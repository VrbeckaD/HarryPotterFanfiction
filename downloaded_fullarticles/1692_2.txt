    <p align="justify">Summer with two immortal beings is, for Harry James Potter, incredibly enjoyable. He learns early on that completing his holiday schoolwork in the first weeks after school ends is the quickest way to get uncle Aziraphale to let him go out and about with his friends. He also learns that putting it off until uncle Aziraphale is a fretful mess over it pleases uncle Crowley to the point of letting him stay over at Ron’s house more than once a month.</p><p align="justify">“Uncle Aziraphale,” Harry calls, not looking up from his textbook on the floor beneath the skylight in the bookshop. He’s lying on his stomach, a notepad to his right, textbook to his left and a fountain pen poised over the pad. A frown is on Harry’s face as he stares down at the textbook and the frankly stupid potions ingredients he’s meant to be writing a four-foot long essay on the properties of. “Why do all of these names sound so—well—silly? Eye of newt? Why would I want to put the eye of a newt in potion that you’re meant to drink for stomach upset? Seems kind of silly.”</p><p align="justify">Uncle Aziraphale is sat at his desk, glasses perched on his nose and very intent on the book of prophecies he’s finally managed to obtain from a very reluctant seller. The book is engrossing to the point where he’s let his hot chocolate go cold three times now—not even noticing Harry warming it up with a warming charm—but not so engrossing that he doesn’t register Harry asking him questions.</p><p align="justify">“Hmm?” Aziraphale blinks and looks up and away from the book of prophecies on his desk, turning a little to look at Harry under the skylight. “What was that Harry?”</p><p align="justify">“Eye of newt; is that a real potions ingredient? The book talks about grinding it up and making sure you don’t let it get mouldy but, how can you grind up an eye? I suppose they can get mouldy, though, since eyes are made of liquid right?” Harry looks away from his textbook to look at Aziraphale with a confused expression. “I mean, Hermione told me that they are, and if things get damp you can get mould so eyes should be able to mould right? Or cause mould?”</p><p align="justify">Aziraphale hums thoughtfully, thinking for a moment. “I don’t rightly know, I’m afraid,” he admits after a moment. “About the eyes, that is,” he clarifies at Harry’s disappointed look. “I do know about eye of newt, however. It’s actually <em>mustard</em> <em>seed</em>.”</p><p align="justify">“Mustard seed?”</p><p align="justify">Aziraphale nods excitedly. “Oh yes,” he says, shifting more in his chair so he’s fully facing Harry who is paying rapt attention to his uncle. “Some potions ingredients are known by rather misleading names like ‘eye of newt’ and ‘wool of bat’ but are really plants or herbs. Some—naturally—are really what they say they are, like blindworm—although that’s <em>really</em> a type of venomous snake also known as a slowworm—but generally, if the potion says, ‘toe of frog’, ‘wool of bat’, or ‘eye of newt’ it’s just plants.”</p><p align="justify">Harry nods slowly. “Okay,” he says, “but why are they called those names? They’re really silly.”</p><p align="justify">“Because those were the names they were given a long time ago—by human standards,” Aziraphale answers, standing up and crossing the bookshop to a specific shelf. He selects three books in particular on the shelf and brings them over to Harry in the middle. “Here, these are historical accounts—quite accurate too might I point out—about witchcraft in the middle ages. There should be chapters that talk about potions ingredients and the origins of some of their names.”</p><p align="justify">“Awesome!” Harry gladly takes the books, smiling widely. “I’ll write to Hermione and ask her if she’s read them,” he says then, pulling a fresh piece of paper from the notepad and begins doing just that. “If she hasn’t, she’ll love hearing about them!”</p><p align="justify">Aziraphale smiles softly down at Harry—who is engrossed in his letter writing and thus doesn’t notice—and watches the eleven-year-old-soon-to-be-twelve scribbling away to his friend about books. Crowley, for all that the demon liked to pretend otherwise, found Harry’s love of books and learning about new things to be—well—<em>nice</em>. It was nice to see someone care about knowledge, about asking questions, about <em>understanding</em> things<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" rel="nofollow" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>.</p><p align="justify">Several days later, something tries to visit the bookshop but is ejected by the celestial wards Crowley and Aziraphale jointly created. These wards work to deny access to anything or anyone that would potentially cause harm to Harry—although the definition of ‘harm’ is very liberal to the point where a visit from one of Harry’s old primary school teachers intent on making snide comments about Harry’s non-English heritage is forcibly ejected from the bookshop and sent rolling out into the middle of the road, narrowly avoiding being flattened by a double decker bus<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" rel="nofollow" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>.</p><p align="justify">Harry’s birthday is an enjoyable affair as Crowley and Aziraphale each get him individual gifts and a combined one that is, to summarise, “absolutely bloody bonkers” according to one Ronald Weasley.</p><p align="justify">Aziraphale—in true bibliophile fashion—gifts Harry with an exquisite set of books on magical lore from around the world. The books are expertly crafted and—by Aziraphale’s own miracle—adjust themselves to the magical ability of the reader<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" rel="nofollow" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a>. Crowley’s gift is—in terms of presentation—far more ostentatious and very much Him. The demon snaps his fingers, blanking out all light in the room—since Aziraphale can create light as an angel, Crowley is equally as capable of removing it as a demon—which makes the arrival of a flaming broom—literally—more impressive than it would be otherwise. After the screaming subsides, Harry is absolutely stoked to try the broom out—learning that the flames will deter anyone from trying to tackle him in the air but won’t harm him at all—and it is only because Aziraphale reminds both Crowley and Harry that they don’t have the space—“no, we will not ‘just make the space’ Crowley!”—and that this is a party that Harry doesn’t zoom around the bookshop on it<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" rel="nofollow" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a>.</p><p align="justify">The last gift from both of Harry’s surrogate parents is given to him after everyone else has left—except Hermione and Ron who are staying the week so the trio can see 3 Ninjas on 7<sup>th</sup> August—since both angel and demon figure it may cause a ‘bit of a scene’ with the Weasley and Granger parents. After all, it’s not every day you find out your son or daughter’s friend can talk to snakes including the saw-scaled viper that, as a species, is known as one of the most deadly in the world.</p><p align="justify">“That thing is poisonous!” Ron exclaims, leaning back as far as he can in his chair when Harry opens the box with the snake inside.</p><p align="justify">Harry’s face lights up at the sight of the snake—young and barely longer than a pencil<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" rel="nofollow" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a>—when it hisses at him curiously. Harry hisses back at it automatically at the same moment that Crowley—unable to help himself, being part-serpent himself by nature—hisses soothingly at it.</p><p align="justify">This—completely reasonably considering Ron’s upbringing—causes the young ginger to leap out of his chair and away from Crowley who has been leaning down over his shoulder to watch Harry’s reaction to the snake. “Merlin’s balls!”</p><p align="justify">“Merlin didn’t have balls, you humans just rewrote history and made him have a set,” Crowley scoffs.</p><p align="justify">Ron gapes at him.</p><p align="justify">Hermione and Aziraphale, as usual, ignore the shenanigans of the Two Gingers in favour of discussing Harry’s gift.</p><p align="justify">“Aren’t saw-scaled vipers venomous?” Hermione asks suspiciously.</p><p align="justify">“Very,” Crowley interjects helpfully, smirking a not so nice smirk. It suits him.</p><p align="justify">“That was partly the reason for choosing an <em>Echis</em> really,” Aziraphale explains when Hermione looks surprised. The little smile on the angel’s face is—for those who don’t know from personal experience—the same smile he has worn when wiping the memories of human mob members trying to intimidate him out of his home for decades now. It is a nice smile but only in that it reaches his eyes, not in any way that makes you feel like the angel isn’t a threat<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" rel="nofollow" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a>.</p><p align="justify">“Why?” Hermione looks appalled at Aziraphale and the angels smile falls away a little.</p><p align="justify">“Well—after last year—with—with that shade, we—we had a talk—Crowley and I,” Aziraphale says awkwardly. “Harry was in danger and we almost weren’t quick enough you see—and that—that didn’t quite sit well with us.”</p><p align="justify">“I’ll say,” Crowley mutters, ruffling Harry’s hair when the now-twelve-year-old looks at him guiltily. “So we thought to do something about it.”</p><p align="justify">“But a <em>snake?”</em></p><p align="justify">Crowley shrugs. “Why not? Harry likes them, I <em>made</em> them, and he can talk to this one—and it’ll keep me up to date on any threats to him we don’t notice,” Crowley says, giving Hermione a look. “Makes perfect sense really.”</p><p align="justify">“Talk? To snakes? That’s not possible!” Hermione exclaims hotly and Crowley rolls his eyes behind his sunglasses—which he has worn all day that people have been at the bookshop for Harry’s party.</p><p align="justify">“Yes it is,” Ron says nervously, shooting Crowley awkward glances. “Parseltongue,” he explains, looking at Hermione. “Always been dark wizards who can talk to snakes.”</p><p align="justify">Crowley looks so offended at Ron’s words that Aziraphale hastily claps his hands together, shooting Harry an apologetic look when it scares the snake that was just about to slither out of the box at last. “Right! Tea anyone?”</p><p align="justify">The experience of the cinema with his friends is all Harry can talk about for days after. Crowley and Aziraphale endure the chattering with the patience of immortal beings who have listened to a lot worse than a twelve-year-old gushing about a relatively mediocre film<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" rel="nofollow" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a>. </p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Harry is still going on about it when the letter from Hogwarts detailing second year equipment requirements arrives. Crowley and Aziraphale have already informed Harry and his friends of the texts they'd need for second year—except for Defence—and it's uniform and potions ingredients that Harry needs from Diagon Alley than textbooks<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" rel="nofollow" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a>. </p><p align="justify">The day the trio go to Diagon Alley to collect Harry’s schoolbooks for the coming term is a day they Unanimously Regret. Visiting the ice-cream parlour on the street is enjoyable but it doesn't make up for the sheer chaos that occurs inside <em>Flourish and Blotts</em> when the Weasley family—who Ron has convinced to visit the Alley on the same day as Harry and Hermione—come across the head of the Malfoy household and his son. Especially after Gilderoy Lockhart, the new Defence professor for the coming year, tries to drag Harry into a photoshoot and is instead turned into a mirror by Aziraphale<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" rel="nofollow" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a>. This sends the entire bookshop into a circus until Aziraphale turns him back and Crowley makes everyone forget about that little miracle. </p><p align="justify">"Arthur Weasley," Lucius Malfoy says and it is <em>definitely</em> sneered—Crowley mutters such to Aziraphale while they stand just to the side with Harry and watch—as Malfoy and Weasley heads stare each other down. "The blood traitor." </p><p align="justify">It, as to be expected, gets worse from this point. Mister Malfoy is given a verbal slap by Mister Weasley on what it means to be a 'blood traitor' and, as a result, Mister Weasley is insulted by Mister Malfoy commenting on his ability to provide for his family. The fists flying from both men are a bit unexpected considering they're both wizards but Crowley has always commented on the value of a good right hook. </p><p align="justify">Rubeus Hagrid attempts to intervene between the two men but it is Crowley who separate them in a very real sense. The demon snaps his fingers and sends both Weasley and Malfoy skidding away from each other. Hagrid's not inconsiderable height and general mass separates the two more permanently when he stands between them and the two wizards hiss out the most polite but not at all meant apologies they can before Mister Malfoy leaves with Draco trailing behind. </p><p align="justify">All but Aziraphale miss the fact that Mister Malfoy has been fiddling with the books of one Ginny Weasley. However, as Crowley leaves the bookshop and Harry follows the demon, the angel is distracted from pursuing the matter. This, it seems, is becoming a habit. </p><p align="justify">The trio, leaving the Weasleys behind, follow at a vaguely decent distance as the Malfoy males head toward a side alley off Diagon. A sign reads: Knockturn Alley and, from the general state of the brickwork alone, Aziraphale figures the place isn't all that nice. </p><p align="justify">"I'll follow them," Crowley declares, turning to Aziraphale. "Can claim it's for evil purposes and that. Meet you at the bookshop in an hour." </p><p align="justify">Aziraphale wants to argue—he really does—but Crowley is more likely to fare better than Aziraphale in the not-nice-at-all alley and someone needs to take care of Harry. </p><p align="justify">"You best be back for dinner, Crowley," Aziraphale orders and he narrows his eyes when Crowley mockingly places a hand over where his heart should be and swears on it. "Crowley, your heart isn't located there." </p><p align="justify">"It's the sentiment," the demon counters before disappearing down Knockturn Alley. Aziraphale and Harry apparate home—though it's not really <em>apparating</em> in Aziraphale's case, simply a close enough mimicry of the act<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" rel="nofollow" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a>. </p><p align="justify">In Knockturn Alley, Crowley miracles it so no one notices him as unusual for the place, although—as a demon—he's very, <em>very</em> usual for Knockturn. The Malfoy's head to a shop with grimy windows and even grimier woodwork surrounding the glass panes. Inside is grimy also but in a more ordered manner suggesting the grime is for the Creepy Aesthetic. </p><p align="justify">Crowley is reminded a little too much of hell with the aesthetic and loathes the idea of entering the shop but needs must. He is spying after all and—considering the contents of <em>Borgin and Burkes</em>—Crowley <em>definitely</em> needs to know about this shop. He follows behind Lucius Malfoy as the man moves with purpose to the proprietor of the store—at least, Crowley presumes this guy owns the place, if he doesn’t then he’s probably an escapee from the mad house; wait, humans don’t have ‘mad houses’ anymore do they? An escapee from the hospital then.</p><p align="justify">“Father, will you buy me this?” Draco Malfoy asks, pointing at an eye on display nearby and Crowley automatically glances at the boy. He’s not a bad student—if a bit pompous—but obviously the kid has a poor role model in the form of his elitist father. No body’s perfect though—just look at Crowley.</p><p align="justify">The staring glass eye is, Crowley realises with a jolt, a bastardisation of the all-seeing eye of God. It was created in the middle of the 14<sup>th</sup> century—another reason Crowley hates that century—by a group of very devout but ultimately stupid humans at the behest of a demon that was actually a Fallen Archangel. It wasn’t Crowley, but he knows who had the eye commissioned by humanity and he also knows they got a right lashing by Satan for losing the thing not long after.</p><p align="justify">Leaving it in the hands of obviously similar stupid humans to the ones who made it is a Bad Idea and Crowley decides to have a Good Idea. So he snaps his fingers and the glass eye vanishes, immediately replaced with a perfect replica with no power to it at all. The staring glass eye is nestled safely in an inner pocket of his jacket while Borgin—the name of the owner—and Lucius Malfoy talk about items the Malfoy head is selling to avoid a ministry raid.</p><p align="justify">Very naughty that, Crowley thinks, leaning over Malfoy’s shoulder to read the list on the counter. “Didn’t know you lot used foetuses that way; though English always have been about stealing everyone else’s stuff and claiming it as their own so, really, why am I surprised?”</p><p align="justify">It is fortunate none of the individuals in the shop can hear Crowley otherwise he’d be both cursed and verbally bitched at for daring to insult England and English tradition yada-yada. The demon has heard the same sort of diatribe from hell for centuries now so, honestly, he could probably change the places and the titles and still have near enough the rant from hell and the wizards be near enough word-for-word the same.</p><p align="justify">Shaking his head, Crowley moves away from the men, deciding he’s done enough spying for now and focuses his attention on the items in the Borgin’s shop. He notices a Hand of Glory that seems to fascinate Draco Malfoy—until Crowley snaps his fingers again and the boy loses interest; he’ll never know but Crowley thinks the boy has more potential than dark magic and evil and hell. Most of the items that Crowley can see are pretty unassuming—to the point where he wonders if the staring eye is the only thing in the shop that is honestly not meant for human hands until he sees it.</p><p align="justify">It’s nestled away, in a corner and it shouldn’t—it shouldn’t be there. It shouldn’t be anywhere.</p><p align="justify">“No,” Crowley breathes. “That—that’s not possible. It can’t be.”</p><p align="justify">He steps toward the object, eyes wide behind his sunglasses and he absently takes them off to better see. That—that shouldn’t be in human hands. It should be—well—</p><p align="justify">“You shouldn’t be here,” Crowley whispers, hand reaching out, trembling. “I can’t believe you’re here.” His hand touches the case. “You’re—you’re really here.”</p><p align="justify">A person can make a split-second decision and change everything. One moment in history, a single point in time, and the action undertaken changes what is to come. From the beginning of time, some actions are impossible to change because they have been Ordained, but others… others are determined by choices made in the moment.</p><p align="justify">Choices like taking an item that hasn’t been held by its owner in over six thousand <em>years</em>.</p><p align="justify">Those kinds of choices can change <em>everything</em> really.</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/>
<hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" rel="nofollow" id="_ftn1">[1]</a> If there was one thing that Crowley would <em>always</em> support, no matter what, it was the pursuit of knowledge and understanding. In Harry’s case, that meant the demon would procure books that he’d never read in a million years just so Harry could have the opportunity to learn about world war two, ancient Egypt, mythology, Japanese history, the ocean, space, and anything else the child might well find an interest in learning about. Aziraphale once commented about this propensity of Crowley’s only for the demon to pin him to a wall and declare, very, <em>very</em> angrily—oh so angrily because he was a demony demon—that it was all in service of evil and knowledge threw mankind out of Eden so maybe it’d do the same here. Both of them, unanimously agreed that mankind leaving Eden—not actually getting kicked out so much so as politely evicted from the premises—was actually the best thing to happen to humanity.</p><p align="justify"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" rel="nofollow" id="_ftn2">[2]</a> The wards do, however, also include protections for Crowley and Aziraphale. Neither of them mention these protections for the other since they are done in ‘secret’ but the end result is no one in heaven or hell can actually see inside the bookshop and likely are unable to enter no matter how powerful they are since—combined together—Aziraphale and Crowley turn out to be a mite bit stronger than any Archangel or demon who would think to visit. However, as neither of them realise this, they simply chalk up the lack of visits to the bookshop by their respective offices as a stroke of good luck and continue on with life thinking they’re fooling their head offices. And, as their head offices have no desire to ‘loose face’, neither side actually pushes to try and do anything about these wards and the combined strength of a principality and archangel-turned-demon powering said wards.</p><p align="justify"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" rel="nofollow" id="_ftn3">[3]</a> The books are, amusingly enough, more comprehensive than the fifth-year textbooks Percy will obtain in Diagon Alley on 19<sup>th</sup> August. They also—as per Aziraphale’s intentions—limit Harry’s exposure to more advanced and potentially-dangerous magic but don’t impede his progress either.</p><p align="justify"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" rel="nofollow" id="_ftn4">[4]</a> Aziraphale and Hermione both squeak in horrified unison at the prospect of open flames near so many books—even if they <em>are</em> protected from flame damage after Harry set several on fire while attempting his charms homework—and this, more than anything, dissuades Crowley and Harry from using the broom inside the bookshop. St James’ Park, however, is fair game—Crowley can always freeze everyone so they don’t notice after all.</p><p align="justify"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" rel="nofollow" id="_ftn5">[5]</a> The average length of which is approximately nineteen centimetres or seven-point-five inches long as both metric and imperial measurement systems are used in the United Kingdom in a mish-mash, hodgepodge collection of both measurement systems. This is because the United Kingdom has never done things the easy way—just look at Brexit.</p><p align="justify"><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6" rel="nofollow" id="_ftn6">[6]</a> In truth, it’s the kind of smile a very polite, demure person wears when they’re about to snap and beat you to death with the teaspoon they’re using to stir the tea with.</p><p align="justify"><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7" rel="nofollow" id="_ftn7">[7]</a> It is the authors opinion that the first film of the 3 Ninjas franchise isn't the best of them, but that is because they are biased towards roller-coaster.</p><p align="justify"><a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8" rel="nofollow" id="_ftn8">[8]</a> Not that he wasn't going to buy some books. Aziraphale is always so pleased when Harry buys a book and, since Harry tends to <em>enjoy</em> the books he buys, he has no complaints with pleasing his uncle Zira this way. Crowley is pleased also but hates to admit it verbally—as he has only ever managed a smile when Harry has gushed about a book he’s bought or that Crowley has given him. But knowing that both his uncles are happy about Harry liking books reassures the child that being smart isn’t a bad thing no matter what aunt Petunia, uncle Vernon or Dudley tried to drill into him.</p><p align="justify"><a href="#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9" rel="nofollow" id="_ftn9">[9]</a> "I thought it rather fitting," Aziraphale says later when Crowley asks him <em>why a mirror</em>. The angel has that look in his eyes that is mirthful but also a little bit mean and Crowley just smiles. </p><p align="justify">"That's my angel," he says fondly and Aziraphale's smile turns bashful at the praise. Harry, wisely, makes himself scarce to avoid the inevitable flirting-disguised-as-insults that is about to occur.</p><p align="justify"><a href="#_ftnref10" name="_ftn10" rel="nofollow" id="_ftn10">[10]</a> Although neither Crowley or Aziraphale do it often, both are capable of spontaneous teleportation of their beings and anything else they so desire to teleport. It is more a matter of choosing not to do it and enjoying the journey time that deters them from teleporting everywhere. Although, at some point in their lives, both are advised against teleportation and, as such, don’t think of it as the first solution to a problem when Crowley’s Bentley is far more comfortable and—although mildly terrifying for Aziraphale considering the speed of it—far more enjoyable as well. Teleportation is instantaneous after all and it is sometimes enjoyable to spend time with someone on a journey to a point rather than immediately arriving at your destination.</p>
