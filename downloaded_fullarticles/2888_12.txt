          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our tale starts a decade after the second wizarding war was won. Caradoc and Dorcas Dearborn are living the perfect life in a large mansion in the English countryside.</p><p>Caradoc smiled. "This is the life, my dear Dorcas."</p><p>Dorcas nodded and agreed, "Indeed, my darling Caradoc."</p><p>Caradoc asked, "More tea?"</p><p>Dorcas held her cup out and grinned. "That would be simply delightful, thank you my darling."</p><p>Caradoc ordered, "Jeeves, fill our cups up."</p><p>Caradoc's butler Jeeves took their teacups and went away to the kitchen with them.</p><p>Dorcas smirked. "Your butler is as slow as always, my darling."</p><p>Caradoc beamed, "I know, my dear. But alas, there's not much we can do about the matter."</p><p>Dorcas whispered, "You could dismiss him."</p><p>Caradoc chuckled. "How despicable!"</p><p>Dorcas inquired, "Is that a no?"</p><p>Caradoc murmered, "Let's do it."</p><p>Dorcas warned, "Here he comes."</p><p>Jeeves entered the room with their teacups full to the brim with steaming hot tea and set them down on the table.</p><p>Just as Jeeves was about to leave, Caradoc cleared his throat and ordered, "Come here, Jeeves."</p><p>Jeeves hurried towards him and asked, "What do you require, Master?"</p><p>Caradoc sneered. "I require nothing, you insolent fool."</p><p>Jeeves stuttered, "Wh-What's wrong, Master?"</p><p>Dorcas smirked. "Can't you see he's about to dismiss you, fool?"</p><p>Jeeves turned to Caradoc and inquired, "Is she speaking the truth, Master?"</p><p>Caradoc smiled. "Absolutely, you're dismissed."</p><p>Jeeves begged, "No Sir, you need me. I'm the best butler in England."</p><p>Dorcas grinned. "Leave before your dignity has been compromised."</p><p>Jeeves rushed out of the room and Caradoc beamed, "You're absolutely despicable my dear Dorcas and I adore you for it."</p></div>
