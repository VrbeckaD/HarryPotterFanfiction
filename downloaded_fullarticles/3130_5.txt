    <p>-July 1996, Upstate New York Near the Canadian Border<br/>
Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry-</p><p>A crack sounded and two people appeared in front of the gates of the American School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p><p>“Really Albus is this the proper time to be visiting the states?” a curt voice sounded.</p><p>“I always felt that sometimes a break from the everyday, lets you see a situation more clearly Minerva.” Albus said brushing off his robes. Minerva gave him a withering glare, one that has put many a wayward student in line. Albus simply smiled back at her.</p><p>Whatever response Minerva had was cut off by the gates opening.</p><p>“Albus! So glad you came!” the blonde woman behind the gates said.</p><p>“Well when one of my most gifted student’s owls with a problem, who am I to deny such a request. We have a return port key scheduled for late this evening, I hope that is enough time.” Albus said bringing the girl into a hug, she nodded in response to his remark. “Minerva you remember Alicia Farris? She graduated the same year as Lily and James.” Albus asked.</p><p>“Yes, if I remember you had a knack of Transfiguration.” Minerva said. Alicia shook Minerva’s hand and smiled.</p><p>--</p><p>The trio quickly made their way into the school.</p><p>“I’ve been in the states since I graduated. Moved here once I discovered there was an opening on staff. Moved to Deputy Headmistress last year. The Headmaster and I have been presented with a problem, we could really use your input.” Alicia said.</p><p>“Your letter said something about a true seer?” Minerva said.</p><p>“Yes, well… we’ll explain when we meet her.” Alicia knocked on the door that said Headmaster.</p><p>“Come in.” A deep voice said behind the door. They opened and walked in. “ALBUS!” was yelled the second the wizard came in the room.</p><p>“Hugo Lively! How are you?” Albus greeted. The tall redheaded man behind the desk got up and vigorously shook his hand.</p><p>“Thank you for coming. I hope the overseas portkey wasn’t to dreadful?” Hugo asked.</p><p>“No, not at all. Now, what do I hear about a True Seer?” Albus asked.</p><p>“Yes. She has been with us since she was 11. Typical girl, nothing out of the ordinary, until she went home last year. Her parents were killed by Voldemort sympathisers and her grandmother got custody. When she came back this year she was different.” They walked over to a wall. Hugo pulled a book and a room with a mirror on the wall appeared. In the room was a girl, 16 years old, drawing in a book. She had red hair with one blue eye and one green.</p><p>“This is her?” Minerva asked.</p><p>“Yes, her name is Sabine. When she came back she was not the 15-year-old we had sent home before.” Alicia said.</p><p>“How can you be sure?” Albus asked</p><p>“Well for one, when she left us she had brown eyes and blonde hair.” Hugo said. “When she came back she started having problems in class. She couldn’t focus, assignments were wrong or made no sense at all. It was like other people were trying to talk through her. That’s when things got interesting.”</p><p>“Interesting how?” Minerva asked, voice edged with anxiety.</p><p>“What she was writing, was coming true. Like every word she said was coming true. So we had our Divination teacher talk with her. Marge isn’t a true seer, hasn’t had a vision ever, but her mother was one so she knows the signs. All signs were showing that she had Seer abilities, and then at the end of the visit Sabine went into a trance. This was a deeper trance then any of her other teachers reported.” Alicia said.</p><p>“What happened?” Albus asked</p><p>“She made a prediction that a man with white hair that wore the stars and a woman with eyes like a cat would come a hear of the fate of the wizarding world.” Hugo said, eyes never leaving the girl in the room. Albus and Minerva looked at each other, Albus was wearing his favorite robes: midnight blue with the solar system on them. “At that time I had Alicia contact you. I know you have plenty on your plate with Voldemort looming on the horizon, but I thought maybe she could tell you something useful. And, to be honest, you’re the only person I know who wears stars on his robes.” Hugo finished with a smile.</p><p>Albus smiled at the Headmaster. Nodding at Minerva they both entered the room.</p><p>Sabine looked up from her book. She gasped and stood up.</p><p>“It’s you. And you! Oh thank goodnees I thought I was officially going around the bend. I thought for sure they would give me a straitjacket and put me in a loony bin.” Sabine said. Minerva stared at the girl while Albus just smiled, like the ever doting grandfather.</p><p>“Sabine gets excited very easily.” Alicia offered, entering the room with Hugo. Sabine smiled at her school leaders.</p><p>“So tell us what happened last summer.” Minerva said sitting down.</p><p>“Well after Mom and Pop’s funeral I started feeling funny. It wasn’t until my 16th birthday, June 21st, that I went through this change. My hair turned a different color, my eyes completely changed, and I started predicting things that happened. My grandmother thought I was just lucky, it was little things at first, but then I came back to school and-.” Sabine stopped and stared at a point on the wall.</p><p>Minerva went to snap her out of it but Dumbledore stopped her.</p><p>“Sabine?” Dumbledore began. Something snapped and Sabine’s eyes went white.</p><p><em>“As the New Millennium approaches, a great evil begins to rise.</em><br/>
<em> Only a power shared by three can save us.</em><br/>
<em> One with white hair and deeply misunderstood,</em><br/>
<em> One with black hair who lives in the shadow</em><br/>
<em> One with the weight of the world on their shoulders.</em><br/>
<em> Only when bonded can this trio hope to succeed.</em><br/>
<em> A power shared by three,</em><br/>
<em> Can help the Man Who Lived once more</em>.” Sabine collapsed on the table in front of her. Alicia rushed to her.</p><p>“Sabine, are you ok?” Alicia asked. Sabine sat up and shook her head.</p><p>“Mister Dumbledore,” Sabine said, voice very soft.</p><p>“Yes dear.” Albus said.</p><p>“You need to help Harry defeat Voldemort. If he does not defeat him, the world will never recover. This new evil will join with Voldemort and the wizarding world as we know it will be gone.” Sabine said. She looked at Dumbledore, eyes bright green just like Harry’s.</p><p>--</p><p>Alicia shut the door to Sabine’s room with a soft click.</p><p>“She’ll be asleep for a while. That was longer than the one Marge reported.” Alicia said sitting in front of the Headmaster’s desk. Albus was currently in deep thought.</p><p>“So do you think the prophecy is about Harry?” Hugo asked.</p><p>“Certainly sounds like it. If this prophecy is to be true, Harry will defeat Voldemort. But there is something worse looming around the corner.” Minerva said. Albus looked up and pulled his watch out of his pocket.</p><p>“Minerva we have to go; our portkey is scheduled to depart in 15 minutes. Hugo, Alicia, please keep me up to date about Sabine. And don’t worry about reporting this to the Ministry, I will handle to paperwork when I get back.” Albus said smiling.</p><p>Hugo and Alicia startled at Albus’ sudden reaction.</p><p>“Uh- ok. Sure, whatever you think is best.” Hugo said. Alicia nodded in agreement. She offered to show the two out.</p><p>--</p><p>One quick portkey trip later Minerva and Albus were in his office.</p><p>“What now Albus?” Minerva asked. Albus continued to stare pensively out the window.</p><p>“We continue as planned. The prophecy we know has already begun to unfold. We can’t be sure this will come true.” Albus said.</p><p>“If this was Sybil I’d agree with you, but this girl is the most gifted seer we’ve possibly bore witness to. I have only read about Seer’s who constantly predict accurate futures, not since-.”</p><p>“Mopsus of ancient Greece, yes I know. I also know that whether or not we want it, Sabine’s prophecy has been set in motion already. Personally I’d rather we deal with the evil we know, so he doesn’t join up with the evil yet to be found.” Albus said.</p><p>“And the Ministry?” Minerva asked.</p><p>“I will report the prophecy, send the pensive, but after what happened a month ago they haven’t even begun to figure out fixing the hall of prophecy. I’ll simply tell the minister to lock this one away until after the war. Once everything has settled, we will begin to figure out this prophecy.” Dumbledore said looking at Minerva. She nodded and left the Headmaster to his work.</p><p>--</p><p>We all know how the story progressed. Dumbledore got Harry ready to defeat Voldemort, successfully, but in all the chaos of the final battle the prophecy made by Sabine was forgotten. Locked away in a room in the department of Ministry.</p><p>Until the day a girl with red hair, one green eye and one blue took on an apprenticeship for Ancient Runes the same year Harry Potter came back to finish his final year.</p>
