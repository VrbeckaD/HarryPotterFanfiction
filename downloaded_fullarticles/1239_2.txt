    <p>“What’s up, Danvers?” The smooth voice came out of nowhere, a quiet but coy question from nearby, very nearby.</p><p>Carol jumped, so focused on her potion that she hadn’t seen Slytherin’s Prefect leaning on the table next to her. Unfortunately, that meant the entire contents of the vial of powered rue in her hand now spilled into her potion. Carol gaped, momentarily stunned that she just ruined another potions assignment. Her dread quickly turned to anger, which wasn’t helped by looking over at Natasha, leaning on the table and smirking at her, with her perfectly straight red hair that clashed beautifully with the green-outlined, black robes she wore.</p><p>“Bloody hell, Romanoff!” Carol managed to keep her voice down enough that their professor didn’t notice yet. Except that Carol’s potion was now gurgling, and steadily turning more red much like the face of its potionmaker.</p><p>“Sorry,” Natasha’s smirk was still in place. Carol’s fists clenched automatically, wishing she could wipe the smirk off that face. Natasha raised an eyebrow at her, as if to say Here? Now?, but aloud she said, “You may want to to care of that,” thrusting her chin at the increasingly turbulent potion.</p><p>Carol opened her mouth, to say what, she wasn’t sure, when an authoritative voice cut her off, “Danvers. Failed again, I see.” Carol gritted her teeth but said nothing. “It’ll be a miracle if you pass your N.E.W.T.s this year. And I’ll be watching you closely to make sure you don’t cheat again.” Carol just glared at Professor Snape, knowing that if she opened her mouth to retort, she’d only just lose points for her house.</p><p>She didn’t cheat on her O.W.Ls. She just didn’t have a certain redheaded Slytherin there to distract her. She kept her composure by imagining all the ways she was going to murder Natasha once they got out of class.</p><p>Snape’s eyes snapped to Natasha, who was still casually leaning against the table facing Carol. “And what are you doing here, Romanoff?”</p><p>Natasha straightened up, turning around to face him. Carol’s protective instinct kicked in, and she opened her mouth to reply, but Natasha got there first. “Just trying to warn Danvers that her potion didn’t look right, sir.” Natasha said, sweetly. Carol was instantly back to wanting to punch her.</p><p>Snape’s eyes narrowed, suspicious, but not willing to push the matter more when his own house was involved. “Get back to your desk.” Natasha turned, brushing so close to Carol that she almost touched her. Carol stiffened, but Natasha was already gone.</p><p>Snape turned back to Carol. “In an effort to teach you anything, I’m assigning you additional homework, Danvers. I want a list of the 20 most common potions that use powered rue, write down their full ingredients list and their amounts. I expect it on my desk tomorrow.”</p><p>“But I have quidditch practice tonight!” Carol whined, knowing it was useless.</p><p>“Maybe you should spend more time with books and less on the quidditch pitch,” Snape suggested coldly. “Ten points from Gryffindor for talking back.” He added, with a smirk.</p><p>Carol just glared, sighing, resigned to keep her mouth shut. She’d figure something out. She wasn’t going to miss practice. The Slytherin match was next week and her team was far from ready. Snape waited a moment before turning away, realizing that Carol wasn’t going to dig herself any deeper at the moment. As soon as he was gone, Carol was surrounded by sympathetic Gryffindors, mostly from her quidditch team.</p><p>“He’s an ass,” one whispered to her.</p><p>“It wasn’t even your fault!” Another whined.</p><p>“Too bad Romanoff’s not on the Slytherin team, it would be easier to explain why she was hit by a bludger,” another threatened.</p><p>Carol snorted at the image. “She wouldn’t want to mess up her hair.” Carol shook her head. “Don’t worry about it, Avery. I can handle revenge on Romanoff myself.” They looked as her doubtfully, but no one wanted to question their team captain aloud.</p><p>Carol took solace in her friends, trying not to let it get to her that she was scolded in front of the whole class again. She really shouldn’t care. She was doing great on Defense Against the Dark Arts. And she was killing it on the quidditch pitch. All things were going her way, really. She just needed to get back at Natasha.</p><p>She knew it was a cycle. That Romanoff was just getting her back for the incident last week. The incident that involved “accidentally” dropping a levitating toad into Natasha’s hood and her not noticing until it started croaking. Carol would never forget the way she had completely lost her normally cool composure, flailing around so much that the toad was somehow dislodged into her hair, which had her shrieking even more. Finally it had hopped from her hair, completely unaware of the panic it had caused. Natasha had immediately knew who to blame, but other than snickering Gryffindors, no one had witnessed Carol’s guilt.</p><p>She could also be getting Carol back for the incident two weeks ago at Hogsmead. Where Carol may have slipped Whizzing Worms into Natasha’s Butterbeer. There was no being coy about that one. Carol had just had to not-so-casually dash by and drop them into her cup, and then boom! Romanoff suddenly had an overflowing mug of worms instead of Butterbeer. Those things were well worth the galleons she had spent. Carol hadn’t stuck around to hear anything more than Natasha shout, “You’re dead, Danvers!” before she was out in the streets of Hogsmead, cracking up with her friends.</p><p>So did she deserve this? Maybe. But damned if she was going to put up with it. She had a plan.</p><p>—-</p><p>As soon as class ended, Carol left, winding her way through the halls back to her room. She was so engrossed in planning her scheme to get Natasha back, that she didn’t see the hand that snaked out of the alcove in the hallway. She yelped as she was tugged into the alcove, half hidden by curtains.</p><p>“Shush, Danvers, unless you want to get caught,” Natasha was smirking at her, still holding Carol by the lapels of her robe.</p><p>“I’m gonna kill you,” Carol glared, fists clenching.</p><p>Nat’s smirk bloomed into a full grin. “Save it, little lion.” Natasha’s lips were on Carol’s before she could respond.</p><p>Carol tried not to melt at the pet name. She tried not to let Nat distract her with her demanding lips. But the moan that escaped her mouth gave her away. She could feel Natasha smirk again as she deepened the kiss. Carol switched tactics. Instead of trying to resist her lover’s kiss, she pushed into her. She let the rage inside her burn into passion. She had a good few centimeters on Natasha, and she used them to her advantage, pushing the shorter girl back against the other wall. Carol’s lips took control, her hands came up to cup Natasha’s cheeks and tilt her head at the right angle, so Carol could sneak her tongue in. She pushed her body against Natasha, knowing that the other girl didn’t like to be pinned. Nat’s responding growl confirmed that. It was Carol’s turn to grin into the kiss.</p><p>When she pulled away, they were born gasping for air. “You ruined my potion.” Carol narrowed her eyes at Nat.</p><p>Natasha shrugged, unperturbed. “Wasn’t my intention. But it was adorable. Didn’t realize I had such an effect on you.” She teased. It wasn’t entirely true. They had been sneaking off for some time now, getting to know each other much better in the shadows of Hogwarts.</p><p>“You just surprised me,” Carol grumbled. Not willing to admit that it was more the sound of Natasha’s voice that had affected her.</p><p>“You keep telling yourself that, Danvers.” Natasha pulled Carol down for another kiss, retaking control. She snuck a hand up into Carol’s hair, tugging the other girl by it as she fit her lips to hers.</p><p>Carol moaned, letting Natasha push her back against the wall. Nat used the hand in Carol’s hair to hold her head to the side as she lowered her lips to her lover’s neck, nipping and teasing her way down the column.</p><p>Carol moaned again, arching into Natasha. “I have to go. I’m going to be late for practice.” Carol gasped reluctantly.</p><p>“Hmm,” Natasha hummed into Carol’s collarbone, not letting up as she worked her mouth along the skin there. She latched on particularly hard near Carol’s shoulder, where she knew she could leave a mark no one else would see. Carol wriggled under her.</p><p>“Is that your plan then?” Carol let out a breathless laugh. “Sabotage my team by keeping me away from practice?”</p><p>Natasha chuckled. “Wasn’t my original plan. But I like how your mind works, Captain Danvers.” She brought her forehead to her lover’s in time to see the flash of lust in her eyes at the title. “Isn’t this more fun anyway?” She teased.</p><p>Carol realized she was panting. These make out sessions with Nat were intense. But she thrived on intense. Passionate. Wild.</p><p>She pressed her lips to Natasha’s again, swallowing a moan from the other girl. She let herself sink into the kiss for a few more moments, allowing the world to slip away. It was just Natasha’s lips on hers, the fire she ignited as her hands slid down Carol’s curves, and the heat where their bodies were pressed together. But they both knew that this couldn’t go much further, tucked away in the middle of a hallway. Not to mention, Carol really had to get to practice.</p><p>Carol pulled away. “Another time, love?” It wasn’t really a question. Neither of them could keep away from each other. Not with this burning inside of them. They had tried. And it had only led them to this. Tangled up in alcoves, violently kissing until both of them gasped for breath.</p><p>Natasha grabbed Carol’s sleeve, not ready yet to lose the moment. “You’re getting clingy, Romanoff,” Carol challenged with a smirk.</p><p>It was Natasha’s turn to narrow her eyes at her lover. “I’ll make you pay for that comment, next time we’re in bed.” She threatened.</p><p>Carol gave her a lopsided grin. “I count on it.”</p><p>—–</p><p>Carol burst into her room, in a much better mood than how she had left class. But much more chaotic. She tossed her robes aside, throwing on her quidditch uniform. She hastily stuffed the notes she scribbled for practice into her bag, gathering her extra equipment in a heap as she shoveled it inside too.</p><p>A indignant squak halted her haphazard progress. A tiny, fuzzy owl stared at her with big eyes, holding a parchment that was taller than itself. It was comically adorable. “Well hello there, handsome.” She praised the owl, carefully taking its burden. It blinked at her, which she took at permission to pet its tiny head. Its eyes closed instantly, swaying contently under her fingers. Carol wanted to dote on the thing all day. But she really didn’t have time.</p><p>She did keep petting the tiny owl while she peaked at the contents the scroll with the other hand. A smaller, hastily scribbled note fell out on the bed. But Carol could see that the scroll held a list of potions. And on closer inspection, she saw that they all had powered rue in them. She dropped the parchment on her bed and reached for the smaller note. It said:</p><p>
  <em>
Dear Danvers,</em><br/>
<em>We haven’t met. But I saw what happened today. Thought you could use a hand, since it wasn’t your fault. Do me a favor and copy the list please? Professor Snape knows my handwriting. I really don’t want to get in trouble.</em><br/>
<em>Cheers,</em><br/>
<em>Your Ravenclaw Friend</em><br/>
<em>P.S. Tip for potions class: don’t measure your ingredients over the cauldron</em><br/>
</p><p>
Carol glanced at the owl curiously. “You’ve got a wonderful master there, you know that mate? Sit tight a sec?” She found a scrap of parchment to write back. She kept it short and sweet.
</p><p>
    <em>
Dear Sassy Raven friend,</em><br/>
<em>You’re a life saver! Come say hi sometime in person?</em><br/>
<em>Cheers,</em><br/>
<em>Your Gryffindor Friend</em><br/>
</p><p>
Carol smiled to herself. Then decided to add one more thing.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
P.S. Your owl is bloody adorable<br/>
</em></p><p>
Perfect. She got the tiny owl situated with the note back, and it took off immediately.
</p><p>
Carol had a goofy grin still plastered on her face as she raced down to the quidditch pitch. She didn’t even care that she was late. Her day had just improved immensely.
