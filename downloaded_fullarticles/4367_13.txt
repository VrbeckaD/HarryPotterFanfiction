    <p>The sun is just barely peaking into their bedroom with its early, pink-orange light when Remus wakes up. At first, he’s able to stay in that wonderful state - the one where you’re only barely awake and you know that if you don’t move too fast and keep your eyes closed, you’ll fall right back into your dreams. He’s there for a moment, blissfully heavy against the mattress, not knowing anything except the fact that its still early and he can’t feel Sirius’ body against his. <em>Well, that’s not right.</em> Carefully, without thinking too much, he decides one roll over to find Sirius won’t wake him up. That they can sleep a while longer until they decide to get up for breakfast - or lunch - then crawl right back into bed. So he rolls, and he reaches… and he opens his eyes.</p><p>He stares at the empty mattress, his outstretched fingers, and he remembers.</p><p>His newfound state of full awareness allows the world to slowly filter in, bringing all of reality crashing in with it. Today is the day he’s been avoiding since the moment he learned about it. The thought that it’s actually here makes his chest tighten painfully and his heart thud.</p><p>He presses himself onto one of his elbows, head turning to the side to see the bathroom light on. He can see Sirius’ shadow on the strip of tiles visible, hear him humming to himself as he prepares for the day.</p><p>Remus wishes that tooth brushing and a hot shower were enough to prepare <em>him</em> for today.</p><p>The floor is too cold against his feet and he pulls on socks, along with the t-shirt Sirius had discarded the night before. He bends, picking it up, and presses the fabric to his nose, inhaling.</p><p>He thinks back to the previous night, Sirius’ skin flush against his, foreheads together, tears mixing with their breath. <em>“You’ll be okay”</em> Sirius had said, <em>You’ll be okay.</em></p><p>Remus had tried not to cry, tried to have their last night together be <em>happy</em> and <em>good</em> - something for Sirius to keep with him while he was away. But Remus had never been one for keeping in his emotions.</p><p>Remus hadn’t been able to tell Sirius that it wasn’t himself he was worried about, though. He was safe in their flat and Sirius was… well, Remus never knew where Sirius was. He squeezed his eyes shut at the thought, yanking the t-shirt over his head.</p><p>
  <em>Will you be okay?</em>
</p><p>The tiles of the bathroom are even chillier, and he squints against the bright light. He hears Sirius’ laugh before he sees him, most likely at the face he just pulled.</p><p>“Aren’t you beautiful this morning.” Sirius sets the iron he’d been using down, leaning over the table to press a lingering kiss to Remus’ mouth. His eyes are bright, a towel wrapped around his waist, “Sleep well?”</p><p>No “Mhm..” Remus traces his fingers down Sirius’ cheek, keeping him this close for as long as he can, “Did you…”</p><p>He means to ask how Sirius slept, but his eyes find the item on the ironing board. Sirius’ uniform, all greens and browns, lies neatly, creases just so and spotless. Remus has the sudden urge to take it outside and drag it through the mud caused by last night’s rain.</p><p>He clears his throat, eyes flicking back to Sirius’. He tries for a smile, but he knows he hesitated too long for it to be a clean cover up. He asks the question anyway, “Did you sleep okay?”</p><p>Remus hates the sadness that has appeared Sirius’ eyes now. He hates it every time.</p><p>“I always sleep well with you next to me.”</p><p>It’s suppose to be a sweet comment, but they both flinch.</p><p>
  <em>But I won’t be next to you </em>
</p><p>Remus wants to scream a little bit.</p><p>~</p><p>At times like these, everything about the airport reminds Remus of the hospital he spent so much time in as a kid. Everything is white and loud and blinding. He feels so small, holding Sirius’ hand so tightly like this, but he’s scared that if he loosens his grip even in the slightest, Sirius might be pulled away and lost in the sea of people and he wouldn’t be able to say goodbye.</p><p>The walk to the terminal was long and by the way Sirius kept looking at his watch, Remus could tell they were tight on time. But Sirius kept their walk slow, prolonging these last moments for Remus’ sake. They were always silent. Neither of them knew what to say and Sirius knew that attempts at normal smalltalk would just make Remus shut down.</p><p><em>“This isn’t normal!”</em> He had shouted one time, halting right in the middle of the airport, <em>“This isn’t normal and it isn’t fair and I can’t pretend like it is.” </em></p><p>Sirius knew Remus hated crying in front of other people, but he had. Days like these always seemed to be an exception to that rule of his.</p><p>So Sirius doesn’t speak, he just squeezes Remus’ hand, letting him know he’s still there.</p><p>He feels the falter in Remus’ steps when the gate comes into view, a big, looming number ten. He feels Remus start slowing down, more and more until he’s pulling Sirius back by their laced fingers. Sirius tries to ignore it, tries to keep walking because if they stop he’s worried he’ll never be able to start again. It’s taken all his willpower to just get <em>this far.</em> But Remus is insistent, and when Sirius hears the slight hitch in his breathing he finally turns around, encasing Remus’ hand in both his own warmly.</p><p>“Re… Please-“</p><p>“I’m not ready yet.” Remus’ breathing is too quick to be normal, his eyes shining, “Sirius, I’m not- I can’t-“ He’s shaking his head - really his entire body is shaking, “I can’t. Not again-“</p><p>Sirius drops his pack to the ground, right there in the middle of the walkway. He doesn’t care if people have to step around them, doesn’t care who sees. He doesn’t care about anything at all except closing the distance between them.</p><p>He reaches up to cup the back of Remus’ head, pressing their foreheads together, “I know. I know, love, <em>I know.” </em></p><p>It’s all Sirius can say right now because he can feel his throat closing up at the look on Remus’ face and he cannot cry right now. He needs to be strong for both of them. Because he knows if he cries, Remus will never let him go, and he would never be able to walk away.</p><p>“I just got you <em>back</em>, I-“ Remus hates how pathetic he sounds but he’s <em>panicking</em>. He thought he had prepared himself. After all he’d done this before. He’d hoped it would get easier, but how could it? How does one make <em>bye, see you in three months, please don’t die, please come home, I need you</em> any <em>easier?</em></p><p>“I want to come with you.”</p><p>There’s a beat of silence.</p><p>“Oh, love… “ Sirius sighs, hand sliding from his hair to his cheek, thumb running over the smooth, tear-streaked skin. He didn’t say anything more but the silence said it all - at least Sirius hoped it did.</p><p>Remus blinks a few times, trying to clear his eyes, trying to focus on something else - something good. Like how beautifully tan Sirius always is when he gets home, how strong, how proud. How he follows Remus around the house like a love sick puppy for at least the first month. But it’s almost too hard and his brain keeps slipping up.</p><p>So he tries for a laugh instead, and it comes out watery but he needs to try- for Sirius, “Fuck me. I promised myself I wouldn’t freak out this time.” He glances around, watching a few prying eyes flit away as they realize he’s seen them, “‘m sorry.”</p><p>Sirius smiles a little too. Remus doesn’t miss the way his shoulders sag in relief and he instantly feels guilty. He knows he doesn’t make it easier for Sirius to leave.</p><p>“S’alright… I- I’d freak out a little bit too.”</p><p>“Knowing you, you’d cause a right scene.”</p><p>Sirius’ smile is real this time, and he hooks his finger into Remus’ belt loop, pulling them flush together, “Sod off-”</p><p>Remus jumps when the loudspeakers crackles to life and the smooth voice of a woman fills the air. Because it had almost felt like just another day - just for a second. It had almost felt like he wasn’t about to be left alone for three months.</p><p>“Flight 307 first call for boarding. Please be ready to present your ticket and passport and any luggage you wish to gate check.”</p><p>Remus bites his lip hard. He wants to squeeze his eyes shut, wants to block everything out. But he keeps them open and flitting across Sirius’ face, a face he won’t see for a very long time. The panic is threatening to surge back up in his chest but he pushes it down.</p><p>Sirius’ hands are there instantly, looping around his waist, rubbing gently at his hip bones because he <em>knows</em> how much Remus loves that. Remus, however, doesn’t know what to do with his hands. He wants to run them through Sirius’ newly cropped short hair, memorize the feeling because he suddenly feels like he doesn’t do it enough. He wants to press them to his warm neck run them along his jaw and that little scar on his upper lip.</p><p>He ends up just clutching onto the front of his uniform. He’s probably ruining all Sirius’ hard work with the iron that morning but he can’t bring himself to care.</p><p>“I-“</p><p>They say it at the same time. They just stare at each other, because what is there to say? And Remus hates this part. He hates goodbyes because what if-</p><p>“I love you.” Sirius is glancing up as the speaker announces a last call for passengers. His grip is tighter now and his eyes are burning into Remus, locking him into their gaze like they always do,</p><p>“I love you and I have to- fuck- Re, <em>I love you</em>, I have-“ His eyes are pleading almost.<br/> I have to go <br/>“I need to kiss you-“</p><p>Remus barely lets him get the words out before he’s surging forward, letting Sirius immediately open his mouth with his tongue, letting him hold the bruising grip on his hips because at least he’d have <em>something</em> then, a purplish, bluish reminder…</p><p>Remus can’t help the soft noise that escapes when Sirius pulls back, burrowing his head into the nook of Remus’ neck. They just hold each other, swaying on the spot, feeling the pounding of each other’s hearts.</p><p>“You have to stay safe.” Remus murmurs, shakily into Sirius’ ear. He presses his nose into his hair, inhaling deeply, desperate to surround himself with Sirius as much as he can, “Pads, you have to come <em>home.”</em></p><p>“I always come home.”</p><p>And Remus knows what’s coming next.</p><p>He feels Sirius’ lips press once to his neck, like always.</p><p>And then, like always, Sirius is tearing himself away in one swift motion, dipping slightly to swing his pack onto his back, and sprinting to the gate. He doesn’t turn around for a last look - he can’t.</p><p>Because if he does, they both know he’d come running back.</p><p>
  <em>three months </em>
</p><p>Remus watches until Sirius disappears around the corner.</p><p>
  <em>I always come home</em>
</p><p>He stays until the plane is just a dot in the sky.</p><p>
  <em>91 days</em>
</p><p>He locks himself in one of the family bathrooms and lets the panic in.</p>
