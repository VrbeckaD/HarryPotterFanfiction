    <p>In the aftermath of battle, there are always the bodies of those who didn’t survive. Newt Scamander had served in the Great War, he’d seen enough battle fields to recognize it when he saw one. He’d had to develop the skills to deal with the sadness and the despair and having to move on from it. </p>
<p>But this? This was no battlefield. It was just slaughter. </p>
<p>Through one of his old friends who Newt had served with, the Magizoologist had found out about a plan by the Soviets to “clean up” a group of Ukrainian Ironbellys- specifically, Newt’s Ironbellys. </p>
<p>If he’d asked Theseus what to do, his ministry brother would have advised him to go through all the proper legal channels before entering the U.S.S.R. Instead, Newt decided to just go in, get his dragons, and leave. The Soviets wouldn’t even know Newt was there until it was too late. </p>
<p>He had even found a place to release the dragons. While Romania was not the perfect place for Ukrainian dragons, it was a Reserve specifically for dragons. The witches and wizards who ran it were a small group but the had been more then willing to get Newt’s advice. They were good people. </p>
<p>He had no doubt they would protect his babies. </p>
<p>The Hufflepuff did not realize he had come too late until he arrived on the scene. Littered across the massive field were the deceased bodies of all of Newt’s dragons. The earth was crushed and valleyed around their bodies, obvious signs they had crashed into the field below. Light grey smoke danced off their bodies into the air, releasing a repugnant smell. </p>
<p>The killing curse did not cause bodies to smoke- not even dragons. </p>
<p>When he arrived, Newt saw three soviet wizards- presumably the ones responsible for this. </p>
<p>Never in his life had Newt felt such anger, such pure exquisite rage. </p>
<p>These dragons were Newt’s. He’d brought Suzanna’s mate here, he’d helped many of their eggs hatch. He’d even helped little Jules when she hatched a little too early from the rest of her egg-mates. </p>
<p>Little Jules loved him, and Newt adored her. Now, all of them- Suzanna, Jules, Martin, Erin, Freya, Daniel and May- lay dead. Simply for being- just for being the magnificent creatures they were. </p>
<p>The three soviets shouted something at him, their wands drawn.</p>
<p>Never in his life had Newt drawn his wand so quickly or deftly. Pointing at the one he assumed was the leader, Newt shouted a curse he never thought he’d use in his life. </p>
<p>“Crucio!”</p>
<p>Immediately the man fell, screaming in pain that echoed off the nearby mountains and valleys. It bounced off the deceased dragon’s scales, magnifying the sound but it could not reach Newt’s heart. </p>
<p>When the other two tried to stop Newt, the Magizoologist waved his other hand- pulling their wands out of their grasp and into the woods. He didn’t even realize he’d used wandless magic. </p>
<p>Forcing the other two on their knees- rather like Grindelwald-as-Graves had months ago in New York, Newt extended the Cruciatus curse to all three of them. Approaching them, Newt did not notice or seem to hear the pop of someone apparating to the forest. The Soviets screams became whimpers as their pain increased exponentially. </p>
<p>“How dare you? How dare you harm these creatures just for being?”</p>
<p>One of them, in very broken English, tried to say they were just following orders. </p>
<p>It was the wrong thing to say. </p>
<p>“So the destruction of an entire flock is acceptable if a Superior officer gives the order? You three are dirt! Worse then!”</p>
<p>With power and control Newt never realized he had, the Magizoologist levitated the men high above the ground before slamming them back down. </p>
<p>Newt didn’t know if he killed them or just paralyzed the, but he didn’t care. Finally, he released the crucio, Newt fell to his knees. </p>
<p>He did not feel regret or remorse for what he did- only an immense sadness that he hadn’t been here to stop it the slaying.</p>
<p>What kind of government did this? Had the Ministry done things like this and Theseus just hadn’t told him? Did MACUSA do it?</p>
<p>The possibilities were too horrifying to contemplate. </p>
<p>This extraordinary use of magic drained Newt to the degree that he was barely clinging to consciousness when a voice behind him spoke. </p>
<p>“Well done, Mr. Scamander- I didn’t think you had it in you.” </p>
<p>The voice was familiar, but the redhead couldn’t place it. Attempting to stand and turn, he stumbled back and fell onto his back. His head hitting the ground. </p>
<p>The last thing he saw was the fuzzy image of a blonde haired man striding toward him. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Watching the small and meek Magizoologist torture and kill three men had been exciting to say the very least, in more ways then one. </p>
<p>Gellert really didn’t think the brit had it in him to do this kind of thing, but here they were. He was surrounded by several dead dragons, three dead Russians, and an unconscious Magizoologist. </p>
<p>When he had heard about the dragon massacre, Gellert decided it would be the perfect trap for Newton. He could not let Newton interfere with his plans again, like he had in New York. </p>
<p>Turns out, he was right. Scamander had come. It seemed, though, both of them had been too late to stop the killing. Gellert didn’t particularly care about the dragons, but Newton did. Therefore, he would stop them. As erotic as it had been to watch Newt torture those men, seeing him so distraught was not. </p>
<p>Easily picking up the thin man, Gellert wondered how much darkness was in Newton. Just how powerful was Scamander, if he could tame a Thunderbird and crucio three men at once?</p>
<p>Regardless, he’d already decided. He would keep Newton, he was simply too interesting to ignore. </p>
<p>Noting that the infamous case wasn’t there, Gellert kissed Newton’s forehead. He’d send Vinda to go get it, wherever it was. Probably with the American muggle Newt liked so much. </p>
<p>As he apparated both of them away, Gellert couldn’t but grin. It cost Newton a bit of his heart for Gellert to claim him but the Dark Lord was certain in the end it would all be worth it. He’d give Newt a 100 dragons if it made him smile again. </p>
<p>He’d do anything for his beloved Magizoologist.</p>
