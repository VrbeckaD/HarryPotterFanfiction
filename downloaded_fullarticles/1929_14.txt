    <p class="p1">It came back to him in flashes, usually. Quick spurts of repetition appearing out of the void of time that lived in his head, a void he could put shape and order to if he decided he wanted to think about it. Somewhere, his past was a complete picture, an uncut fabric stretched back into the time before, well, now. Somewhere, it all made complete and perfect sense. Like a history book. Cause and effect, pattern and shape and reasons for everything. Logic in an unbroken, plodding line. But in the twisting river of his memory there were gaps, places where a stone parted the flow, where a tree diverted the river’s direction. In order to see those places — the space under the stone, the spot hidden behind the tree — he would have to rip them up by the roots. And he didn’t want to do that. He was afraid of what would come up if he pulled too hard.</p><p class="p1">Like what his father had said to him that night. It had been about midnight, he remembered that. Almost, because it hadn’t yet become the 19th. They were alone in his parents’ room. His father had placed a hand on his shoulder. He had stared at the wall, and wondered why he wasn’t crying. He had understood that his mother was dead, that the police were investigating, that the man who had killed her had been under the Imperius Curse, and was now dead as well.</p><p class="p1">But he couldn’t remember the words his father had used.</p><p class="p1">The officers had come through the front door a few moments later, let in by the housekeeper. His father had left to meet them, and the closing of the study door echoed through the front hall and up to the second floor. He had managed to wonder why someone would kill a woman who had been fatally ill for years.</p><p class="p1">And then the housekeeper had asked: “Would you like some tea, love?”</p><p class="p1">And a new voice had answered: “No, thank you. I’ll just wait here.”</p><p class="p1">He had crept out the double doors of the bedroom then, and peered over the banister from the second floor landing into the front hall.</p><p class="p1">“What are you doing here?” There were probably politer ways he could have asked, but he didn’t care.</p><p class="p1">“I’m sorry. I was just with him when he got the call. I’m…I’m really sorry.”</p><p class="p1">They didn’t say anything for several moments.</p><p class="p1">“What do you know?”</p><p class="p1">“Nothing. Really. I —“</p><p class="p1">“What?”</p><p class="p1">“I shouldn’t —“</p><p class="p1">A pointed glare had produced a tiny package from inside a pocket. It contained a disembodied pair of ears. It warranted an invitation to the second floor landing.</p><p class="p1">Only when the ear successfully hung outside the crack in the door to the study could they hear inside. It felt odd to press an alien ear against one’s own.</p><p class="p1">“—and you’re positive?” His father’s voice was choked and tight.</p><p class="p1">“That’s my personal <em>and</em> professional opinion.”</p><p class="p1">“I’m going to need a little fucking more than your <em>opinion</em>.“</p><p class="p1">It was odd to hear his father swear. He almost never did. Did grief make you do that?</p><p class="p1">A sigh. “I wish there was more I could offer you. The perpetrator couldn’t exactly give us a statement after he’d jumped off the nearest tall building.”</p><p class="p1">“So what was it then? In your <em>personal and professional opinion</em>.”</p><p class="p1">It sounded like something scuttling up a wall. Like Parseltongue, maybe. It wasn’t a word he had heard before. But he would remember it. That, he would remember perfectly. He would try look it up later in the school library, in any government archive he could reach. He scoured shelves and poured over books obsessively, desperately. He found nothing. There was no record of it anywhere except the case file, and that was restricted.</p><p class="p1">But he hadn’t searched alone. He had a new presence at his side after that, the same presence that sat, knee pressed against his own, as they listened from the second floor landing through a pair of stolen ears.</p><p class="p1">“What the fuck is that?” His father was swearing again.</p><p class="p1">“I cast it at you, once. Sixth year.”</p><p class="p1">“Well, <em>I’m</em> not fucking dead, am I?”</p><p class="p1">“Only a handful of people could know—“</p><p class="p1">“Are you telling me I’m a suspect in my own wife’s murder? Because you tried to kill me once when we were sixteen?”</p><p class="p1">“I <em>never</em>—“ A cough. “I never wanted that. I didn’t know what it would do.”</p><p class="p1">“But whoever…whoever sent that man— they knew.”</p><p class="p1">There was a pause. At the other end of the ears, it seemed likely to be a nod. “They also knew there was no one left alive who knew the counter-curse.”</p><p class="p1">“Do you mean to tell me <em>you</em> don’t know it?”</p><p class="p1">“I —“</p><p class="p1">“Bet you didn’t know it then either, eh?” Biting. One of the few things that remained unforgiven.</p><p class="p1">No one spoke. Not in the study, and not on the landing. His father sat heavily in a chair, the legs scraping the wood of the floor. It was grainy and jarring through the ear. The questions of war haunted the air of the house.</p><p class="p1">“Do you or your wife have any enemies?” The tone was formal, but the voice that spoke it fought with a desire to shake.</p><p class="p1">His father began to laugh. He might have been crying at the same time. It was a horrible sound. When he did speak, it was almost a whisper.</p><p class="p1">“More than we have friends.”</p><p class="p1">Up on the landing, he felt a hand on his arm. He looked up into the striking green of the eyes opposite him. He’d almost forgotten he wasn’t alone up there.</p><p class="p1">“You do have friends,” Albus said. He wasn’t wearing his glasses like he did for school.</p><p class="p1">Scorpius swallowed hard. “You promise?” he whispered.</p><p class="p1">Albus closed his hand around Scorpius’s forearm and squeezed. “I promise.”</p><p class="p1">It would take a lot to make him forget that.</p>
