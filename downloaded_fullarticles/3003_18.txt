    <p>Severus sat in one of the compartments on the Hogwarts Express, scowling at the list in the notebook, he had been supplied with by Dumbledore. It had been the older wizard's idea for Severus to travel back in time in the first place but, it was Severus who had to carry it out as per usual with their relationship. If the foolish, old, coot hadn't been already dying from the incident with that blasted, ring; Severus would have been more inclined to tear him a new one. Like every other plan of Dumbledore's, Severus was the one who had to instigate it.</p><p>Apparently, the headmaster had been up three nights in a row, trying to figure out a way preventing the upcoming war, on the horizon. He had thought through each and every possible scenario, thoroughly. But each time they came back with similar results, mass death that seemingly couldn't be avoided. That people, they had both known for years, would perish in the upcoming fight for their freedom. It was an obvious thing to factor in, considering it was war they were talking about and, not some quaint, little, tea party. People died in wars. It was as though Dumbledore had seemingly forgotten that he had been the one, to lead the charge in the last war. As if he had never expected this outcome. But what Severus hadn't expected, was for Dumbledore to come up with an idea to remedy the inevitability of death.</p><p>===</p><p>"Severus, sometimes in life we must look to our past misfortunes, so that we can better our future." Dumbledore had begun. "And, never has that sentence had more meaning and truth than now."</p><p>"S-Sir?" Severus had inquired, hesitantly.</p><p>"In order to prevent as many deaths, in the inevitable future, someone must journey into the past with the knowledge of the present and stop the destruction before it arrives." Albus had said. "And, that someone is you, Severus."</p><p>"Time travel? Me? Headmaster you cannot be serious?" Severus had gasped, appalled at the idea. Time wasn't something to mess with, liberally. It was delicate and needed to be respected.</p><p>"I understand your concerns as we both know of the risks involved in time travel but if we are to prevent the deaths of hundreds of innocents, it is a risk worth pursuing, is it not?" Albus had stated.</p><p>Severus had been quiet for a moment or two, not wanting to speak as he knew the old, goat was right. "But, why me? Headmaster?"</p><p>"Severus, you, with your knowledge, understanding and history, are in the best position, for such an expedition." His employer had informed him. "That and the fact that, if ever there was someone, witch or wizard, who deserved to live their life again, it would be you."</p><p>"Headmaster, I understand your reasoning but, I cannot accept your offer." Severus had declined, "I do not deserve it."</p><p>"You do and you will. Severus, you have done more for the betterment of the wizarding world, than even you know. You have worked hard to repent your past mistakes and more. How many others can you say have done the same? Not many, I would bet to the extent as someone, like yourself has. I, myself, have not treated you well and, you deserve so much more." Albus had affirmed, placing something around his neck. Looking down at what it was, Severus found it to be a chain necklace with a large, glass, phial attached. Inside, it contained small, blue, tendril, like things that, glowed and wriggled around inside.</p><p>"What is this that you are giving me?" Severus had prompted, indicating the phial.</p><p>"Those Severus, are some of my more informative memories of what I have learnt over the years. Before, during and after the war, up until now." Albus had said. "When you get the chance, you will present these memories to the Albus Dumbledore of nineteen seventy-one. You will tell him that you wished to speak to him about "Tom", he will know what you mean. I trust you to keep them safe until then."</p><p>"Yes, Headmaster." Severus had nodded as he was hand a plain looking notebook.</p><p>"Inside this book, I have written down what is needed to be done, in order for the plan to follow through, I would ask that you follow through with what is written as closely as you can." Dumbledore had instructed him, gesturing to the book. "There are things in there that I don't doubt, you will find most agreeable. But there other things on that list that are ... more on the sensitive topic with you."</p><p>Curious to see what the old man had in store for him, Severus opened the notebook and could have vomited  as he read the third note on the list: Become as close to: James Potter, Sirius Black and Remus Lupin as possible. "Is this some kind of cruel joke, to you?"</p><p>"It is a fail safe, Severus," Albus had said as he had approached one of his glass cabinets, opening it up and retrieving something from inside. "Peter Pettigrew's betrayal of the Potters was one of many factors, I have taken into consideration."</p><p>"You want me to replace, Pettigrew?" Severus had said, frowning at the list. "What makes you think they'd want anything to do with me?"</p><p>"Not to assume too much but, I believe that the main reason the three boys had allowed Peter into their fold was mainly to do with the fact that they shared a dorm together." Dumbledore had theorized. "Happenstance, wouldn't you say?"</p><p>Severus had pondered this for a moment before agreeing with Dumbledore. With Potter and Black, it had been obvious to him, how they had become friends: equally, boisterous, arrogant and trouble seeking. He could even see why someone like Lupin would attract their friendship. He was highly intelligent, shy but equally enthusiastic as the other two. But Pettigrew? As a child he had been below average in most if not all his classes, struggling with some of the most basic of spells in his sixth year that first years could master in their sleep. He was also very socially awkward, more so than even Severus and Lupin and had just seemed to be riding on the other boy's coat tails, most of the time. Maybe it had just been coincidence that they became friends with Pettigrew? "I suppose ..."</p><p>"So, if you were to be substituted in his stead, problem diverted. Because as we both know, you would do anything to protect those you care deeply about." Albus had continued as he had placed a small, ornate, white and gold enameled, box on his desk before the Potions Master. Opening up the box, inside set on a plush velvet pillow was a strange looking, time turner. It had the ascetic of an ordinary time turner but it had a metallic plunger at it's center.</p><p>"Don't you think it'll be a little bit telling, having two Severus Snape's running around Hogwarts?" he had pointed out but seeing a smile press across the old fool's face, he knew the other wizard had already thought of that answer. Then he had been pulled gently by the shoulder closer to the device in the box.</p><p>"This, Severus, is Melden's time turner." The headmaster had enthused, carefully picking the device up out of it's box and showing it to Severus. "Much like yourself, Melden worked hard to improve upon well know methods and practices. And one of his most ingenious inventions was five identical time turners with his own magical improvements, enhancing their power. They were however snatched up by the ministry of magic as they were listed as too dangerous, if they fell into the wrong hands. This is the only one that managed to escape incineration, fully intact. These time turners have the ability to go to any time in someone's life with just a click, the person phasing their mind with their past selves'. Keeping their knowledge intact from their future selves and melding it with that of their past selves. But it also has a function similar to an ordinary time turner that, whatever you hold in your hand or have on your person will travel back with you.  So you can probably guess why they were destroyed. Could you imagine the damage such a thing could do, if an unscrupulous person got their hands on it? If Voldemort was to learn of it's existence?"</p><p>"And, you're trusting this to me?" Severus had said, looking at the device with a new wounder and worry. It was a lot of responsibility that made it's self comfortable on his shoulders.</p><p>"Severus, I have said it many times in my life and, I will say it again." Dumbledore had begun. "I would trust you with my life. But when you do go back, hide the device safely away and give it to my past self, he'll know how to take care of it." Dumbledore had then pressed the device into Severus' hand with what had seemed like a prideful smile and tears brimming his eyes. "When you're ready, my boy."</p><p>Severus had peered down at the modified time turner which suddenly had held so much more weight to it. "Thank you, headmaster." he had managed. "Really, thank you."</p><p>Click.</p><p>Severus had had a strange sensation of being pulled backwards by some invisible force, the sound of air rushing passed his ears and, it suddenly stopped.</p><p>Severus had been whisked back to Spinners End and stood, practically drowning in his future self's robes. He had forgotten how small, he used to be and had quickly changed into his least thread bared clothes, hiding the device carefully in his school trunk along with the notebook, he had wrapped the time turner up carefully in a pair of socks so as to not have it clanking about. It was far too dangerous a thing to just have lying about in the open, for anyone to see. He then tucked the headmaster's phial full of memories under his over sized shirt which hide it surprisingly well.</p><p>It had been just a moment later that, Severus' mother had peered into his room, looking just as haggard as he remembered her to be. "Are you ready to go now, Severus," She had whispered to him. "Your father's sleeping off last night, so if we're going to go, we should go now."</p><p>"Coming, mother." he had replied, quietly, not wishing to disturb his father in the next room.</p><p>===</p><p>"Hey, Sev, what's wrong?" asked Lily bringing Severus out of his thoughts and into the present ... past ... whatever. "Come on, you're on a magical train, going to a magical school, where you get to practice magic, cheer up."</p><p>Severus sighed happily. Hearing her voice that morning when they had met on platform nine and three quarters, had been an emotional trip, struggling with the urge just to hug her and hold her and know she was alive. And, that he would do anything in his power to keep it that way.</p>
