    <p align="left">The pull of the heavy iron chains hindered Harri’s movement as she struggled and fought her guards. She snapped her teeth at any who got too close and felt satisfaction when they gave her a wide berth after making the first ten bleed. </p><p>Luna was serene by her side and if she had been in a calmer mindset she would have realized they were fine but right now panic was gripping her too hard to let her pay that fact any attention. </p><p>They were heading towards the Veil. She had watched all of her friends, the ‘lucky’ ones at least, get thrown in there a few days after capture. After torture. </p><p>Fred and George has been the first to go. Their deaths featured in the front page of the prophet in horrifying detail. You could see that Fred was barely able to stand and George had to hold him up. They were both bleeding heavily and had nasty festering wounds all over. </p><p>Ginny couldn’t sleep for weeks afterwards. Her remaining brothers weren’t much better. </p><p>The Weasleys had gotten more vicious after that day, more prone to kill first ask questions later. Dark Arts flowed easier for them and more than once Harri had to hold each of them back from going to far and losing themselves to the darkness.</p><p>The haunted look in their eyes only got worse when Ginny died. </p><p>A raid gone bad. That was what killed her. Not battling leagues of death eaters and dying in a blaze of glory, not in an ambush that caught everyone unaware but she was quick to defend and lost her life to save others. No, she was killed by a raid gone bad. </p><p>A spy in their ranks had given bad information, hoping to catch one of Harri’s most trusted. But something went wrong and Ginny was found dead in the middle of the deserted manor.</p><p>She had insisted on going alone, Ron’s death at the Battle of Hogwarts and the Twins’ fall through the Veil had completely broken her self preservation and she refused to let anyone walk into anything blind.</p><p>She had left before Harri could say anything to refuse and four days later they stormed the manor and found her dead in the entryway. She was torn limb from limb and scattered across the room, her blood coated the floor and walls in a sick painting. </p><p>The remaining Weasleys had been catatonic for days and after that Harri lost all control of them. </p><p>Molly and Arthur died next, ambushed by a roaming pack of dementors. Their souls gone before anyone could sound the alarm. Harri thought that their souls had left with the death of their first child.</p><p>Bill and Charlie were captured soon after; tossed through the Veil in a celebratory ceremony but not before they took out hundreds of death eaters together with a Dark ritual that they sacrificed an untold amount to complete. </p><p>Percy was just a husk of himself by then. He holed himself up in a library whenever he could while they were on the run and was often seen muttering to himself wildly with his nose buried in a book. Hermione joined him as often as she could, Ron’s death had hit her the hardest but still tried her best to be there for everyone. </p><p>They had left on a mission to infiltrate Malfoy Manor, dragging Draco behind them and armed with an obscure ritual they theorized would destroy Voldemort along with any horcruxes he might have left. </p><p>The picture of their capture and fall through the Veil was in the Prophet a week later. </p><p>Blaise, Vince and Greg were heartbroken when they learned of Draco’s death but soldered on. Pansy was often seen with one or the other, comforting them to the best of her ability even as she herself was struggling. </p><p>Harri’s side had been slowly but surely dwindling in numbers; more and more of them had been found dead in their homes, they’re families killed and their stuff destroyed. Soon it was less about destroying Voldemort and more about surviving and helping when they could. </p><p>Blaise was caught while he was trying to save a family from Dementors. He was thrown through the Veil the same day; the Death Eaters having long since stopped caring about the pomp of it all and more about the carnage they wrought. </p><p>Vince and Greg were lost next, surrounded as they fought to defend and protect Pansy. She got away but they were tossed through the Veil the next day. </p><p>Pansy had been beside herself with grief and guilt. She no longer smiled or teased, her appearance deteriorated. She was thrown through the Veil a year later; Bellatrix and the Lestrange brothers killed by her wand. Neville had been at her side, the Sword of Gryffindor on his hip wet with the blood of Nagini. He was also tossed through the Veil.</p><p>Now it was just Harri and Luna.</p><p>Harri had jealously guarded her little sister like never before; they were never apart and had quickly taken to sleeping with each other at night, helping to keep the nightmares away.</p><p>They had evaded capture for three years after everyone else was gone before one slip up and they were goners. </p><p>Harri was furious with herself for getting her little sister in danger. She had been distracted with saving a small group of muggle survivors from dementors. She hadn’t seen the death eaters sneaking up behind them until it was too late. </p><p>The only upside that Harry could see was that Voldemort wasn’t getting the death that he wanted for her. </p><p>He wanted to prove that he himself could kill her as he hadn’t when she was a baby, so he had tried to AK her. But that problem had long since been solved by Hermione years ago; immediately after the battle of Hogwarts when she learned that Ron had been killed by a stray avada kedavra.</p><p>Pins in the shape of a lightening bolt etched with runes and tied to the wearers magic prevented being hit. It sensed an AK in a certain vacinity and then forced the wearer into a different location just out of reach. It couldn’t break through wards but it acted like sort of apparition in that it jolted the wearer around the room to avoid the avada.</p><p>Harri didn’t fully understand the physics behind it, or the magic. All she knew was that it worked and was largely the reason her inner circle were thrown through the Veil instead. </p><p>She was jolted back into reality when she was yanked to a stop before the Veil. Voldemort’s remaining followers filled the room and the monster himself stood off to the left of the arch. </p><p>“Harri Potter. A pleasure to finally get rid of you. Now my claim to the wizard of world cannot be contested. The fools who continue to believe in you will have to face the reality that there is no one who can save them now.”</p><p>His high voice echoed around the room and Harri tensed instinctively. When he looked at her she spat at his feet and glared with all of the hate she could muster. It was a lot and she could almost see him quell before he gathered himself up and motioned at her guards. </p><p>“Throw them in. Let’s not give Ms. Potter’s unaccountable luck a chance to save her from certain death once more.”</p><p>Harri’s struggles renewed when she saw Luna being manhandled to the archway. She growled in fury and bit viciously into the unguarded throat of an approaching guard. She yanked back hard and brought his throat with her. His shocked expression was frozen on his face as he crumpled to the ground like a cut marionette. </p><p>Harri grinned wickedly and spat the gore and blood out as her remaining guards froze in horror. Her smirk turned into a cackle as no one moved. </p><p>“What. Didn’t think the “Golden Girl” could get her hands dirty like that?”</p><p>Her maniacal laughter brought everyone back into reality and she was shoved from behind into Luna. She watched in horror, her smirk frozen on her face, as she watched her sister stumble in her binds and topple through the Veil. </p><p>A cry of shock was lodged in her throat and Harri felt her eyes fog over with tears. </p><p>“No.”</p><p>A snarl of rage flew out of her and she turned around sharply, launching herself into the guard that had shoved her. They both hit the ground hard and rolled around in a tussle. Harri bit and kicked wherever she could until finally her mouth found soft skin of his stomach. His shirt had torn off in the scuffle somehow and Harri didn’t question it as she tore into it. Her teeth, now pulsing with her unchanneled magic, ripped his stomach open and cut into his soft inner organs. Blood pooled around her and over her as she yanked out everything she could; the man’s screams washing over her.</p><p>A spell hit her and Harri froze in place, her head buried in the guard’s stomach and her mouth biting into his heart. </p><p>Harri was yanked away from the dying man, subsequently pulling the man’s heart out of his chest with her. The guard gurgled out a bloody breath and collapsed, dead. </p><p>The guard holding her practically threw her into the Veil but Harri managed to catch the look of shocked horror on Voldemort’s face as she plunged into icy oblivion. </p>
