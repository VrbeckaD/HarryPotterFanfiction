    <p>London, 2007</p><p>Pansy groaned against his throat, her breath hot against Draco’s skin, beads of sweat lining the cords of his neck. She lingered for another second, slowing her breathing down, steadying her gaze. </p><p>“Do you have to go? It can’t take you that long to floo in.” He huffed. Draco’s brows knit together, looking rather serious despite his lack of clothes.</p><p>“Draco,” Pansy warned, her palms flush against his chest, gently pushing him away. “This is my first day, I have to at least get there a little early.” She sighed, shaking her head slightly. Her blunt bob caught the hollows of her collarbones, and she reached a hand up absentmindedly to brush it back. Already she could feel the knot of anxiety—anticipation—coiling in her belly. It had taken her years to reach a position like this, and she wasn’t about it waste it on another morning go with Malfoy. She had been here, what, almost four months already with no real prospects until now? After years spent in New York, securing a staff position as MACUSA, coming home had been jarring. Adjusting to being back in British wizarding society had been a bit like reacquainting herself with a phantom limb she had suddenly rediscovered after the feeling being absent for years. </p><p>Draco rubbed the back of his hand against his forehead, grey eyes flickering towards her. “And you still won’t tell me who’s vault you supplied to get into the Ministry? Remind me what you’re doing there exactly?” He smirked, just short of waggling his eyebrows.</p><p>Pansy’s lip quirked, her eyes flashing upwards. “Merlin, your faith in me is endearing. Remind me why I put up with you again? The sex is mediocre at best, I suppose your arse is decent looking, but the food here-” Cut off by Draco’s swift pull on her waist, heaving her back onto the bed, Pansy let out a quick squeal. She struggled to right herself; Draco was faster though, his teeth already pulling hungrily at her bottom lip. “Malfoy, I swear!” She kneed him lightly into the side of his thigh, just enough to loosen his grip. Pansy slipped from his grasp, frustrated, pointedly ignoring his lazy grin. “I’m working with the Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, security-based.” </p><p>“Gracious, you’re a glorified bodyguard.” He barked, suppressing a laugh before softening his gaze, “You know I’m rooting for you though, Pans.” Draco pushed himself upon his elbows, watching her step back, quickly gathering clothes from the ground. She slipped on her bra noiselessly, latching it in the back, stepped into a fitted black skirt, tucked in a tailored blouse. Picking up her wand holster, she dragged it up her thigh out of sight, easing her wand into it before glancing around for her shoes. Draco stood as she finished pulling on her work heels, watching her intently. </p><p>Pansy shot him a warning glance, digging her hand into her pocket. Pulling out a short silver chain affixed with a tiny green gem, she offered her palm to him. “Help me with this, will you?” Draco obliged, coming to stand behind her. His fingers ghosted her neck as he closed the latch, placing a chaste kiss against her shoulder. Pansy watched as his blonde strands dipped into her peripheral, smiling despite herself. Ever since she had returned to London months ago, Draco had been quick to allow her to stay with him at the Manor. It had been easy, falling back into a routine with her old friend, even picking up their habit of sleeping together that they had started sometime back in fifth year. Draco hadn’t rushed her to move out, and it felt comfortable staying with him, almost like home. Though she had relished in the freedom she found living in New York, the anonymity it had granted her, allowing her to work on her career, she had missed London. Her friends, the comfortability of having grown up here, the feeling of belonging that took her breath away when she had left after the war. The loss of home had been sharp and piercing, though it had dulled over the years into an ache she had managed by throwing herself into her training. </p><p>“Thanks, love.” Pansy turned, gently squeezing Draco’s forearm, affection for him bubbling in her throat. Draco blushed, hand coming down to swat her arse playfully, pushing her towards the stairs.</p><p>“Alright, alright, enough. Go before you’re late and blame this on me later.” He rolled his eyes, putting on an air of indifference, waving at her to leave. “Oh, and tell Zabini I expect to see him Friday.”</p><p>Pansy nodded, her hand already closing over the handle of her thin leather work bag. She hurried down the stairs towards the floo near the main entrance, deftly applying a layer of deep red lipstick with her free hand, lips rolling together. She tried to collect herself before throwing the powder into the hearth, her nerves hopelessly jumpy. </p><p>As expected, Blaise was waiting for her in the Ministry’s atrium. She strode towards him, suppressing a grin as she took in his imposing frame, back turned. His hair was cropped close to his head, strong chin jutting from his profile, tanned skin glowing in the atrium’s subdued lighting. He turned as she approached, eyes appraising. “Pansy, you’re looking well, and almost on time.” Pansy snorted quietly, tempted to rib him. “Lovely to see you as always, Zabini.” </p><p>“Anyways, I’ll fill you in and get you settled this morning.” He continued, gesturing for her to follow. She kept pace as they winded down another hallway, puffing but thankful they hadn’t had to take the lift, not sure she could stomach it just then. Finally, he stopped in front of an office door, turning a wary gaze to her. “There has also been a few…rearrangements with your position here. It happened very recently,” he paused, one hand held up to halt her inevitable question, “but your role hasn’t necessarily changed.” Sighing, Pansy nodded, taking in the long hallway they were in and Blaise’s out of character nervousness. She wondered if he was merely reflecting her own, or if she had missed something. </p><p>“Blaise, I appreciate your assistance in even getting me in the door here, so really, as long as the job description hasn’t changed, I think I can handle myself.” Folding her arms carefully, she dropped her hip against the doorframe, nodding inside. “Are we going in? Or is there more I should know?”</p><p>Rubbing one hand to his eyes, Blaise tipped his head. “Well, like I noted, some changes have recently taken place. Abbott took ill last week, and they’ve had to find a replacement for him. So you’re still working for the Undersecretary, but it won’t be Abbott. His replacement will fill you in on your role though, go over your contract, the like. But things have been hectic for Minister Shacklebolt ever since so keep your head down and do what the Undersecretary needs. They’ll have other staff help settle you in but I’ve noted a…heightened level of stress…around,” Blaise waived his hand, Pansy noticing for the first time that he had been chewing on the inside of his cheek. “What I’m trying to get across is that the next few weeks will be busy, and not necessarily indicative of what usually goes on around here. I’ll just be down the hall though, so if you need, come find me. Shacklebolt has me on a fairly tight leash these days, with Robards trail coming up and all.” Pausing, he exhaled heavily, finally glancing down at Pansy, who was caught between amusement at Blaise’s rambling and mild concern. It wasn’t like Blaise to get flustered, eschewing his calm exterior. Pansy mentally noted to follow up with him later on. </p><p>“Alright then, Zabini. Everyone’s off their trolley this week, I get it.” Pansy shifted, watching him closely. She felt her hair scratch lightly at the back of her neck and brushed a hand through it quickly, pulling away a few short dark strands between her fingers. </p><p>Blaise gave her a curt nod, his disinterested mask returning. His hand hovered above the door, ready to knock, before he sent her another glance. “Oh, and you have two seconds to vanish that gum.” Lip raising in a half grin, his fist rapped lightly on the wooden frame. Pansy allowed herself a quick laugh, popped it in defiance, and vanished her gum with a flick. She straightened herself behind Blaise as he pushed open the door a few inches, his smooth voice calling out. “Undersecretary?” She heard a soft reply, waited for Blaise to push the door further.</p><p>“Undersecretary, this is Pansy, she’ll be working as your Auror assistant. She comes from MACUSA, highly recommended by the Auror Commissioner himself.” Blaise stepped inside, smoothing his robes, voice carefully light. Pansy smiled easily, following him through the door, eyes taking in the rather large but chaotic-looking office they had entered. She noted the stacks of paper on the desk, precariously piled on top of each other haphazardly, spelled not to tip over. Blinking at the lack of light in the room, it took her eyes a second to adjust. </p><p>“Parkinson.” She heard, the voice heavy with a sign. Her gaze followed the sound, locking eyes seconds later with the new Undersecretary.</p><p>“Granger?” Pansy breathed, her voice sounding loud to her own ears, lilting with confusion. She held her gaze for another second before Blaise’s insistent cough, clearing the buzzing that had started low but insistent in her head.</p><p>“Well, Pansy, I’ll leave you to it. As I said, Undersecretary, Pansy has been assigned to work closely with you over the next few months, both in an investigative and security sense. I’d stay for more introductions, but I really must…” He trailed off, already half out the door, closing it quietly behind him. Pansy inhaled sharply, watching him leave, fighting the urge to ask him to stay.</p><p>“Parkinson, sit.” Pansy’s eyes darted back to Hermione at her insistence, who hadn’t left her spot standing in the corner. They were both staring at each other then, Hermione’s gaze wary. Pansy felt her pulse quicken, at once furious with Blaise for not warning her about Granger, another part of her curious to see the witch she hadn’t laid eyes on for almost a decade. </p><p>Pansy took her in, noted the dark plait that fell past her shoulders. The side of her face was illuminated by a high window in the corner, a stray of natural light catching the specs of dust that hovered lazily in the air. Pansy’s gaze flitted over the stray curls that had escaped from Hermione’s braid, framing her face gently. She had shallow bags under her eyes, suggestive of long days, though her cheeks kept a soft flush. She looked, as Blaise had warned, rather worn, holding her body rigidly, as if she hadn’t let herself exhale in many days. Her scar was there though, barely visible, hidden behind the start of her robes. Pansy’s eyes latched onto it, noted it was a silvery white now, no longer the thin stripe of scarlet it had been before. </p><p>“I didn’t know you were being assigned to me.” Hermione sighed, breaking their gaze. Pansy glimpsed the quill she had tucked behind her ear, the small smear of ink on the side of her nose. She had a file open in her hands, fingers worrying the edge of a page. </p><p>Clearing her throat cautiously, Pansy finally sat at the chair Hermione had gestured to in front of her desk. “I thought I was assigned to Undersecretary Abbott, I didn’t realize…That is, Zabini has just informed me of your recent appointment.” She hesitated, unsure of how she was being received, swallowing down her apprehension. </p><p>“Yes, well, a surprise for both of us then.” Hermione murmured, gaze meeting Pansy’s again, more firm this time. Pansy fought the urge to fidget under her watch, feeling Hermione’s eyes sweep over her, scrutinizing. She waited for Hermione to react, perhaps to show her the door, laugh even, but felt unprepared for her resigned sigh. “You worked for the Commissioner then, Tolliver?” </p><p>Pansy nodded, “Yes, for three years. I received my Auror training at MACUSA. I worked with Commissioner Tolliver for the past three years.” Pansy kept her voice steady, polite.</p><p>“And you were there how long?” Hermione pulled the quill from her ear, tapped it against her file, looking impatient, bored. Pansy forced down the desire to scoff, vaguely irritated by Hermione’s sudden posturing. She was differently—vastly—from the eighteen-year-old Pansy had last seen. Surer of herself, certainly, holding herself with an air of…Pansy couldn’t put her finger on it; pride, perhaps? There was little of the wild-eyed girl Pansy had seen just after the war, a woman filled with the enormity of her losses and unbelieving in her victories, anxious too, as if those who remained could be snatched out from under her nose if she glanced away for even a second. And some had been, Pansy supposed. She wondered, silently, if Hermione’s grief had dulled the way hers had over the years. The knife in her gut twisted less and less with the years, though still ever-present. Pansy had lost her parents in the war, her father a Death Eater, her mother a casualty, herself caught between her own inability to choose a side. The weight of the past ebbed at the back of her mind, though Pansy caught herself, kept her gaze steady. </p><p>“Almost nine years, Undersecretary.”</p><p>“Just after the war then, how convenient.” Hermione’s lips quirked back into a smile, an eyebrow raised slightly. “And Granger is fine, please. If we’re to be working together.” She ended her sentence with a questioning tone. Pansy felt heat spread across her chest, pink blooming at the base of her neck. </p><p>Pansy gritted her teeth, forcing herself to meet her gaze, noting the hardness in Hermione’s eyes, glowering pools of deep brown. “We all had to make choices, Granger.” </p><p>“Indeed, we did.” Hermione’s voice, no more than a whisper, finished with another sigh. Resigned, she bristled past where Pansy sat, dropping the file on the desk as she went. She moved towards an adjoining door in her office, glancing over her shoulder. “Well, no need to dwell on bygones at this point, I’m sure if you’ve made it through the interview process, you’re at least half decent. I’d love to catch up, but I have a rather pressing deadline approaching. I’ll have my assistant fill you in. Percy!” Hermione tapped the door, her robes falling open, revealing a pair of fitted beige trousers, a soft white blouse. Pansy noted the outfit with interest, caught sight of the base of her throat past the robes. Her thoughts were disturbed as she watched a pale, freckled face pop into sight beyond Hermione, a mop of smartly cut red hair. Stifling a groan, Pansy stood.</p><p>“Mr. Weasley.” She closed the steps between them, her hand offered. </p><p>Percy’s eyes widened, landing on Pansy. “Merlin, Parkinson? Pansy Parkinson? I didn’t think I’d be seeing you here. Though I’d heard you have been doing quite well for yourself under Tolliver.” He smirked, regarding her with the same wary hardness that Hermione had, though took the hand she had offered. </p><p>“Keeping tabs on me, Percy?” Pansy purred, returning his questioning glare. </p><p>“Merely keeping my ears open…Pansy.” Percy flicked his tongue over his teeth, hiding a sneer. But he widened his door for her, expecting her to follow. “The Undersecretary is busy, as you’ve noticed, so I suppose you’re my task for the time being.” </p><p>“Percy, really, you don’t have to call me that.” Hermione grumbled, back already turned. Pansy realized there was a familiarity between the two of them, guessing Percy had likely moved up positions with Hermione. </p><p>“Really, Hermione, it’s for her sake, though you deserve the respect of the title.” He clicked his tongue reproachfully, though shot the back of Hermione’s head a warm look. Before ushering Pansy inside his office, he waved his wand silently until a lamp on Hermione’s desk flamed, casting her office in soft shadows.</p><p>“Parkinson, how much did Zabini fill you in on what’s been going on at the Ministry?” Percy lowered himself into his chair, pushing the pads of his fingers together gently, tenting his hands. </p><p>“Very little.” Pansy tsked, looking down at her own fingers, the soft half-moons of her nails glinting with the polish she had applied earlier in the week, feigning disinterest. Working with Granger, perhaps, she could stomach. A Weasley was another matter, the worst of them at that. She recognized instant guilt at leaving her position in New York flare in her stomach, feeling utterly daft for thinking that in returning, all these years later, things might have been different for her. </p><p>“Shocking. Well.” Percy crossed his arms, irritated. He, too, had changed over the years. His hairline was an inch further back than she remembered, though he had maintained his ability to look down his rather long nose at her. His robes appeared firmly pressed, stiff, as if they had been charmed to never wrinkle. “As you’ve likely heard, Robards’ trial is next week.” He paused, waiting for Pansy’s nod. “It’s a rather high-profile case, and we’ve noticed, ah, perhaps heightened threats is the right word, here at the Ministry.” His voice lowered now, eyes darting towards the door, cautious. “Abbott fell ill, though not of old age. There are talks of a poisoning, though the DMLE won’t release the cause, officially. You can imagine, then, that our Aurors are working overtime, and as Head Auror Potter has only recently been promoted, it’s been, well, ah, stressful.” His hands splayed on the desk then, looking a bit perturbed, flustered at his own admittance that things had been rather bleak at the Ministry as of late. Pansy merely nodded again, waiting for him to carry on.</p><p>“You’ve been brought on to work closely with the Undersecretary. She needs, first and foremost, your protection. But I see here,” he glanced down at the Pansy’s file that had materialised in front of them, pointing at something Pansy couldn’t see, “that you worked for a few years in MACUSA’s investigative department, before working directly with Commissioner Tolliver. The Undersecretary’s role in the next week is demanding. She’s helping the Minister prepare for the trial, both of them will be giving testimony against Robards, and there’s hope that this might lead to the arrest of further Death Eaters who have evaded the Ministry all these years. The Undersecretary could use your eyes on the case and her notes for the trial, and undoubtedly with what comes after this. You’ll be answering exclusively to her, though of course, you and I will unfort—often—cross paths.” Percy caught himself, easing his lips back into what he likely thought of as an easy smile, though it appeared more of a grimace. </p><p>Pansy, dragging her eyes from the ceiling, forced a grin at him. “Doesn’t bother me a lick, Perce.” She watched his smile catch, little wrinkles forming in his smile lines. She wondered which of them would crack first, enjoying setting him on edge regardless. He huffed, pointing at his door expectedly. “Yes, certainly. You’ll be stationed in the Undersecretary’s office, by the way. I’m sure she’s transfigured you a desk already. Off you go.” He dismissed her readily, refusing to look up from the file in front of him. </p><p>- + -</p><p>Percy was right, Hermione had transfigured a corner desk for Pansy, the large office easily accommodating the extra workspace. She found herself seated there, warily, after her brusque introduction with Percy. Her thin briefcase laid flat against the rich polished wood, looking inconsequential. Hermione, seemingly as engrossed with her files as Percy had been, hadn’t acknowledged Pansy when she re-entered her office. Pansy crossed her legs, uncrossed them, glancing from her view of Hermione’s head of curls bent over her papers to the lining of books on the walls, the office overflowing with them. This was all a bit strange for her, this waiting about. Under Tolliver, her days had been gruelling, fast-paced, often in the field one day and piled under paperwork the next. It was what she had loved, the exhausting nature of it all. She loved falling into bed in the early hours of the morning, too tired to have unsettling dreams; she loved waking early, her body going through the motions, trained and disciplined. Waiting now for Hermione’s cues felt like being refused an itch, wanting to move, to do something, finding herself stilled. Finally, what seemed like an eternity later, Hermione glanced up.</p><p>“Parkinson, over here, will you? Take a look at his.” She motioned to the paper in her hand, waiting for Pansy to approach. Pansy obliged, the short click of her heels against the black tile, the sound muffled by the mountain of books. She leaned over Hermione’s desk, careful to avoid contact, eyes straining to see the paper. Hermione had a number of papers strewn in front of her, compounded by memos buzzing feet above her head now. Pansy pursed her lips, taking in what appeared to be transcripts of Robards’ questioning by the Aurors upon capture. Scanning it quickly, her eyes caught where the Aurors had likely slipped him Veritaserum by force, the transcript of his words suddenly increasingly. She shook her head mutely, irked at how quickly they had resorted to potions. </p><p>“Displeased with their tactics, Parkinson?” Hermione titled her head up towards Pansy, her face almost smug. “Not how they do things in New York?”</p><p>“Just seems like they rushed into it, perhaps.” Pansy muttered, sliding her gaze from the paper towards Hermione, unsettled by how closely she was regarding her. </p><p>“And this, Parkinson?” Hermione kept her gaze on Pansy’s face, her voice a whisper, intent, but her hand lowered to Pansy’s thigh, catching the beginning of her holster hidden just under her skirt. “Is this how they do things in New York? Hiding your wand under holsters?” Pansy’s eyes widened, darting down to Hermione’s hand, which fell back to her lap after grazing Pansy’s thighs. Her touch felt like a ghost, haunting. Pansy stopped herself from shuddering, unsure if she had imagined it. She jerked herself back though, away from Hermione’s desk, a safe distance.</p><p>“I’m not sure what you’re talking about, Granger.” Her voice came out soft, reedy and high. Her eyes found Percy’s door, nervous he might walk in at any moment, see her like this, caught off guard. She barely noticed Hermione silently stand, closing the space between them. Barely noticed it until her back bumped against a shelf of books. Until she felt their old, soft spines press into her skin, smelt the faint mold coming from their pages. Hermione was in front of her then. She stood a few inches above Pansy, almost the same height, though her face was imposing. Pansy stilled her breath, waited. Felt Hermione’s soft breath on her face.</p><p>“You.” Hermione hissed, her voice still low but accusatory—twisted with pain. Pansy half expected to feel a finger jab into her shoulder, was surprised when it didn’t. But Hermione’s look was undeniable, and Pansy felt herself reeling from the conflicting emotions reflected back at her. Pain, undoubtedly; anger too, and a wash of vulnerability before Hermione hardened her gaze. Pansy opened her lips to reply, but found her mouth dry, her throat emitting a low whine. Hermione’s nose brushed against hers, too close. After a beat, Hermione pulled back, exhaled loudly. Turning, she shook her head roughly. </p><p>“You.” Hermione repeated, barely glancing over her shoulder at Pansy. It came out with less vitriol but soaked in something else now. Something that sent rising panic through Pansy’s blood. Hermione’s shoulders were hunched inwards, protective. Hermione’s words tumbled out then, fast but punctuated with an air of disbelief. “You bloody left, Parkinson. You left. You told me you couldn’t bear to stay here, with me, and now this? I haven’t seen you, haven’t even bloody heard from you in almost a decade, and you stroll into my office just like this?” Hermione laughed, a raw noise that caught her in throat. “Of all the fucking days, now? And you’re telling me you didn’t even know you’d be working for me? Acting like this is all some odd series of events? Like we’re just supposed to be colleagues now, you sitting in a bloody desk across from me? Supposed to be protecting me?” Her tone was low still, gravelly, but filled with venom. Pansy felt it seep into her skin, closing her eyes at Hermione’s accusations. She didn’t, she hadn’t, she couldn’t have.</p><p>“Hermione, I-” Pansy choked, holding herself up. Felt a hot stinging behind her eyes, refusing to blink, to give in to the oncoming well. </p><p>“No, no no. You don’t get to do this, Pansy. You-,” Hermione broke, a wild laugh escaping her lips, masking a sob. She shook her head again, firmly. Her curls rustled against her cheek before she angrily pushed them behind her ears. “You need to leave.” Pansy regarded her quietly, mouth firmly shut. She took in Hermione’s deadly calm after she practically spat her name at her. Hermione’s fists were clenched tightly at her sides, still except for a quiver Pansy caught run along her lip. Pansy turned on her heel, at her desk in seconds. She grasped at her case, yanked down at her skirt where it had hitched on her holster, flung open Hermione’s door, not bothering to shut it behind her. Marching purposefully, she had to stop herself from racing down the hallway, hot tears threatening to push past her lids. She bit down onto her tongue to stop herself, tasting metal, until she reached the atrium. Almost blind now, she threw the floo powder into the first fireplace she stumbled into, a moan bubbling from her throat just as her body spun out of focus.</p><p>- + -</p><p>Pansy landed back at the Manor with a thud, wrists protesting under the sudden weight of holding up her shaking form from the ground. She felt untethered as she pushed herself up, skirt peppered with dust from the hearth. She tried to slow her breathing, feeling it snag in her throat. Her skin felt awash with the heat from the exchange, cold though she felt little drops of sweat forming against the nape of her neck, the dip of her lower back. Shivering, she hurried to the stairs, taking them two at a time. Pansy saw the glow coming from under Draco’s closed office door as she passed, doing her best to tread quietly, unsure if her ragged breathing was audible through the dense wood. When she reached her own rooms down the corridor, hands dragging lightly against the pale cream wallpaper, she stumbled into it. She could feel it then, dread quelling deep within her, bile threatening to climb her throat. She moved quickly, retching into the bin closest to the door, biting back a groan. </p><p>“Pans?” The voice sounded muffled, far away. </p><p>“Fine! I’m fine, Draco, just a bit ill!” She returned his call, hoping to stave off any questions. Unfortunately, Draco was already past the door of his office, striding quickly towards her room. He was wearing his Muggle business attire, though his sleeves were pushed up his forearms, two collar buttons undone casually. Pansy heard his incoming footsteps muted through his leather shoes, moving quietly against the polished wood of the floors. </p><p>“Merlin, Pansy, you look like you’ve just been fished from the Great Lake.” He surmised, eyes taking in her rumpled clothes, the sweat she was sure was now visible in places through her blouse. </p><p>She laughed, the noise sounding garbled, as she slumped onto her bed. She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, ignoring the red lipstick that smeared onto her skin. “Draco… Blaise didn’t tell me. I saw her—at the Ministry—I’m supposed to be working for her.” Pansy popped off her heels quickly, drawing her knees to her chin. Draco’s brow furrowed, and she watched as it clicked into place for him.</p><p>“Granger, you mean? You saw Granger? Pans, surely you realized you might run into her at the Ministry—” confusion alight on his features. </p><p>“No, you don’t understand,” she seethed, fingers rubbing at her nose. “She’s the new  <i>Undersecretary</i>, she’s replaced Abbott. I’m working  <i>for</i> her. And Blaise, that bloody bastard, practically offered me up to her as a sacrifice, didn’t even warn me on the way over. Didn’t even send a bloody owl!” Her hands were waiving in the air now, wild.</p><p>“Oh. Oh, I see. Pansy…what happened between the two of you, that was…Merlin, years ago.” Draco moved to sit beside her, hand tentative on her back. </p><p>“You didn’t see the way she looked at me.” Pansy breathed, eyes bolted to the floor. She felt unable to meet Draco’s gaze, not wanting to see the concern written there, the pity. “I thought…the way she accused me of leaving, like she never understood why I had to. I even thought, for a second, Merlin, that she was going to kiss me, but it was rage, Draco.” She chuckled nervously, feeling foolish and deserving of her humiliation at the same time. “I don’t think, since I left, she ever forgave me.” Tears, hot and demanding, dripped from her chin. Draco made a small noise in his throat, patted her back, at a loss. Pansy slipped her wand from its holster, about to spell the blinds closed across her bay windows. She noticed it then, a small barn owl waiting impatiently on the ledge, a letter between its beak. </p><p>“Looks like Percy Weasley a bit, doesn’t it?” Pansy nudged Draco, shifting his gaze to the window. “Did I mention Percy  <i>fucking </i>Weasley was there, working for her too?” Draco made a soft hmm, approaching the window. </p><p>“Yes, you two always did have a bit of dislike for one another, I remember.” Pushing the window up with one hand, Draco reached through and gently plucked the letter from the owl. “Did you want me to read it or were you going to?”</p><p>“You read it, unless it’s about today, then don’t read it.” Pansy groaned, letting herself fall back onto the bed with a small exhale. Her hair fanned around her in a triangle, sticking to the back of her neck. </p><p>“It’s from Zabi-” Draco unsealed it with a finger, noting the signature.</p><p>“Don’t read it! Gods, I don’t want to know what--”</p><p>“He says he caught sight of you floo’ing out of the Ministry, and Percy filled him in that you had to leave suddenly, no reason given. Something about being sorry for not warning you sooner, something something not angry just disappointed, etcetera, but will you meet him at the Three Broomsticks at 7?” Draco pushed past her objections, eyes scanning through the letter quickly. </p><p>Pansy turned an eye on him, neck craning up to watch him. “Would you go with me? Are you even allowed, after Madam Rosmerta…”</p><p>Draco waved his hand in frustration, cutting her off. “Yes, yes, I’ll go. I worked things out with her a few years back. I’m certainly not a regular patron, but it’s obvious from Zabini’s letter he wants me there also.” </p><p>Pansy chuckled, dropping her head back. “Always sure to not miss out on the gossip, right Draco? Coming to support me or watch me squirm?” </p><p>“The latter.” Draco breathed, having moved to hover above her on the bed, one foot on the floor, the other knee propped against the edge of the mattress, palms flat and framing her shoulders. Pansy’s breath caught, eyes wide as he smiled down at her. A vision, Pansy thought. The light framed the back of his hair, caught its edges, glowed. </p><p>“And will you lend a bit of support now?” Pansy huffed, caught her bottom lip between her teeth. She reached a hand out to him and laced it around his neck. Rolling his eyes, Draco pushed off the bed, letting her hand fall back. “As much as I’d love to, Pans, some of us do have to actually work today. We don’t all get the dramatic luxury of storming out.” </p><p>“Alright, a little too soon, but sure.” She let her hands settle onto her stomach and threaded her fingers together. “Tosser.” She grumbled, knowing her cheeks would have that revealing flush, betraying her as they often did. Draco made a noncommittal noise before letting himself out of her room, closing the door behind him with a click. He endlessly frustrated her; the line they walked between friends and something else, the razor’s edge Draco himself balanced on, one moment soft and kind, the other sharp and a little cruel. She knew, based upon the feeling that would sometimes camp out in the back of her thoughts, that it was perhaps time to find her own flat. But glancing out her windows again, onto the back gardens of the Manor, she felt her heart twist painfully. Mist had descended upon the top leaves of the large oaks lining the main path, lining the branches like thick gauze. The little trimmed hedges that seemed to stretch for miles had become a familiar sight in the past months, the gardens a soothing salve to the blister that leaving New York had been. She had spent hours, when she first arrived, sitting quietly among the shaded delphiniums, gently tending to new spring blooms. Veter, Draco’s house-elf, had grumbled his protests when she tried to help, eventually caving when she nearly pleaded with him. He still muttered obscenities when he caught her pluck a white geranium or two from a bush, and she did notice how he sometimes checked up on her gardening duties after she had finished them. He had, however, begun to point out the height of the hollyhocks to her, and managed a funny little smile when she asked him about how the lavender was coming along. After asking Draco about the gardens, he admitted that Narcissa had breathed new life into them after they received the Manor back from the Ministry. It had been seized during the war, held, searched, until it was finally turned back over to Narcissa and Draco, Lucius already a permanent fixture at Azkaban at that time. He remained there, Pansy surmised, all these years later. Draco had mentioned his mother rarely came to the Manor now. She spent her days in France at one of their other properties, and Pansy could think of a hundred reasons why she’d stay away, why the memories had overtaken her. Forced her out of her home. Pansy had learned quickly not to ask Draco about his parents, an uneasy truce maintained between them where they rarely talked of the past. But the idea of leaving here too, after finally settling back in, felt like another loss she wasn’t prepared to make just yet. </p><p>“Is Miss Parkinson needing anything?” Pansy heard a small pop in the corner of her room, shaking her out of the lull she had sank into. </p><p>“Oh, Veter, hi. Actually, tea would be lovely. Jasmine, please.” She sat up, slightly embarrassed at her current state. She took in the sight of him, his little gnarled hands snapping before a saucer appeared in his grasp. He rustled over to her bedside, placing the tea on her nightstand. His eyes peered at her still, unmoving even after she gingerly took the cup into her hands. It had just a dash of milk in it, leaving the surface opaque. His large ears waggled in disapproval, flattening his neatly ironed cloth against his small frame. He opened his mouth to speak, closed it, opened it again. “And, perhaps a bath, Miss?” At that, he disappeared with a dull pop, and Pansy scoffed at his boldness and his ability to boss her around. Affection welling at her throat and tea in hand, she padded towards the bathroom. She cringed at the sight of herself. It had been a while since she had felt this…uneasy, after getting particularly good at forcing down uncomfortable emotions that threatened to bubble over. Her nearly black hair was ruffled on one side, lipstick still streaking part of her cheek. Though the sweat had dried on her lower back and at the nape of her neck, it had made her blouse stick to her skin at random. Turning away from the mirror with a dissatisfied grunt, she turned the taps to the bath on and waited. Moments later, after sinking deliciously into the bath, steam clouding her face, she felt the weight of the day buoyed by the water. </p><p>“Three Broomsticks then,” she sighed to the ceiling, having dropped her head back against the tile. “Draco. Blaise. 7pm, fine.”</p>
