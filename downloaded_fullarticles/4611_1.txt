          <div class="userstuff"><p>A soft knock upon the Potions Master’s open door broke the evening’s silence for a brief moment.</p><p>“Is this something to challenge this year’s new students with, Horace? A love potion, perhaps, or could it be a more pleasant-tasting replacement for Skele-Gro?”</p><p>Albus Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled as he entered the room and peered down into a large solid gold cauldron that stood nearby. In the depths of the cauldron simmered a thick and slightly bubbly mixture with a treacle-like texture; wisps of a caramel and cinnamon-scented smoke arose from the concoction, and its colour gradually changed from a light rosy pink to a deep crimson as it slowly and merrily came to a boil over a magical flame.</p><p>Horace Slughorn looked up from the comfortable armchair where he was relaxing, obviously glad to see his visitor, and gestured for Dumbledore to take a seat opposite him before giving his wand a flick in the direction of the golden vessel to lower the fire that burned beneath it.</p><p>“Nothing so exciting, I’m afraid, Albus,” Slughorn replied calmly, his moustache twitching as his lips quirked upwards in a contented smile. “This is merely a little experiment of my own. It’s home-made confectionery; you might like to think of it as a variation on Turkish delight, with a few added innovations I’ve come up with myself. I felt like a different kind of treat from my customary crystallised pineapple or any of the Honeydukes sweets.”</p><p>Slughorn briefly rose from his chair and padded over to the cauldron, studying its contents with pursed lips and a furrowed brow for a few minutes before reaching for several glass jars, one after another, from a shelf above and adding what seemed to be pinches of various exotic spices as well as a dash each of rose and vanilla essences.</p><p>“I had hoped to have it ready by tonight, so that we could enjoy some during our little tête-à-tête,” Slughorn continued with a tiny sigh. “However, that has proved to be rather too ambitious an undertaking, even for me. It’s a more complex little recipe than I expected it to be! So, will some nice chocolate suffice for the time being instead?”</p><p>He moved over to a chest of drawers and removed, with a small yet covertly dramatic flourish, a box of liqueur truffles that soon had Albus’s eyes sparkling all over again.</p><p>“Horace – you remembered!” Dumbledore exclaimed delightedly as Slughorn fetched a decanter and a couple of crystal goblets, pouring some deliciously sweet dessert wine to go with the chocolates.</p><p>“How could I possibly forget? We had these on our very first night together, after all! And I bought them from the exact same place, too!” Slughorn replied, more than a little smugly, as he handed one of the glasses to his companion and then raised the other in a toast. “Here’s to sweet reunions!”</p><p>“I’ll gladly drink to that,” said Dumbledore, and lifted his goblet in return.</p><p>Slughorn resumed his seat, and both men sipped their wine appreciatively for a little while, waiting for just the right moment to begin sampling the chocolate. With a feeling of tenderness and pleasure spreading warmly through his chest, Dumbledore stood and walked over to Slughorn, bending to press a gentle kiss upon his lips.</p><p>“I’m so happy to have you back at Hogwarts at last, Horace,” he whispered.</p></div>
