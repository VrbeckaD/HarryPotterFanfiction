    <p>Louis has been to Kings Cross many times.</p>
<p>He's frequented muggle London and Manchester and even gone to Italy once or twice.</p>
<p>This time is different though.</p>
<p>He's finally going to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>His dad had tried so hard to get him into school, even with his condition, and he's made it.</p>
<p>Almost.</p>
<p>He's making his way onto the train.</p>
<p>He'd had to go by himself because his dad couldn't get off of work.</p>
<p>It was okay, though. Danny had made him his favourite breakfast and kissed him on the head, telling him he was going to do amazing.</p>
<p>Louis knew that they'd send owls back and forth every day, so it was okay.</p>
<p>But he's nervous.</p>
<p>He's always been more reserved, and he doesn't know who he's going to sit by.</p>
<p>He lets out a breath of relief as he reaches an empty car, and with minimal struggle, hoists his big duffle in the overhead area.</p>
<p>He brought a few extra books with him so he won't be bored.</p>
<p>He lets out a little sigh of relief as the train finally starts moving, silently thanking the Powers That Be that his car stays empty.</p>
<p>He's always been a bit of a lone wolf (no pun intended), and he didn't have many friends at home.</p>
<p>He doesn't mind, though. He prefers the company of himself or his books.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, he takes one out of his book bag, puts his glasses on, and sets off to another world far away.</p>
<p>He's jolted out of his thoughts when he hears a loud banging on the glass of his car before the door opens.</p>
<p>There's a boy a bit taller than him, a mop of curly hair on his head stumbling into the nearly empty car. "Oops!" he says loudly, tripping over his feet a bit.</p>
<p>Louis furrows his eyebrows and can't help the little laugh that falls from his lips. "Uh, hi."</p>
<p>"Hi!" Curly smiles wide and he's got these adorable dimples and bright green eyes. "Can I sit here? I was late and everywhere else is full."</p>
<p>Louis blinks at the mysterious boy before nodding his head slowly. Louis is many things, but a jerk isn't one of them. "M'just reading."</p>
<p>"Ooh, what are you reading?" Curly asks, green eyes wide as he sits on the bench across from Louis.</p>
<p>"Erm, s'a muggle book," Louis ducks his head. He's not sure how the boy will react. His father had warned him that other wizards might not be as accepting of muggle things. "S'called <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.</em> Have you heard of it?"</p>
<p>Curly's eyes go wide and he shakes his head. "Chocolate factory? That sounds amazing!" He gasps, hopping over to sit next to Louis.</p>
<p>Louis nods, smiling a bit shyly. "Yeah, it's one of my favourites," he hums, sitting up and taking his glasses off. "It's about a kid who loves chocolate and this man, Willy Wonka, owns a candy factory and he gives away golden tickets to come visit him."</p>
<p>"Wicked." Curly breathes, carefully reaching out to grab the book. "Can I read some of it?"</p>
<p>Louis nods, smiling. Usually he wouldn't let people touch his things, but this boy seems to be gentle, respectful.</p>
<p>"<em>Of course they're real people. They're Oompa-Loompas...Imported direct from Loompaland...And oh what a terrible country it is! Nothing but thick jungles infested by the most dangerous beasts in the world - hornswogglers and snozzwangers and those terrible wicked whangdoodles. A whangdoodle would eat ten Oompa-Loompas for breakfast and come galloping back for a second helping</em>." Curly reads aloud and his eyebrows furrow. "Whoa... is this where muggles live?" He asks curiously, eyes wide as he looks at Louis. "I didn't know there were creatures like this in the muggle world."</p>
<p>Louis covers his mouth to suppress his giggles and he shakes his head. "No, no. We definitely don't have creatures. It's fake. It's all made up. It's a fairytale. Like <em>Babbity Rabbity and the Cackling Stump</em>."</p>
<p>Curly nods his head, brushing his fingers over the worn pages of Louis' book. "Wicked," he breathes. "What's your name?" he asks politely. "I'm Harry. Harry Styles."</p>
<p>Styles. Louis knows that name from somewhere, but he just can't place it.</p>
<p>"Louis. Louis Tomlinson."</p>
<p>"Louis Tomlinson." Harry Styles echoes with a smile. "I like it," he decides. "Very posh."</p>
<p>Louis laughs and shrugs. "I guess. My dad lived in France for a little while before he met my mum and he said he always liked the name Louis."</p>
<p>"I love France," Harry says mindlessly, smiling. "We used to go there a lot when I was little."</p>
<p>Louis smiles at Harry.</p>
<p>Harry Styles has some sort of infectious energy about him.</p>
<p>Louis feels... happy around him.</p>
<p>He should feel nervous, uncomfortable around this stranger.</p>
<p>But he feels like he's known him all this life, and trusts Harry.</p>
<p>"So what house you hoping to be in?" Harry's voice asks after about an hour of silence.</p>
<p>Louis startles from looking out the window at the gorgeous scenery.</p>
<p>He furrows his eyebrows, thinking for a little bit.</p>
<p>"I think I'd like to be in Gryffindor. My dad says I'm really brave..." Louis is a bit shy as he says this, cheeks turning red.</p>
<p>Harry's watching him with a soft smile on his lips. "I'd like to be in Gryffindor too. My whole family are a bunch of Slytherins, and I just don't agree with them." he wrinkles his nose. "They suck and are really mean to a lot of people."</p>
<p>Louis frowns, getting up to sit next to Harry. "I'm really sorry." he says quietly, resting a hand on Harry's leg. "My dad has to deal with a lot of mean people at work."</p>
<p>Harry gives Louis another smile. "It'd be cool to prove them wrong, you know? That you can be pure blood and be nice too."</p>
<p>Louis can't help but smile. His dad had always told him that he was wise beyond his years, and he thinks Harry is too. "Well I think you're really nice."</p>
<p>Harry sets his hand on top of Louis' and gives it a squeeze. "Thanks." he hums. "My mum and dad are dumb."</p>
<p>Louis can't help the laugh that escapes him and he shakes his head. "Well, my dad's really cool, so he can be your dad too."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Lou. That'd be sick." Harry smiles so wide and genuine at Louis and Louis' heart flutters.</p>
<p>He's never known boys to be pretty, only girls, but he thinks Harry's pretty. Prettier than any girl he's ever seen.</p>
<p>Louis smiles back and turns his hand over so he's holding Harry's. "No one deserves to be sad. Especially at home."</p>
<p>Louis knows that his dad is sad.</p>
<p>Ever since his mum died and Louis got changed, it's been hard. He knows that there's something else going on, but he knows not to pry. He doesn't want his dad to be mad at him.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna sleep, okay, Lou?" Harry asks softly, green eyes fluttering as he rests his head on Louis' shoulder.</p>
<p>Louis just nods, smiling. "D'you wanna lay down?" he asks quietly. "I can move..."</p>
<p>"No." Harry says quickly. "Wanna lay down, but..." his cheeks turn a little pink. "But I want you to stay."</p>
<p>Louis watches as Harry situates himself so he's laying on the seat, his head resting in his lap.</p>
<p>Louis smiles softly down at Harry. "Goodnight." he whispers. "I'll wake you up when the train gets here."</p>
<p>Harry just mumbles, grabbing Louis' hand and situating it in his hair.</p>
<p>Louis bites his lip to suppress a little 'aww' as he brushes his fingers absently through Harry's thick curls, blunt fingernails scratching lightly at his scalp.</p>
<p>He thinks that Harry's something special. He knows that Harry's going to do well in school.</p>
<p>He's pure of heart, and Louis knows that can get a person far at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>He lets out a little sigh, resting his head against the back of the seat and closes his eyes.</p>
<p>There's a few hours of the train ride left, and he supposes he should catch some shut eye.</p>
<p>He knows he's not going to sleep well in the dormitories tonight.</p>
<p>He always has a tough time sleeping in unfamiliar beds.</p>
<p>Besides, the week before the full moon is always hard. He's always restless, and he's predicting he's not going to sleep at all for the next week.</p>
<p>Harry makes a noise in his sleep, snuffling as he wraps an arm around Louis' thin waist, nuzzling his face into his tummy.</p>
<p>Louis can't help but smile at this soft, warm boy in his arms, and maybe he can do this. Maybe school won't be so bad.</p>
