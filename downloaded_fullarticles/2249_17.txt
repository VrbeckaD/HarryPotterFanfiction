    <p>"Ismelda, you can't use a love potion on Barnaby. It's wrong. You should want him to love you by his own free will," Sapphire urged. "That potion won't last forever, and there's a chance he might resent you once it wears off," she continued, her eyes focusing on the pink tinted bottle Ismelda held in her hand.</p><p>Ismelda's fingers clinched the bottle in her hand as she weighed the pros and cons of her decision. With a defeated sigh, she made her choice.</p><p>"As much as I hate to admit it, you're right, Phillips," Ismelda confessed as her grip on the bottle loosened.</p><p>"Whew," the girls heard from around the corner as they turned to find Barnaby approaching them.</p><p>"Thanks for talking Ismelda out of using that Love Potion on me, Sapphire," he grinned. "That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me, or at least in the top ten."</p><p>Sapphire's cheeks tinted a slight shade of pink at the awkward situation. Barnaby had clearly overheard their conversation concerning the love potion, but yet he didn't seemed to be too bothered by the situation.</p><p>"You're always doing nice things for me...and thinking of me...and helping me understand big words," he noted aloud, more to himself rather than either girl in front of him.</p><p>"I really like that," he smiled as he looked back to Sapphire, "I really like you..." he finished, smoothly.</p><p>Sapphire's heart rate quickened as the already slight flush of her cheeks burned hotter. She never admitted it to anyone, but ever since their first drink together at The Three Broomsticks she had started to develop a soft spot in her heart for the Slytherin boy. He had shared such personal details about his life, and despite how terrible he was treated at home, he still managed to have a big heart.</p><p>"Hello? I'm still here," Ismelda fumed, but Barnaby never took his eyes off Sapphire's.</p><p>"That's okay, Sapphire. We can continue this another time."</p>
<hr/><p>The next afternoon, Sapphire still had not spoken to Barnaby about the previous day's events. Class had just finished when Ismelda appeared, startling Sapphire in the process.</p><p>"Ismelda," Sapphire gasped as she took a slight step back. "I swear, I had no idea that-"</p><p>"It's fine, Phillips," Ismelda interrupted, "Barnaby and I spent the entire afternoon talking and I realized you were right. If I would have used that potion on him then he probably wouldn't want anything to do with me after it wore off."</p><p>Sapphire released a sigh of relief. "I'm glad," she smiled. Ismelda shrugged.</p><p>"Plus, I realized he was too soft for me when he was <em>showering</em> you with compliments," she rolled her eyes. The Hufflepuff shrank back in response causing Ismelda to narrow her eyes in suspicion.</p><p>"Tell me, Phillips," the Slytherin girl began, a devilish smirk forming across her lips, "do <em>you</em>, perhaps, fancy Barnaby?"</p><p>Sapphire quickly shifted her line of sight to avoid Ismelda's knowing gaze.</p><p>"I...uh...well..." she stammered nervously. The Slytherin's smirk grew into a confident grin.</p><p>"That's what I thought. See ya 'round, Phillips. And...thanks," Ismelda mumbled out her last word before turning and making her way out of the classroom.</p>
<hr/><p>That evening at dinner, conversations ran rapid due to Dumbledore's announcement of the Celestial Ball.</p><p>"Yes, Mr. Lee?" Dumbledore called from the Headmaster's spot in front of the Great Hall. Sapphire looked across the room to the Slytherin table in time to see Barnaby lower his hand.</p><p>"Can I bring a date to the ball? A person, not the fruit," he clarified, causing some students to snicker. A bright smile formed across Dumbledore's face.</p><p>"Why, yes. Every student may bring a guest if they so choose." Subconsciously, the corners of Sapphire's lips turned upward at the thought of Barnaby possibly asking her to the ball.</p><p>From beside her, Penny squealed with delight, distracting Sapphire from her thoughts.</p><p>"Sapphire, do you think I could have a chance at being the head of the decorating committee?" Penny asked hopefully. Sapphire tilted her head to the side and gently rested her hand across Penny's forearm.</p><p>"Penny, you can do anything you set your mind to," she answered, truthfully. The smile on Penny's face widened.</p><p>"I know how busy you are, but do you think you could help me?" she asked. This had been the happiest Sapphire saw her friend since Beatrice had disappeared into the portrait on the wall. She couldn't let her friend down.</p><p>"Of course I'll help you, Penny. This will be the most beautiful ball Hogwarts has ever seen!" she replied confidently.</p>
