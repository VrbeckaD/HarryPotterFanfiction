    <p>I didn't want to be known as the BWL because of the fact:</p><p>One, I detest being in the fame and spotlight.</p><p>Second, I hate being an orphan and living with my hating relatives.</p><p>Three, my last reason is I didn't want to fight in this war.</p><p>But then again, when has my needs or wants ever come true.</p><p>The answer being never, nothing I wished for ever came true in this magical world that seems to depend on a boy who didn't even know that magic was real, better yet had a hidden world that was in plain sight.</p><p>Literally.</p><p>Picking up Dudley's old barely used school notebook, the sharp tipped pencil and blue ink pen I opened to a blank page and started to write the letter I've wanted to write since Voldemort returned and because I wanted out. Plain and simple.</p><p>
  <em> <strong>Dear Voldemort aka Tom Riddle,</strong> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <strong>I know that you are plotting ways to find and kill me. I wanted to tell you that if you want to know where I am just responded back to this letter and just to make sure you can trust this letter here is an oath.</strong> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <strong>I, Harrison James Potter, at this moment swear that this letter is authentic. I swear in my magic so mote I swear so mote it be. </strong> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <strong>The reason is straightforward: I never wanted to be in this war or the fame that came with it either. I hate how I'm treated in both the muggle and magical world. </strong> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <strong>Hated in one and a liar in the other. So please kill me, I ask you because in this life I have nothing or one to live for and no hope to win against you either. </strong> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <strong>I know about your Horcruxes and also wanted to inform you that I have given them to the goblins in a secret account to be given to you using either name addressed in the letter to you.</strong> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <strong>Don't worry, they don't know or won't let Dumbledore know or anyone that isn't you given it because you have my blood on you and you can only indeed access the account.</strong> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <strong>p.s. I think your ideas and beliefs are what the magical definitely needs in it. </strong> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <strong>Blood Signed Harry Potter.</strong> </em>
</p><p>I finished the letter signing the bottom part of my blood, so the dark lord knows everything written is not a lie. Harry then folded it neatly and called for Dobby.</p><p>"<em>DOBBY</em>" he whispered and watched as Dobby appeared in the small unimpressive and almost covered in brown dried blood everywhere looking in the bedroom. The wide-eyed looking ex-house elf came into the bedroom with a barely audible pop "The great Harry Potter has called for Dobby?!" he said in an excited tone of voice.</p><p><em>"shhh please be quiet Dobby, I need you to deliver this letter to Voldemort and before you say anything just listen to this message is very very important it is absolutely imperative that he receives this, so I'm begging you to do this. For me. please."</em> I say in a pleading voice that you can practically hear the desperate and stubborn tone sounding in my pitch.</p><p>I could see Dobby reluctantly begin to submit to my request as he understood that what was written in this letter could be the key to my life or my death either option didn't really bother me.</p><p>Dobby grasped the letter from an outstretched hand and disappeared quietly with one last forlorn look in my direction before turning and popping away to do what I practically begged Dobby to do.</p><p>I then began writing again this time though this was not a letter an untold truth that I had never dared to tell anyone or show anyone but a group of deeply trusted people who I made swear an oath on their magic to keep quiet about unless given permission in any way or form to tell.</p><p>
  <strong>"I Harrison James Potter am writing to tell you about my life from my side of things seeing as no one bothered to ask me before doing anything they wanted to about my so-called important life. </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>I was left on the doorstep of my relative's stairs at night on one November night, and I was taken in and endured worse than a house elf that seemed to be treated. </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>understand that I was not given an actual room as I was deemed not worthy of deserving a real bedroom to live in, so the 11 years of my life I lived in the cupboard under the stairs in the first letter I received was actually named that exact title.</strong>
</p><p>
  <em> <strong>TO POTTER, HARRY JAMES</strong> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <strong>NUMBER 4, PRIVET DRIVE</strong> </em>
</p><p>
  <em> <strong>THE CUPBOARD UNDER THE STAIRS.</strong> </em>
</p><p>
  <strong>I first thought it was a joke but then how would anyone but my relatives know that I was living in the cupboard under the stairs. To put how bad my life has been, I will be frank and honest and say that I have been:</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>both mentally and verbally</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>That's the simplest way to phrase it. </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>I was first made to do the housework as soon as I could walk and then raped from the age of 5 years old.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Because, as my uncle put it so beautiful to me, Vernon said, "Freaks need to learn how to earn their keep in this house seeing as this and cleaning is all you're ever going to be good for in you're a sad excuse for an unwanted life."</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Oh boy and did I learn, not only did he use me but he let others pay to "play" with me and with every time it happened the more accustomed I grew to the pain. My innocence was taken from me and from then on it just seemed to get worse. </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>When I first found out that the fact that I could change my features and hair and blah blah weren't unnatural and freakish about me was because of magic, as Hagrid, half-giant, told me. I couldn't believe it that there was a way out of this hellhole that people call a family more like a house of undursleyish hating life things. </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>That house was not and never would have been my home I'd have instead been murdered or committed my own suicide before I called this house any of my abusive and painful looking hell. </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Then Hagrid told me the truth, and I found out that instead of being able to make friends because they wanted to become my friends by choice and not by wanting the fame that came with being my friend entailed showed it ugly looking head and stared at that. ME. </strong>
</p><p>
  <em> <strong>whipped, raped, beaten, verbally abused, gangbanged, overworked, neglectful, uncared, and more</strong> </em>
</p><p>
  <strong>That I suddenly had a whole bunch of expectations thrust upon me didn't help me at all, and everything seemed to go downhill I have no regrets about everything that happened, but I do wish things happened differently. </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>The only real thing that I would change in my life is the fact that I never told my crushes how I felt about them.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Lastly that I didn't listen to the sorting hat and let him place me in Slytherin like I was supposed to go too at Hogwarts maybe then I could have been happier and possibly even saved.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Now I don't want anyone or anything nor do I want to be saved or rescued at all in this world if I were to be dead anytime soon or be in a dying state.</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>I pray that anyone should read this letter so I don't have one or more purposes to live for so there's no point in saving me when I want to die."</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>That's all I have to write for now from </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Yours truly, </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>HJP the boy who wished he wasn't the one who lived in this life.</strong>
</p><p>I put the notebook down and ripped out the letter neatly folding in half before a slam could be heard coming from the front door downstairs and I paled because that could only mean one thing.</p><p>I was going to be punished severly because something bad happened to Vernon at work today, or because Dudley or Aunt Petunia told him that I did something wrong or didn't do it at all.</p><p>I prayed that it wasn't any of those and that he just accidentally slammed the door, closing it a bit too hard and it caused it to slam loudly.</p><p>But the feeling that I was wrong just grew in my stomach and I knew when I heard the telltale of creaking on the stairway coming up towards the locked door that I knew today was not going to end very well for me or my body.</p><p>TBC.</p><p>This is my first Harry Potter fanfiction ideas, and feedback is also appreciated if anyone who has experience wants to help be my beta that would be truly appreciated by me just send me an email either by my PM or my gmail which begins macosta1009 and then so till next time.</p><p>Updates may not come at a set time so bare with me please.</p>
