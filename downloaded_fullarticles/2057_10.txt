His body was only half turned towards Theseus, as if he was ready to bolt at any second.</p><p> “Why reject the deal? This way you can work against Grindelwald and travel, as well.”</p><p>Making Newt join the ministry was the best idea he could come up with. It would enable him to keep Newt close and, at the same time, help Newt with his travel ban. Having Newt closer to him might outweigh his good intentions just a tiny bit, though.</p><p>“You know I have no interest in being an auror, or worse, having a desk job.” Newt looked up at him briefly, an accusing glint in his eye. “And killing Credence isn’t the answer. He’s just a lost boy.”</p><p>Theseus sighed and ran a hand through his hair.</p><p>“I know that, it’s just,” Theseus paused, frustrated. “I want to know that you are safe. After I heard what happened in New York, I just wish I’d been there to help you. If you work for the ministry, then…” He made a gesture with his hand. “And I’d rather see you doing this than Grimmson. You think I like the idea of him taking this job any more than you?”</p><p>Newt’s shoulders released their tension visibly. He gave a little smile. “You know I am capable of taking care of myself.” Then he looked at the ground. “I still can’t do this. I’m not good with people.”</p><p>“I know you are. I just wish you’d lean on me sometimes, too. I know I could have been there for you more, after mum died. I’ve always been busy with work, but Leta and I would appreciate it, if you can make time and come over for dinner. I haven’t properly spent time with you in so long.” The <em>I missed you</em> went unsaid. He’d like to know Newt was aware that it was implied but knowing the picture his brother had of him, that might not be the case.</p><p>The slight grimace at the mention of Leta’s name didn’t go unnoticed to Theseus’s sharp eyes. There was an unspoken of tension between them since Newt got the news of their engagement, but Theseus wished to discuss the situation with Newt in private. What he had to say on that topic was no one’s business but theirs.</p><p>“I’ll try to make time,” Newt said with little conviction.</p><p>They both knew it was a lie. Theseus sighed.</p><p>“I know this isn’t all about Leta. You’ve been this way before I met her, always busy when I try to talk to you.”</p><p>Newt looked at the ground.</p><p>“It's not like that…” He murmured.</p><p>Theseus knew there wasn’t more to be said, as he noticed the telltale signs of Newt clamming up. Instead of prodding further, he opened his arms to envelop Newt in a firm hug.</p><p>“Come here,” he said.</p><p> The discussion with the ministers was momentarily forgotten, making place for a fond smile. It always made Theseus happy to see his brother; to spend time with him, no matter how brief.</p><p>He wasn’t getting hugged in return, but Newt tolerating the display of affection had to be enough for the moment. He inhaled Newt’s scent and committed it to his memory, seeing as it might be a while until he could savour it again. Not often was he presented with the opportunity to get so close to his brother, with Newt’s constant travels and Theseus’ numerous work commitments.</p><p>Newt smelled a little like fresh earth and some fragrant flowers. It must be some exotic species he had found on one of his travels, that he now kept in his suitcase. A scent truly befitting of his brother, who loved spending time with creatures and outdoors. Theseus had heard tales of the whole world of its own that Newt had created in his suitcase, but he’d never seen it for himself. Shamefully, he had to admit, that he never showed much interest in his brother’s pursuits. When the situation with the obscurus would be under control, he would make time to properly get reacquainted with his brother. After all, Leta wasn’t the only one who would like to spend more time with Newt.</p><p>“They’re watching you,” he whispered into Newt’s ear, his lips almost touching it.</p><p>He could feel the heat radiating from Newt’s body and wished to just move a tiny bit closer, to feel the skin of Newt’s earlobe on his lips. But then the moment was gone, and he let go of his brother.</p><p>When he released Newt from the hug, he said, “You will have to pick a side. Grindelwald’s power is rising.”</p><p>“I don’t do sides.” Newt looked at him, almost disappointed, and swiftly walked away.</p><p>Theseus shoved his hands in his pockets and furrowed his eyebrows, making his way back to his office. No matter what he did to get closer to Newt or to try and help him, it seemed all he ever did was to push him away. Theseus was a man well-liked by his peers and superiors, that much he knew, and he never quite seemed to grasp what made Newt dislike him so. He slammed the door to his office shut and punched the wall with his right fist. Then he sat down at his desk and started doing paperwork. His emotions and thoughts could wait until he was done.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
