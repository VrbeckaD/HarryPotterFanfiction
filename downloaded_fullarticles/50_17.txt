  <u>
    <span>9 Weeks</span>
  </u>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Good morning, Ms. Granger.” Hermione waved at the secretary to the Department Head and Deputy Head. Abigail Fawley was ten years older than her and knew the ins and outs of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures better than anyone. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione stopped in front of Fawley’s desk. “Any mail for me?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fawley grimaced slightly. “Quite a few notes for you, Ms. Granger,” she handed over a stack of letters, “and Mr. Sterling wanted to make sure you remembered the time for this morning’s meeting.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione took the proffered letters. “10 a.m?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fawley nodded. “That’s right.” She scooped up from files on her desk and organized them in a neat stack. “Would you like me to call some tea?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione shook her head. “That’s quite alright. I’ll be in my office, Mrs. Fawley.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She walked past the desk and entered the alcove that housed her office, the House Elf Liaison Office, and two other offices of her colleagues Timothy Ainsworth, Beast Division and Centaur Liaison, and Lauren Hayashi, Spirit Division and Goblin Liaison. Daphne Greengrass’ office, the Office of Misinformation was closer to the department and deputy head. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She pushed open her door and walked around her desk, tapping the fake windows with her wand, opening them up to a false image of the London skyline. She squinted as her dark office brightened. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She set her tote bag and wand down and finally began filing through her letters. Two applications for house elf placement, a note from Ainsworth on the intra-department meeting taking place that afternoon. A note from Sterling on the agenda for the morning meeting. Then, she came across an envelope with a dragon colored on the front. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She opened it and found the official invitation to Teddy’s seventh birthday. They already knew she was going, but six-year-old Teddy (almost seven - as he frequently reminded everyone) wanted to send out invites to his birthday party. She smiled at the drawing, deciding to pin it up on her corkboard. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione finally settled down in her chair and began getting her files and paperwork ready for her first meeting of the day. Mr. Sterling, the deputy head, wanted constant updates on their work toward comprehensive werewolf legislation. Madam Kane, the department head, sat in on these meetings frequently, especially since they were in the works of overhauling a law previously pushed through this very department. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She organized the current draft she was working on - decriminalization and medical assistance - and then double-checked her schedule to make sure she was still available for the afternoon meeting. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Knock, knock.” Timothy Ainsworth stood in the doorway of her office. His sandy blond hair shown in the morning light, but he narrowed his eyes at the window with disdain. “You still free for 2 p.m.?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, I just checked.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Good. Best part, Greengrass will be there. You know what that means?” He waggled his eyebrows, his previous sour mood gone. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Donuts?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What? No. She’s bringing her ‘suggestion box’ with her.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione and Ainsworth shared a laugh. Daphne frequently placed on their intra-department meeting agenda, plausible explanations for magical happenings in the muggle world. Hermione leaned forward. “Best coverup suggestion gets donuts.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He grinned. “You’re on. What’s up with you and donuts?” He stepped out into the hallway and began walking toward his office. “I want a chocolate one with sprinkles!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She chuckled and got to work preparing the house-elf placement applications she received. She needed to reach out and schedule interviews for the individuals or families requesting a house-elf and gather the necessary reading material for those who pass muster. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She was proud of her work with house-elves. Years ago, she realized that attempting to free house-elves without their consent was the wrong way to go about things. Instead, with comprehensive house-elf protection laws in place, the department she works in can regulate and properly inform people on how to treat their house-elves while also punishing those who cause them harm. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She still disliked the lifelong servitude house-elves found themselves in, but this way she could ensure they were treated properly and with dignity. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Before she knew it, it was time to head to her first meeting of the day. She grabbed the file containing her drafts for the werewolf legislation. She pushed her chair back and stood. She gasped, clutching the edge of her desk, and feeling a wave of dizziness course through her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She grimaced. “That was weird.” </span>
</p>
<p align="center"><span>#</span> <span>#</span> <span>#</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Harry kicked open his office door, starling the occupant already settled inside. “Sorry, Neville.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Neville glared at him slightly. “What’s going on with you? Did Ron already get under your skin?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry scoffed. “I haven’t even seen him yet.” He dropped the stack of files he was holding onto his desk. “My arms were full.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, that’s the excuse this time.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m not angry at anyone,” Harry defended, “right now.” He picked up the first file, flipping it open and skimming over the words. He and Neville were tasked with going over past unsolved cases to find potential connections or leads for their current case - finding and apprehending Kenneth Southgate, a serial burglar and murderer. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’ve got a meeting with Robards in twenty,” Neville said, “and a training session after lunch.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry nodded. “Got it.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did you hear? The Mentor program is starting up again?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is it that time already?” Harry dropped down into his chair, thinking back to his own time in the program. Newly recruited Aurors who had passed their exams and graduated from the academy were recommended to enter the Mentor program. Essentially, finding a seasoned Auror to shadow and learn from so their transition into the department wasn’t too jarring. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was still close to his own mentor, Danielle Castle, a senior Auror who took him under her wing and taught him more than he could have garnered from his time at the academy, like how to maintain a work-life balance, how to perceive and handle victims and their families, and most importantly how not to lose himself in the work. Life as an Auror took a toll. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But, Harry didn’t think he was ready for that type of commitment, mentoring new Aurors. Or rather he wasn’t sure he wanted someone trailing around him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Someone wrapped harshly at the door. “Potter, Longbottom,” Robards stood in the open doorway. “Debrief in ten minutes.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, sir,” Harry and Neville answered. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Robards turned on his heel and left. Harry and Neville exchanged looks. Another day, another tiring meeting. </span>
</p>
<p align="center"><span>#</span> <span>#</span> <span>#</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione settled in the seat directly across from Harry and Ron, grimacing slightly at the sight of their lunch - some type of roasted turkey, mashed potatoes, and a side salad. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She took one look at her own lunch and sighed quietly. A lackluster looking salad and an orange. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron pointed his fork at her. “You, okay?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She nodded. “Felt a little light-headed earlier, but I’m feeling okay now.” She didn’t notice Harry and Ron exchange looks, too busy stabbing her salad with her fork. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, what did you get Teddy for his birthday?” Harry asked. “I’m thinking of getting him a new game for his Gamecube”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh! That’s a great idea. I haven’t figured out what to get him yet. Maybe something Pokemon.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry’s eyes roamed over Hermione’s form, noting her tired appearance. Something caught his attention in the area past Hermione’s shoulder. He nudged Ron in the ribs. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What’s that for? Oh.” Ron wiped his mouth with his napkin. “I’ll see you back at the office. See you tomorrow, Hermione.” He stood from his seat and rounded the table heading to the other side of the employee cafeteria. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione gave Harry a knowing smile. She looked over her shoulder and Harry leaned on his elbow, watching their best friend walk up to the secretary of the Department of Magical Games and Sports, Jenna Clarke. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione grinned at the sight. “He’s so cute, don’t you think?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry scoffed. “Sure, Ron, cute.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She turned back around and kicked him beneath the table. “Be nice. I’m just saying, it’s cute to see him make an effort. He obviously likes her a lot.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh yeah, totally,” he feigned interest, “now he just needs to actually ask her out instead of dragging his feet.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t be so hard on him.” Hermione pushed her salad around her plate. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He chuckled this time. “You don’t have to hear and see him moon over her, Hermione. I’ll be looking forward to when this is over.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione swallowed a few mouthfuls of her salad. “Awe, Harry, you’re not much of a romantic.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He gasped, a hand over his heart. “I’m plenty romantic.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, yeah?” She began to peel her orange. “When was the last time you did something romantic?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He muttered something under his breath. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What was that?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry rested his chin in his hand and trained his eyes on her. His attention made her shift. “Valentine’s Day,” he said. “I thought I was pretty romantic. Flowers. Chocolate.” He coughed into his hand, “chocolate syrup.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Harry!” She kicked him again. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He laughed. “Do you want to head to Teddy’s birthday party together?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She smiled down at her nausea-inducing lunch. “I’d like that.” </span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <span>Hermione swished water in her mouth and then spit. Wiping her mouth with the back of her hand, she looked herself over in the bathroom mirror. Her clothes still looked fine, but she couldn’t help wondering if the smell of throw up lingered. At least her hair still looked okay. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She tugged at the seams of her dress at her waist. This dress fit a whole lot better the last time she wore it. Did something she ate make her bloated? Well, hopefully, whatever it was, she just threw it up in the toilet. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She stepped out of the bathroom and headed back to her small kitchen. She looked over the food and drinks she had. Why </span>
  <em>
    <span>did</span>
  </em>
  <span> she throw up her breakfast? Eggs and toast weren’t out of the ordinary. The eggs hadn’t gone bad. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She shrugged and went about cleaning up her kitchen while she waited for Harry to arrive. She hoped she wasn’t coming down with anything. Getting sick was the last thing she wanted. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Setting the clean dishes aside she thought back to the week she had. She had bouts of dizziness and even nausea a few times, but she wasn’t too surprised by that. A lot of the food she had this week looked and tasted worse. Another reminder to bring her own lunch to work. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She was lightheaded all day yesterday. But, she figured she just needed to drink more water. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A muffled cracking sounded by the door and Harry appeared. “Hey, Hermione,” he greeted, “how are - wow, you look great.” His eyes followed her form down to her feet and back up. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione’s eyebrows rose. “Really, Harry Potter? Thanks.” She patted down her dress, suddenly feeling a little self-conscious. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He shrugged. “What? I’m just speaking the truth. Ready to go?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She slung her purse strap over her shoulder. “Ready.” She walked across the kitchen and held out her hand. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He took it in his, gave it a quick squeeze, and disapparated. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They appeared in the corner of the Lupin’s garden, behind the tall tree where Remus had hung up a swing for Teddy. The garden was quiet, signaling they arrived before any of Teddy’s muggle friends and their parents. They walked through the open back door. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus was tapping various picture frames in the sitting room, freezing them and making sure any other magical item was hidden from sight. “Good your here. Bill, Fleur, and Victoire should be here any minute.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re looking rather flustered, Remus.” Hermione touched his arm and went on her tip-toes to kiss him on the cheek. “Anything you need help with?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Please? Could you go through the bathroom and hallway to see if there’s anything I missed? Just in case. I don’t want Teddy’s friends or their parents to be startled.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione nodded. “I’m on it.” She handed Harry her gift and walked away. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus gripped Harry’s shoulder and motioned for him to follow. They stepped back into the garden. Remus pointed to the gift table. Harry and Hermione’s were the first ones. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sirius should be here any minute.” Remus moved to another table and proceeded to open crisp bags and set out cookies. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry snatched one of the chocolate chip cookies and stuffed his mouth. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mai!” Teddy’s voice resounded through the house. Hermione’s laughter followed. They burst into a conversation about Pokemon.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That boy adores her,” Remus opened the last crisp bag, eating one for himself. “I don’t know how she does it.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione strolled out carrying Teddy on her back. Harry rushed over, holding his arms out. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I got him.” She moved past him and headed toward the swing. Teddy jumped down her back and instructed her to sit down. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Teddy was pushing her lightly on the swing when Uncle Sirius arrived. He handed Teddy a box and told him to hide it before turning to Hermione. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Come here you.” He tugged her to her feet and pulled her into a tight hug. “It’s been ages.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, please.” She wrapped her arms around his torso. “It’s barely been a few weeks. I saw you at Remus’s birthday party.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His wide grin made her smile. “Obviously, it’s been too long.” He kissed her forehead. “Alright, time to bug Remus.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Teddy’s seventh birthday party went off without a hitch. Once all the invited children arrived, they got started with party games: musical chairs, pin the tail on Pikachu, Pokemon ball hunt. Then Grandma Andromeda brought out the cake and Teddy opened his presents. He received an assortment of toys and books. He gave Harry a tight hug for his new video game. He gave Hermione a more gentler hug for his trainer belt equipped with Pokeballs and Pokedex. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Once all his friends left, Teddy turned his attention to Fred and George, the trio stomped around the garden pretending to search for Pokemon to catch. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She took in the sights, smells, and the warmth of the sun and felt an overwhelming sense of happiness.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What’s on your mind?” Harry handed her a cup of lemonade. “Is something the matter?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She shook her head and took a sip. Andromeda’s lemonade was the best. “Just happy.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just happy, huh?” He pushed his glasses up. “Well, you can’t fault ‘just happy’. Teddy was looking for you, by the way.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What for?” She looked around the garden, searching for the young boy. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry shrugged. “Wanted to show you something, I don’t know.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mai!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A smile erupted on her face. “Teddy!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Teddy barreled into her, wrapping his arms tightly around her hips. “Missed you, Mai.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, I’ve missed you too, Teddy-bear. Did you like your presents?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His eyes widened. “Yes, it’s the best!” He gestured to his training belt. “I want to show you what my grandma got me. Come on,” he tugged on her hand. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright, let’s go.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She let the seven-year-old boy drag her away, leaving Harry alone. He scratched at the side of his face and shrugged. He walked back to where his godfather and Remus were, grilling hamburgers. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Harry.” Sirius squeezed his shoulder, curiosity evident in his eyes. He turned to Remus and made a curt nod toward Harry. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus shut his mouth and shook his head. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry looked between the two. “What is it?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus held up his hands. “Nothing.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius glared at Remus. He took a moment and flipped over the burgers currently laid out on the grill. “We were just talking about you and Hermione, is all.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh? What about us?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius shrugged nonchalantly. “You know, just how close you two are. Good friends,” he cleared his throat, “maybe more. Nothing much, really?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Maybe more?” Harry shifted on his feet. He knew where they were going with this. It wouldn’t be the first time people assumed. It definitely wouldn’t be the last. “You know we’re not like that. Besides, you two would probably be the first to know.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Really?” Sirius grinned. “Thanks, pup.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Told you,” Remus rolled his eyes at Sirius. “Anyway, Harry, how’s work?” </span>
</p>
<p align="center"><span>#</span> <span>#</span> <span>#</span></p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s beautiful, Teddy.” Hermione caressed the soft locks on top of his head. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Isn’t it?” He hugged his new telescope clumsily. “Grandma brought it back from Germany. She said it’s one of a kind, like me! But, I can only use it at night.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione chuckled. “Well, that would be the best. Thank you for showing it to me.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I had to show it to you, Mai! Do you want to play gobstones with me and George? We can play now that all my muggle friends are gone. I wish I could play with them, but we just play with regular marbles.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione shook her head. “Maybe another time.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Teddy shrugged. “Okay.” He raced out of his bedroom. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione took a look around the little boy’s room. Quidditch and dragon posters hung on the wall alongside Premier League football teams. His bookshelf looked a little worse for wear, holding books and toys. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Teddy show you his telescope?” Tonks stood in the doorway, she motioned her head to the side, in the direction of the kitchen. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione followed her down the hallway. “It’s beautiful.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It sure is. Only my mother, honestly. But he loves it.” Tonks settled on the opposite side of the counter began pouring out some wine. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fleur stepped into the kitchen, sighing softly. “She is sleeping. Thank you for letting me use your bedroom.” She rested her arms against the counter. “She tires me.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tonks chuckled. “And you want to have another one.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fleur smiled. “I do. Victoire drives Bill and I mad, but I love every minute of it. I wouldn’t mind having another child or two.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione was surprised by the news. “Are you and Bill planning on having more children?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fleur shrugged. “I’d like to. Bill and I just need to talk about it. Discuss if we’re ready for another one.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tonks nodded, sipping her wine. “It’s just Teddy for me and Remus.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Really?” Fleur leaned forward. “Are you sure?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tonks set her hands on the table and turned to the kitchen window that overlooked the garden. “We’ve talked about it. I never imagined having a family bigger than this. I suppose I’m just used to a single-child house. Besides, we can concentrate all our attention on Teddy.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fleur nodded in understanding. “What about you, Hermione?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione squeaked. “Me?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fleur picked up her neglected wine glass. “Do you want children?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t know.” She set her empty cup of lemonade on the counter. “I mean, I have pictured it as part of my future.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tonks chuckled. “I can’t wait to meet any future children of yours, Hermione.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She pouted. “Why do you say that?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They’ll be so cute,” Fleur chimed in. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thick brown hair, brown eyes. Like a doll. They’d be so smart,” Tonks added. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione flushed. “Alright, you two.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tonks and Fleur chuckled. Fleur gulped down the rest of her wine. “If I do have another baby, I will not look forward to nine or ten months of pain.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tonks groaned. “That’s right. I had nausea for five months. It was a total rip off. Mum kept saying, ‘the nausea will go away in a few weeks’. Screw that. I was throwing up all day, every day for forever.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione’s eyes widened. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Nausea? Throwing up? </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I had dizzy spells,” Fleur shared. “I’m glad Molly had advice for that. She said she felt dizzy when she carried Bill and the twins.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione stared at her cup. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Dizzy spells?</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tonks nodded. “The back pain was torture, no the hip pain was torture. Everything was awful actually.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“My feet swelled so much, I looked like a duck. I felt so fat.” Fleur poured herself some more wine. “And all I wanted to eat were those cheese sticks.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I wanted pizza, like all the time. That was hard.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione looked back and forth between the two women. “That sounds terrible.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tonks blew out some air. “Tell me about it, but you should know if you decide to have children. It’s no walk in the park.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mama!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fleur sighed softly. “If it’s something you want, It’s worth it.” She patted Hermione on the arm before stepping out of the kitchen. “Ma petite, would you like some cake?” </span>
</p>
<p align="center"><span>#</span> <span>#</span> <span>#</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione sat in a chair in the shade, humming to herself. Why hadn’t she thought of it herself? Nausea. Throwing up. She knew something was off. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She could literally feel it. But, she couldn’t be, right? She’s been on birth control for more than three years. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She jumped when a body plopped down beside her. “Guess what?” Harry whispered, holding up two plates of cake. He placed on in her hand.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re disturbing my peace, Harry.” She stabbed her cake. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ron actually asked her out.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione gasped and let out a short squeal, making a few members of their family and friends turn toward them. “Shut up! Did he really?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They’re going out for coffee tomorrow,” he disclosed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oi!” Ron rushed over and took a seat on Hermione’s other side. “Don’t go telling her </span>
  <em>

  <span> news.” Ron settled his attention on Hermione. He took a deep breath and said, “I did it. I actually did it.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She squealed again. “How did it go? How did you ask her?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I was nervous as hell, but I just buckled down and thought, I’ll never know what might happen if I don’t actually do it, so I did it.” Ron leaned back in his chair. “I can’t believe it.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She slapped his leg. “So, how did you ask her?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I walked her back to her office and said, ‘if you’re not busy, we should go get some coffee sometime, I know this place in London near the London Eye’ and she said yes!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione’s cheeks hurt from the amount of smiling she was doing. “That is so great, Ron! I’m so happy for you. I knew she was going to say yes.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah.” He pulled on his pant leg. “Now, I need to make sure I have something good to wear.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Where something light to bring out your eyes,” Hermione suggested. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, something dark just in case he spills coffee on himself,” Harry said with a grin. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Harry, don’t. He won’t spill coffee on himself.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He might.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He won’t.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry shifted in his seat. “He might.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She groaned. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright, enough you two. You’re making me nervous. Besides, I’m a wizard. I’ll just banish the damn coffee stain.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s the spirit, Ron!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron leaned back in his chair. “You two are impossible.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What did I do?” Hermione whined, taking another bite of her cake. “I’m here, being supportive.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, we’re even giving you fashion advice. Sheesh.” Harry rested his head on Hermione’s shoulder. “That’s the last time I help you.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron laughed again and walked off in the direction of his brothers. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Teddy skidded to a stop in front of Hermione. “Will you play gobstones with me now?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright, Teddy, lead the way.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione stood out of Harry’s hold and followed the young boy back into the house. Her stomach felt queasy. She slapped her hand over her mouth. “I’m going to throw up.” She ran down the hall to the bathroom. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She slammed the door shut behind her and launched herself at the toilet. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mai?” Teddy tapped on the closed door. “Are you okay?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione cringed. She didn’t want to scare him. “I don’t feel so good,” she called out to him. “Just give me a sec, okay?” She promptly silenced the bathroom.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She gripped the side of the toilet and threw up some more. What the hell is wrong with her? This can't be happening. This was not happening. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The silence was broken by firm knocks on the door. “Hermione?” Harry’s voice reached her. “Teddy told me you aren’t feeling well.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He pushed the bathroom door and closed it behind him. He kneeled on the other side of her form. Her arms were bracing herself against the toilet. He pulled her hair back. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is something wrong?” He whispered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She shook her head. “I don’t know. I just haven’t been feeling well.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He rubbed her back. “We’ll say our goodbyes after this and I’ll take you home, okay?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>All she could do was nod. </span>
