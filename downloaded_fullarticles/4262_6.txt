    <p>
Ancient stories lost to the modern tongue do not die. Oh, they can be forgotten, burned from records and hidden away under a thousand hundred years of dirt, but they do not die. The fact that none hear them does not make them any less real, or any less effective. Especially not when it comes to Prophecy. You see, far before there was any difference between 'muggle' and 'wizard,' there was a great world. Perhaps during the ages of Pangea breaking away.
</p><p>
In these times, there was little land. Cyrodiil, Skyrim, among smaller lands, barely a day or three's ride from border to border. These lands were different. Factions yes, magic engraved into life. Potions were commonplace, herbal remedies of far ancient times. But as the rift between Man, Beast and Mer grew, times grew harder. Species consolidated, and a great ravine between those who could wield magic and those who could not began to form.
</p><p>
The Beast-people's died out, for the most part. Argonians survived barely, until the sinking of the great city Atlantis, as the plates of the earth itself moved and a giant crevasse swallowed the city. Nobody had heard from the Argonians again, after that. The Mer, now known as the Greater Elves, disappeared, leaving only the descendants of their once-slaves, taken in as House Elves by the Magik Men.
</p><p>
As war grew between Unmagikal and Magikal men, those with the strongest Magic in the Illusion School began to band together to create great domes of warped space. They made vaults and filled them with ancient knowledge. A great Wizard named Merlin, the youngest seven and one of the only Dragonborn of that era, created a great castle near a huge lake with water so dark it looked black, and placed every book he ever raided in a vault deep in the hill the castle stood on, carved with dragons, for Merlin held the power of the Thu'um. It is rumored in the ancient text that Merlin himself was the descendant of the Dragonborn which slayed the Great Dragon Alduin.
</p><p>
After Merlin the first died, the castle and its powerful wardstones and illusionary warped-space Anti-muggle barriers stood firm. It was passed down century to century, and the souls of the Dragons that Merlin and his ancestors had taken guarded it, great wraiths of power that prowled in the long-forgotten places of the castle, invisible to nearly all of mankind.
</p><p>
Merlin the second, born in the times of Arthur Pendragon, was the second Merlin in the Merlin Line. Descendant of the first dragonborn, known only in those times as the Dragonlord, he spoke to the Last Great Dragon, Kilgharrah, descendant of the dragon Paarthurnax who lived amongst the Greybeards, the great holders of the Thu'um. It was said that the Great Grey Dragon lived upon the Throat Of The World, which had shifted with the parting of the Great Pangea and was now known the world over as part of the Himalayan Mountains.
</p><p>
Merlin the 2nd stepped alongside Arthur Pendragon always, birthed the Great White Dragon Aithusa from one of the last Dragon Eggs, and ultimately failed in his quest to assist Arthur in uniting all of Albion. Blessed by Magik herself, Merlin then made the great trek to the Throat Of The World. Near centuries later, he descended upon the Dragonborn Castle, which had since been claimed by four people in the name of education.
</p><p>
Salazar Slytherin, Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff greeted him cheerily. He was sorted upon expressing his wish to learn more, and went to Salazar Slytherin's House. The Parselmouth held a rare gift descended of those who could speak to dragons, though it was mutated. Upon learning that they were related, Merlin named Salazar his heir, and thus died.
</p><p>
Salazar, who owned the castle and all the land it was on, said nothing of how he owned it. Instead, he endeavored to find the Vault below the castle. Growing distant from his friends, he found the Sky-tunnel which led to the vault in the Dark Forest and set a protection upon it. Salazar ended up hatching a Basilisk that he found in the Vault on accident, as the egg had been in a case and had waited for its Wizard for centuries before he met it. Naming the descendant of dragons Gronvith, which meant 'bond/clan' and 'snake' in the Old Thu'um, he spent much of his time in the vault. So much so that he called it his Chamber.
</p><p>
His friends, furious upon believing he had crafted a chamber with a dangerous beast in it, exiled him. Salazar did not argue, and instead spent decades searching for a Great Dragon Egg to preserve the Ancient Dragons. Failing in his quest, Salazar met a lovely man who was gifted in alchemy, and they had three children together.
</p><p>
These three brothers were named for their father, and his brothers. These three boys held the last name of their father, Peverell, and in their later days they encountered Death itself, who was cheated by their discoveries in how to cheat Death. In return for forgetting their method to escape it, Death would grant each of them a wish, regardless of how powerful.
</p><p>
Antioch, the first born, was a brash young man with a lust for power. He asked Death for a unbeatable wand, the most powerful wand to ever be made, regardless of mankind's limitations. His duels and boasting of holding the most powerful wand, which were naturally conductors of magic, of all of mankind led to his throat being slit, and the legendary wand stolen from his stiff fingertips.
</p><p>
Cadmus, the second born, was a vain but romantic man. Deeply saddened by his fiance's death, Cadmus asked Death to grant him an item that would let him call his fiance from the Land of the Dead, the Soul Cairn, just as she was before. Death granted him this wish, but felt cheated, for the entire point of the wishes was so that the brothers could not cheat Death. In revenge, he made it so that for every moment that Cadmus held his love in the world of the living, she would deteriorate. Driven to maddened sadness after his fiance, crippled by this, disappeared forever, Cadmus hung himself. The stone passed on to his son, who was born to his argonian-descended fiance before she died. The son, saddened by his father's passing but knowledgeable of the stone, put it in a ring. This ring is now the Lord Ring of his descendants, House Gaunt, but the ring still induces a fevered madness if not handled carefully.
</p><p>
Ignotus, the third son, was a wise yet young man. The ravenclaw to Cadmus and Antioch's Gryffindor ways, Ignotus asked Death for a cloak that could hide him from the sight of anything, living, dead, or higher. Death, though reluctantly, slit a long cloth from its own cloak, and handed it to him. What it was not aware of was that its own cloak, severed and given to another, had changed its loyalty. He could not find Ignotus, but on the day Ignotus was due to die, he fell upon the man.
</p><p>
Ignotus passed the Invisibility Cloak to his son, born to him of Elena Potter, a bright woman with a vibrant personality and firm outlook. Ignotus passed on the genes of messy hair to match to Elena's chocolate eyes, but he also passed something that ran amongst all those related to both Salazar and Merlin himself; Parseltongue, and Drakentongue.
</p><p>
And so it went. The Gaunt line continued, and so did the Potters, until finally, they reached the ones prophecy long forgotten spoke of, far before, when prophecy held weight far greater than the measly lie that Albus Dumbledore fed to the Death Eater spy in that inn.
</p><p>
When Tom Marvolo Riddle was born, the world knew. Magic herself may be long asleep, hibernating in the weakening days and ages of today, but her Great Dragons, long forgotten, roused. Ancient bones that should have been crumbled to dust that lay beneath mountains and in caves of the great plains in which Magic herself once resided, hidden from the common men finally roused from their ancient slumber.
</p><p>
Death itself turned its great eye to the world, peering closely upon Tom Marvolo Riddle, the destined soulmate of its future Master.
</p><p>
For where Tom Marvolo Riddle was power, strength in all things, wisdom and age and the speaker of serpents, a prophecy that spoke of him began to rumble.
</p><p>
Fate, long dead, roused to speak It once more.
</p><p>
"Born as the seventh month dies,
</p><p>
Matched to the death of the 26th year,
</p><p>

    Two shall perish, both shall survive
</p><p>
And upon that very day they will rise
</p><p>
Born of blood and sinew
</p><p>

    The boy of cold ash and dust
</p><p>

        And the man born of iron blood and rust
</p><p>
Two souls matched,
</p><p>

    The birth and the end of the final year."
</p><p>
"Master of Death,
</p><p>
	Pale Rider, born but never alive,
</p><p>
		A chance to live
</p><p>
			But only to survive
</p><p>
Alone and cold
</p><p>
	A fire without a flame
</p><p>
		Only risen by the tinder
</p><p>
			Of the serpent-speaking thane."
</p><p>
And then Fate slept, and Death stood guard over the Soul Cairn, great eye wide.
</p><p>
And Hadrian Harrigan Potter was born.
</p><p>
~-~
</p><p>
Hadrian was born early on September 1979, on the 30th. He was taken from his mother's womb to save his life months early due to an issue with magical compatibility, more specifically because Lily Potter's magic was seeing him not as her child but as a magical parasite due to a improperly grown umbilical cord and the fact that Hadrian was subsisting entirely on her magic due to the malformation. So Lily's magic began to attack Hadrian, who, already ill from the malnutrition of body, could not stand it. Lily, who had grown ill suddenly, had gone to St Mungo's with her new husband James out of concern. Both were horrified to find what the problem was, and Hadrian was taken out via the magical equivalent of a C-section. His middle name was given in honor of the mediwizard who saved him.
</p><p>
Hadrian then spent many months in a stabilizing pod, fed nutritional mush and donated samples of magic from his godfathers and parents. He was freed of his pod after six months and given to his parents, who were given a special potion regime to feed him. Other than that, Hadrian was a perfectly normal, if unusually small, child. He liked flying well enough, but <em>loved </em>books, especially fairytales, and had a fondness for magical creatures, specifically dragons. His godfather in honor, Remus Lupin, regaled Hadrian several times a week with stories of dragons, vampires and other creatures, but Harry also grew up knowing vividly of the awful laws all of them were subjected to, too.
</p><p>
Harry was graced with a baby brother around the age of one on July 31st, 1980, named Charlie Sirius Potter. Charlie was the near opposite of Harry, and liked flying far more than any book. Where Harry was small, with dark hair and vividly green eyes, with pale skin on a lean body and a dorky grin, Charlie was red-haired, with brown eyes, pudgy cheeks and a cacophony of freckles across his pink cheeks. Charlie <em>loved </em>Sirius and the stories he told of his pranks, was missing a tooth from where he fell off his toy broom, and raced across the house constantly.
</p><p>
Harry was much quieter than Charlie, but they were friendly with one another. Harry spent much of his time reading, which Charlie found boring, though.
</p><p>
However, it was on the Halloween of 1981 when it happened. Young Harry, nearly two, was playing in the nursery while his baby brother slept in his crib, tuckered out from playing all day with their nanny, a squib they were very fond of.
</p><p>
Voldemort did not smash his way inside, as people would lead you to believe. Instead, he opened the door near-silently, stepping inside. The squib was asleep in the living room with a well-placed <em>Stupefy,</em> and he was free to get what he came for.
</p><p>
Tom was not quite <em>gone,</em> at this point. His mind was crippled by both horcrux and madness, but he was not gone, nor so damaged he could not be saved. So in this place, this world, when one of his most loyal begged of him to spare Lily Potter, he did not go to the Potter home when they were there. Instead, he threatened Peter Pettigrew into giving him the Fidelius secret, and then directed the useless rat to get the Potters out of their home for a halloween party.
</p><p>
However, his brief moments of thoughtful sanity had grown rare, and so he was unaware that Severus, wary of this and knowing the likelihood that Voldemort had listened was low, went to Dumbledore anyway, even as Voldemort stopped in the doorway to the nursery.
</p><p>
Acidic green and bloodied stone red met as the toddler looked at the man, and the man looked back.
</p><p>
Voldemort, driven by a madness in the few moments to which Tom was too startled by the way his chest lurched upon eyes of green and red meeting, threw forth a spell just as green as the boys eyes. Poetic that the boy would die to a spell the same color as his eyes, Voldemort thought.
</p><p>
But the boy did not die, for Death refused to touch the boy, knowing that this was its one chance to truly choose the one who would command it. Instead, the boys magic absorbed the spell and, in doing so, accepted the magic absorbed alongside it. The spell floundered, for the spell had to be backed by killing intent, and therefore could not do as it was designed for Death itself refused to allow it to do what it was meant to do.
</p><p>
The spell rebounded, to the horror of Voldemort. A mere second later, and Voldemort could think no more.
</p><p>
The Potter's came back to their home, hours later, to the sniffles of the two brothers and the squib guarding them in her arms. The house, they saw, was collapsed into itself on the second floor. It was in great disarray, covered in soot. The boys were mostly fine, exempting only one thing; Charlie had an odd scar on his cheek.
</p><p>
And so the boy was hailed the Boy Who Lived.
</p><p>
Nobody noticed the odd imprint upon Harry's inner right wrist. If one looked close, you could almost say it was a dragon.
</p><p>
{°\/°}
</p><p>
Harry liked to think himself very patient. And he was! He had to be, really, because in the Potter family, nothing was slow. This included, of course, his brothers irritating voice. Constantly, his brother nattered on and on, from bragging to Quidditch. If he wasn't talking, he was moving. In fact, Harry could say that his brother never really stopped moving. Shaking his leg, tapping fingers, all the way to chewing quills and running through the house.
</p><p>
He would be more irritated if he wasn't so used to it, he supposed.
</p><p>
As time went on, he didn't really need to be 'used to it' as often. Once Charlie and James bonded over Quidditch, Harry didn't really need to be around. Charlie could entertain himself well enough, the boy figured. So he turned his veridian eyes from family to knowledge.
</p><p>
The Potters had a big library. Old, not quite big enough to fight in the big league libraries like those of the Malfoys or such, mostly due to the Potter's mostly Gryffindor legacy. In olden times, Gryffindors tended to be more on the side of war and glory than knowledge, and while capable of being great tacticians, had lackluster skills when it came to simple <em>knowing.</em>
</p><p>
That was for the house of Ravenclaw and Slytherin. You see, where Gryffindors were glory, and Hufflepuffs infrastructure, Slytherins were the planners. The what-goes-there and who-goes-where, the people to build cities and architecture. Ambitious, nowadays they were more often risk-taking politicians than the builders of ancient wizarding architecture, people who handled money instead of risk.
</p><p>
Ravenclaws, however, changed little. They were still scholars, still wielders of knowledge. While you could plan on Slytherins planning their every step, Ravenclaws were the genius scholar types of the world. A rivalry between Ravenclaws and Slytherins would be even worse than that of the calm-headed serpents and hot-headed lions, because both houses hosted geniuses of ages and eras. The only difference? Where Ravenclaws planned to learn for knowledge's sake, Slytherins learned to <em>use it.</em>
</p><p>
The truth was that Ravenclaw and Slytherin were perhaps the most overlapping of the four houses. A twin of a Ravenclaw who was a Slytherin can blend in just as easily amongst the only winged residents of Hogwarts as the snakes. It is a simple fact. But there is the stark difference, between how they are perceived: That Ravenclaws care only for a book, and that Slytherins care only for the death of those below them.
</p><p>
While Slytherins and Gryffindors hold the most attention, it is not Hufflepuffs but Ravenclaws most often overlooked. At the very least, Hufflepuff was a punchline. Therefore, none could forget it. But Ravenclaws, despite what many would believe, were the most overlooked amongst their peers.
</p><p>
Despite their intellect, many Ravenclaws were… dulled. Not dull, no, but perhaps simply less <em>aware.</em> The mix of those whom were not soft, or sharp, or rough. Just… there. The leftover scraps of the heap, where all sorts of personalities mixed. But it wore on them, to be forgotten so easily, to be the distant ones amongst their peers. For all their smarts, they were awarded the least, looked over instead to Gryffindors or Slytherins by the teachers, who could not unfocus their gaze from them lest they do something 'evil' or pull a 'prank' upon one another.
</p><p>
Hufflepuffs were coddled irritatingly, but at least they received attention. And Harry was well on his way, you see, to being a Ravenclaw. His growing distance with his family pulled on him, as time went on. Being overlooked for his rambunctious younger brother did not make him bitter, as one would assume. Instead, as time grew, he became thankful for it.
</p><p>
He found solace in a good book, be it maths or herbology, or a great fictional work a million words long. As time went on you could almost expect him to be a cushion , he was so sunken into the old soft chair in the library. The warmth of a fire and his cocoa or tea beside him, forever warm from a well placed charm.
</p><p>
As time grew, so did he. He never outgrew his lean, half-starved look. Too engrossed in a good book to eat, or sleep, or breath. His health, already deteriorated from his weakened body from his unusual birth, grew worse as time went on. He barely noticed.
</p><p>
Harry was used to being small. He filled his head with books until he could barely walk, his brain was so fuzzed, forever playing like a cinema. Harry felt much like a puppet would, sometimes, forcing himself to eat so he could learn more. His mind was honed from years of reading of all sorts of magic and knowledge, quite literally a library, all the books framed in the exact shelves he found them on, in their exact place.
</p><p>
He read a book, and as he did he recorded it, from the words on each page to the texture of the cover and the fine filigree of the titles and authors. He also recorded which books he had read and which he had not, that way, and few remained that he had not read. If he focused, sometimes he could see all the protections laced into his mind.
</p><p>
He wasn't aware of it, but he also recorded memories. His mental 'library' of sorts held all his knowledge, and it was more than that. It was a fine tuned occlumency, done by his magic and mind alike. His memories were hidden well, so well not even he knew where they hid. Dust mites in the pages, spiders and their webs in the darker shelves where the naughty, bloodied, human-leather books resided. The very stone under his steps, the cathedral ceiling and vaulted stone to which every shelf towered to reach, a two story stone building filled with so much knowledge that the dusty, blue-stained glass windows lit upon the very magic they exuded.
</p><p>
As he grew, his memory palace grew with him. The darker books, no longer hidden due to his age, were devoured with feverous eagerness. Dark stairwells in odd places led to the basement, then, where all the darkest of his knowledge hid. Thin puddles of too-thick, dark water resided in the seams of the stone, and where it dipped. The shelves here were dark, too, wood covered with scars of fire and thin layers of soot and bone dust. The older books resided on shelves that were more carved alcoves, dipping into the old stone of the basement. Water dripped from the ceiling, despite all knowledge that no water resided above this floor.
</p><p>
Perhaps it wasn't so odd, then, that Harry was surprised when his eleventh birthday came about.
</p><p>
It was after all one of the few days he deigned to chart off every year, and one of even fewer where he bothered to come out of the library to eat with his family. His family who, while never quite forgetting him, disregarded him often enough that it was a surprise every time.
</p><p>
So when he came downstairs to the grand living room, letter in hand and his Vermiculated fishing owl, Ptolemy, on his shoulder. Acidic-Veridian eyes blinked languidly at his godfather, Remus.
</p><p>
"I got a letter." Harry informed Remus quietly.
</p><p>
And he did. Two in fact. One, the hogwarts letter, was stamped with red wax with the hogwarts crest on dull yellow paper. A soft, minty envelope stamped with a bright blue wax from Beauxbatons came alongside it, from a lovely Snowy owl, just after the exhausted Tawny from Hogwarts left. Ptolemy, seething at the other owls proximity, had yet to leave his shoulder.
</p><p>
For Harry, this was momentous occasion, mostly because nobody bothered to send him letters, though he was vaguely friendly with a few of the Weasley brothers from when Ron came over, mostly Percy. To receive not one, but two letters from two international schools was surprising, but Harry knew that the likelihood of him even being able to look <em>twice </em>at the Beauxbatons letter was next to nothing, if his hogwarts-zealous father saw it.
</p><p>
So he had simply… forgotten the high quality, blue-green envelope and its letter in his desk in his room. Instead, he showed Remus the Hogwarts letter, with a dorky smile that told everyone who saw it that he was not a boy who smiled often.
</p><p>
Remus obviously did not care about the awkward attempt at smiling, as Harry was immediately struggling not to get smothered in the tight, pressing hug the werewolf pulled him into.
</p><p>
<em>Perhaps, </em>The lonely boy who oft told himself he was not lonely thought, <em>this wouldn't be so bad.</em>
</p><p>
~-~
</p><p>
<em>Or maybe, </em>The boy thought to himself snippily, the next day, <em>this would be terrible.</em>
</p><p>
The cause for his bad temper was that his family was a very social family. While he had been able to avoid most public things such as going to Diagon Alley, he was now in full view of three dozen other families with kids going to hogwarts, he had no such choice of whether he wished to be seen or not. It itched at him, an inherently uncomfortable feeling, like something crawling under his skin. The hyper-alert gaze of the people watching him like he was a new treat disturbed him.
</p><p>
But he had no choice of whether he wanted to be there. So little of a choice, in fact, that his father had genuinely hunted him down and dragged him out of bed, dressed him roughly in his excitement, and ferried him downstairs to Floo. And so he did- straight into the loudness of the Alley. People crying about their wares, families shuffling, and by the gods it was <em>such a thin alleyway, and there were so many people!</em>
</p><p>
Not to mention they brought his little brother along. Gods, he was getting a headache fast, keeping track of all this. The alley was so loud, and his brother (who was only ten) had yet to grow weary of it all, practically screaming in delight at things. And of course, where his brother went, paparazzi showed up, too.
</p><p>
It took depressingly little time after that for his parents to nearly totally forget that it was <em>his </em>'big day' and not his little brothers. Harry reprimanded himself- he knew it would happen eventually, after all, like it had <em>literally every other time-</em> but he simply took his coin purse attached to his trust vault and continued on. Nobody went after him, his parents too busy posing with bright smiles and their hands on his brother's shoulders for pictures.
</p><p>
His first stop was to get a wand. The wrinkly but seemingly jolly (and sort of creepy) old man helped him find his wand. Every single one he tried seemed to reject him, until a Holly wand with a phoenix core. It accepted him, but holding it seemed to <em>burn</em> somehow. He told Ollivander this.
</p><p>
The old man rubbed at his chin for a moment, taking the wand. "The core has bonded to you, but the wood of the wand has rejected you. And judging from these burn marks where you held it, the wand isn't powerful enough for you, either."
</p><p>
The man couldn't seem to figure it out, after a while. "I'll tell you what," The wand maker decided, "I will pull this wand apart- it is too damaged to use anyway- and you can buy the feather off of me for five galleons. Perhaps if you go to a wand maker with skill in making personal, custom wands they can bond it to the correct wood for you. None of the cores I gave you aside from this feather were compatible anyway."
</p><p>
And this was true, for every dragon heartstring wand he tried, the core burnt up in the wood. The unicorn hair faired better, but not by much. And no light woods seemed to be really capable of bonding with him. 
</p><p>
It occurred to him suddenly, "But where would I find someone to make it?"
</p><p>
The old man considered this. "I know a place in Knockturn, but you may wish to look in your family vault before you go looking for the place. Old wands are more powerful, from when Magic was most prevalent among us. And either way, the shop is in a dangerous area of the alley. You would be safer to try an old wand, than to go there."
</p><p>
So Harry went to Gringotts, the softly glowing feather pressed in his hand. The plumes were carefully wrapped around the shaft, making it look like a coiled spring of fire. It was warm, too warm, against his skin as he walked up the slightly crooked steps to the great white bank. He stepped inside, shoulders tight as the feeling of <em>earth hum old</em> swept down his spine.
</p><p>
The goblins had never made him nervous, but they had a magic twofold as old as man, for they had no genuine reason to let go the ancient magics. Either way, the goblins were far more connected to the earth than any other, excepting the long-dead Dwemer for which the Goblins were descended from. It is said in ancient books about Goblins that they were the child of orc and Dwemer, and that they were the strongest of any craft excepting by that of the Dwemer for whom they were descended. They worshipped one god, who was the nameless god of Earth, Forge and Craft.
</p><p>
Harry knew their greetings well, having read scrolls and books from the library about them. He looked carefully, and went to a goblin he recognised from his youth as the Potter account manager, bowing carefully. "Greetings to you, Gravelaxe. I hope you are well, that your coffers bleed gold, and your enemies are crushed." He greeted, carefully.
</p><p>
Gravelaxe blinked at him with beady black eyes, crossing his fingers. "Greetings, Heir Potter. May your tongue be silver, and your eyes be emeralds." The old goblin replied, as is custom to responding to other races. The goblin-to-goblin greeting was more along the lines of 'may your clan be strong, and your hand bold' depending on which clan it was, or if it was a greeting between two of differing clans.
</p><p>
"What can I do for you today, little heir?" The goblin asked.
</p><p>
"I need to access the wands of my forefathers, ancestors, and their ancestors."
</p><p>
Gravelaxe raised a brow, but didn't question it. Much. "Too powerful for those piddly sticks they call conductors, little heir?"
</p><p>
Harry considered him. "Perhaps just a little."
</p><p>
Gravelaxe smiled. It was threatening, all sharp uneven fangs and tough molars, with far too many teeth. "Come with me then." The goblin said, depositing his short stature upon the ground and moving to one of the back entryways to the carts. Harry trotted after the unusually fast walk of the goblin, nary taller than his tiny stature as it was.
</p><p>
The cart ride was brilliantly fast. Harry loved it, the sensation of flying as the cart whistled around the tracks, so fast that if it were a train it would fly right off the track. The dips, hills and sharp, leaning turns reminded him of memories he did not have, like it was scratching an itch he had never felt. He loved it, the soaring speed and the sharp turn, right until the end, where the cart slowed steadily to a stop above a deep trench.
</p><p>
This part of the bank was filled with huge caverns filled with Darkwater, a thick black substance like water but not quite that hummed with olde magic, from forgotten times. It was said to enrich earth, but it could not survive in the sun. The Darke magic in it was supposedly from the corpse of Alduin himself, the Great Black Dragon, the World Eater. It is said that when Alduin was slaid in Sovngarde, his blood ran so thick it made great rivers that bellowed up from the Heart Of The World and filled all of the Empty in it. Great places with rich Ley Lines were said to be upon pockets of Darkwater, which made Magic's grip on the world stronger. Diagon Alley was, in fact, built over a great cavern filled with it, which the Goblins built into.
</p><p>
In the Darkwater, he saw shapes. Odd and sharp, they slid under the water, distorting it, but they never quite came out, merely shaping it. He turned his eyes away to instead look at the vault they had brought him to.
</p><p>
The Goblin walked him to the cavern that led to the vault he had been brought to. Ancient, it held a crest not of the Potters, but instead of another family. Decorated in dragons, it held the picture of a bat and a bird (or was that three birds?) and wings of carefully stained glass. The stone dragons carved alongside it from the stone itself watched him with eyes of gemstones.
</p><p>
"This is not the Potter vault." Harry knew this because the Potter crest was filled with reds and golds, with two lions either side, and a lion roaring with a ring on its tongue for the shield.
</p><p>
"It is not." Gravelaxe said, "Because this is the vault of the Peverell family, whom the Potters are descended from, and who your grandfather forbade your father and his wife from ever accessing for fear that was well placed. The Peverell family was Dark, and dipped into Black and Old magic. They were a family of necromancers, and this door," The goblin gestured to the shield, which had a thick seam in it, "opens to all three vaults.The Potters are the only descendants, aside from the Gaunt family. You have right to open the vaults, but your siblings and family do not."
</p><p>
The goblin's eyes held a knowing gleam. Harry wondered why, so he asked.
</p><p>
"You have the blood of the Dragonlord, or better known, the dragonborn. It is a title that skips lines by the eldest, unless the eldest does not live, to which it passes to the second. Your brother does not have the blood of Dragons in him, but you do, and all your other traits qualify you for the Peverell Lordship. We always tracked your bloodline heavily, testing their magics for every generation. You are the first one in nearly a dozen of them to have it. Therefore, you are the first in dozens to qualify for the Peverell lordship, for the requirements were that the wizard or witch in question held a Darke core, and the blood of dragons descended of their line. However, due to the breeding of your family, the goblin nation has doubted it would ever come back."
</p><p>
"Why did you track my bloodline for so long, in hopes that a dragonborn would come back?" Harry asked.
</p><p>
"Because of the Ancient Prophecy given by Fate herself. It told that a dragonborn favored by death and equal to a man for whom the dragonborn shares a soul would be born, and they would bring back the oldest of magic from the times before, allowing Magic to regain her hold upon the world so that those of magic and those without may live with peace. Ever since the muggles began to populate the world so heavily, Magic has been slowly dying as the rites that kept her alive fell out of favor by the Ministries of magic for magical countries in favor for promoting muggleborn adaptation. Since then, she has started losing her hold on the world, and her favor for those with magic has lessened for those who do not worship her, so much so that their descendants are born without magic in their veins. The only reason magical people still exist is their inbreeding to strengthen their magic. Soon enough, magic will die."
</p><p>
Harry considered this as they entered the vault. He had to place his hand on the door, which took some of his blood. Glowing symbols appeared on the door, and he read them, his vision fading into a shuddering sight of a huge gust of wind. Knowledge split his head, and his vocals swelled without his wish, and a burst of noise exploded from him.
</p><p>
<strong><em>"FUS"</em></strong>
</p><p>
The door shuddered under the strength, and then opened slowly as the words faded.
</p><p>
He was greeted by a chamber. The walls were lined with racks filled with interesting bowls and cauldrons, and odd plants growing from special pots enchanted to the bottoms, growing the plants of hundreds of species that were used in Olde alchemy, the last of their kind. An odd table with weirdly shaped glassware stood in the center of the room, surrounded by thick dirt and rampaging growths of flowers and mushrooms on rotting wooden logs placed there. The three rooms split off from separate doorways to the sides and behind the odd alchemy table. One was so filled with gold that it was spilling out of the door, forbidding entry, and one opposite it was filled with weaponry, gems of odd purple that glowed, and a weird table with a skull, along with dozens of odd armors of gold, green glass, and an evil-looking black chitinous armor that glows faintly with runes and odd shimmers telling of enchantment.
</p><p>
The centered one, however, was most interesting. It held a thin, tall wall filled with hundreds of boxes, thin and of all sorts of colors. A tiny sapling with gold leaves and pink flowers glowed faintly from a small pot in the center of the room. To either side, however, were dozens of bones too big to be anything but a dragons, and dozens of trinkets, odd looking weaponry, and dozens of other things. A fully intact dragon skeleton with thick, blackened bones hung from the ceiling, held up by thin chains. Its back faced the ground, and its long neck extended down to look straight at him. He froze, staring up at it, when it rattled as it moved. It was judging him somehow, he knew.
</p><p>
Deeming him acceptable, its glowing eyes faded, along with the dozens of odd glowing orbs in its hollow chest.
</p><p>
Breathing a sigh of relief, he looked at the room closer, now knowing why the goblin had not entered with him. The odd weaponry, he saw, was placed strategically. A sun-shaped object with a round purple glowing gem not unlike those in the enchanting and armory room was held carefully on the wall, and dragons feet and claws were placed, made of dozens of kinds of gemstones and stone with interesting circular stamps of animals on the bottom. Some of the claws looked like they were painted, the gemstones they had been carved from were so pure. It made them look like they had a manicure, and Harry tried not to snort.
</p><p>
Along with the claws placed in stands all over the shelves, a thin dark staff with screaming faces on top sat on the top shelf. Next to it were a few other staffs, some glowing, some not. A sword hung above them on an old stand with ancient red cloth, a faintly glowing golden sun sputtering in the handle.
</p><p>
There were also a lot of really old books with symbols on them in quite a few old shelves. They were organized by their symbol and color, he saw, and when he opened one he saw that they were about spells, each about a different one. The spellbooks also went by a 'school' system, where each school was specifically based around certain things. Such as Restoration, which was about healing and resurrection. A few spells based around the dead and repelling the dead were also the Restoration school, he saw.
</p><p>
Even from just looking at them, he knew that this magic was unlike any other. The pictures of the book he had picked up, Healing Hands, showed a carefully detailed charcoal picture of hands and a glowing golden orb above them, stained with precision into the parchment paper. Was this what Old Magic was? So old and powerful, not even a wand needed to be used?
</p><p>
He hesitated, remembering the reason he had gone to Gringotts. A wand.
</p><p>
He held out the phoenix feather again, watching it hum in his hands, inching along his palm. Harry looked up, to see where it was trying to go, and was met with the boxes of wands. It looked like more than six dozen were there, every single box with a wand from the hands of his elders, no doubt placed in those related to the Peverells and taken. Or were these from the before times?
</p><p>
There was a small stone slab with a round circle imprinted in it. Harry considered it for a moment, then carefully placed the phoenix feather in it. It glowed, and he placed his hand to the stone. A soft rumble caused him to look up. A dozen of the boxes had inched out of their places and slowly hovered and settled on the ledge in front of him.
</p><p>
Some of the boxes were blackened with soot and ash, and one box was damaged with what seemed to be acid marks. Others were clean, if dusty, and had no such damage.
</p><p>
He looked at them
</p><p>
The first box was a deep, bloodied red stained with a rust-colored liquid. A strip of parchment on it read this; "Cap of Namira's Rot, Bone."
</p><p>
The second was a deep yellow like old ivory, and read this; "Werewolf &amp; Vampire fang core, Yew. Was favored by Hewn-kiln, no last name. A werewolf who served as part of the Dawnguard, Kewn-kiln used this wand sparingly after he had it made, for, as he put it, 'it had a tendency to suck the life from his enemies, regardless of who, or what, they were.'"
</p><p>
The third was a soft, stained blue with a rich parchment that read this; "Hagraven Feather, Birch. Originally favored by Penet Gaunt, seconded by her son Petre. Penet mostly used bow and arrow as her weapon, and had this wand made for her son from a Hagraven she killed. Petre used it until his death at the hands of a dragon which fell upon the farm that he and his family lived on outside of what used to be Markarth. It was scavenged later by his youngest daughter, who never used it."
</p><p>
The fourth was a wooden box carved with animals he did not recognize. It read this; "Gleamblossom &amp; Bear Claw, Elder Beech Tree. Made and used by the alchemist and mage Go-Shei Dawnshield, who was an Argonian ancestor of the Gaunt family. It passed down until it was later used by his three-greats granddaughter Metil Gaunt, who was one of few who managed to mix Potioneering and Alchemy to create a cure to a disease, killing it off entirely."
</p><p>
The fifth was a leather-bound box with burn marks. The parchment was relatively intact, and read this; "Dragon, Daedra &amp; Human Heartstring, Blackthorn handle &amp; Chestnut. Made and used by the warrior mage Meec Potter, who slayed one of the Last Dragons, earning his family the title of Duke of Rain's Shield, a now magically-guarded area in the northeast of England near the Scottish-english border."
</p><p>
The sixth was a soot-covered once-white box that read this; "Powdered Mammoth Tusk &amp; Human Heart, Handle of Mammoth Bone, Old Oak. Was favored by the son of Meec Potter, whose name was Katter-pier Potter. An accomplished hunter, he used what he thought to be a deer's heart in his wand, and was surprised when the wand  held far more power than a deer's heart would provide."
</p><p>
The seventh was in good condition, made of wood painted with red stain. It read this; "Scathecraw, ancient Maple. Was used by a young mage, Melina Gaunt, who liked enchanting and alchemy. She used the odd, claw-like thing she had found to make a wand, and was surprised at its efficiency in not only tiring her opponents, but afflicting odd effects to them as well."
</p><p>
The eighth was a black box with no decoration at all. It had no paper to tell what it was.
</p><p>
The ninth was made of carved stone, with gold lining the rims. It read this; "Skeever Tongue, Carved from large antlers and capped with pearl. Favored by Judas Silver-blood, who went on to marry to Melina Gaunt after she beat him at a duel, to which she floored him."
</p><p>
The tenth was carved from a huge bone or tusk of something, with strange carvings he could not read. It read this; "Unknown Mixed Blood, Dragon's Horn. Said to be taken from the Throat of the World's ruins, this wand is carved with the ancient language of dragons, and strengthens the voice, applying spells cast with it the power of Thu'um. It was used by a Greybeard's son, who followed the Way of the Voice under the Great Grey Dragon until the Throat of the World fell."
</p><p>
The eleventh was sooty, carved with feathers and made of wood. It was splattered in soft pock marks that told of acid. It read this; "Frostbite Venom &amp; Spider's Fang, Rotted Pine. Was used exclusively by a strange alchemist who was never named, who was said to tame spiders. It is rumored that the alchemist even tamed an Acromantula. She married a young tailor who was named Jacon Potter, and bore one child before she willingly died when her husband passed away by drinking a mixture of spider's venom."
</p><p>
The twelfth was burnt badly, so much that a corner was nearly burnt through. It still smelt singed, and like old incense. It used to be brown, and the thin, soft leather that once covered it was burnt away. There was no parchment on it. This box, he noted, was slightly longer than the others, too.
</p><p>
So, which one should he choose?
