  <i>"This is the story of how I died."</i>

  <i>"Don't worry, he means it figuratively."</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Do I, Rem?"</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Yes Sev, you do."</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Ah, good morning guys!"</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Good morning Lil's."</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"What are you doing?"</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Telling a story."</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Attempting to at least."</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Watch out!"</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Are you okay?"</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Yeah... "</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Sev will you carry on with the story as I help Lil's clean up the spilt orange juice?"</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Fine. So I guess we begin..."</i>

  <b>One summer ago</b>
</p><p>"Good afternoon, class! Now, those of you who have been keeping up with your studies should be soon able to cast a Patronus!"</p><p>Remus groaned inwardly at Professor Akechi's words. It was almost the end of the unit, and so far, he had only been able to create a small blue wisp.</p><p>Sure Prongs and Padfoot had been able to fully cast theirs- a stag and dog respectively. Wormtail was the only one bedside's him who can't.</p><p>He didn't know why. Most of it was thinking of a single happy memory, and he had plenty of those. So why was it so difficult?</p><p>He watched as their DADA Professor started eating a lolly, seeming just as bored as himself.</p><p>But a few seconds later, he saw two does dance in mid-air before his eyes. Surprised and a little jealous, he looked toward the casters.</p><p>"Now Lily, you don't need to cast the spell twice."</p><p>This had been Prongs.</p><p>Lily looked puzzled. "But I didn't. I didn't, did I Sev?"</p><p>Remus risked a glance at her best friend, the Slytherin sitting beside her. He could see Snape doing his best to remain stone-faced, but he was really only drawing attention to himself.</p><p>And then Remus understood. Snape had cast it. Snape had been able to cast a Patronus despite all the stuff his friends put him through. He didn't know why he was so happy to know this, or why he even cared. But he was proud.</p><p>And with this happiness, he felt more powerful, more confident, and he felt as if he could cast the spell. So he did. "Expecto Patronum!"</p><p>And for the first time ever, he saw his Patronus. And it wasn't what he thought it would be.</p><p>But then he realized.</p><p>The memory that cast it wasn't of him hanging out with his friends; it wasn't finally going to Hogwarts. It was just now and it wasn't even his memory.</p><p>And then he realized even more. Severus wasn't just some "evil Slytherin" he was forbidden from interacting with, or the bullied victim Remus saw who still tried to fight till the end. He was...</p><p>And then it happened.</p><p>Pain engulfed Remus and he bent over his desk, retching. His friends crowded around him worriedly, asking questions he couldn't answer. Because he couldn't stop coughing. His lungs were on fire and his heart racing.</p><p>And then, just like that, it stopped. And the only proof of what happened was a pure white flower petal.</p><p>He could hear some people gasp around him but he couldn't see. Professor Akechi let his friends take him to the hospital wing.</p><p>He pulled away from them once they were out into the hall, taking a step back. "Guys, I'm fine!"</p><p>"Are you sure, Mate?"</p><p>Remus had been able to convince them to go to the library instead. And that's when they found it. And then he knew for certain.</p><p>During that following summer, he only continued to get worse and Prongs kept begging him to take the potion.</p><p>The potion.</p><p>The potion that would cure him. But it could also possibly erase his memories of the person he loved. And erase his ability to love, forever.</p><p>So obviously he refused to take it, coughing up petals and feeling awful.</p><p>
  <i>This was just the beginning.</i>
</p><p>It was the beginning of Snape's Fifth year and everything was going smoothly.</p><p>
  <i>As smooth as it can when everyone hates you, anyway.</i>
</p><p>"Hey, Sev!"</p><p>Severus smiled softly as his best and only friend passed by him on her way to class.</p><p>
  <i>Everyone except Lily.</i>
</p><p>As soon as she turned a corner, a coughing fit overcame him and he leaned against the cold stone wall for support. A few people turned to watch but most ignored the Slytherin as he wheezed, his lungs and throat growing sore for a few minutes before a stinging sensation crawled up his throat, and then-. He finally opened his eyes, gasping slightly for breath.</p><p>A single yellow flower petal drifted towards the ground. He hastily snatched it before anyone saw.</p><p>
  <i>I'll go to the library after class.</i>
</p><p>He thought.</p><p>
  <i>I don't know what the hell just happened, but it must be some sort of prank.</i>
</p><p>The next class Severus had was History of Magic with the Ravenclaws.</p><p>As soon as he got in, he quickly headed for his seat, getting his second-hand books out and setting up his inkpot and quill. Though this was merely for show, as even he couldn't possibly focus in this class.</p><p>Especially not after he just coughed up a flower petal.</p><p>
  <i>Why?</i>
</p><p>It was, to say the least, peculiar.</p><p>
  <i>Maybe it's a prank.</i>
</p><p>He thought.</p><p>
  <i>Yes, a prank! That must be it. Another prank intended to hurt and humiliate me.</i>
</p><p>Later on, Severus coughed up another petal, in the Courtyard this time.</p><p>
  <i>Why does it hurt so bloody much?</i>
</p><p>"Are you okay?"</p><p>Even with all the pain he felt inside his chest, he tensed up, whipping out his wand only to point it at two boys, a Gryffindor and a Slytherin.</p><p>
  <i>Second-Years.</i>
</p><p>He didn't know what they were trying to do, but he wasn't going to fall for this.</p><p>He recognized the Slytherin from his own house. Duncan Ashe, the idiot who kept asking to copy his homework all bloody last year.</p><p>He glanced at Ashe, before looking at the Gryffindor. Severus didn't know him but knew OF him. Jacob Miles, the kid who was obsessed with finding these Cursed vaults or whatever. Frankly, he didn't care.</p><p>"Do you need to go to the Hospital Wing?" Miles asked annoyingly.</p><p>"I'm fine, thank you very much." Without glancing back at the two, he walked away, not wanting to walk into whatever prank or trap they've set. That was the only reason most people pretended to care about him, after all.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn't get a chance to go to the library until supper time.</p><p>He rushed there without eating, wanting to find the counter spell way more than having dinner.</p><p>But as he reached his destination, he sensed danger and quickly turned around, hitting his target with a spell.</p><p>"Oof!"</p><p>He narrowed his eyes when he saw the Marauders approach him. Most of the marauders anyway. The werewolf wasn't among them.</p><p>Potter quickly recovered from the spell. "Hey Snivellus," he smirked.</p><p>Severus raised his wand again.</p><p>"I heard that you coughed up a flower petal."</p><p>"None of your business Potter!"</p><p>"Ah, but why aren't you in the hospital wing? Surely you know that this disease will eventually kill you," he smirked again, backing Severus into the corner, blocking all of his curses. Severus held his wand shakily.</p><p>"You don't know anything," he spat.</p><p>"I know that you've gotten Hanahaki," Potter laughed cruelly. "Quite embarrassing really. How would you feel if I told everyone about your predicament? Everyone already hates you, to know that the slimy snake developed feeling for one of them!"</p><p>"Whatever are you on about Potter?"</p><p>Snape fell to the ground as Potter kicked him hard, a raw pain spreading throughout his body. He stubbornly struggled to not show any of the pain he felt.</p><p>Potter leaned in close. "Evans is mine, got that Snively? You don't stand a chance."</p><p>Before he could register any of the words Potter had said, the group had disappeared.</p><p>Gasping, a jolt of pain pulsed in his stomach as he took in air, his lungs on fire.</p><p>Then Lily appeared, her dark red hair glowing beautifully against the torches. "Sev! What happened?"</p><p>"Oh!" he failed to stop the slight blush that went to his cheeks as Lily helped him up. "Studying!"</p><p>"Studying?" she raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"Yes, er- I was studying the ground!" he nodded, hoping that Lily believed a word he said.</p><p>"Okay," she nodded, seeming to believe it, although her eyes suggested otherwise.</p><p>Still, he tried to act like he was fine. "Anyway, I was going to do some research. Do you want to perhaps... join me?"</p><p>"Of course," she smiled sweetly, and Severus's heart beat a mile a minute. "What are best friends for?"</p><p>And then his heart fell painfully.</p><p>They went in together and immediately went to an undisturbed spot.</p><p>"You can't tell anyone what I'm to share with you, please," Severus whispered anxiously.</p><p>"I promise," she reassured. "Is it for a potion you invented?"</p><p>He shook his head and shakily placed the red-spotted yellow flower petal in the middle of the table.</p><p>She looked at it concerned. "Is- is that blood?"</p><p>"Yes," he affirmed. "Believe it or not I coughed it up this morning."</p><p>Lily quickly drew her hand away disgusted and a bit worried. "Coughed it up?"</p><p>"I was hoping to figure out the reason why," he explained.</p><p>They poured over dozens of books. Books on plants, herbs, curses, and ghosts, until Severus started coughing again, ending up with another petal that was slightly smaller than the first.</p><p>"Sev, maybe we should go to the Hospital wing-."</p><p>"No! I'm fine, honestly Lily," he quickly reassured her.</p><p>They poured over more books with Lily glancing at him every few minutes.</p><p>"Wait- I think I found it!" she exclaimed happily before reading it.</p><p>
