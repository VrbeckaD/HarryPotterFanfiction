    <p>The frayed hat on the stool finished its last rhyme. The song ended. Everyone in the room started clapping. </p><p>He clapped politely along with them, but he didn’t quite know what to think. His mother would never have allowed any item of clothing in such poor condition in her home, much less allow anyone in the house to wear it. Clearly Hogwarts had different values. He wasn’t exactly upset at the thought.</p><p>When the hall was silent once more, Professor McGonagall pulled out a lengthy list. “When I call your name, please step forward, sit on the stool, and put the hat on.” She cleared her throat. “Adams, Liam.”</p><p>The short, blonde boy stepped out of line from behind and walked up the hall. He sat and put the hat on, wrapping his fingers tightly around the edges of the stool. He closed his eyes.</p><p>The hall waited in silence before the Sorting Hat shouted, “RAVENCLAW!”</p><p>The Ravenclaw table cheered and the other houses clapped along with them. The boy, Liam, rushed to join his housemates.</p><p>“Andrews, Mia” was sorted into Hufflepuff along with “Archer, Kyle,” and a Gryffindor whose name he didn’t catch was close behind. “Avery” was the first Slytherin to be sorted, but he couldn’t for the life of him make out what his first name was.</p><p>“Bennett, Hailey,” the professor called. She was sorted into Ravenclaw.</p><p>They were on the B’s now. It wouldn’t be long before his name was called. The nerves were starting to kick in.</p><p>He glanced around the Great Hall, searching the faces. There, at the Slytherin table, his cousins sat; all of them in a row, watching the ceremony intently. They didn’t seem excited like the rest of the room. Just watchful. Cold, calculating, already planning who they would and wouldn’t associate with, no doubt.</p><p>Narcissa met his eyes across the room. She nodded slightly, an almost imperceptible gesture. Confirmation that moments from now he would be sitting with them, just as had always been planned.</p><p>He tore his gaze away from the Slytherins and looked towards the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws, all watching and whispering amongst each other. None of them turned towards him.</p><p>He studiously avoided the Gryffindor table, though he could feel someone’s gaze boring into his back.</p><p>Desperate to look anywhere other than that table, he craned his neck to the ceiling to look amongst the stars. He searched for his namesake, but it soon became clear that the enchantment did not mirror the real night sky. Even with years of experience studying astronomy, there wasn’t a single constellation he recognized.</p><p>“Black,” he heard. His throat tightened. “—Bellatrix.”</p><p>He calmed for a moment, letting himself relax, though he knew that he was undoubtedly next.</p><p>Bella only bought him a few seconds’ time. The hat had barely touched her head before a booming “SLYTHERIN!” rang out.</p><p>The Slytherin table erupted in applause. Narcissa actually stood, smiling a little. Had he not known that Narcissa’s celebration was one of approval and not genuine happiness that her sister would be her housemate, he might have been touched. The other houses clapped too, though clearly less enthused.</p><p>When the noise died down, Professor McGonagall’s voice sounded once again. “Black, Regulus.”</p><p>Regulus’ heart started pounding wildly in his chest. His hands were shaking, so he flattened them against the sides of his legs and schooled his face into a mask of calm. His cousins were watching. They could not know how much this frightened him.</p><p>If he wasn’t a Slytherin, what would his mother do? And if he was, how would his brother feel? Would he be upset that he hadn’t been a Gryffindor like him? Would he be jealous or resentful?</p><p>He walked up to the stool. Every step was agonizingly slow. He sat down and squeezed his eyes shut. The old fabric settled onto his head.</p><p>"Well, well, another Black," the hat whispered in his head. "But different from the rest. What to do with you, what to do with you?"</p><p>Regulus was starting to panic. He had to be a Slytherin. He had seen what his mother had done to Sirius now that he was in Gryffindor. The beatings, the bruises, the cuts. Sirius was stronger than he was. Sirius could take it, but Regulus... Regulus was not like his brother. He did not have that kind of strength.</p><p>"There’s intelligence there, and a big heart, too, larger than you want people to see. And that desire to be good enough for... who? Your mother? Yes, that’s it, there’s that familiar ambition I see. Slytherin would do you good, and you would be a great asset."</p><p>Yes, Slytherin, thank God. He would be a Slytherin.</p><p>"But what’s this? There’s courage in you, I think more than you see. Perhaps you belong with your brother in Gryff—"</p><p>Not Gryffindor, Regulus thought. Please not Gryffindor. Sirius’ anger he could stand. It would be awful, but he could deal with it. His mother’s wrath? Never.</p><p>"Are you sure? Gryffindor could make you great, you know. Help you fight for—"</p><p>Not Gryffindor.</p><p>The hat paused, giving no further comment. “SLYTHERIN!”</p><p>The applause was even louder for him than it had been for Bella. All of the Slytherins were screaming. The Black legacy had been reinforced, proving the heir to be a mere outlier. A mistake.</p><p>But it was not to the Slytherin table that Regulus first looked. For the first time that evening he searched for his brother at the Gryffindor table, quickly looking through the bored-looking students, clapping politely for yet another Slytherin Black.</p><p>He was a Slytherin, just like all the others, leaving his brother alone in Gryffindor. What would Sirius think?</p><p>There. Near the middle of the table on the left was Sirius and his friends.</p><p>And he was standing and cheering louder than anyone else in the room.</p><p>Regulus flashed a secret, relieved smile towards his brother before schooling his features and making his way to the Slytherin table. Narcissa scooted to the left, making room for him between her and Bella. Regulus had to wonder if she had shifted that way purely to put space between herself and her younger sister.</p><p>He sat down, squeezing in between his cousins. The hard part was over.</p><p>Bella grabbed his shoulder. Regulus stiffened. He had always been perturbed by her knack for invading his personal space.</p><p>“First day and you’re already better than Sirius,” she giggled. He hated it when she giggled.</p><p>“Right,” he said, feigning a weak laugh. Regulus looked back across the hall to find Sirius still smiling at him. His stomach churned. “Already better.”</p>
