  <strong> An owl in my living room</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>A large eagle owl glared into the living room of 12 Grimmauld Place. It’s incessant tapping put a stop to Hermione’s studying. Why were there so many distractions? All she wanted was half an hour without Sirius or Harry harassing her about going to the pub or asking what they should have for dinner.</p><p>She opened the window. The owl hopped inside onto the window sill, then with one great flap settled on the back of the ornate sofa. Hermione approached it cautiously, it was the biggest owl she had ever seen and did not look particularly friendly. She selected some owl treats off the mantle and exchanged them quickly for the letter. It hooted as it gently relinquished the message.</p><p>The letter was sealed with a beautiful red wax monogram. Initials DM. She groaned and rolled her eyes. Of course, who else would have such an ostentatious owl? Draco Malfoy— he had actually responded to her letter. </p><p>She sat down on the couch, contemplating not opening it. If it was good news, she could stop worrying and go back to studying in a good mood. However, if it were bad news, she knew she wouldn’t be able to focus again. She turned the envelope over in her hand several times, admiring the quality of the paper and the lovely handwriting. Probably written by his house elf.</p><p>The owl suddenly hooted behind her making her jump in her seat. She felt it’s large yellow eyes glaring at her. “I’m assuming you’re waiting for a reply, Mr Owl?” she said. The owl creepily turned it’s head all the way around to look out the window then all the way back, resuming its unblinking stare. “Okay…I think I’ll just read the letter.”</p><p>She opened the envelope, breaking the perfect seal and unfolded the letter, she couldn’t help but smell the paper,  fresh parchment and jasmine.</p><p>
  <em>Dear Granger,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I received your correspondence and regret to inform you that you are most certainly stuck with me for the potions project. I am aware you asked Professor Slughorn to swap partners, but as stated in the assignment instructions— all partnerships are final— bad luck for you.</em>
</p><p><em>On a positive note, I have the perfect project for us. Your suggestion of doing an advanced Wolfsbane potion is admirable, however many Potions Masters have tried and failed at this. I don</em> <em>’t think it is our best option for success, we, as the top students need to set an example by having an exemplary potion that is both innovative and flawless. </em></p><p>
  <em>I have a potion in mind that could be beneficial to both of us, and I believe it to be revolutionary. I do not want to write the details in a letter so I shall await a meeting in person to discuss this further. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>I hope you have had a pleasant summer.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>See you at school in a few days.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Best regards</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Draco Malfoy</em>
</p><p>She re-read the letter twice. How could he have a potion better than advanced Wolfsbane? Probably because he doesn’t want to be seen helping werewolves. That Malfoy family set of skewed morals— can’t be seen helping the halfbreeds. She scoffed at the thought. She was surprised at his willingness to work with her. She thought the letter would go one of two ways— either him outright refusing to work with her and calling her a mudblood, or him dividing up the work, so they worked separately then collaborate the end. She certainly didn’t expect outright co-operation. Maybe it would be different once she got to school. Perhaps his changing sides in the war had had some sort of magical, positive effect on him.</p><p>Her train of thought was broken as Sirius apparated into the room with a loud crack, followed by a series of curses as he knocked over a lamp and ungracefully stumbled onto the couch.</p><p>“You aren’t meant to apparate when you’ve been drinking Sirius, especially when you came from the kitchen!” Hermione said, setting the lamp in its rightful position.</p><p>“I know, but it’s more fun this way. I get to surprise you.” Sirius replied as he poured himself a firewhiskey from the bottle into a glass conveniently located next to him.</p><p>“Why so serious? What’s with the giant owl?” Sirius asked as he leaned back into the chair.</p><p>“It’s from Malfoy,” she sighed. “He wrote back to me. Looks like I’m stuck with him and he didn’t like my project idea. Apparently, we have to do what he wants.” Hermione slammed the letter onto the side table and folded her arms. The owl took a few side steps closer to her causing her to shuffle further across the couch. “I think he wants me to write back,” she whispered.</p><p>“Let me read it.” Sirius grabbed the letter and read it out loud in his best impression of Malfoy. It was terrible since he didn’t actually know Malfoy at all. Hermione giggled, forgetting she was angry for a second.  “Okay here’s what we’ll do— I’ll write to McGonagall and tell her it is unacceptable for you to be forced to work with a Death Eater after everything you’ve been through. Especially after what happened at the Manor. Then I’ll write to Malfoy and tell him where to shove his project.” Sirius said, suddenly very determined. He stormed over to the writing desk and started hunting for a quill and parchment, opening draws at random.</p><p>“No Sirius, thank you for the offer, but I can look after myself just fine, I don’t need you fighting my battles,” Hermione said as she leaned over Sirius taking the quill from his hand and opened the correct draw to retrieve the parchment. She quickly scribbled a note, leaning on the desk next to Sirius. Sirius pretended to sulk before remembering his whiskey and returned to the sofa opposite the stare of the looming owl.</p><p>Hermione finished up the note and handed it to the owl along with a few extra treats. She had a strong sense to stay on the right side of this creature. The owl held up its wings as it hopped back to the windowsill, leaving a flurry of papers in its wake as it launched itself out the window.</p><p>Hermione scrambled to pick up the papers. As she sat up, she saw Sirius shaking his head at her. “You agreed to meet with him, didn’t you?”</p><p>“Of course I did. He deserves a chance at least— everyone does. You never know, his idea might be a good one.” Hermione said as she re-stacked her papers. Sirius moved to the other sofa to sit next to her, he smelled of fire whiskey and cologne.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have to work with that scum, he shouldn’t even be allowed back at school! As soon as he steps out of line tell me and I’ll take care of him. Don’t you worry.” Sirius said. Hermione turned to face him, moving to sit cross-legged.</p><p>“I’m not scared of him Sirius. Honestly, you don’t need to worry about me. When I’m back at school I can look after myself— like we agreed, we can go back to living separate lives,” she said trying to catch his eye so he knew she meant it.</p><p>“I know, I know,” he said, putting his arm around her pulling her closer, “Harry will have to look after me now. Too bad his cooking’s shit,” Sirius joked as he planted a kiss on the top of her head. Hermione smiled and looked up at him.</p><p>“You’ll be just fine Sirius, and I’ll find Crookshanks again and all will be well,” she said optimistically. Hoping very much she would find that orange ball of fluff again. Sirius <em>accioed</em> anther glass and the firewhiskey bottle over to their sofa. He poured her a small amount and topped his own up.</p><p>“Here’s to you and an uneventful, boring school year filled with assignments and exams.”</p><p>“Cheers to that!” Hermione said, very much hoping that would be the case.</p><p>“But you can always ask me for help you know?” Sirius said. “I do worry about you. If you feel a cruciatus attack coming on call me, send your Patronus and I’ll be there. Or at least tell Ginny or someone else. I’d feel better if someone was there looking out for you.”</p><p>“I’ll tell Ginny,” she said, wanting to change the subject. “Let’s not worry about this now. I was meant to be studying before you, and that owl distracted me!”</p><p>“You’ve got all year to study. Drink with me before you leave me alone and abandoned.”</p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “I’m sure you won’t be alone for very long Sirius. You have a way of finding company.” She realised she had a drink in her hand. “You’re a terrible influence on me! I’m going to stop drinking when I go back to school, then maybe I’ll get something done.”</p><p>The rest of the afternoon was spent drinking and trying to pack Hermione’s books and school supplies. There were several failed attempts at undetectable extension charms on her new bag.  Sirius was no help at all. Near dinner time Harry arrived home with fish and chips, he was greeted by two enthusiastic, drunk housemates who were very hungry.</p><p>Hermione poured Harry some firewhiskey as they sat down at the large kitchen table to eat. Harry had been smiling non-stop since he arrived. Hermione was sure it wasn’t due to her or Sirius.</p><p>“What’s up Harry? You seem unusually chipper.” Sirius said as he made a half sandwich with some hot chips.</p><p>“I broke up with Ginny,” Harry said. Hermione and Sirius glanced at each other.</p><p>“Um— are you okay. I mean— I guess you are. You look really happy,” Hermione said.</p><p>“It’s for the best, she’s going back to school, I’ve started Auror training. We’d never get to see each other, and I’m feeling pretty good about this. Free— you know?” Harry said.</p><p>“I guess this is a celebration then,” Sirius said.</p><p>“Here’s to a fresh start to all of us,” Hermione said, raising her glass to toast the others.</p><p> </p>
