    <p>
  <span>“... This one I believe I know. Leta Lestrange, despised entirely among wizards… Unloved, mistreated ...yet brave. So very brave.” Grindelwald took a step closer to Leta, gently taking her hand. His voice was soft, gentle even, with a slight smile on his face. Leta couldn't help but shudder because she knew that look. That was a look of understanding. “Together, we can right your sin, Leta. I can bring back Corvus.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leta--” She felt Theseus grab her hand, could hear the desperation in his voice even over the raging of the blue fire. But her eyes were focused of the dark wizard in front of her who had the slight smile intact on his face. “Countless have tried, nothing can bring back the dead. Corvus is </span>
  <em>
    <span>gone</span>
  </em>
  <span>!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Theseus grabbed her arm, gentle yet firm and was trying to drag her back. Leta shrugged him off. Her full attention was on the dark wizard. She could hear her heart beating rapidly against her ribcage. Excited and yet terrified of the prospect of correcting her mistake, of reviving her little brother, Corvus.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How would you do that?” Leta asked, biting her lips worriedly. As much as she wanted to believe it, she couldn't help but ask. She needed to wash away the doubt in her heart. “No one has yet managed to raise the dead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Newt couldn't bear to watch it anymore. He had to do something. He had to try to convince her it was a bad idea. No matter how good it sounded, it was nothing but an empty promise. He took a step down from behind his brother whose hand still held her arm firmly, trying to drag her back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leta, I know it’s hard to forgive yourself, but what happened to Corvus was an accident!” His voice broke as he said it. He wanted to reach her but couldn't.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta ignored him too, focused on nothing but Grindelwald and the crackling of the flames. Her mind reeling about the possibility. If Corvus could be brought back then her wicked, selfish choice she made that night could be forgiven. </span>
  <em>
    <span>She</span>
  </em>
  <span> could be forgiven. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are wise to doubt, to question,” Grindelwald chuckles, amusement dancing in his eyes. She shuddered once more as she could see the approval in his eyes. “My research has gone farther than any wizard has ever gone into necromancy. I have an entire lab waiting for you, Leta, as well as a special mission…” Grindelwald inhaled from the skull hookah and then blew, once again, they were in a vision…</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>It was </span>
  </em>
  <span>her…</span>
  <em>
    <span>. She was cuddling a baby, soothing his cries. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“It’s all right, Corvus,” vision-Leta was saying as she rocked the baby. She smiled fondly at the baby. “You’re safe. I will always protect you...”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Vision-Leta began to sing him a lullaby, rocking him to sleep once more. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Remembering that promise only solidified her will to followed him. To correct her mistake. For her little brother, Corvus. She clenched her teeth and stared straight on Grindelwald's eyes and gave him a slight nod. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta could feel the pair of gazes behind her, of two men whom she loved dearly in different ways. She didn't want to leave them, especially Theseus, but for her little brother's sake, she had to. She drew a deep breath and let it out. Without looking back at Theseus and Newt, she said to the pair of them, “I love you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She allowed Grindelwald to steer her down the steps of the amphitheater, to the blue fire. She could hear Theseus’ screams, telling her to stop, to come back. And it hurt her. She could hear the pain in that voice and she knew she was the one who had caused it. She swallowed the lump in her throat as he kept begging her to come back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wished she could heed Theseus’ cries but she couldn’t. If she turned back, she knew her will would waver and part of her wanted to turn around and head back to his arms. She gritted her teeth, trying to suppress the wave of emotion that threatened to overwhelm her. She wanted to go back to Theseus so badly, but she couldn't.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She couldn’t live with the guilt anymore. Sometimes she felt like the weight of Corvus’ murder might </span>
  <em>
    <span>kill</span>
  </em>
  <span> her. The weight made it hard to breathe. It was too much, </span>
  <em>
    <span>too much.</span>
  </em>
  <span> And Corvus was her little brother, she just wanted him to grow up, safe and sound the way he should have. If there a way, if Grindelwald could help her achieve that goal, then it had to be correct. It was the correct way. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It washed away the hint of doubt in her heart which was a good thing, they were fast approaching the ring of fire and already Leta could feel the heat, she knew that the flashing of the blue light must have lit up her irises. It was right before them, the heat blistering, and she stepped through, knowing that this was the only way to give her baby brother a second chance. The chance he deserved.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The flames </span>
  <em>
    <span>hurt</span>
  </em>
  <span>. They licked at her body, trying to tear her apart. She screamed from the pain and she heard someone else screaming--</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Theseus</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His scream hurt her more than the fire ever could.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A vision entered her mind, of a castle in the snow capped mountains, and this she knew was were Grindelwald needed her to go. Without hesitation, without looking back to see the looks of hatred that she knew would be on the faces of the Scamander brothers, she Disapparated. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The room Leta arrived in was empty, save for a blonde woman in a black dress with matching sharp heels wearing vivid red lipstick. She was pretty, yet there were bags under her eyes: she looked as though she had not slept in days.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The room itself was very fancy, much more than the rooms Leta had grown up in at the Lestrange estate. She turned around, scanning her surroundings. Above the two women was a crystal chandelier, the windows were made of stained glass, the carpet below their feet was a rich velvet. The realisation dawned on her that she had arrived at the lap of luxury. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you’re new, too,” the woman said, sounding disappointed as she puckered her lip. Her accent was unfamiliar and Leta tried and failed to recall where she had heard that accent. “I figured it was best to wait here for instructions, but if you just got here as well, you probably don’t know what’s goin’ on anymore than I do.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta wasn’t sure how she knew that Leta was new, but she was still too stunned to feel like responding. Now she was here, in the castle surrounded by eternal snow, the enormity of her choice hit her, </span>
  <em>
    <span>hard.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She had left him behind, Theseus, who loved her unconditionally. The person who loved her regardless of the rumours surrounding her, who had accepted her not for her blood or family but her own self, whose smile was always ready for her and whose embrace gave her a sense of safety. She had betrayed Theseus. A question entered her mind with a pang in her chest.  </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What if she couldn’t bring Corvus back?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She clenched her fist, determined. There was only a way to make amends. Failure would not be an option, not after she betrayed someone who loved her dearly. She would be the first person to bring someone back from the dead, and no one would be more deserving than her baby brother. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He promised you you could bring someone back from the </span>
  <em>
    <span>dead</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” said the blond woman, sounding stunned. Leta raised her head in an instant, her eyes widened in surprise as the woman’s words sunk in. “That ain’t supposed to be possible, but he does seem to have powers other wizards don’t…” She sounded disbelieving, yet unable to believe it was a lie. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something was wrong. How did this woman know so much about her? They’d only known each other for less than a minute. The blond woman looked at her with such an odd expression, it was as if she was looking through her mind. Shudders ran through her body as she stepped backward out of fear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Realization hit Leta. She knew, but didn’t want to believe it. The idea that someone could see the worst of her deeds was horrifying, it was as embarrassing as if someone in school had asked her to strip naked and run through the halls of Hogwarts. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Worse</span>
  </em>
  <span>, in fact.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How are you reading my mind?” Leta snapped as she took another step backward, her left hand gripped her right arm tightly, trying to stop the trembles. “Stop it!” The last thing she needed was a stranger knowing that she had murdered Corvus. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You </span>
  <em>
    <span>killed</span>
  </em>
  <span> someone?” The blond woman responded, voice wobbling with fear, and yet her prying bloodshot eyes still on Leta. She backed away from Leta, much as Leta had backed away from her a second ago, hands at her mouth. There was a long silence, where she seemed to stare into Leta’s soul before she spoke up again. She lowered her hands, her body language relaxing. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Oh</span>
  </em>
  <span>… It was an accident. You switched your little brother with another baby, and then he was swept away. Well, that ain’t your fault, honey. You didn’t know it was going to happen, you--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta did not even care that she was being kind right now. That woman exposed her mind bare without her consent. She wouldn't allow it any longer. She cut her off immediately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I said STOP IT,” Leta said, trying to emphasised her point. Her eyes glaring daggers at the rude blond woman. Leta was livid. It was one thing to have the gift of reading minds but using it without consent toward her was unforgivable. She had no right, none at all. It made her wonder at all if she was ever taught the ethics of using that power or not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The blond woman looked as though she’d been slapped and Leta couldn't bother about it. She was being rude and laid down her past, her sin as if it were a normal thing to brought up in conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I could, I would,” her voice was cold. She crossed her arms, now glaring back with the same intensity Leta had. The bags under her eyes, the dark rings around them, looked even more contrasted now. “I was born this way. I can’t turn it off, although believe me, an off switch would be nice--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A familiar voice stopped her from finishing her sentence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ladies, ladies, arguing is no way to show team spirit!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grindelwald stode into the room. The slight, almost amused smile once again on his face. He had changed his clothes. He now wore a grey striped suit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Leta, this is our Legilimens, Queenie Goldstein. She’s new, just like you,” Grindelwald said, putting one arm around Leta and another around Queenie. Like they were one big happy family. “And Queenie, this is Leta Lestrange. I have charged her with studying necromancy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Queenie’s face flew into a look of wariness at the sound of her name. Leta couldn't help but swallow the lump in her throat in bitterness. Great, so her reputation had traveled overseas. She crossed her arms and tightened it around her body. And the blonde woman added to the unending list of people who hated Leta based on her family name and rumours.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not that she cared about it. She was used to the look on the blonde woman’s face. It was all too familiar. Even though it hurt at the beginning but as the years passed she had grown desensitized to the looks of hatred, of dislike. It was her constant companion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There is no need for you to patch things up, sir,” Leta sighed. She was tired already and wanted it to be done soon. She was still reeling from  the woman’s rudeness and the realisation that she had betrayed her fiance, not that she had right to call Theseus that anymore. “I’m used to people reacting with disgust when they met me. You could say I have embraced the bad girl stereotype. I didn’t come here to be loved by all. I came here to save my brother.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But I don’t wish for you to simply be tolerated, Leta,” He looked to the two women. His voice was soothing, as if trying to calm the raging storm. Or trying to calm two bickering sisters. “Both of you have left behind people who you love to join glory. One day, they will understand and we will bring them to our side, but for now someone who understands not being understood by those that love you may be a comfort, yes?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grindelwald tilted his head and looked Queenie in the eye. There was a silence before Queenie nodded and a smile once again found its way to his face. Queenie smiled back, but it was a fake smile. Her cheeks were tight, and her eyes were glassy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Queenie I have just shown you were your bedroom is, as well as Leta’s. Please show her to her room. Both of you get a nap, a bath… Then, Queenie, met me at Credence’s room. I need you to tell me what is wrong with the boy. He has been silent ever since his arrival.” Grindelwald clicked his tongue, unamused, before his gaze turned to Leta as he continued. “Leta, I will be in touch once you’ve had time to settle in.” He glanced at Queenie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Queenie… Do not worry about Jacob. In time, he’ll understand. If anyone can work things, out, is the two of you. Leta, the same goes for you and Theseus. He </span>
  <em>
    <span>will</span>
  </em>
  <span> understand.” His eyes staring at Leta and she nodded in understanding. Grindelwald spared them a smile before leaving them alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Queenie said, cutting through the thick silence as Leta began to employ Occlumency. She sounded congested, as though developing a cold. “Let’s go.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Queenie did not speak to Leta on their walk to her room, Leta supposed it might be due to her blocking Queenie out or maybe how harshly Leta had reacted to her Legilimency. Leta observed her. Queenie’s hands trembled. Her face was pale despite the elegant makeup. And yet, Leta felt no remorse; She did not appreciate having her brain snooped through like a child’s toy chest and her sin into a conversation, casually, as if they talked about the weather. Perhaps they would have to get along another day, since Grindelwald seemed determined for them to be friends, but it did not have to be </span>
  <em>
    <span>this</span>
  </em>
  <span> day. No matter how petty it sounded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here is is,” Queenie finally said, voice tense, hands gripping each other so tightly they turned even more white if such thing possible, stopping in front of a door that had a sign on it that read LETA in gold letters. “Well, just think loudly if you need me. After everything that’s happened today, I need that bath he mentioned. I’ll see you later I suppose…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With that she trotted off, high heels clicking against the stone floors of Nurmengard. Leta was certain she heard a sob echo down the hall, perhaps when Queenie had </span>
  <em>
    <span>believed</span>
  </em>
  <span> she was out of earshot. She scoffed and thought, </span>
  <em>
    <span>how naive. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta swung open the door to her room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was just as lush as the room she had met Queenie in; more velvet rugs, another chandelier, her bed was piled with thick, warm-looking blankets, and a set of glass French doors led out to a balcony. There was even a fireplace with two chairs sitting in front of it. She couldn't help but wonder how rich Grindelwald was. She thought her family estate was already fancy but the room from before and her own room proved otherwise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leta waved her wand at the fireplace and a fire began to crack merrily, providing heat to counter the chilly mountain air. She scanned the room before her eyes fell on a certain thing. Her eyes widened as she approached it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even though there were amazing things in the room, the one that stuck her the most however about the room was not the ornate fireplace, or the crystal chandelier, it was the photos on the nightstand next to the bed. There was one of herself as a little girl with Corvus as a baby, another of herself and Newt at Hogwarts, and a more recent one of herself and Theseus. She couldn't resist a watery laugh that come from her mouth. That was a laugh of relief.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was those photos that comforted Leta. She was understood, and welcomed here. He knew who she loved, was even trying to help her make friends. Her eyes lingered on the photo of herself and Theseus. After a moment, she took the photo from the nightstand and tried not to cry. She caressed gently the smiling Theseus in the photo before putting it back in the nightstand. She closed her eyes and let out a long sigh. He would never forgive her for what she had done today, she was certain of that. She knew she didn't deserve his forgiveness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She picked up the silver-framed photo of herself and Corvus. The baby Corvus sleeping soundly as her child self smilef shyly to the camera. Her tears fell one by one on the photo.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will save you, brother,” Leta said, tightening her grip on the photo. Determination clear in her tears-filled eyes. “I don’t know how, but if anyone has a way, it is him.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grindelwald gave her a way. The </span>
  <em>
    <span>only</span>
  </em>
  <span> way. No one would offer her a solution to her mistake, only Grindelwald. Even though the person she loved would hate her, she had to try, for her little brother, Corvus. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And she cried, letting out the feelings she had been repressing, away from everyone, protected by the stone walls surrounding her, until she felt tired and slept with her head resting on the nightstand while holding the silver-framed photo dearly as if it would disappear if she let go.</span>
