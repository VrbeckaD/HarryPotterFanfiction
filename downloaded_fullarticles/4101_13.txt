    <p>Newt's return to New York, nine moths after his last visit, has the self-proclaimed magizoologist standing on deck of a great steamer, leaning against the railing eagerly watching the Statue of Liberty edge closer and closer.</p><p>He wraps his faded Hufflepuff scarf tighter around his neck and wishes he had brought up his gloves from the case.</p><p>"It seams it is always cold and windy when we arrive in New York", he mumbles towards his coat's breast pocket, where Pickett has sought refuge against the biting September wind.</p><p>There is no answer from the Bowtruckle and Newt sighs gently. "Asleep again – are we?"</p><p>He checks his case, making sure that the new claps are tightly shut and then sets is down next to his feet.</p><p>It had taken a lot of arguing and persuasion from both the Ministry of Magic and his publisher so the MACUSA would allow his case back into New York City.</p><p>Additional to that he had been informed before leaving Liverpool that a MACUSA officials would be waiting for him at the harbour after he had gone through customs.</p><p>Newt heaves a sigh. "You'd think I let them loose on purpose by the fuss they are kicking up."</p><p>There is reproaching muttering heard from his coat and he can't help but smile. "Don't worry, Pick, I would have smuggled you in regardless of their decision."</p><p>The Bowtruckle pokes his head out of his hiding place and nods satisfied. He than points at something and his chatter becomes worried.</p><p>Newt looks up and sees that they are about to dock at the harbour, "They won't search my coat, Pickett, but you can wait in the case if you want", he adds and chuckles knowingly when the Bowtruckle retreats into the pocket. "Thought so."</p><p> </p><p>Customs are a dull, quickly sorted out affair and soon Newt stands at the gates of the harbour and wonders if the MACUSA has either forgotten him or is playing tricks on him. He can't imagine neither of it.</p><p>So he paces along the harbour fence, attracting a good deal of attention and slowly getting a headache thanks to Pickett's anxious chatter when he is suddenly stopped by a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>"Mr. Scamander?"</p><p>He turns and finds himself standing face to face with a young man, who looks dimly familiar. He tightens his grip on his case, while using his free hand to cover the pocket that contains Pickett. "Yes?"</p><p>The men looks nervously down to where Newt clutches his case and then back up to Newt. "My Name is Abernathy. I am here to escort you to the Woolworth Building."</p><p>Now Newt remembers where he has seen Abernathy before. "Don't you work for the Major Investigation Department.?"</p><p>Abernathy stands a little taller. "That I do indeed. Madam President personally asked me to make sure you would arrive at MACUSA in one piece and without <em>losing </em>anything again."</p><p>Abernathy's emphasis on the word "losing" has Newt's temper raising quickly.</p><p>"I didn't lose them", he clarifies with unusual harshness. "They got lost because your department chose to ignore Miss Goldstein's warnings."</p><p>To his credit Abernathy looks quite sobered by Newt's display. "As you might be aware Miss Goldstein received an apology and has been fully reinstated at her former position."</p><p>Of course Newt knows this. He had been present when Madam Picquery had informed Tina of her reinstatement and Tina had thanked him for it; but he also thinks that a gentle reminder of how the MACUSA has mistreated Tina in the past can't hurt.</p><p>"I heard of it", he tries to sound nonchalant but he doesn't completely succeeds.</p><p>With Queenie's letters – that tell of Tina's successes and how happier the older Goldstein sister seems – fresh in mind a bit of pride seeps into his voice.</p><p>Abernathy pointedly clears his throat. "Shall we?"</p><p>Newt nods and the two so different men set out for Broadway and the headquarters of MACUSA.</p><p> </p><p>When they arrive in the lobby of MACUSA Abernathy stirs Newt in the direction of a small coffee shop.</p><p>"You can wait there." And he is gone.</p><p>Newt shrugs his shoulders and trots towards an empty table.</p><p>He just sets his case down when he catches a glimpse of the woman behind the counter. He jerks so abruptly upright that Pickett gives an angry shriek but Newt already is leaping towards the counter. "Queenie!"</p><p>The woman turns around and nearly drops the jug of milk she is carrying. "Newt! Mercy Lewis! What <em>are </em>you doing here." She hurries around the counter and is just about to hug him when she stops short. "Is Pickett still camping out in your coat pocket?"</p><p>Newt smiles lightly and nods, "Yes, but he won't mind a gentle hug." With that he surprises himself and hugs the blonde close.</p><p>"It's good to see you again, Queenie", he mumbles shyly when they part.</p><p>Queenie giggles. "Oh I'm happy too, honey. Do you want to see Teenie?"</p><p>And without waiting for an answer she practically drags him across the lobby towards the lifts.</p><p>"But doesn’t Tina needs towork?" He pants and panic-y grabs his case.</p><p>"Oh honey she will want to see you anyway." Queenie looks down at his case and a strangely wistfully smile appears on her lips. "So has the Niffler rem-sacked an other bank, yet?"</p><p>Newt can't help the small laugh that escapes him while they enter the lift. "No they are all where they belong – and please don't give that pest any ideas, will you?"</p><p>Queenie giggles along with him and nods. "Oh don't worry." Another glance towards the case. "How's Dougal?"</p><p>Newt smiles brightly. "He's very good, thank you for asking, tough I think he might be a bit lonely."</p><p>Queenie's smile falters a bit and Newt bites is lip – that was inconsiderate of him. According to Tina's letters Queenie still misses Jacob quite a bit.</p><p>"Sorry", he mumbles and lies a hand on her arm. "I miss him too."</p><p>They share a sad smile as the lift shutters to a halt.</p><p>Newt falters slightly when he becomes aware of the hustle that is the main corridor of the MID and swallows. "Maybe I'll be back later..."</p><p>Queenie throws him a dazzling smile and takes his arm. "Nonsense. They won't bite."</p><p>With that she navigates Newt expertly through the mass of witches and wizards.</p><p>"See that wasn't that bad, was it?" Even so her tone is teasing her smile is understanding and she pats his arm lightly. "It's gonna be fine. Teenie's desk is right over there, next to the second window." She points towards a big open office space and Newt feels the colour drain from his face. "I'm sure she doesn’t want to be interrupted."</p><p>Queen pats him on the arm rather condescendingly. "You are a big boy, honey. You can do it." With that she gives him a gentle but nevertheless firm shove. "I have to get back to my own work." She turns and throws him an impish smile.</p><p>Newt swallows, tightens the grip on his case and sets of in the direction of the desk of one Tina Goldstein.</p><p>He is barley half-way there when Pickett chatters happily and he detaches his gaze from his shoes to look ahead.</p><p>Tina is just making her way back to her desk from the left side of the room and will cross his path in about a minute.</p><p>Newt's heart falters when he sees her in deep conversation with a young man.</p><p>"Ow!", he mumbles when Pickett pinches him not so lightly through his coat.</p><p>Tina stops abruptly and looks up – her face a mixture of astonishment and unwillingness to believe her own eyes – unconsciously mirroring Queenie perfectly.</p><p>"Newt? Mercy Lewis of course it's you. I'd recognise this case anywhere." Then she suddenly blushes and closes the short distance left between them in one wide stride. "No. That sounded completely wrong." She glances at him unsure and seems to be rather unconformable – not exactly how Newt had envisioned their reunion.</p><p>"Hello Tina", he mumbles warmly and offers her his free hand as a greeting. "I'm sorry to come by so unannounced but Queenie practically dragged me here."</p><p>Tina shakes her head, smiling fondly, finally shaking his hand. "That sounds indeed like Queenie. She's been giddy with excitement ever since you told us your arrival date."</p><p>Now Newt smiles fondly too, but can't help the sting he feels at her word – no mention if she had also been looking forward to seeing him again.</p><p>Tina seems to realise that at the same moment and hurries to assure. "Not that I wasn't looking forward to it myself." Then she huffs exasperated. "This isn't exactly going well, is it?"</p><p>Newt just shrugs and throws her a hopefully encouraging smile. "Well I did surprise you after all."</p><p>Tina smiles back and then turns to the man she was crossing the room with. "This is Miller. He's my new parter."</p><p>Newt offers Miller a handshake too, "Newt Scamander. Nice to meet you."</p><p>Miller grins at him. "Ah so you are that guy with the animals. I read about your book in the papers."</p><p>They shake hands and Miller turns to Tina. "I can cover the reports. If you'd like to take an early lunch, Goldstein."</p><p>Tina looks and Miller, than at Newt and back to Miller, who nods firmly. "Go on, I really don't mind."</p><p>Finally Tina shrugs and nods as well. "Okay than. Thanks Miller." She taps Newt on the forearm. "Stay right where you are. I'll just get my coat."</p><p>Newt nods and is left on his own after Miller winks at him and saunters off to what seems to be the desk next to Tina's.</p><p>He is still pondering over the man's weird behaviour when Tina reappears at his shoulder.</p><p>"All set, let's go."</p><p> </p><p>They end up at a little restaurant across from Newt's rather run down looking hotel.</p><p>Tina frowns and turns to him the moment they have found a table in the back of the restaurant. "You could stay with me and Queenie." Her voice drops lower. "Your hotel really looks quite shabby to be honest."<br/>
Newt just chuckles. "I think it's my publisher's way to make clear he isn’t happy with me right now."</p><p>"By getting you a shabby hotel?" Concern filters into her impression just as the waiter arrives with their food.</p><p>Newt nods, smiles shyly at the waiter and takes a big gulp of tea before answering. "Yes, he wanted to start with the promotional tour in London. I on the other hand made it quite clear it <em>had</em> to start here in New York City." Another sip of tea and Newt sets the cup down rather forcefully. "I am aware that you Americans prefer coffee over tea but this", he nudges his cup with his index finger, "concoction can hardly be called tea."</p><p>Tina is still shocked over his first statement and so misses the jab at the American cuisine. "You had a row with you publisher because you wanted to come here first?"</p><p>Newt shrugs his shoulders. "I wouldn't call it a row...it was a misunderstanding."</p><p>Tina takes a sip of her coffee and finds it as excellent as always. "But Newt....why does it have to be New York." Only after she closes her mouth it dawns on her that she might be the reason and she feels like a complete fool.</p><p>But Newt grins boyishly and takes a healthy bite out of his sandwich. "Well I did promise to deliver your copy in person." To late he realizes it might have been not a good idea to speak around a mouthful of bacon, eggs and salad when an elderly woman shoots him a scandalized look.</p><p>"Sorry", he mumbles after gulping the massive bite down and coughs. "I'm afraid I sometimes forget my manners."</p><p>But Tina waves his apologies away. "No problem." She falls silent for quite some time and Newt starts to worry he did something wrong when she suddenly gasps.<br/>
"There is something special about that book, right? This is why you needed to come here first."</p><p>Newt grins, pride forming in his chest and he nods happily. "Exactly. You are quite sharp, Miss Goldstein. Ever considered becoming an Auror?"</p><p>Tina shoots him a not so amused look and suddenly leaps to her feet. "I fear I need to head back. We are slightly short staffed at the moment and I can't leave Miller to cope with the paper work on his own."</p><p>Newt suppresses his disappointment and schools his features into a smile – after all Tina is an Auror and can't spent her days sitting around eating launch with him.</p><p>"I'll escort you back." He stands as well, drops – what he hopes is the right amount of money - on the table and offers her his arm, after retrieving his case from under their table. "Shall we, Miss Goldstein?"</p><p>Tina shakes her head at his antics, but smiles softly when she takes his arm. "We shall, Mr. Scamander."</p><p> </p><p>The sun is just setting over New York when Newt sneaks past Mrs. Esposito and up the stairs to the Goldstein sisters' flat.</p><p>He stops short just when he is about to knock and becomes aware of the voices in the flat. One is definitely Queenie's but the other one also definitely doesn’t belong to Tina.</p><p>He just made up his mind just to leave and come back later – because Queenie's business is hers alone – when the door is wrenched open.</p><p>"You'll never make it back past Mrs. Esposito." Queenie whispers harshly. "Come on in before she sees you."</p><p>He is dragged into the flat despite his arguments and Pickett's angry chattering. "Don't read my mind, Queenie."</p><p>The blonde witch just shrugs and pushes him down on a chair. "You think quite loudly for someone so shy."</p><p>Newt blinks uncertain and whips around when he hears a low and masculine chuckle.</p><p>"Mr Kowalski?" He shakes his head. "I mean Jacob. Never mind – Merlin's beard what are you doing here?" He stops his ramblings – the sudden silence feels quite loaded - "Do you remember who I am?"</p><p>A grin breaks out on Jacob's face. "Of cause I remember who you are." His grin becomes slightly crooked and he nods towards Newt's breast pocket. "So that little guy still has attachment issues, hm?"</p><p>Newt glances down and sees that Pickett looks at Jacob and chirps quite happily. He smiles. "Ah yes I fear he will forever stay with me." Then he frowns confused. "So you remember <em>everything</em>?"</p><p>Jacob shrugs and crosses the small living room to sit opposite from Newt. "Yes by now. At first it was just flashes and odd dreams." He smiles when Pickett climbs out of Newt's pocket and sits on the polished table top. "The thing I remembered most vividly at the beginning were your creatures.", he chuckled looking slightly embarrassed, "I'm even baking Niffler-shaped pasties and everything."<br/>
But Newt feels oddly proud and beams at his friend. "Do your costumers like them?"</p><p>Jacob nods with enthusiasm. "Oh yes especially the kids. The adults prefer my", he drops his voice. "Bowtruckle formed bread."</p><p>Pickett chirps sharply and Newt laughs. "It's an honour Pick – Jacob makes money with it." The Bowtruckle crosses his spindly arms and turns away form the baker.</p><p>Newt shrugs and grins insecure. "We are working on the sulking."</p><p>Jacob laughs just as the clock chimes the half hour.</p><p>Queenie looks up sharply from preparing dinner. "You should leave, honey."</p><p>Newt blinks confused but scoops up Pickett. "Alright."</p><p>But Queenie shakes her head and looks slightly downcast. "Not you – Jacob. Tina doesn’t know about us."</p><p>That would explain why Tina hasn’t mentioned anything about Jacob remembering them.</p><p>"But why?", he wonders while Jacob shrugs into his coat and kisses Queenie on the cheek.</p><p>Queenie sighs and straightens Jacob's tie, "Because I'm technically seen a criminal and Tina works for the law enforcement." She talks more to Jacobs coat lapels than to any of the men. "And I rather not have her arrest me."</p><p>Newt just sits at the table and can't look at either Queenie or Jacob. He feels stupid for asking in the first place now. He <em>knows </em>about the law that forbids any relationships between magical folks and muggles in America and <em>of cause </em>Queenie wouldn't risk Tina's position at MACUSA.</p><p>He just opens his mouth to apologize when Queenie cuts across it. "There is no need to feel so bad about yourself, honey. You aren't responsible for that stupid law. But you are right 'bout Teenie. She just got her old job back and I'm not going to jeopardize that."</p><p>Newt nods and resolve settles into his stomach. "She won't hear it form me."</p><p>Queenie looks troubled. "I don't want you lying to her on our behalf. It's bad enough that I have to."</p><p>But Newt shrugs. "As long as she doesn’t ask. And how likely is that?" When Queenie still looks troubled he smile at her. "Try not to worry – in the end worrying means that you suffer twice."</p><p>When Jacob chuckles loudly Queenie turns to him and smiles lightly. "Sounds familiar?"</p><p>Jacob nods, still chuckling and nods at Newt. "Thanks, pal."</p><p>Newt smiles back and stands to shake Jacob's hand. "It was good to see you, again. Perhaps I'll have a look at those pastries myself tomorrow."</p><p>Jacob grins and claps Newt firmly on the back. "That'll be grand. Say hallo to Dougal from me, will you?"</p><p>Newt nods. "Sure. He will appreciate that."</p><p>With that Jacob kisses Queenie goodbye – Newt not knowing where to look – and slowly, carefully makes is way down the stairs and past Mrs. Esposito's flat.</p><p>Queenie and Newt remain standing at the front door for a moment than the blonde shakes out of her motionlessness and returns to preparing dinner.</p><p>Newt shrugs out of his coat, lies it over the back of a chair and then wanders aimlessly trough the living room for a moment before sitting down on one of the sofas tentatively.</p><p>Suddenly Queenie jerks and turns around. "I'm being a terrible host. Would you like a drink or a little snack? I usually wait for Teenie before eating dinner."</p><p>Newt smiles. "I'm not that hungry yet – I had a very wholesome lunch. But I wouldn’t say no to a nice cup of tea."</p><p>Queenie positively <em>smirks. </em>"Good thing I brought a pack of tea yesterday." She throws him a look. "Would you mind making it yourself? Neither me not Teenie are fond of tea that much."</p><p>Newt jumps to his feet. "No not at all."</p><p>He crosses the short distance and picks up the tea tin. "That is quite the expensive brand. That really wasn't necessary."</p><p>Queenie shrugs. "The salesmen highly recommended it."</p><p>Newt nods and quietly makes himself a cup a tea and only becomes aware of Queenie's stare when he fishes out the stewed tea leaves.</p><p>"Is there something wrong?"</p><p>Queenie blushes. "I just presumed you'd do it with magic."</p><p>Newt chuckles lightly. "My mother always insisted that tea tastes better when it is done by hand and I must say I agree with her. Somehow tea leaves and magic doesn’t work well together."</p><p>"Why is that?"</p><p>"I have not the faintest idea and all my research wasn't very informative."</p><p>Queenie looks puzzled at first than shakes her head and passes Newt a piece of carrot. "Eat it. I can hear your stomach rumble from here."</p><p>Newt blushes and then bites a tiny piece off and gives it to Pickett, who now sits on his shoulder. "It's not fair that you can read minds and have good hearing. But really I'm going to be fine until dinner."</p><p>Queenie chuckles just as the door opens and Tina enters the flat with windswept hair and rosy cheeks. "The weather is absolutely <em>horrible. </em>We better make sure that the windows are shut tight over night." She hangs her coat on the coat rack and tosses her hat carelessly onto one of the sofas. "I could do with a cup of hot chocolate right now."</p><p>She turns towards her sister and Newt and smiles when she sees Newt feeding Pickett pieces of the carrot. "No wonder that the others accuse of favouritism when you feed him by hand."</p><p>While Newt grins bashfully Queenie just huffs. "It was meant to be for him. I couldn't concentrate with his stomach rumbling."</p><p>"I told you – I will be fine until dinner."</p><p>Queenie just rolls her eyes and shoos Newt towards one of the sofas. "Now get out of my way; otherwise I'll never finish dinner."</p><p>Newt chuckles quietly, picks up his cup and does as he is told – nearly sitting down on Tina's hat.</p><p>"So sorry!" Tina rushes forward to take her hat back but Newt turns it curiously around with on hand – the other one is still holding his cup of tea – and grins cheekily. "Perhaps I should have bought you a new hat and not a book."</p><p>Tina snatches her hat out of his grip with a scowl - but a smile tugging at her lips – while Queenie positively <em>chokes </em>on her suppressed laughter.</p><p>"I've been trying for months to take her shopping for a new one", she explains once she has recovered enough to speak. "But Teenie stubbornly insists that she doesn't need a new one."</p><p>"Because it's true I don't need a new one", the elder sister mumbles and absent-mindedly picks at one of the bigger holes. "I quite like the one I got to be honest."</p><p>Newt thinks he detects something else in her tone beside the obvious fondness for a well-liked piece of clothing but doesn't know what to say, so he keeps his mouth shut.</p><p>Tina places the hat on the iron gate in front of the roaring fire and whips her wand out to make herself a cup of hot chocolate.</p><p>"You'd like one as well?", she ask Newt over her shoulder but he just raises his cup of tea. "No thank you. I'm all set."</p><p>Tina finishes her drink, carries the self-stirring mug over to Newt and plops down next to him with a heavy sigh. "Let me tell you the lunch break with you was the highlight of my day."</p><p>Newt looks over to her – ignoring Pickett's demands for more carrot – and smiles shyly. "I'm honoured but since the food was okay and the tea undrinkable the rest of your day must been hell."</p><p>Tina looks at him with raised eyebrows. "I really don't know if you are trying to be humble or if you are really that dense. I meant your company not the food! Although the coffee was excellent."</p><p>Newt flushes scarlet and Queenie breaks into another round of hysterical laughter. "Believe me he really meant what he sad."</p><p>"Don't read his mind." Tina abolishes her younger sister lightly when she becomes aware of how flustered Newt looks.</p><p>Queenie just shrugs. "I already told Newt and I will tell you: his thoughts are unusually loud for someone so shy."</p><p>"That is not an excuse." Tina throws Queenie another scolding look and takes a deep gulp of her hot chocolate. She relaxes and sighs contently. "That's better."</p><p>Queenie's face falls and Newt puts a hand on Tina's forearm. "It's okay. I know Queenie won't use anything she sees in my mind to hurt me. It just needs time to get used to it."</p><p>Tina gives him a calculated look while Queenie <em> beams </em>at him. "You are to kind, honey." A quick glance at the clock. "Do you want to feed your creatures now? Because dinner will still take some time."</p><p>Newt nods, stands and finishes the last of his tea in one big mouthful. He then lays his suitcase flat on the ground next to the sofa and has already opened one of the claps when a thought crosses his mind.</p><p>He looks up from his kneeling position and smiles at the sisters. "Would you like to accompany me?"</p><p>Tina's nod and smile are small and gentle while Queenie is almost shinning with excitement.</p><p>"I'll be right back", she announces and vanishes into the girls' bedroom,</p><p>Newt shrugs and undoes the second claps before gently opening the lid. "Stay were you are - Mum's going to be down in a minute."</p><p>He hears Tina chuckle and shrugs self-consciously. "I started it when I found Dougal and then it somehow stuck."</p><p>"I find it sweet somehow. And why not? You are taking care of them and feed them like a mother would do." This time her smile is wider and more open. "I think it's an appropriate nickname to give yourself."</p><p>Newt swallows and becomes aware that he is still kneeling on the floor. Hastily he jumps to his feet just as Queenie reappears in the living room.</p><p>"Found it", she grins and turns away from Newt when he wants to have a look at the object clutched in her hand, "it is not for you, honey."</p><p>Tina and Newt exchange a puzzled look and begin their descend into Newt's case after Tina finishes her drink and sends the cup to the sink with an absent-minded flick of her wand.</p><p>When all three of them are standing between Newt's clutter and well organized chaos Newt passes Tina a bucket full of Mooncalf pallets and tentatively holds a platter with fruits and vegetables out to Queenie. "It's for Dougal if you don't mind."</p><p>Queenie smiles. "I'd love to feed him. Tough I doubt I would find the way on my own."</p><p>"I wouldn't ask you to."</p><p>With that Newt leads his friends out into the open space of the suitcase and smiles sadly at Frank's empty enclosure. "It's somehow not the same without him." He sighs again and then shakes his head. "He is better off in Arizona – that's where he belongs." He sighs. "I know I should remodel it for the next creature, that might need my help, but I can't bring myself to do it yet."</p><p>He shakes his and turns to make his way towards the Gaphorns when the Niffler hops across the sandy floor and hurries up his trouser leg to try to dive into his pocket.</p><p>"Why in such a hurry?" Newt catches him before he can fall to the ground scrambling to find a hold on Newt's waist coat.</p><p>The Niffler turns around in his hands and sniffs the air around him searchingly.</p><p>"I got nothing for you", Newt apologizes softly. "I'll bring you something tomorrow."</p><p>But the Niffler isn't dented in his search and seams to find a trace suddenly, squirming in Newt's grasp and stretching in Queenie's direction.</p><p>The blond witch giggles and opens her fist – relieving a pair of glittering ear rings. "Good thing I bought something then."</p><p>Newt's eyebrows rise in bewilderment and he sets the Niffler down as Queenie crouches in the sand without a care in the world.</p><p>"That really wasn't necessary of her", he mumbles to Tina and watches with a fond look how the Niffler looks from the ear rings to Queenie and then slowly reaches out a paw to gently take one ear ring.</p><p>The Niffler looks at the piece of jewellery – turning it over and over in paw – and then stuffs it hurriedly into his pouch with a quick glance in Newt's direction.</p><p>Queenie giggles delighted and offers the Niffler the second ear ring. "It's alright take it. They are for you."</p><p>The Niffler makes a happy sound and lets the ear ring slide into his pouch to join his other treasures.</p><p>Queenie gives the pitch black creature on last smile, rises to stand next to Tina and quite carelessly flings off a bit of dust from her knees.</p><p>"He really is quite sweet, isn't he?" She watches the Niffler scuttle back to is burrow and smiles at Newt. "Ah it was nothing, honey, I wasn't wearing them any more."</p><p>Newt throws her a grateful smile and sets out for the Graphorn enclosure once more. He hops onto on of the large boulders at the entrance to the sandy plane and roars the familiar call. Then he jumps back down and turns towards the sisters. "I've got a brand new little calf – only a few days old."</p><p>The family of Graphorns gallops into view and Tina makes a soft cooing sound at the back of her throat when the smallest of them makes an unsteady bee line for Newt.</p><p>Newt laughs and drops to his knees so he can rub the calf's flank and check his eyes at the same time.</p><p>"That all looks perfectly fine. Just as it should be. You are one healthy little chap, aren't you", he mumbles gently and looks at Tina, while Queenie tentatively edges closer to one of the older calves.</p><p>"Do you want to pat him?" Tina smiles and takes a step forward just to have the calf make a stressed sound.</p><p>"You should make yourself as small as possible, best you also kneel." Newt whispers and Tina slowly eases herself to her knees until she is kneeling so close at Newt's side that their elbows nearly brush against each other.</p><p>"That's perfect", he mumbles even lower. "Flat out your hand and rub him between his horns. It's the way Graphorns establish a mother-calf-relationship."</p><p>Tina smiles and turns her hand so her palm is facing downwards and gently lays it on the calf's head.</p><p>The Graphorn makes an almost purr like sound and Tina giggles softly. "You like that, little one?"</p><p>Newt watches Tina patting and cooing to the little creature and something warm and fuzzy blooms in his chest. He smiles softly and eases himself back into a standing position. "I'll feed the Mooncalves then."</p><p>Tina looks up. "Sorry but he's just so cute."</p><p>Newt chuckles lightly and takes the bucket. "I know." He passes Queenie on his way to the rocky Mooncalf territory and laughs when he sees to younger Graphorns in a play fight. "It seems they are trying to impress you."</p><p>Queenie, who is sitting on one of the large rocks grins at him. "For looking so fierce they are quite sweet."</p><p>Newt frowns. "Only because they are used to humans by now. Normally they are not so docile."</p><p>Queenie looks at him intrigued but Newts lifts the bucket. "Sorry I'm a bit on a feeding schedule, exceptional with the Mooncalves because they are nocturnal."</p><p>Queenie jumps up and grabs the platter of fruit. "Of cause. I'll help you."</p><p>They both look over to Tina, who now sits cross-legged on the sandy floor – the calf's head in her lab.</p><p>Queenie giggles. "Let's give those two a bit of privacy, shall we?"</p><p>Newt chuckles too and can't help the goofy smile on his face while he walks over to the Mooncalves and throws them their food.</p><p>The small creatures flock around him even more eager than usual to get their share. "Yes, yes I know I'm a bit late today and I'm sorry about that." The Mooncalves hop around him nearly toppling over in their haste. "Easy boys I wasn't that late. You will choke if you keep this up." He throws the last hand full of food and sets the bucket down. "Now it's back to your burrow it will be morning soon."</p><p>He turns when he hears quite laughter behind him. Tina stands on the path leading to the Mooncalves and shakes her head. "We are inside a transfigured suitcase and you still insist on a regular sleeping pattern?"</p><p>Newt feels himself blush and makes his way towards her, the empty bucket swinging at his side. "Well I can also control if it's day or night for them, And right now they need sleep so it's going to be day." He draws his wand and with a quick turn of his wrist the sun starts raising over the Mooncalf territory.</p><p>"That is quite impressive, Mr. Scamander."</p><p>His blush intensives and he rubs his empty hand on the side of his trousers. "Thank you, Miss Goldstein."</p><p>The silence that follows is rather awkward until Newt clears his throat. "I should have a look how Queenie is doing with Dougal."</p><p>Tina nods and side by side they make their way towards the Occamy and Dougal's swing.</p><p>When they arrive Queenie sits next to the Occamy nest and is feeding Dougal by hand while the Demiguise in turn feeds the Occamys with insects.</p><p>They both look up when they hear Tina and Newt approach and Queenie just shrugs when Newt raises his eyebrows questioningly. "He looked so sad so I thought a bit of extra attention couldn't hurt."</p><p>Newt walks over to Dougal to stroke his head, while Tina helps Queenie back to her feet. "Did you have fun, old boy? Back to your nest now. I'll take it from here."</p><p>The Demiguise looks at Newt and pats his cheek before he swings up into his nest and settles for the night.</p><p>Newt looks at him for a moment, wishing one again there were some way to know what is going on in the creature's head and then turns to the Occamys. "Mum's here now."</p><p>But it looks like Dougal has done a good job feeding them because instead of gulping down the insects that Newt throws them the Occamys just play with them.</p><p>Newt huffs, straightens and durst of his hands on his trousers. "Looks like between you two and Dougal I'm not needed around here any more."</p><p>When Tina and Queenie start to protest he only grins. "Well okay that might have been a bit melodramatic."</p><p>While Tina shakes her head but smiling fondly Queenie takes Newt's arm and bumps her shoulder against his side. "I never realized that you have a sense of humour."</p><p>Newt looks at her and frowns. "Most people find my jokes....weird."</p><p>Tina appears on his other side and shrugs. "Maybe you haven't found people with the same sense of humour yet."</p><p>The three of them cross the suitcase back to Newt's shed – Newt checking on the other creatures in the process – and then climb back up the ladder and reappear in the Goldstein flat.</p><p>While Queenie checks on the roast in the oven and starts with the vegetables Newt picks up his overcoat and searches his pockets.</p><p>After a few minutes of fruitless searching he frowns. "I <em> know </em>I put it in here." He glances at Queenie – still occupied with dinner – than at Tina, who is leafing rather unenthusiastically trough today's The New York Ghost and turns his coat up-side down and shakes it rather forcefully.</p><p>Queenie jumps when the contents of Newt's coat pockets hit the flat floor while Tina looks up startled. "What are you doing?", she ask and jumps up to pick up some of the things, "got confused where up and down is?"</p><p>Newt chuckles. "No. I just can't remember where I put your book."</p><p>Tina freezes, holding something that looks suspiciously like half of an Occamy egg. "Oh."</p><p>Newt, kneeling among the mess on the floor, smiles at her. "I don't want to forget giving it to you. Which is a distinct possibility if the roast tastes as good as it smells."</p><p>Tina smiles back and picks up his thick notebook. "Haven't been eating well lately?"</p><p>Newt stuffs a crumbled package of wood lice back into one of his pockets and shrugs. "I'm not the best cook and my time was well packed with all the revisions and last minute changes my publisher wanted to make to the layout and what not."</p><p>Tina lies his notebook carefully on a beside table and holds up a handful of sparkling green scales. "Mercy Lewis is that what I think it is?"</p><p>Newt looks up from checking his pockets again. "If you are thinking that those are from a dragon you are right."</p><p>Tina narrows her eyes. "Those are non trade goods. Class A non trade goods even." She drops the dragon scales back on the floor. "Really Newt last time you caused havoc because you..." She looks at Queenie and quickly back-paddles. "And now you bring forbidden goods with you."</p><p>Newt chuckles. "As you will find quite soon only dragon <em> eggs </em>are considered non trade goods. Not the scales."</p><p>"As I will find out soon?" Tina mumbles bewildered but at that moment Newt proudly holds aloft his book and she laughs, "Ah I see."</p><p>Newt hands her the book with flourish and a little bow. "Here you go, Miss Goldstein. The first book that was ever printed."</p><p>Tina takes it with shaking fingers and exhales unsteadily. "Oh Newt that wasn't necessary. You should have given it to your mother instead."</p><p>Newt ducks his head and smiles crookedly. "Without you I would still be stuck without a title. See it as payment in kind."</p><p>Tina opens her mouth but than thinks better of it, as she catches Queenie shaking her head at the stove. "Thank you so much. I'm really looking forward to reading it." She lets her hand glide over the midnight blue cover and her eyes rest on his name, embroidered in smaller silver letters than the title. "I'm proud of you, Newt."</p><p>He looks startled. "Thank you....I....", he swallows nervously and looks with wide eyes at Queenie.</p><p>The blonde jumps to his rescue. "Okay guys. Let's eat. Newt's stomach will kill him otherwise."</p><p>Tina jerks out of her trance and lies her book atop Newt's notebook. "Alright." She gets to her feet and flicks her wand to set the table.</p><p>Newt is a bit lost for a moment but then shrugs into his coat and stuffs his materials, bottles, vials and stray animal feed back into his vast pockets.</p><p>"Going somewhere, Mr. Scamander?" Queenie grins. "Pie or strudel?"</p><p>Newt chocks out a laugh, "I really don't have a preference", he flicks a glance at Tina. "As long as you don't poison me."</p><p>Queenie breaks into giggles while Tina rewards his jibe with a bright smile and gestures to the same chair Newt had occupied during his last visit. "Well sit down. I promise that there is no poison involved."</p><p>Newt takes of his coat again and this time he hangs it on the coat rack next to Tina's and drops on the offered chair.</p><p>He takes a deep breath and sighs happily. "It already smells divine, Queenie."</p><p>Queenie beams. "We really should keep him, Teenie. He's such a charmer."</p><p>Newt blushes right red and busies himself with the food instead of looking at one of the sisters.</p><p>He hears Tina sigh. "Queenie leave him be. I think we embarrassed him enough already."</p><p>"You are not embarrassing me." Newt puts down his cutlery quite forcefully. "I'm just not used to the company of friends any more."</p><p>Now both of the sisters beam unguardedly at him and Queenie grips his hand firmly in her own. "Don't worry, honey. You will get used to your friends again."</p><p>Newt makes eye contact with Tina and grins widely when he sees that her smile still hasn't faded.</p><p>She nods. "Queenie is right. We are all oddballs here."</p><p> </p><p>After dinner is eaten and the plates are washing themselves in the sink Newt and the Goldstein sisters settle down in front of the fire.</p><p>Newt is just opening his notebook to jut down some ideas for a hopefully second edition when the thick book is plucked out of his fingers.</p><p>He is already starting to voice his disagreement when Queenie hushes him with a finger pressed to her lips and nods towards Tina.</p><p>The older sister is just gingerly opening Newt's book and begins thumping through it gently.</p><p>Newt's breath catches in his throat and suddenly his palms are so damp with sweat that he has to wipe them off on his trouser legs.</p><p>Queenie pats his arm soothingly but doesn’t say anything to not disturb Tina.</p><p>Only when Tina looks up and blinks a few times to adjust to the dim light Newt works up the courage to ask softy: "So what do you think?"</p><p>Tina looks at him and smiles brightly. "It's wonderful! Did you do the illustrations?"</p><p>Newt nods. "Oh yes and it was quite the fight so my editor wouldn't replace them with something better."</p><p>Tina shakes her head. "That would have been foolish. They are brilliant. Very....", she seems to search for the right words, "they are very you."</p><p>Queenie giggles and opens her hands. "Pass it along, Teenie. I want to have a look too."</p><p>But instead of throwing the book over to her sister, as Queenie would have thought, Tina gets up and lies the book almost reverently into Queenie's hands. "Be careful. It's really brand new. The spine still cracks when you open it."</p><p>Queenie turns the book over in her hands and then grins at Newt. "Looks good indeed. " When she comes across the first of his hand drawn pictures she smiles gently. "Teenie is right. Those are very you."</p><p>Newt shrugs uncomfortably. "I still don't know what you mean with that."</p><p>Queen frowns than shrugs. "It's hard to explain", becoming aware of Newt's unhappy face she adds:" But it is <em>definitely </em>a complement."</p><p>Newt grins a bit bashfully. "Thank you. It started out as mare doodles when I had problems finding the right wording or something and I complete forgot about them until my publisher pointed them out during one of our meetings."</p><p>Tina, looking over Queenie's shoulder, raises her eyebrows. "You call those doodles? Then I'd like to see a real drawing from you."</p><p>Newt laughs. "No you don't. It doesn’t get much better than this."</p><p>"I still find them sweet." Queenie closes the book and passes it back to Tina. "I'm sorry to spoil the mood but I'm tiered and we haven't talked about sleeping arrangements yet."</p><p>Newt shakes his head quickly. "That won't be necessary. My publisher got me a hotel room." He looks at Tina when she huffs. "Really it is better than it looks from the outside."</p><p>Queenie narrows her eyes at him and this time Newt can <em>feel </em>her reading his thoughts deliberately.</p><p>"Not so bad?" The blonde exclaims after a few silent moments. "That looks quite awful. I'm sure between the three of us we can think of something."</p><p>Newt looks straight at Queenie, taking advantage of her mind reading abilities for once. <em>I wanted to visit Jacob tomorrow.</em></p><p>The blonde smiles faintly but nonetheless pleased. "You know Teenie it would be quite bothersome to keep him hidden form Mrs. Esposito all the time."</p><p>Tina nods, clearly not happy and relents. "Yes you are right." She turns to Newt and something hopeful enters her eyes. "Maybe we could find a restaurant with better tea during my lunch break tomorrow?"</p><p>Newt smiles. "I'd love that."</p><p>They keep starring at each other until Pickett chirps into Newt's ear quite loudly and makes him jump. "Merlin, Pickett that wasn't necessary."</p><p>Queenie just giggles and holds out Newt's notebook and coat. "If you go now you might be lucky that Mrs. Esposito is out running errands."</p><p>Newt nods and shrugs into his coat after transferring Pickett back to his usual pocket. "Thank you for the lovely meal, Queenie. It was a pleasure seeing you again."</p><p>Queenie is slightly taken aback. "Are you just staying for one night?"</p><p>Newt shakes his head. "No. Counting today two nights.. More I couldn't wrestle off my publisher." He frowns. "And I will have to do a book presentation the day after tomorrow." He falters. "And then it's back to England for the actual book tour."</p><p>"Well then we will see each other for dinner tomorrow night and <em>of course </em>I'll come to your presentation." Queenie then passes him a parcel wrapped in brown paper. "Here. I doubt the breakfast at the hotel will be very good."</p><p>First Newt wants to protest that he has taken advantage of their hospitality enough but the stubborn tilt to Queenie's chin is indication enough that every argument would be fruitless.</p><p>"Thank you very much", he mumbles and stores the parcel in one of his coat pockets. "I am looking forward to another one of your brilliant meals and maybe this time I can taste your pie."</p><p>Queenie grins, very well understanding his hidden joke and then yawns. "I see you tomorrow, Newt. Sleep well."</p><p>Newt nods and then turns to Tina, "I'm sorry that my stay will be another short one. As I mentioned today my publisher was already cross enough with me,"</p><p>But Tina shakes her head. "It is okay. You do not need to apologize. I'm just happy you really came back."</p><p>Newt shrugs and smiles a bit. "A promise is a promise and I always try my hardest to keep them." He then reaches forward and allows his fingers to rest on Tina's cheek for the shortest of moments. "Sleep well Tina. I see you tomorrow for lunch." He than turns and leaves the flat as fast as manners allow it.</p><p> </p>
