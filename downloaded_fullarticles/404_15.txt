</p><p>Â </p><p>The war was over, the light has won and Lord Voldemort has been defeated by the chosen one. At what cost? The order lost more than half their members in the final battle. Dozens of students didn't return home or had no family to go back to. Albus Dumbledore was dead.</p><p>The portrait of Albus Dumbledore hung in the Headmasters office and acted like he still ran the place. The school was still being rebuilt at a steady pace in hopes to reopen for the new school year. Minerva was the new Headmistress and taking charge immediately, not letting a leg injury from the war slow her down. She was as quick with her cane as she was with her wand and she was back and forth from the Ministry trying to get the proper funding and documents in order to reopen.</p><p>No one knew how Albus still pulled the strings even after his death. The house elves would be loyal to him forever and the ghosts still fed him information like he asked. He spent the last two weeks reviewing all the information he had about the war and who did what, who died and what Voldemort did at every step. If he could only change a few key things then all the dominos would fall into place the order would still have its members, the children would still have their families and most importantly- he would still be alive!</p><p>He planned for weeks about how to fix it all and waited for the right opportunity to put it all to work. Then he heard from one of his portrait informants that Garrick Ollivander made it out of the war alive and was released from the hospital. Not only that, his granddaughter came from Rome for the summer to help him recover. Albus knew this was his golden opportunity and had one of the elves send a message to the recovering wandmaker.</p><p>Once he got word back from his elf that his invitation had been accepted with his time of arrival he smiled and started pointing fingers and calling orders to his loyal house elves. They squealed with excitement and took off to their tasks.</p><p>"What are you plotting old man?" the portrait of Severus Snape asked from his dark corner by the bookshelf. He was painted wearing his finest black robes in a painted version of his personal labs with ingredients and books lining the walls.</p><p>"What do you mean, Severus?" he said with a twinkle in his eye. He was painted in his bright blue robes with silver stars and a long pointy hat.</p><p>Severus scowled at him and went back to ignoring him like he had done since he was hung in the office, much to his disappointment. He didn't want to be painted, he didn't want to be hung in the office that contained nothing but bad memories. He wanted to be left alone in life and in death, but apparently it was too much to ask for. He did his job, spy for the order and protect Potter and die for the cause. Now he just wanted sweet solitude.</p><hr/><p>There was a knock on the door a few hours later, one of the house elves had just placed a large golden vase that looked like an urn, on top of the bookcase closest to Severus. He sneered at the elf as she worked and sent her running as soon as she finished.</p><p>"Come in!" Albus called out from his portrait.</p><p>The door opened slowly and Garrick limped in with his cane, his granddaughter supporting his other arm as she helped him walk. Garrick wore his fine dark blue robes and had a black cane that was topped with the silver head of a raven. His hair was almost as silver as his eyes, all of the black color no longer present. He walked heavily on his left leg, using his cane in the right hand to support the leg that couldn't hold its own.</p><p>His granddaughter was shorter than most her age, a small 15 year old girl with long black wavy hair and lightly tanned skin. She wore similar colored robes with a more feminine cut to them. Her face mostly hidden by her long cut bangs. She had the same piercing silver eyes that her grandfather had. The shy girl closed the door behind them and stood next to her grandfather after taking a small bow to Albus.</p><p>"Welcome! Garrick, how are you these days?" Albus said with a polite smile.</p><p>"I'd be better if I didn't have to walk up all those damn stairs! Why the hell couldn't we floo in?" Garrick huffed as he slowly sat in the chair his granddaughter led him to.</p><p>"The ministry has all the floo networks in the castle blocked for the time being. And who is this lovely lady?" Albus winked.</p><p>Juliet blushed and signed her name 'Hello Mr. Dumbledore, I am Juliet Ollivander.'</p><p>Albus gave her a huge smile that made her cheeks turn red and move behind the chair her grandfather was sitting in.</p><p>"This is my granddaughter Juliet. She's mute, as you can see. My son and daughter in law are still in Rome, but now with the war over they felt it finally safe for her to come and visit. She's been helping me recover and has truly been a godsend." Garrick said and squeezed her hand.</p><p>Albus' eyes widened, and he put his chin on his hand "Oh really? How good of you! Tell me, Miss Ollivander, how are you liking England?"</p><p>She looked up from behind her hair and signed quickly, 'It rains a lot more than back home, I like the rain.'</p><p>"Albus, cut to the chase. Why am I here and not at home with my feet up and drinking whiskey from the bottle?" Garrick cut the pleasantries. Juliet breathed a silent giggle and put her hand to cover her mouth.</p><p>The portrait sighed and looked down to the floor, "I wanted to make sure that one of my oldest friends made it out alive, unlike me. I had to see for myself that you were alright. It was such a shame that you were a prisoner of war."</p><p>Garrick grunted softly in agreement and looked off into the distance, "Getting an order of Merlin I hear. For what? Sitting around in a cell?"</p><p>Albus had the elves bring them tea and sandwiches as well as another chair for Juliet. The men talked for hours about the war from start to finish and she listened to all the details about the war that the papers left out. The sun came in through the high windows and cast their rays throughout the room until they finally hit the large golden urn that the small elf had placed on top of the bookcase. Its reflection shot right at Albus's portrait and caused him to flinch and cover his eyes.</p><p>"Oh my! That is bright!" he exclaimed through his hands he had up to block the blinding light. Both Ollivanders looked around for the source of the light. Juliet pointed to the vase at the top of the shelf an Albus smiled.</p><p>"If it's not too much to ask dear, would you mind getting up there and moving it for me? I don't know why the elves even put that up there!" he asked politely.</p><p>She nodded and stood with her satchel still on her shoulder. She quietly made her way over to the bookshelf and looked up at the urn that was far too tall for her to reach. Albus called out for her to use the ladder on the other side of the wall. She turned and locked eyes with Severus' portrait.</p><p>They were both caught off guard with each other. Severus had a blank expression on his face instead of the usual scowl. He felt like he knew this girl, somehow and someway he knew her. Juliet blinked at him a few times and bit her lip. She stepped closer and looked up at him with her big silver eyes. Any other person in the world and he would have spit out cruel words and a given them glare that sent first years running.</p><p>He couldn't. He didn't know why but he was just stuck and fixated on her. Her eyes traveled over his face and landed on a faint scar he had on his upper lip. She slowly raised her hand and reached up to touch it. Severus held his breath and leaned forward slightly, well as much as his frame would let him. Her hand gently touched the canvas where his scar was painted and he briefly closed his eyes. He couldn't feel it but he could imagine that it was warm and soft.</p><p>"Ah yes, that is Severus Snape! A brave man he is! We won the war because of him, without him-" Albus called out. She pulled her hand back quickly as if burned.</p><p>"Silence you old fool!" Severus hissed at Albus while he continued to stare at Juliet.</p><p>She blushed and finally looked away, hiding behind her hair and grabbing the ladder. She moved it to the bookshelf she needed and climbed up it slowly. Severus watched her move cautiously and look back over her shoulder at him. She smiled softly and continued up the ladder. Albus and Garrick went back to talking as Juliet moved the urn. Severus watched her climb up and reach for the golden vessel.</p><p>It all happened so quickly that no one but Severus saw exactly what happened. The ladder gave way with a loud crash, Juliet was holding the golden urn and fell backwards to the floor. Severus yelled out for her to watch out. Juliet let go of it and it flipped and golden sand spilled out. As soon as it touched her skin she vanished before hitting the ground. Severus banged his fists on the canvas and gripped the surrounding frame tightly. His instincts kicked in to save her but there was nothing he could do. She was gone.</p><p>Garrick shot up out of his chair and kicked his cane over. He limped to where Juliet should have been and pulled his wand out. "WHERE IS SHE?"</p><p>"She just vanished! The urn broke, and something spilled out." Severus said.</p><p>Garrick looked around and saw some of the golden sand on the floor by the bookshelf. He waved his wand over it and turned suddenly to Albus. "Sand from a time turner. What the hell happened to her?!"</p><p>Albus's eyes twinkled over his glasses, and he held his hands up "Oops."</p><p>Severus gritted his teeth and gripped the side of his frame tighter.</p><p>Garrick moved across the room quickly for an old man who was still recovering. He had his wand out and pointed to his painting. "What do you mean oops? Explain- now!"</p><p>Albus held his hands up and shrugged his shoulders. Before he could answer Severus, cut him off. "Yes, tell us what you've done to the poor girl with the urn you strategically placed before they arrived."</p><p>Garrick's eyes went wide at first then he scowled and kicked the chair over in anger, "I see even in your death you're still a meddling old fool! What the hell happened to my granddaughter?!" he didn't let his injury get in the way of his wrath.</p><p>"I sent her to the past. So she can save us from the war and make things right."</p><p>"YOU SENT HER TO THE WAR?!" both men yelled.</p><p>"Of course not! I sent her to 1975, right before the war. She sat here with us and listened to every detail that happened and with that knowledge, she can warn the past me and save millions of lives." He explained.</p><p>"You mean your life. All the years of the 'greater good speech' were just you talking out of your ass! You selfish bastard!" Garrick yelled angrily.</p><p>He dropped his wand and stepped back suddenly while he clutched his head. Severus did the same in his portrait. Both men saw flashes of Juliet in their minds as their past started to alter and change with memories of her. Garrick leaned against the desk with one hand and said "Curse you Albus Dumbledore! If you come out of this alive I will fucking kill you myself!"</p><hr/><p>Juliet silently screamed as she fell for what seemed like hours. She could see the office around her change in lighting and furniture but there was nothing more than a deafening silence. She watched in fear as people quickly moved in and out of the room with speed she couldn't keep up with. She saw Albus alive and kicking, literally. She watched Albus' old figure move around the room doing poses that a man his age shouldn't even try to do. Then it all slowed down and she finally hit the ground, at least it didn't feel like the ground.</p><p>She landed on an invisible cushion and bounced twice before being gently lowered to the ground. She got up quickly and stumbled, losing her balance and getting dizzy. She reached her hand out and gripped one of the shelves to catch herself.</p><p>"Hello, Miss Ollivander. I've been expecting you." A voice said from behind her.</p><p>She jumped and stepped back quickly. She looked up to see Albus Dumbledore alive and smiling down at her. He wore deep purple robes with a gold lining on them and his beard wasn't as long as she had last seen. She opened her mouth to scream, nothing came out but the fear was the same, and she ran past him, she looked around the room for her grandfather but only found Albus. She whistled for him but got no response from Garrick. He wasn't there. She started to panic and hyperventilate.</p><p>"Calm down. Please have a seat, and I'll explain everything." He said calmly and held the chair out for her to sit.</p><p>She shook her head no and backed into a corner of the room that she had seen Severus' portrait in. The wall was bare with no sign of a frame ever being mounted there. 'You're alive, looking younger and I just fell for an hour watching people move backward. When am I?'</p><p>Albus chuckled and stroked his beard "Smart one you are! I knew I chose the right person. Come, I'll tell you all about it over tea." He said and walked back to his desk. "As you know Voldemort is on the rise to power. If I sent you that means either we lost or something went wrong. Today's date is July 15th, 1975."</p><p>She gasped and sat down in the chair he offered her before. 'The war was over! We finally achieved peace-'</p><p>"At what cost? How many lives were lost? See that's why my future self sent you. You were not here during the war so your involvement wont interfere with anything. I would have sent you with information that I needed to make the changes and save people." He said and handed her a cup of tea.</p><p>'I'll tell you everything you need to know then send me back.' She said and ignored the cup. Instead, she wiped the tears that had formed in her eyes on the back of her sleeve.</p><p>He chuckled and sipped his tea with his little finger out. "I'm afraid that's not how it works. If only it were that simple, Miss Ollivander. You are our only link to the future. Any time we change something in the past, it affects the outcome of the war. Thus changing your memory of how the war ended. I need you to tell me what changes and how so I can make the proper changes here in my time and save lives."</p><p>She sobbed into her hands and curled up in her chair; she couldn't believe that she was sent into the past during the war and now she couldn't go back home. 'I want my Papa.' She signed and continued to cry.</p><p>Albus sighed and rested his hands on the desk in front of him calmly "Miss Ollivander, you were sent to be a hero. Your name will-"</p><p>She stood up and stomped her foot angrily. Hot tears ran down her cheeks as she signed 'I may be stuck here, but I won't put up with your lies!'</p><p>"Lies?"</p><p>'You knew my name when I came. You've been planning this. You could have easily sent anyone else, and there are a hundred people who would have eagerly jumped at the opportunity to come back. So you give it to me straight.' She signed angrily and pointed an accusing finger at him.</p><p>Albus flinched at her words and sighed before answering, "You're right. I'm sorry for insulting your intelligence, Miss Ollivander. But it just further proves that I chose right. You aren't the first person that I've sent back to this moment. I have tried to send back people who were involved or were close to the war. All the outcomes ended in one disaster after the other. The time you came from- THAT was the outcome of the last attempt."</p><p>She sat back in her chair defeated and in shock. Her mouth was hanging open and she was stunned. Albus took the opportunity to continue, "I sent you back at an exact moment. The time of day, the alignment of the stars, the exact amount of time turner sand. Unfortunately at this point, it would be nearly impossible to send you back. I am sorry for dragging you into this, but what I can promise you is that you will be taken care of."</p><p>She snapped out of it at his words 'You said nearly. So there is a way for me to go back! So I'll write down all the instructions on how not to kill yourself, and then you just send me back home.'</p><p>Albus chuckled "Nothing gets past you does it? Ah-I believe we have a visitor."</p><p>Before she could ask what he was talking about a knock came from the office door, it opened and a younger, healthier Garrick stepped in and closed it behind him. His hair was black with silver just starting at his temples. He wore light grey robes with a black cloak. Juliet jumped up and rushed forward to him and threw herself around his middle.</p><p>"Oof! Um, I'm sorry. Do I know you, miss?" he asked awkwardly as she stood stiffly in her embrace.</p><p>She jumped back and blushed brightly. Albus stood and moved around the desk to shake his hand, "Garrick, thank you for coming on short notice. I know its busy time for you with summer shoppers. This is Miss Juliet Ollivander."</p><p>Garrick shook his head in disbelief and did a double take when looking at her, "Ollivander? I'm sorry was there a long lost cousin I didn't know about? My son and I are the only Ollivanders left."</p><p>Juliet looked awkwardly at Albus for the answer. He smirked and said "She is your granddaughter. Come and sit while we have tea."</p><hr/><p>"Let me get this straight. My son grows up, marries and has a daughter-which is you. He raises you in Rome, because I warned him to stay out of the war. Am I right so far? Good. Then the war ends, you come to visit and this fool-which is you, sends you back in time because he doesn't want to die. Did I get it all?" Garrick recapped while he drank from his flask that he had in his inner coat. He pointed and Juliet and Albus at the proper times.</p><p>'Yes, Papa.' Juliet signed.</p><p>"I'm sorry, I don't know sign language. Not yet, at least." He said and put his flask away.</p><p>"I didn't send her back because I died-"</p><p>Both Ollivanders shot him a glare that paused his words. They were related after all.</p><p>"I sent her back to save millions of lives. We could stop Tom before he reaches his full power!" Albus said and punched his fist in his hand.</p><p>Juliet pulled her wand out, and a black ribbon formed the words she couldn't speak so Garrick could understand her 'I'm hearing a lot of "we" and not hearing much of you.'</p><p>Garrick let out a bark of laughter, "I like her! She may be mine after all."</p><p>Albus sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration. He waved his wand at both of them quickly before they could react and a glowing string of red formed between them, genetics confirmed that Juliet was indeed his granddaughter. Garrick's eyes widened in surprise and nodded slowly.</p><p>"Now, we have work to do. I have already enrolled you in the upcoming new school year. You can stay here-"</p><p>Garrick jumped in and said "She's staying with me. I'm not leaving her with you! You might send her back to Grindelwald!" Juliet smiled softly at him and reached over to squeeze his arm.</p><p>"Fine. But I will need to meet with her once a week. We will tell everyone that she is your daughter-"</p><p>"How do you plan for that to be believable when I have a son in Rome?"</p><p>"If you stop interrupting me! Not many people know you have a son, really only us and a scroll at the ministry. Slipping her name on that scroll is easy enough-" Albus said</p><p>"You've already done it. Haven't you, you bastard." Garrick cursed.</p><p>"Stop interrupting me! And yes I have. Story we sell is that she was homeschooled up until now and needs to come to Hogwarts to complete her owls and newts due to ministry regulations. Ah- don't interrupt me. When she graduates she will be hidden by the order to keep her out of the war." Albus said quickly and angrily as he held up a finger to Garrick to stop him from interrupting again.</p><p>Juliet waved her wand, 'So that's it? I graduate then hide for the rest of my life? I won't be able to pursue a career or live my life?'</p><p>"It won't be for long. With the information that you are bringing us, we can hope to end the war quick." Albus said and stirred his tea.</p><p>'The war didn't end until 1998!'</p><p>"It will be a lot faster this time, I promise. Now, do you want to be sorted now or at the start of term?" Albus asked and held up the sorting hat.</p><p>"Sort her into Ravenclaw now and save her the stress of being sorted with first years." Garrick huffed.</p><p>"So sure it will be Ravenclaw? Shall we make a wager?"</p><p>"All Ollivander's are Ravenclaw's, just like all Potter's are Gryffindors and all Dumbledore's are arseholes, so if you really want toâ¦then yes. I'll take that bet." Garrick said as a matter of fact.</p><p>"Wellâ¦.perhaps not then." Albus walked around the desk and placed the hat on her head.</p><p>"Well, here you areâ¦.so many thoughts running through your pretty little head. An Ollivander for certain, but here before your time. Such a temper, just like your grandfatherâ¦..RAVENCLAW!" the hat cried out.</p><p>Garrick looked smugly at Albus, silently telling him I told you so. "Well, if that's all I would like to take my daughter home."</p><p>"One last thing, I set up a fund for her. To pay for her supplies, housing, and living expenses while she's here." Albus said and held out an envelope.</p><p>Garrick grabbed her outstretched hand and pulled it away from Albus. "I can provide for my own, we don't need your charity." He said hotly and pulled Juliet towards the door. "Next time, open your floo so I don't have to walk all these damn stairs."</p><p>"Goodbye, Miss Ollivander. I hope you enjoy the rest of your summer." Albus said and watched them walk out of his office.</p><p>Garrick pulled her close when they walked out from behind the gargoyle. "I believe it's time to give you a proper hug. I'm sorry you are being dragged into this, but you are family, and I will do my best to keep you safe and raise you as my own daughter. Don't accept anything from that man- believe me. He will hold it over your head until the end of time."</p><p>Juliet smiled and wiped a tear from the corner of her eye. 'Thank you, Papa.'</p><p>"I think its time for some dinner and you teach me sign language. Come little one, let's go home."</p>
