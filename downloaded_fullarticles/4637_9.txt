    <b>"You have to see the darker side of someone before you can say you truly know them" - Pierre Bouvier</b>
  </h2></center><p>The air smelled perfect, if that even makes sense. But it was a sweet clean smell, the smell of going back to my favorite place in the world. School. Before you judge my sanity, you would have to know where I go to school. Hogwarts school for Witchcraft and Wizardry, it's a magnificent giant castle full of mystery and magic. My first year there I had to have gotten lost a million times, with the moving staircases and the rooms always changing around, even now I find myself a little confused on where I am and it will take me a moment to remember. Hogwarts was nothing like my home. Hogwarts is warm and inviting, my home is cold and I don't even know the right word to describe the evil dark feeling that lingerers in the air. It was still home and I felt safe there but it wasn't on my top places I would like to spend my last days alive if I had a choice.</p><p>I stared out the window impatiently waiting for the castle to appear in the distance, even though I knew we had quite a ways to go. All that was passing by now was small towns and some farming fields.</p><p>"How long are you going to just stare out that window, Isabella" Draco asked<br/>
I blinked out of my train of thought and slowly turned to glare at my dear twin brother</p><p>"I was having a nice day dream, thank you for ruining it" I stuck my tongue out at him, I was always slightly more immature but yet I was the smarter one</p><p>"Daydreaming isn't good for you, you should stop doing that" He stated and looked out the compartment door</p><p>"Says who, father?" He wasn't making me any less annoyed with him</p><p>"Does it really matter who said it" He kept looking out the door for someone, probably one of his little followers.</p><p>I normally got along with my brother very well, just we have different opinions about things in life. He believed everything mum and dad said had to be what he thinks about the world. I don't think that way and yet everyone thinks Draco's twin sister has to be just like him. When in reality we are almost complete opposites, besides our looks.<br/>
</p><p>I had the same pale blonde hair, yet mine was very long like my mum's and was strait; it refused to curl most of the time unless I used some magic beauty products. My eyes were slightly different in the fact that his were light blue almost gray and cold. Mine were more of a baby blue with a kindness in them I like to think. My skin was flawless and pale like his and my smile brilliant, I even had a smirk somewhat like Draco's. Not to mention the confidence he also has.</p><p>"Bloody hell Draco, what do you keep looking for out that door?" I stared at him like he was a stupid git, which he was a lot of the time</p><p>He sat back down and looked at me, no real emotion shown in his face "Well I'm hungry, and Blaise said he needed to speak with me, but he is late" he seemed to get angry at the end of his sentence</p><p>"About what?"</p><p>"Obviously I don't know" he rolled his eyes.</p><p>My brother was one who was always super secretive though, so I didn't just stop being curious when things had to do with him. The compartment door swung open giving me a fright.</p><p>"Anything off the trolley dears?" I heard and looked up to see Draco already buying all that he could<br/>
</p><p>I waited patiently for him to join me back in the compartment, with no other source of amusement since he always insists to sit with me alone for part of our trip to Hogwarts, he treats me like a little girl sometimes and is always very protective which I find annoying but I love it at the same time because that means he cares about me.</p><p>"Here you are sis" Draco handed me pumpkin juice and my favorite pumpkin pasties</p><p>"Thank you" I smiled at him, he did have a kind heart but I was the only one who ever truly saw that side of him I believe</p><p>We ate in silence, I was un sure of what to talk about with him, I was scared to ask him things. Especially when it was about last year's events and Harry Potter saying the Dark lord had returned and the Ministry denying it happened. I myself had no idea but I wouldn't be surprise if Harry was right.</p><p>Draco would probably kill me if he knew the people I talked to in school, since I wasn't in Slytherin like he was, I was in Ravenclaw. Which gladly my parents didn't mind to much since they knew how smart and amazing at magic I was so they were still proud of me. "Better then Gryffindor" father would say. I was happy not to have Draco around all the time, I could talk to whoever I wanted and be friends with whoever I wanted and Draco and mum and dad would never know.<br/>
</p><p>They never knew that I talked to Harry and get along with him and Hermione. Hermione I loved because she was so clever and kind and we would challenge each other. Harry was kind too even though we only had a few conversations. Ron though wasn't too fond of me since my last name was Malfoy. Which saddened me since he was kind of cute.<br/>
</p><p>There was a knock on the door that tore me from my train of thought, which was good since thinking of how cute Ronald Weasley is was not a good thing to do around my brother, I might slip or something.</p><p>"Come in Blaise" Draco put on his "I'm in control" voice and I laughed to myself quietly</p><p>"Draco, Isabella" He nodded his head to both of us before sitting down</p><p>"So what is it that you have to tell me?" Draco was trying so hard not to show his eagerness</p><p>"Well it should be between just me and you, no offense gorgeous but us boys have some business to go over" Blaise smirked at me, I rolled my eyes</p><p>"That's fine I'll go change and find Ali" I glared at Blaise as I walked out of the room before I stepped out Draco grabbed my arm</p><p>"This won't take long, so please come back" He whispered to me as he gave me a hug, I nodded ok and left</p><p>After I changed into my Ravenclaw robes I found the compartment where Ali, Mandy and the Patil twins sat. I opened the door and get pummeled by no other than Allison, my best friend at Hogwarts.</p><p>"Hello to you too Ali" I smiled pushing her off me so we can get off the floor</p><p>"Oh how I missed you Isa" she grabbed my hand pulling me to sit next to her</p><p>I smiled at everyone in the room surprised Parvati actually was sitting with us normally she dragged Padma with her.</p><p>"So how was your summer holiday, Isa?" Mandy asked starting conversation</p><p>"Slightly boring, and annoying a whole summer with Draco and his posse gets old fast and he makes me do everything with them" I complained</p><p>"Oh god, summer with Pansy around must be horrid" Padma commented</p><p>"Believe me it was" I laughed</p><p>"Please tell me you played a few tricks on her" Ali giggled</p><p>"Well of course, Draco was pretty mad at me when Pansy found a frog down her back, or when I slipped worms onto her dinner plate" everyone laughed at the thought of Pansy running around screaming trying to remove the frog out of her robes.</p><p>"You are brilliant sometimes" Ali smiled</p><p>"Only sometimes? I'm always brilliant" I stuck my tongue out at her</p><p>We exchanged stories for a while before Allison just had to bring up my crush from last year, well and this year but I didn't want anyone to know.</p><p>"So how is that Ron thing working out for you Isabella" Ali smirked she could be so evil sometimes</p><p>I slapped her arm "Allison" I said through my teeth</p><p>"Oh come on we already know" Mandy laughed</p><p>"Well you guys know because you dorm with me not Parvati and she is in his house so hush" I said</p><p>"You like Ronald Weasley!" Parvati screamed and Padma covered her mouth</p><p>"I thought he was cute, that's all" I blushed "Now we are done with this subject"</p><p>"But do you still think he is cute?" Ali asked trying to keep the conversation going</p><p>"I haven't seen him this year now have I" I pointed out "He could of gotten ugly"</p><p>"Well let's go find out" before I could object Allison grabbed my hand and pulled me out of the compartment and down the small hallway pushing people out of the way, Mandy and the twins followed but were far behind us by now with Ali's speed and determination. That's how she always was, determined and fought to be right and very blunt, would say how she felt straight out and I loved her for it.</p><p>We slowed down since Ali was trying to look in some of the compartments. Then she stopped as soon as we passed one</p><p>"Ok that was the one, I'm going to go in and talk to Hermione, play along ok" Ali said and once again before I knew it Ali had opened the compartment door and pulled me in with her.</p><p>"Hey everyone, I just got a quick question for Hermione" Ali smiled</p><p>"Alright" Hermione smiled and waved to me and I shyly lifted my hand and did a small wave back I was trying not to lift my head I didn't want to look up but as Ali talked to Hermione about classes Harry just had to talk to me.</p><p>"Hey Isabella, did you have a nice summer?" I looked up and saw him have a warm smile on his face</p><p>"As nice as it could get around Draco and his followers" I laughed</p><p>"Sometimes I think you have it worse than me" He joked</p><p>"I don't know want to trade? I'll take the Durley's and you take the Malfoy's, we just need polyjuice potion so they won't try to murder you" we both laughed</p><p>"Hmmm, I might take you up on that offer" He smiled and motioned me to sit down next to him since now Ali and Hermione were in a deep serious conversation about something.</p><p>"Sorry if we interrupted you by the way you know how Allison gets" I smiled to him looked over and right past him was Ron starring out the window with a vulgar look upon his face</p><p>He really did, dis like me. But he was still so cute. Why did I have to be a Malfoy?</p><p>"No, it's fine we weren't talking about anything to important, anyways most conversations end in me being angry at the end" he stated lifting up the daily prophet</p><p>"I don't blame you the minister is a real git if you ask me" I made Harry smile but Ron was still starring out the window like it was his job to ignore my existence</p><p>"How the bloody hell are you related to the Malfoy's?" Harry gleamed at me</p><p>I laughed "I have no idea to tell you the truth, I wish I could move but most of my family are evil nutsos"</p><p>"Your probably better off with your parents then" Harry smiled throwing the prophet to the ground "This year is going to be difficult I already know it"</p><p>"Just ignore them, I do with everyone hating on me for being Draco's sister" I said that a little louder than normal hoping Ron would hear, I saw his eye twitch a bit and his face not look so angry</p><p>"I'll try" Harry smirked "My anger gets the best of me"</p><p>"I'd be pissed too, some people are just so thick headed" I glared over at Ron and I think Harry saw it</p><p>"He'll get over it" Harry whispered to me</p><p>"He seems to hate me though" I whispered back and looked up to see Ron look as he was trying to listen to us</p><p>"Trust me, he'll get past you being a Malfoy, I promise" Harry smiled</p><p>"Ready Isa?" Ali asked standing up</p><p>"Yeah" I stood up "See you guys around school" I waved good bye and followed Ali down the hall</p><p>"I hate you by the way" I said to her</p><p>"So is he still cute?" She smirked</p><p>"I refuse to answer that" I huffed</p><p>"That's a yes" She turned around to stick her tongue out at me but bumped into my brother as doing so<br/>
"Oh Draco, I'm so sorry are you ok?" she looked terrified</p><p>"Yeah, I'm fine Allison" He said patting himself off which looked silly like he had germs on him "There you are Isabella I've been looking for you" I noticed behind him was his usual group "You said you were coming back"</p><p>"Sorry, I got distracted by friends" I smiled innocently knowing he will forgive me</p><p>"It's fine, just come on" He grabbed my arm and I looked at Allison saying sorry in my facial expression as I got pulled away. Typical Draco.</p>
