    <p>She did not know what was the most surprising. The fact that so many people flew away after the Dark Lord had spoken into their head - or that after two hours fighting, the resistance was still going on. They were fewer and fewer but hell, they will not let him take control that easily.</p><p>There was almost no doubt they could not win. Hermione looked over Harry, he was crouched behind a big rock – probably a part of the castle’s wall not so long ago.  She watched as he wiped his forehead with his jacket, smearing the dust over his face. She looked at Ron. She felt relieved he was still breathing. Numerous cuts could be seen on his face but, they had stopped bleeding and appeared not too harmful.</p><p>Hermione has since long forgotten to make a check upon her. Now, her only purpose was to keep Harry alive. Her watch was now indicating 9.58pm and she wondered if she will see another day, or even see them again. Perhaps if there was an afterlife …</p><p>Slightly reassured about her friend’s condition, she focused on the reason why they were hiding. <em>Nagini</em>. They had to find the snake. It was their only chance to survive the night. Or even the evening. They guessed it should be close to its master, in the heart of the battle - still looking for Harry. However, there was no trace of him or his damned snake. Well, at the end it did not really surprise her. Voldemort liked to remain clean while others were fighting for his cause.</p><p>She felt him before the others. Probably because she was constantly the most aware of her surroundings. She knew he was invading her mind and his speech was seconds away.</p><p>She gripped her wand stronger as his first words resonated in her head – praying it will be over soon.</p><p>“You fought with great courage tonight. It is such a shame that so many of you died for a boy that does not have the courage to fight me. You have to know that every drop of witches and wizard’s blood is a pain in my heart. I ask you to stop this nonsense and to stop protecting a boy that does nothing to protect you.”</p><p>His voice was paining her, like a thousand needles were pressed to her head. She had never heard of a person so good at Legimency that he could talk to different people’s mind at the same time. None of the less, everyone present on the castle’s ground. She will need to look over it on books. If she survived of course. She glanced at Harry, he more than anyone was pained by the words. She did not have to use Occlumency to know what he thought: <em>It is true, I abandoned them.</em></p><p>“Harry – This message is just for you. You let your people die for you. A lot of them did not have the chance to go in a peaceful way. Their blood is on your hand Harry Potter. Now, I ask all my followers to stop fighting and to join me back in the forbidden forest. I give you all one hour to take care of your lost. In one hour Harry, if you did not surrender yourself to me, I will kill every wizard, witch or infant that tried to hide you from me. Remember Harry Potter – You have one hour.”</p>
<hr/><p>Just as she felt him invading her mind she sensed his presence fading away. In addition to the soreness of her members, she now had a killing headache. She closed her eyes, trying to chase the pain away. It was the worst time to have a breakdown, she needed to find a solution to protect Harry, to get him out of-</p><p>“I am sorry, I can’t do this anymore.”</p><p>Hermione opened her eyes and looked straight at Ronald. She heard him talk and yet, could not process its meanings. Ron looked at her with pleading eyes.</p><p>“I am sorry, but I can’t continue this.”  Ron’s eyes were travelling from Hermione to Harry. He carried on: “You know I am not fitted for that kind of mission. Harry’s the hero. Not me. I cannot die now, I am too young”</p><p>Hermione opened her mouth to ask what the hell was going on but he raised his hand, making her stop.</p><p>“I am sorry.” He whispered. They heard a sound as a fire bold in a thunder storm. A big and loud <em>Krak </em>lost in the recent silence. And then, he was not here anymore. Hermione’s opened her mouth, looking straight where, not a second before, stood the guy she spend years to love. His vibrant red hair invisible in the dusty courtyard.</p><p>The deafening silence started to fade away and she could make out cries, screams and footing heading inside the ruins of the castle. She looked at Harry. He was still crouched down, staring at the spot where Ron was.</p><p>She turned around, still searching and started screaming his name. He could not be gone. It was impossible. He did not abandoned them a second time. She could not see him among people heading to the castle and turned to the park. He must have gone this way. Still screaming his name, waiting for an answer, she advanced to the green field.</p><p>She felt a hand on her arm, stopping her. Gently turning her, she was faced with the kind eyes of her best friend. She could see the message he was passing through them. Her brain understood that Ron had left for good. Yet, her heart couldn’t.</p><p>She whimpered: “Ron, he cannot…”</p><p>“He’s gone Hermione.” He smiled at her, the same one he wore when Sirius died. Forced. Harry looked down: “You should go too. I do not want to see any more people I love dying”</p><p>He started to let go of her hand but she quickly grasped it back.</p><p>“Harry look at me.” As he raised his eyes, she continued “I will die a million time if it means I get to save you for another day. I will die a painful death over and over again if it means I get to see you another day…”</p><p>Tears were forming on both of their eyes.</p><p>“Harry, please. Do not send me away. Let me be with you until the end. Until my bones are broken and I cannot walk. Until my eyes are blind and I cannot see you. Until I die and I cannot feel your soul.”</p><p>They were now both crying, deep and silent tears falling. Nobody paid them attention and it was for the best. It was their moment, and they needed it.</p><p>Hermione wiped her tears away. “Where are we heading to now?”</p><p>Before Harry could answer, someone interrupted them.</p><p>“Potter.”</p><p>They both turned around to Malfoy, perfectly dressed, his pale blond hairs in order. Both friends, looked at him alarmingly. Draco was not one of their people. He was a part of the other side. They watched him as he took out a wand from his pocket. They recognized it:  Dumbledore’s.</p><p>Draco put it in Harry’s hand “Make good use of it”.</p><p>He raised his eyes and met Hermione’s. One, two, three seconds. Then, he passed them and disappeared after the tree lines of the forest. White features melting into the darkness.</p><p>“What was that about?” asked Hermione.</p><p>“I do not have the slightest idea...” Harry answered. He turned around the wand in his hand. “Dumbledore’s wand … The strongest among others … If he gave it to me does it means it is mine?” Hermione nodded.</p><p>They looked back at the courtyard. It was now empty, except for the wreckage the battle made. They went in the direction everyone had left and as they reached to the door of the great hall they stopped in their tracks. The sight of so many laying down on the floor was too much to ignore. At the further end of the hall, they spotted bright red haired heads. Something twirled inside Hermione. Please don’t let it be Ron. Not Ron.</p><p>She advanced, careful in her stepping. Afraid to interrupt something. She saw Ginny turning around and crashing inside her arms.</p><p>“Hermione… it’s Fred” Big tears were drenching Hermione’s sweater but she couldn’t give a damn about it. Her eyes were glued to the form of the young man. Pale as a ghost, striking against his purple clothing. George was crying on his chest. Losing a son, a friend, a brother must be unbearable, but in their case, George losing his twin was the most heart-breaking thing she saw in her life. Ginny was still sobbing in her clothes and she wondered why she was not in Harry’s arms. She turned slightly around to see where he was.</p><p>Harry was standing just steps away from her. However, as her eyes were focused on Fred, his were looking at the neighbour’s bed. He was still, like something he couldn’t process was happening. The same reaction he had with Ron, mere moment ago.  She casted an eye on the ground and she understood. Remus, Tonks. Their hands were almost touching. Like they died holding hands.</p><p>She came back to earth when someone pulled on her sweater and she looked at Ginny.</p><p>“Where is Ron?” she asked.</p><p>Right. It was obvious they were going to ask her where Ron was. He was the best friend of Harry Potter. Always first before her. She wanted to lie. To tell them, he was in the toilet or even, was slaying dragons to protect a girl.</p><p>“I don’t know” replied Hermione.</p><p>Ginny looked at her with round eyes, but it is Molly with her accusatory voice that spoke. “What do you mean you do not know?” She was frowning, like it was Hermione’s fault that he was not here, in this room.</p><p>“I told you, I have no idea where he is right now.” She took a deep breath, obviously this was not sufficient for them. “He left the battlefield.” With a point of anger she added in a whisper “he left us.”</p><p>“You are lying!” Molly almost shouted. “Are you making up a story so you seem more interesting than him?”</p><p>Ginny left her arms and went to stand next to her mother. Like touching Hermione was burning her. She could not believe what she was seeing, or hearing for that matter.</p><p>“More interesting?” she gaped.</p><p>“Yes. So you can claim that YOU are Harry Potter’s best friend” Molly’s voice was like poison. She was talking so loud now that everyone was looking at them. How dare she accuse her of something like this when she was in love with her son? She spent Christmas, summers in her house, helping her cook, playing with Ginny and so on. Hermione’s turned to Harry. He would certainly explain them. However, he was no longer in sight. She guessed he left before the inquisition, too pained by the sight of the corpses. But where to? The forest of course.  She had to get to him. Fuck Molly and her accusations, she has other things to do and if they died tonight, she will not matter anymore.</p><p>Hermione looked one last time at the Weasley family. All fuming and looking at her as she was the devil himself. Bill and George were the only one looking at her with kind eyes, like they were saying that they understood and not blaming. Hermione took a few step back.</p><p>“I have to go” she turned and left the great hall, trying the escape the scream of Ms. Weasley, running to get to Harry.</p>
<hr/><p> “Harry!” running through the castle ground, she finally caught sight of him. He was reaching Hagrid’s house but stopped when he heard her scream his name.</p><p>When she reached him, she slapped him. “What the hell do you think you are doing?”</p><p>“I have too Hermione. Too many people died, I need to try and defeat him directly.” He explained.</p><p>“Without me? Without even saying goodbye?”</p><p>“Hermione ….”</p><p>“No! Listen to me young boy!” she dapped a finger to his chest, repeating the movement she continued “You will never be able to defeat him alone and remain alive! What happen if you kill him? Huh? His army will then be on you.”</p><p>“Do you think I did not think about this? There is no other solution Hermione. Even if it is the two of us against him, he will be stronger. I will try my chance without risking your life.”</p><p>Hermione knew he was right. But, there should be another solution …</p><p>“Harry, do you still have your cape?” Hermione asked. Harry threw her a questioning look but took off from his sweatshirt the invisibility cloak. Hermione took it in her hand. “I will go under it and follow you. He will not see me, and he will think he has only one opponent.”</p><p>Harry started to understand “You want me to be a distraction…”</p><p>Hermione nodded “Yes. He is expecting you, but not that I will come along. As he will start to fight you, I will destroy him.”</p><p>Harry took the elder wand out of his back pocket “Here take this. Since you are the one to attack him you should take this one. It should be the only one able to surpass him.”</p><p>Hermione nodded and placed the cape on her arm. She will have time to put it on later. Hermione touched his shoulder, sign of encouragement. She was sure they could make it. It was not the perfect plan but since Voldemort was underestimating the Muggle-born, he will not guess she was accompanying him. She took a deep breath and followed Harry into the wood.</p><p>They walked for at least ten minutes into the darkness, slight rays of light from the moon passing through the trees branches. During this walk, Hermione took the time to re-think of her plan, of everything that could go wrong. Still, she had faith in this mission. There was no way he could know or sense her.</p><p>Harry stopped in his track and she slightly bumped into him. “I think I understand now why he gave me the golden snitch.” He took out the little ball from his pocket and raised it to his mouth. He slightly kissed it and the sentence graved in it appeared: <em>I open at the close. </em>He then pronounced “The end is near”. There was a <em>Pop </em>and the devise activated itself leaving in Harry’s hand a small stone. The same stone that was adorning Riddle’s ring.</p><p>Hermione looked at Harry but her attention was soon reported to something else. Here, in front of them was standing Sirius, Lupin and she guessed James and Lily. She realized: the resurrection stone. She watched Harry advance to his mother, trying to reach out but their hand never met, just passing through each other.</p><p>Hermione touched Harry’s shoulder “I will wait for you a little further away. Take your time.” Harry nodded and she went deeper into the forest until she was sure she could not hear him. It was the second time he could talk to his parents. He deserved the privacy. Her thought went back to the mission at hand. In one hour, she will be either victorious or dead. It did not really matter to her anymore.</p><p>She thought about Ron, if they died tonight, would he join the dark side? Will he try to avenge their death? She doubted it. She spend years loving him. He made her cry so often and yet, she was still going along all his tantrums, crisis and other need of attention. He actually had to leave them alone in their search of Horcruxes for her to understand that she could never be happy with him. He was definitely too self-centred. And yet, she could never have imagined that he would abandon them one more time.  When he returned the first time, she blamed everything on the Horcruxe. She was mad at him but she did not take him for guilty.  And now, it was too late. She betted that if they survived tonight, he would come and apologize. Harry will forgive him, but she will never be able to. So much for <em>True Love</em> anyway.</p><p>She heard some footstep approaching and soon enough, Harry was in front of her.</p><p>“Thank you” he said. They both knew he did not have to, but she guessed he needed to voice it out. Just in case something would go wrong. They walked for a bit and after some minutes – that could have seemed like hours – they started to hear some voices. They were getting close. Harry stopped and looked over Hermione.</p><p>“I think it is safer you put the cloak right now.” Hermione agreed but before she could put it on her, Harry took her in his arms. “Just in case we don’t make it, I would like to thank you again. For all the thing you have done for me. Your friendship and your smartness helped me to reach seventeen. I am so grateful for you to have remained loyal, even if I am not sure I deserve it.”</p><p>Hermione was crying again. “Oh Harry … I will do everything the same way if I had the chance” She was so overwhelmed that she did not see or felt Harry slipping the resurrection stone in her jacket.  She stepped a bit away from his embrace “Let’s do this, we can make it.”</p><p>He made a small smile at her conviction and urged her to go under the cape. She whispered to him “See you soon”.</p><p>Harry made his way to the sounds coming from his left. Hermione following closely after. They arrived in a small clearing. Here stood the Dark Lord, all wrapped in black robes. His head looking more and more like a snake. Almost all trace of humanity had disappeared from his face. He was pacing back and forth, his snake tightly secured behind a protection ball. Hermione shivered, he was so intimidating, radiating power. She may have rushed the plan. May be they should have elaborated one more carefully.</p><p>Voldemort pacing stopped abruptly when he caught sight of Harry. He displayed a touch of surprise. “Harry Potter. Finally you came to my sight. I started to lose faith in you my boy”.</p><p>Harry stopped in front of him, ten feet away. “You wanted me Tom. Here I am”</p><p>“Prepare yourself to die.” He answered. Voldemort raised his new borrowed wand, ready to strike. Hermione did the same. She had to wait for him to cast the first incantation. If not, he would see her curse and avoid it before it actually reached him.</p><p>Suddenly, they heard a big hissing from Nagini. Voldemort stopped staring at Harry for a brief moment and casted a glance at his companion. “What did you say? The little mudblood is here as well?” While saying this, he looked straight at where she was standing – as if she just had naturally walked on them. Of course. Why did she not have thought about this before? The snake with its animal instincts will have sensed her. Before she could process on what to do, Lord Voldemort has started to talk again.</p><p>“Very well then. I will kill the Mudblood, and then the boy who lived.” In no time he screamed <em>“AVADA KEDRAVA” </em>a flash of green appeared and Hermione closed her eyes. She was prepared to die when she accompanied Harry. After some seconds she still felt nothing. Strange. Wasn’t death supposed to change someone? To make you feel a special sensation? She opened one eye and saw far worse than death itself.</p><p>Here, on the ground, in front of her, was laying Harry, face to the ground, dead. She threw the cape away and crouched next to the body.</p><p>“NO! HARRY! HARRY!” she tried to shake him awake “Please, please, please. Say something…” But nothing could be done. Harry’s eyes were on hers but not seeing. She rocked on her heels holding his body and crying into his shirt. She could feel his warm going away, turning into a coldness he never possessed. She did not see Voldemort on the ground. Pushed by the force of his own spell. When Bellatrix tried to help him up he casted her away.</p><p>“I DON’T NEED YOUR HELP” raising from the ground, he was now standing higher than ever. He dusted his robe and took of the yard around Nagini. “Now, Mudblood it is your turn to die. How foolish of you to think you could win against me.”</p><p>Hermione came out of her trance after hearing him pronouncing <em>Mudblood</em>. She prepared herself, if there was no Harry, there was no hope. Without hope she was better dead anyway.</p><p>“Master – If I may” both Voldemort and Hermione turned their attention to the pale boy dressed in black. Draco advanced to the front line of Death Eaters, detaching himself from the group.  He felt Voldemort trying to prick his mind. To know what was Draco’s intention. He projected to him all the anger and hatred he felt toward the Muggle-born – everything since the day he met her. Voldemort chuckled.</p><p>“Well my boy, she is all yours.” Theatrically he opened his arms, looking and sounding like a father offering a Christmas present to his precious son.</p><p>Hermione’s looked at Draco as he advanced to her. He was walking calmly and silently. Hermione imagined that if death could take a human appearance, she would have taken this one. Face of an angel to hide the darkness of her visit. She looked at him in the eyes and watched him reach her. He crouched down, now face to face with her. Silent tears were now falling from her eyes. He locked his grey gaze on her brown one and gently took the wand from her hand. Separating her finger softly when she could do nothing but stare. Her eyes were pleading him – <em>please be quick about it</em>. If possible, she would prefer a clean death instead of having her body tortured and ridiculed before.</p><p>At her grand surprise, Draco made a small smile at her. The elder wand in his hand, she was at his mercy, no way to fight. However, instead of casting the killing curse, he did something unexpected: He took her in her arms and whispered “I am so sorry Hermione”. And then, he apparated them away.</p><p>Silence was once again present in the clearing. Voldemort was looking at the spot where his protégé was mere moment ago. The only indication that they have been there at all, was the lifeless body of Harry Potter.</p>
