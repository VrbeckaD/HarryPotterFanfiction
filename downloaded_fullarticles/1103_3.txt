    <p>"Haarrry Potter" a low hissing voice wound its way through the nightmare "Harry!" someone was calling his name from far... far... away. Voldemort was once again haunting Harry's dreams. A flash of green light illuminated Harry crouched against the gravestone of Tom Riddle staring at the dead body of Cedric Diggory spread-eagled on the ground, blank grey eyes gazing at the sky unseeing. Harry was still staring at him from his position underneath the gravestone, so still he looked as though he was carved from stone. "Harry!" the voice called again coming closer he stirred moaning "no, no, not again it wasn't me"</p>
<p>"Harry!" called the voice yet again a jet of cold water hit harry square in the face and he jerked awake staring up into the long nosed freckled face of his best friend Ron Weasley grinning down at him</p>
<p>"Sorry mate but mum's going crazy and she says that if we aren't ready to go to Diagon alley in 10 minutes we'll be de-noming the garden when we get back" Harry groaned rolling onto his side as Ron strode out of the room staring at one of the many Chuggly Canon posters but not really seeing it. He had, yet again been dreaming about the dark wizard that had hunted Harry almost his entire life. Lord Voldemort. Harry had defeated him secretly hunting down each of the seven horcruxes that Voldemort made to make himself almost immortal. He had killed Voldemort, yet the memories remained.</p>
<p>Harry rubbed at his eyes trying to push aside the heavy fog of exhaustion that had been hounding him since the day he had realized that he, Harry had been used as one of the seven horcruxes that had tied Voldemort to life. Even when the piece of soul that had been inside Harry was destroyed, he still felt tainted, contaminated. He was so heavy these days so weighed down with all the lives that Voldemort had destroyed or killed while he had hunted down the horcruxes he'd wasted countless hours, days searching for them. He could have acted sooner, searched for them faster, but because of his slow pace all those lives had been taken. Because of his fear of facing Voldemort of encountering him one day in that final duel he had been reluctant to rush the search, to face him so soon. His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of Ron's bedroom door opening. He stomped into the room banging the door open as loud as he could he could before slamming it shut making the people occupying the Chuggley Cannons posters stare.</p>
<p>He looked over at Harry and said in an annoyed voice "Change of plans Ginny's got spattergroit so she can't come with us and Fred’s too busy at Weasleys Wizard Wheezes with Lee so he can't come with us either. She says that since Ginny can't come with us or to school this year we'll have to get their by ourselves and buy our books and supplies on our own because she has to stay home with Ginny" he paused taking a deep breath then continued indignantly "and when I asked if we could have the key to our vault she said that Bill would give us our money when we go in. I mean where’s the trust?"</p>
<p>Harry forced out a smile his facial muscles straining since he had not smiled often since after the war. Ron squinted at him and asked "you okay mate? You look like your swallowing a lemon" Harry gave up another thing he was shit at then. He'd have to practice on that since he didn't plan on going through the year looking halfway to hell.<br/>
He was supposed to be the model everyone looked up to. The perfect hero who had defeated Voldemort and saved the world. He could not be anything less, should not be anyone less. And he would never let anyone see this part of him. The dark void inside of him that grew bigger day by day devouring his feelings and sapping his energy and strength.<br/>
Harry shook his head to clear his thoughts in time to hear Ron say "-good that you already took a shower since we want to go in a couple of minutes." Harry looked up at Ron confused then looked down at himself. His shirt stuck to his body and was damp with sweat. He quickly ran his hand through his messy black hair which was also soaked with sweat he stared at it glimmering in the light of the candles that were set into the walls of the room. It wasn’t sweat, no it was too dark for sweat.</p>
<p>It was blood. Like the blood that had coated Severus Snape when he’d been struck by the snake, blood that still stained the castle walls of Hogwarts, the blood of all the innocents he couldn’t save, innocents that he should’ve saved. His head was spinning he couldn’t get in any air he couldn’t breathe; he could breathe… Shit. He was having a panic attack. Nausea rose in him and his mouth went dry he had to do something, anything.</p>
<p> He nodded distractedly to Ron got up and strode over to the bed stand that was next to the small cot he was currently sleeping in. He opened one of the drawers it creaked and protested but he pulled harder until it was fully opened he quickly grabbed a black t-shirt with a skull design on it and a pair of blue jeans along with his last pair of boxers and ran down the burrows rickety steps as quickly as he could, and though they creaked and groaned dangerously beneath his pounding feet he didn't slow down until he'd reached the landing that held the only bathroom In the house.</p>
<p>He wrenched the door open and ran inside quickly closing the door making sure it was locked, he rushed over to the toilet and heaved into it. The sour taste of vomit hit him a moment before he leaned over the toilet again and spat it out. His body spasmed as he again vomited into the toilet for the third time. </p>
<p>Finished Harry closed his eyes slumping against the toilet. Exhaustion rolled over him and stars danced in front of his eyes. Slowly he got to his feet and flushed the toilet then he shuffled over to the bathtub. He put the shower on turning the knob with little effort. While the water was running, slowly warming. He stripped his sweaty, vomit smelling clothes off and vanished them wish a flick of his wand. He stepped into the bathtub letting the warm water seep over his cold, exhausted body. Taking some soap from the small shelf that was built into the bathtub's side he poured it onto a rag and scrubbed at his body as though he could wash away the phantom taint of Voldemort that was hanging around him like a black cloud.</p>
<p>When Harry at last stepped out of the bathtub the air was so full of steam that Harry could barely see his own hand as he reached out to pull the shower curtain back. Harry stepped out of the bathtub groping for the towel that he had placed onto the counter. Giving up he slid down to the floor resting his back against the bathtub and letting his head fall back against the rim.</p>
<p>It was too much. Every day doing the same thing. Struggling to keep a smile on his face. It was too much being the hero everyone thought he was. He couldn't do it anymore, couldn't keep pretending to be something he wasn't he- there was movement in the haze of steam that was still thick in the air. Harry's eyes which had been slowly been closing snapped open and he stared into the fog trying to detect what it had been that he'd seen. He spun around “who is it?” he said, uncertainly.</p>
<p>“Is anybody there?” he asked again he swung his head from side to side trying to detect a sign of movement his ears straining to catch any sound that would escape the foggy whiteness that hung, still heavy in the air.</p>
<p>A face loomed out of the blank whiteness he flinched back it was Amelia Bones, Suzan Bones’ Aunt. Her face was twisted with hate. She said in a harsh voice unlike her own, "I am dead because of you. I am here because of you this is all your doing."</p>
<p> Another face swooped down it was Lupin; his face was unrecognizable beneath the loathing and disgust written all over his face. "My son has no father because of you. He has no parents because of your cowardice you didn't even-” </p>
<p>A flash of red caught Harrys attention. Slowly he turned his head. Fred was standing there a look of disappointment on his freckled face. In a voice of utter disgust, he said quietly "I am dead because you were too afraid of Voldemort to face him as soon as the battle began. Because of your cowards’ heart I am dead, and my family hurt along with countless others. It’s all because of you.”</p>
<p>More faces joined those of Amelia, Lupin and Fred. Nimphodora Tonks, Her father Ted Tonks, Colin Creavy, and countless others. They converged on Harry, their faces etched with hatred and disgust. They swirled around Harry their words echoing around him "coward" one hissed, "It’s all your fault" another whispered. They surrounded him circling him moaning vicious insults into his ears. A howling whirlwind of pain, despair and guilt. Harry closed his eyes pulling his knees in hugging himself, "I know he whispered it’s me I was too late. He drank the misery and hate in. He deserved this; it was his punishment for not saving those people. There was a pounding in his head in his-</p>
<p>“Harry!" Hermione’s voice filtered through the door as she pounded on it again. He woke with a start blinking, the steam was gone he was lying on the floor curled up at the foot of the bathtub so tightly his spine was aching. He raised his head realizing at the same time that there were tears streaming down his face. He wiped them away quickly and forced his pain down, down, down. Down into a box shoving it in and slamming it shut and locking it. </p>
<p>Slowly he got to his feet blinking to clear the sleep from his eyes and squinted looking around for his glasses he found them on the counter. Sliding them on the scrubbed at his face to get rid of the tears that were still clinging to his lashes.</p>
<p>"Harry" Hermione called again</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth trying to call out, but his voice was gone. He coughed then cleared his throat "what?" he said. His voice was hoarse, and it shook slightly.<br/>
"Open. The. Door... Right. Now." Her voice was stern and didn't leave room for argument. </p>
<p>"What! Why? I don't have any clothes on" he tried to make his voice sound surprised and indignant. He didn't really care how she or anyone else saw him anymore clothed or bare. </p>
<p>"Then put something on and open the door or I will" Harry slowly reached for his boxers and put them on then started on his jeans and t-shirt. While he was dressing, he asked her "when did you arrive?" his voice was still hoarse but this time he was pleased to hear that it didn't shake.</p>
<p>"Right before you ran downstairs and locked yourself in here" she said.</p>
<p>"Now stop stalling" she added "and let me in"<br/>
He walked over to the door there was no time to get rid of his red rimmed eyes, so he opened the door slowly. It creaked protesting but he pushed harder and it swung open all the way revealing Hermione standing in the hallway her bushy brown hair which was shorter was pulled back in a ponytail, hands on hips she stared at him with a suspicious expression on her face. Dear god Harry thought the whole nine yards. Her brown eyes became concerned as she took him in. She quickly glanced around the hallway then pushed the door fully open and entered. With a wave of her wand the door snapped shut and the lock clicked into place. </p>
<p>She then turned her concerned gaze on him "Harry" she said gently, "are you alright?" </p>
<p>He glanced at her then down at the floor avoiding her gaze "I'm fine" he said his voice breaking on the last word.<br/>
He swallowed before trying again "I'm fine" he said in a firmer voice. </p>
<p>Hermione narrowed her eyes then grabbed his hand examining it. "Harry" she said in a sharp voice, "have you lost weight?</p>
<p>"No, no" he said airily "I just... " he quailed under the look Hermione gave him.</p>
<p>"Hermione sighed through her nose "Harry please don't insult my intelligence. Again."</p>
<p>She took a deep breath before continuing "if your fine then why are you hurling your guts up? Because it sure smells like it and by the looks of it-” she continued, overriding his feeble protests "you've been doing that pretty often" she said gesturing at Harry's arm which she was still holding. "You may be able to fool Ron but don't think you can fool me" she finished.</p>
<p>She noticed his red rimmed eyes at last and took a step closer to him he flinched back lowering his gaze and making his fringe fall over his face to hide them, but it was too late. She released his hand and pushed the bangs across his forehead back forcing him to look directly at her.</p>
<p>"Harry" she said softly, I'm here now" she paused before continuing "I'm your best friend, I'm here for you,” she hesitated then said slowly "I heard you muttering through the door. I was looking for you when I heard you" she hesitated again swallowing before she continued<br/>
"You, you cried out it’s my fault, all my fault, they're dead because of me, and-” she hesitated yet again then said "you also muttered you were too late. You meant Voldemort, didn't you? You think that it’s your fault that all those people were slaughtered and hurt for opposing him or being connected to those people who opposed him" </p>
<p>Harry said nothing only stared at the ground as though it held the answer to some unknown question that he himself didn’t know. Then he raised his hand to Hermione’s which was still holding back his bangs and gripped it gently before forcing it away from his face, then slowly as though every movement cost him a great amount of energy he turned away.<br/>
"Hey" Hermione said gently "you don't have to push me away okay? I'm right here and I’m not leaving until-" she cut herself off as Harry turned and she drew her breath in sharply as though someone had knocked the air from her lungs, or surprised her.</p>
<p>Tears streamed down Harrys face as he turned back to her slowly. All the pain he'd locked in that chest with the key he'd thought he'd thrown away had exploded and he felt as though he were tearing apart from the force of it. He wanted to scream to find some way to end it all to release the pain, and self-hatred. He felt like the Cruciatus Curse was being used on him all over again. But no, he wouldn't cry out, couldn't, because it took too much energy to even breath and feel these days let alone walk and talk.<br/>
So, he just stood their tears flowing in tiny rivulets down his face. He couldn't move couldn't breathe from the pain of it. He felt as though one slight motion would break him entirely- finish the fracturing that Voldemort had started and even from death, would finish.</p>
<p>"Oh Harry" Hermione cried before she embraced him in a tight hug wrapping her arms around him as his tears continued to flow silently.</p>
<p>"It is my fault, if I hadn't acted sooner hadn't been so damn afraid of him of facing him, of turning myself in to stop all those people from dying for my cause then- then" his voice broke and he gripped Hermione tighter trying to relieve some of the pain any of it just to get rid of just a small part of it would be a relief. </p>
<p>Hermione said nothing only gripping him more firmly and rubbing her hand in small circles on Harry's back as his tears fell- still silent onto her shoulder.</p>
