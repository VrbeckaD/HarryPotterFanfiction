          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry knew Draco by now,  knew that when he wanted something, he'd get moody and irritable for a day or two and then it would burst out like a volcano erupting.</p><p>"I want to tie you up," Draco announced two bites into pudding. </p><p>Harry paused, his spoon halfway to his mouth, then nodded before taking a bite. "I did wonder what had you out of sorts the last few days."</p><p>Draco frowned. "I wasn't out of sorts."</p><p>Harry suppressed a smile. No sense riling Draco up any further now. Not if sex was in the offing. He'd save their verbal sparing—and Draco's pouting—for another time.</p><p>"Regardless, what did you have in mind?" </p><p>"A blindfold and silk ties, work our way up to something more <i>challenging</i>."</p><p>Harry stood, his cock catching up with his thoughts. "I do enjoy a challenge."</p><p>"I'll hang onto the handcuffs and leather restraints then."</p><p>Harry looked at Draco out of the corner of his eye. "Is there anything else you want to tell me?"</p><p>"Let it be, Potter," Draco grumbled as he took Harry's hand and led him toward the bedroom. </p><p>Somehow Harry knew he wouldn't be the one tied up in the end.</p></div>
