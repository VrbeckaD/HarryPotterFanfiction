    <p>Merlin had lived 1,300 years, or at least around that many years. It was hard to keep track of the passing time to be honest. Not that he looked even remotely that old. He looked to be around thirty at the moment, appearance had to be kept, but he still had his messy black hair, blue eyes, and infections (if he could say so himself) smile. No one would believe that he was Merlin and that was one reason he never bothered to change his appearance. Besides everyone thought he was dead.</p><p> </p><p>That being said, having lived so long, boredom was something that he was not unaccustomed to. Sometimes he traveled, and that was when he was most likely to loose track of time, but sometimes he went to school, Hogwarts to be exact. He had been a student about 8 times, not that the number mattered, and a teacher 4.</p><p> </p><p>Every once in a while the old religion would pull at him, but it happened very rarely now a days and his interference was usually left up to his discretion. Then again it was because of that when the old religion called it moved him if not out of loyalty then out of curiosity.</p><p> </p><p>The last time the old religion pulled at him it was right before he suggested the Isle of the Blessed for the Hogwarts school grounds. It wasn’t his place to offer it and he wouldn’t have if the old religion hadn’t given its approval.</p><p> </p><p>He would be going back to Hogwarts soon, or at least that was what he had been feeling recently. The old religion certainly hadn’t lost his pull, but that might have just been because it had been so long absent. The feeling made him jump out of bed, quite literally, and make a visit to the Crystal Cave. He saw many images, as he always had, but throughout the flashes words were repeating. A prophecy.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies..."</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The young boy the people had been talking about, Harry something or other, would be the key to what he was supposed to do. If Merlin had to guess the attack on Harry’s family was the moment he had been ‘marked’. Voldemort had been a problem, but it wasn’t something he could interfere in, and now he knew why he couldn’t. He wasn’t destined to end the fight and couldn’t get involved, at least he couldn’t until yesterday when the old religion called out to him because Morgana had begun making her way back through the veil and out of Avalon.</p><p> </p><p>Now, 900 years after the building of Hogwarts and five years since Voldemort’s fall, he sat at one of the cafes looking rather longingly over at Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour, but something was telling him to remain seated for just a bit longer. It wasn’t the old religion but instinct, though sometimes distinguishing between the two could be difficult, not that it mattered.</p><p> </p><p>A young blonde boy chose then to wonder across his path. He wouldn’t have thought much of it but the boy must have seen him from the corner of his eye and chose to approach.</p><p> </p><p>At first the boy didn’t say anything, but tilted his head to the side as if examining him. “Are you a pureblood?”</p><p> </p><p>The question was innocent, or was supposed to be, but it angered him that children were asking such things, being taught to ask such things.</p><p> </p><p>“Why?”</p><p> </p><p>The boy stood up straighter now and puffed out his chest dramatically, “Because my father says that purebloods are better because we’re not tainted.”</p><p> </p><p>Merlin raised an eyebrow. He did, in fact, pose as a pureblood, if only because magical paperwork was easier to deal with and his explanations were more easily accepted. He wasn’t in the muggle world long enough, or often enough, to set up any identities, and being magic itself was pretty pure. He always put his previous identity as his father and from a whole slew of invented family he drew a woman’s name from to be his mother. He had set it up with the founders, it had been their idea and it had come in handy. There was a spell that they had set to make the family tree continue to grow on its own, without his interference being necessary. He only had to update his direct line. It gave him a family name to use. Still, he didn’t want to encourage this child’s beliefs.</p><p> </p><p>He would have said no, but the Malfoy symbol stopped him. If he lied (about his fake identity) it could come back to haunt him, especially if that lie was to someone who could have it verified. He was stuck and his choices were to tell the truth or to ignore the child. “Yes.” He couldn’t ignore the kid. There was something about him.</p><p> </p><p>The kid gave him a sharp nod. He looked to be five but was acting as if he was an adult. Prat. Before he could speak again an older man appeared. “Draco, we avoid the riff-raff.” It was said with a sigh, as if he had repeated this point one too many times.</p><p> </p><p>Draco, the kid, nodded then raced back to his father, slowing halfway there and settled into a dignified walk. They spoke for a minute before Draco walked back over with his father following him.</p><p> </p><p>“I apologize if my son was bothering you.” Merlin realized that this apology wasn’t an actual apology, but for show, and was again annoyed by the arrogance.</p><p> </p><p>“Not at all. He seems to be extremely bright.” Merlin said with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>That seemed to encourage the older Malfoy to speak again, “My son tells me you’re a pureblood,” when Merlin nodded in agreement he continued, “I’m Lucius Malfoy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Macarius Ambrosius.”</p><p> </p><p>At his name Lucius reached out a hand for Merlin to shake. Merlin shook his hand realizing that he must have recognized the name and deemed him not riff-raff. “Ah, yes. I have heard of the Ambrosius family. I heard that they are,” he paused and seemed to try to think of the correct word, “Reclusive.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, my family does have that reputation.” Merlin agreed easily, it was hard to meet people who didn’t exist.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius nodded; “Do you have a child yourself?” he seemed much more friendly now that he realized that he was speaking with someone who was both a pureblood and of a good family.</p><p> </p><p>Merlin’s first thought was to deny but he would be attending Hogwarts to stay close to the Potter (Harry Potter was his name Merlin remembered) boy. He should be about five too, the same age as Draco. So to keep his cover he answered, “As a matter of fact I do. A boy of five who takes almost completely after me.”</p><p> </p><p>“The same age as Draco here then.” Lucius said putting a hand on the boy’s head. “Maybe you and your wife would like to come to the Christmas ball we will be having in a few months.” He seemed to pause as if an idea had struck him, “She is a witch, correct?”</p><p> </p><p>Merlin sighed catching on to Lucius’s train of thought. Lucius must believe that the was only reason he is outside his home is because he was forced out, probably for marrying a muggle. Still, he tried to look sad, “She was, but my wife passed recently so I don’t believe I, or my son, would be up to it,” there was no other way to explain why she would never be seen, besides the paperwork was already filed. “Sometime we tutor our children ourselves but in lieu of the loss I will be sending him to Hogwarts when he turns eleven.”</p><p> </p><p>Lucius nodded, “With any luck he will end up in Slytherin with Draco here.”</p><p> </p><p>“What’s his name?” Draco asked curiously, speaking for the first time since his dad had joined them.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius shot Draco a look but Merlin answered anyway. He had made the birth certificate last night, and with magic as strong as his it was already completely legitimate, as was the supposed death of his wife. “Myrddin.”</p><p> </p><p>Lucius nodded, “We must be going,” he began as he saw his wife exiting Madam Malkin’s Robes for all Occasions, “We do hope that we will see you again.”</p><p> </p><p>Merlin nodded all the while knowing that it would be one of the last times anyone saw him. His own death would take place within the year and he would become Myrddin, a six year old with no parents.</p><p> </p><p>He has a mansion with a few house elves, and that would be where he would stay until the time when he could go to Hogwarts. He must start preparing soon  anyway, as who knows when the real fight would begin.</p>
