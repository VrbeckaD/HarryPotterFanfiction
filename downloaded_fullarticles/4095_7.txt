  <em>Next to my heart is ever so lonely,</em><br/>
<em>I'm holding only air,</em><br/>
<em>While here in my arms it's adorable!</em><br/>
<em>It's deplorable</em><br/>
<em>That you were never there...</em>
</p><p align="center">Dearest Enemy (1925)</p><p> </p><p>For months, the world had existed only in distant sound—footsteps from above him (or around? Perhaps below?), muffled voices, faint scratches and the groan of furniture. Of course, he did not know it has been months. Time bled away between the fades in and out of unconsciousness, and the difference between opening and closing his eyes became non-existent in the blackness to which he was confined.</p><p>Sometimes he felt himself coming to in a position he could not remember arranging himself in, with faint memories of a conversation already slipping from his mind. Though he could not remember eating or drinking, the faintness of starvation never seemed to last more than a moment before he would fade out, then back in, finding it gone as if he had only imagined it to begin with.</p><p>He was kept perfectly balanced on a razor’s edge: strong enough to keep purchase on life, weak enough to be unable to care about his condition. After a long time, the darkness had simply become normal, and the focus or acuity to question his predicament was all but lost until the hunger came back.</p><p>With it came flashes of brightness and sound. Memories of someone pulling him out of the blackness into a room that looked remarkably like his own; of his own voice speaking to him and then replying (“your mother’s name?” “Evelyn” “and who is Dahlia?”); his hand itching for his wand in a rush of anger, before blackness blossomed behind his eyes again and he awoke alone.</p><p>Truth be told, there was no despair in the realisation that he was dying. He had already been dead a long time, and could not for the life of him think of any good reason to remain alive. So, when the light shone on him once again it barely occurred to him that it might be anything more than an unusual trick of his dormant imagination, or that the voices surrounding him were in any way connected to the two pairs of hands who lifted him from the floor.</p><p>“I can’t believe it…”</p><p>“Get the healers. Now.”</p><p>“Mr. Graves, can you hear us?”</p><p>“Mr. Graves!”</p><p>The sound and sensation were still distant, but this time unquestionably real. Percival Graves lifted his heavy head slowly, furrowed his brow and opened his mouth to speak—before losing his grip on consciousness again, and sagging in the arms of his rescuers.</p>
