    <p>The boys had been silent for the entire train ride back to London. While students wandered around the Hogwarts Express, excitedly sharing their plans for the summer, the four marauders sat in their compartment, quietly keeping each other company. They all knew what this summer meant; it was their last summer at Hogwarts. This was their last summer in the safety and protection of the family they had built within the castle walls. This time next year, the boys would be alone. No more night time prowls around the forest, no more map, no more wandering the halls at night, no more misadventures. Nobody wanted to bring up what everyone was thinking: this was the start of the end.</p><p> </p><p>When they arrived in London, the four boys said their goodbyes and parted ways. Remus returned to the Lupin home, knowing that his next three moons would involve a steel cage and concrete walls. Peter returned to his mother’s house, realizing that he would once again become the meek pushover he used to be before becoming a marauder. Sirius followed James to the Potter Manor, the same place he stayed the previous summer after leaving 12 Grimmauld Place forever.</p><p> </p><p>Remus and Sirius had managed a more intimate farewell on the train, sharing a tender kiss and a promise to see one another constantly throughout the summer.</p><p> </p><p>And just like that, the boys were separated. The four marauders became individuals until their next opportunity to meet up.</p><p> </p><p><br/> ___<br/> </p><p> </p><p>Day one into summer vacation, James’ owl came to visit Lupin’s home with a note.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, hullo Athena.” Remus gave the owl a friendly rub and untied the letter from her leg. James had always been willing to lend his owl to Remus, and she had grown to love the werewolf. The owl playfully nipped at Lupin’s fingers, eager for a treat that showed his gratitude.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, yeah, I’m sure mum has some owl food around here somewhere…”</p><p> </p><p>Remus scattered pellets across the kitchen table and the small barn owl happily hopped around as he read <a href="https://imgur.com/a/05v4ukV" rel="nofollow">his letter</a>.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Moons </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Guess what? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Got concert tickets. Four of them. </em>
</p><p><em> We’re all going. </em> </p><p>
  <em> No, you don’t have a choice. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> No, you’ve probably never heard of this band. (They’re muggles) </em>
</p><p>
  <em> No, you can’t use the moon as an excuse. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> No, I can’t return the tickets. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Suck it up, Moons. We’re going on a road trip! </em>
</p><p>
  <em> July 1st. Meet at the Potters’ place. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> -S </em>
</p><p>
  <em> P.S. Write me back. I miss you. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Remus couldn’t help but smile. This was surely his first of many letters from Sirius. They never discussed what would happen to their relationship once they went home for the summer, but it seemed like his boyfriend had every intention of keeping in touch.</p><p> </p><p>Remus grabbed a quill and parchment from the kitchen drawer and wrote <a href="https://imgur.com/a/RTQpMGC" rel="nofollow">his own letter</a> in response.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Dear Sirius, </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I will attend this concert if you insist, however, it had better not be any of that “Punk Rock” nonsense that you call music. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> If I’m not mistaken, Potter Manor isn’t located too far from my parents’ home. Why wait until July to meet up? If Mr. and Mrs. Potter are open to the idea, I would love to come over for a visit sometime soon. Hopefully we’ll make the most out of our last summer as students. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Don’t forget to write me regularly. As you know, I do not own an owl. We will have to share Athena. I expect that James will want to use her to write to Lily as well, so correspondence may be difficult. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Please keep in touch. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I do miss you. </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> - </em> <strike> <em> Remus </em> </strike> <em> Your Moony </em></p><p> </p><p>Remus didn’t have anything against Sirius’ taste in music. In fact, although he’d never openly admit it to his boyfriend, Moony had developed an affinity for Muggle rock music. Unfortunately, he also had an affinity for annoying Padfoot, so he was particularly careful to say exactly the type of thing that would bother his partner.</p><p> </p><p>Remus rolled his letter up and tied it to Athena’s leg. She hooted happily before taking off and flying out the open window. Lupin smiled to himself, imagining Sirius’ face as he opened the letter.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps this summer would turn out to be enjoyable after all.</p><p> </p>
