  <span>Harry walked through the corridor, already in a bad mood and feeling defensive. He'd been staying at Hogwarts during the summer, helping McGonagall rebuild and figure things out, and eighth year started that night, meaning the other students, and his new roommate, were all arriving that day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His new roommate, Draco bloody Malfoy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And yeah, Harry was upset to be sharing a room with a guy who almost killed him and had hated him for years, but he'd requested it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Because at the end of the day, Draco had chances all throughout the war to kill Harry, or let him die, and every time, he… Didn't. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Which was why, when McGonagall had been stressed at where to place the blonde git, Harry had requested to room with him. Harry wasn't an idiot, he knew that things would be tense, with everyone. Draco would find himself the target of a lot of hostility, and though earned, Harry found it hard to believe it was deserved. If Draco could protect him, Harry could protect Draco, too. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But that didn't make him happy about the arrangement. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They'll be arriving soon,” McGonagall told him as she fell into step beside him. “I wish Albus…” She trailed off with a sigh. She'd done that a lot over the summer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know,” Harry reached out, putting his hand on her shoulder. “He'll always be with us, yeah?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, of course,” She smiled at him, putting her hand over his and patting it. “Thank you, Harry, you're a good boy…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry smiled back, though still not in the mood to. It didn't matter how he felt, McGonagall needed a little brightness in her life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco had managed to find a compartment in the back of the train, a couple third years being the only occupants, so he'd wedged himself in the corner and pulled his hood up so he wasn't as recognizable. All the third years seemed terrified to be riding with him, so they all had scurried off almost as soon as he'd sat down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Getting on the train itself had been hard enough, it seemed like no one wanted him at Hogwarts. He wasn't entirely sure they were wrong to treat him how they did. He was a Death-eater to them, and always would be. The mark on his arm was a sufficient enough reminder that he'd never be anything more than a killer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The only one to have said anything to Draco past, ‘go fuck yourself,’ ‘go to Azkaban, Death-eater,’ or ‘you shouldn't be here,’ had been Pansy. She'd offered him a pitying smile and a quiet, “I'm glad you're here,” as he passed her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Arriving at Hogwarts had carried the same note, and they all went to their tables and watched first years get sorted, but the Slytherin table was too empty. Students from every year had decided not to return for another year, and Draco was beginning to believe he'd made a mistake by returning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Any first year sorted into Slytherin was followed by a few seconds of silence before a reluctant round of applause, and Draco couldn't help but blame himself for that. After all, </span>
  <em>
    <span>he </span>
  </em>
  <span>was the Slytherin anyone would point to as the perfect  example of what not to be. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After the sorting ceremony, all the eighth years were asked to stay behind as all the other students went to their dorms. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you all for your patience,” Headmaster McGonagall called from her stand. “Now I realize this will be very complicated for you all, so I'll try and do this so it's the least difficult for everyone involved. Though all of you are still in your original houses, and essentially retaking your seventh year, due to having a full seventh year class, you will be boarded separately and taking classes separately as well.” She waved her wand, pieces of parchment appearing on the tables in front of all the remaining students. “There's your new class schedules, and your dorm assignments. I'd recommend reviewing that and settling in for the night. And I hardly need remind you all, the war is over. Any continuation of what has passed will not be tolerated. That being said, we're thankful for each of your returns. Good night and welcome back.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Everyone started getting up as they looked over their papers, so Draco did the same. He stood as he picked up the parchment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of bloody course, he'd been put with possibly the one person in the whole school he couldn't bare to live with. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Harry freaking Potter.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>---</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry walked back to his room after McGonagall’s welcome speech, upset and a little nervous. To say that he and Malfoy hadn't left things off in a good term would be an understatement. He'd spoken in defense of both Draco and Narcissa Malfoy, and they'd both been let free, but Lucius had been sent to Azkaban, and Harry was certain Draco would blame that on Harry. Not to mention the fact that Draco was a horrible person who'd tried to kill Dumbledore and Harry both. Yes, he'd backed down in the moment every time, but he still had treated Hermione awfully, and was a horrible person. Always had been, and probably always would be. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron had been put with Neville, Hermione was put with Fay Dunbar, and had both been relatively fine with their pairing. “It's not fair,” Ron had told Harry after hearing about Malfoy. “You saved the whole bleeding world, you shouldn’t have to stay with that creep.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It doesn't seem right,” Hermione agreed with a sigh. “I'm not sure what McGonagall was thinking. She should have put Draco with another Slytherin.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry hadn't told them that he'd been the one to ask, because he was starting to think it was a bad idea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So when Malfoy </span>
  <em>
    <span>finally </span>
  </em>
  <span>came into their room, Harry wasn't inclined to be very friendly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco didn't say anything, just looked around the room before heading into their shared bathroom. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He was in there for twenty minutes or so before coming back out. He had changed into a long-sleeved black shirt and black pants. He gave Harry a weird look before snapping his head away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Without a word, he set his suitcase next to his bed and sat on the edge of it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So we’re roommates,” Harry said, a little tensely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I hadn't noticed,” Draco raised his eyebrow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don't be a dick, Malfoy,” Harry glared. “I want to make this work, okay?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Great start,” Draco rolled his eyes as he pulled his covers up and slid under them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry scoffed, though not being able to say much else. “Yeah,” He said thoughtlessly. “Well, good night.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco gave Harry the same weird look before rolling over so he couldn't see him anymore. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...You're supposed to say it back,” Harry smiled. At least he'd be able to annoy Draco. That might be the only fun he'd have that year. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a beat of silence. Satisfied, Harry settled under his own covers. He clicked off the lamp, and then he heard Draco mutter “Good night, Harry.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>...Shit. </span>
