    <p>
  <span>Draco glances at the clock in his office. Almost five. He looks at the bottom corner of his computer. 4:52 to be exact. He glances down at his watch. 4:50... something. Draco sighs and flops back in his chair, running a hand through his hair. He can only hold off on leaving until five before Harry starts calling him. Or shows up. He taps at the desk and then looks up at the clock again. Nearly 5. He looks at the computer: 4:54. Six more minutes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>*Bing* </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco glances down at his phone and sees Harry’s name brightening up the screen. He picks up his phone to open the message, noting the time on his phone: 4:55.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Harry: </b>
  <span>Hermione and Ron are here. Just got back home from helping them settle in at the hotel. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco takes a deep breath. Alright so they’re here. That’s fine. Not like he’s been dreading this visit for weeks. His phone dings again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Harry: </b>
  <span>I know you’re stressed about seeing them. But everything will be fine, okay? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Draco: </b>
  <span>Okay.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Harry: </b>
  <span>see you soon? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Draco: </b>
  <span>Yeah, I’m just waiting to close up. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Harry: </b>
  <span>Alright. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Harry: </b>
  <span>I lovee you. </span>
</p>
<p>Draco smiles at that. </p>
<p>
  <b>Draco: </b>
  <span>I love you too. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco sighs and glances at the clock. A few minutes after 5. He checks the computer: 5:02. Time to face the music. (<em>“The music,” being his boyfriend’s two best friends who have *barely* accepted their relationship and </em><em>sort of</em><em> hate him! yay! )</em></span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With a sigh Draco locks the door to the café behind him and begins walking to the empty alley he uses to Apparate.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>....</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry was very happy to see his friends. It had only been two months since the move but, they were his best friends, and he had missed them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione and Ron were staying in a hotel, a different one then the last time they had been here, but after picking them up from the airport and helping them settle into their room, the trio had headed over to Harry’s for dinner. Harry had thought a small dinner with his friends would be more comfortable for everyone, seeing how the last time they had tried to merge both friend groups, things had gone.... significantly bad. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They’re waiting for Draco to arrive home, he's closing the café today and Harry suspects he’s waiting until the very last possible second to leave. So, currently they’re sitting at the table with some wine and Hermione is telling Harry about the new research she’s doing as they wait. Harry glances at the clock, nodding along to Hermione, (5:05) Draco should be here soon. Harry feels his stomach erupt into little butterflies, and he takes another sip of wine. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They’ve been together, officially, about three months or so now, and Harry <em>still</em> gets nervous at the thought of seeing Draco walk through the door. He confided in Hazel one day about it, who beamed at him and told him, “that’s the cutest thing I’ve ever heard,” before assuring him he wasn’t crazy, and that being excited to see your significant other was a good thing. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry’s pulled out of his thoughts by the sound of the door clicking open and smiles as he watches Draco walk in. Draco’s eyes meet his, and Harry nods slightly at him hoping to project some sort of comfort to his boyfriend. If he wasn’t captivatingly in love with the man, he wouldn’t notice that his eyes grew wide for the briefest of seconds like a timid deer, before the mask went up, and he surely wouldn’t think twice about the way Draco was holding himself: composed and proper, the only hint of him feeling anything other than pure confidence being the soft tapping of his right foot. </span>
  <span>Harry stands up from the table and sets down his glass moving forward to Draco, aware of the fact that Hermione and Ron are standing up behind him as well. Harry reaches Draco and pushes himself up to lightly kiss Draco hello, whispering softly in his ear, “Relax,” as he falls back to the ground next to Draco. Then he turns to find Hermione and Ron standing a few feet away looking unsure of themselves. Harry gives Draco a slight nudge with his elbow, who side eyes him before stepping forward. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello, Hermione. Ron. It’s good to see you again.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione nods and gives Draco a small smile, “It’s lovely to see you Draco.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Good to see you too,” Ron mutters. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry smiles and coughs quietly, “Okay, well um, we were having a glass of wine while we were waiting. Here I’ll grab you one...” he murmurs as he slips by to grab a glass out of the cupboard for Draco. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How was work?” Harry hears Hermione ask. “It was good... not too many customers near the end of the day.... How has your work been? Harry tells me you’re working in some sort of research sect?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry smiles to himself as he turns to bring Draco the wine glass. This isn’t going too bad. Harry hands Draco the glass, who thanks him quietly as Hermione continues to explain the work she’s doing. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>....</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The night went okay, Draco thinks as he steps out of the shower and stares at his reflection. No fighting. No threats. It hadn't been <em>comfortable</em> but they had ordered takeout and made small talk until Hermione and Ron left for the night. Draco runs a hand through his wet hair and steps out of the bathroom. Harry’s sitting in bed typing on his computer but looks up and grins at Draco when he sees him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That went well,” He says practically beaming. Draco smiles at him, “It wasn’t awful.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry laughs and gets out of bed walking over to Draco who’s looking through his drawers for clothes. Draco feels Harry wrap his arms around his waist. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Come on, admit you had fun.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco turns slightly and raises an eyebrow at his boyfriend. “I don’t know if fun is the word I would use. It was... tolerable.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry rolls his eyes and turns Draco so they’re pressed up against each other. He pushes gently so that Draco is pressed up against the dresser and Harry looks up at Draco. “Just the teeniest amount of fun?” He pleads. Draco stands there for a second, and then tips Harry’s chin up. Draco tilts his head down so that his lips are just brushing Harry’s, and then he whispers against Harry’s lips. “<em>No</em>.” Before leaning back and smiling smugly. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry grunts a little. “Fine,” he says, leaning up to press a kiss to Draco’s neck. He kisses up Draco’s neck slowly, stopping at his ear, “Next time then.” Draco sighs softly as Harry goes back to kissing his neck. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hm... what do you mean next time?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry doesn’t answer for a second, he’s too busy sucking on Draco’s neck. <em>There will definitely be a hickey there tomorrow</em>, Draco thinks. Harry finally releases him to answer. “Next time, we’ll just have to make sure you have fun. Maybe we can spend the day with them, play board games in their hotel...” Draco’s eyes widen as he imagines being stuck in a room with Harry’s two best friends for a full day. He hears Harry start giggling and he frowns and pushes Harry off.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> “Very funny.” He drawls, as he turns and pulls out a tshirt and some boxers. Harry is still laughing, “Sorry, but seriously Draco the look on your face,” Harry starts giggling again as Draco moves to put on his clothes, rolling his eyes at his boyfriend who seems to find emotionally torturing him hilarious.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> “You would have thought I asked you to commit arson, instead of spending a day with my friends… Woah<em>, </em>what are you doing?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco squeaks in surprise as his shirt is suddenly torn from his hands. “Harry Potter what in the world are <em>you</em> doing.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> “Well I was </span>
  <em>
    <span>trying</span>
  </em>
  <span> to fuck you...” Harry says pushing Draco back against the wall and blinking up at him. Draco blinks and then looks at his boyfriend with a smirk. “Well then?” He asks, letting Harry press their bodies together again. Harry looks up at him with bright eyes before closing the distance between their lips and pulling Draco towards the bed. Draco grunts as he hits the bed and Harry attacks his mouth again, pulling at his hair to deepen the kiss and straddling Draco. Draco shoves Harry so he’s on top and he pulls Harry’s shirt off. Pressing kisses up his chest Draco whispers, “Tonight wasn’t that bad.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry grins and pulls Draco up to kiss him. “I knew you had fun,” Harry says happily, pulling Draco’s body down onto his so that he can grind up against him. Draco moans softly and reaches down to undo Harry’s pants. “Fun, is still not the word I would use,” he manages to say in between breaths. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry rolls them so he’s on top again. “Fine, not fun. Tolerable.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco rolls his eyes and sits up, “Yes, now can we <em>please</em> stop talking about your friends?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry laughs and nods , pushing Draco back against the bed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>... </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry wakes up later than usual the next morning. He turns to find that Draco is gone and frowns, reaching for where he placed his glasses on the bedside table the night before. Once his glasses are on he blinks, and looks around the room covering up a yawn with his hand. His eyes find the clock and he sighs when he sees the time. It’s a little past 10, which means Draco is already at work. Harry picks up his phone and sits up, looking at his notifications. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>(2) messages from D❤️</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>(1) message from Ron </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry yawns again as he opens his messages from Draco.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>D❤️: </b>
  <span>At work, I didn't want to wake you. I wasn’t sure if you still planned to bring Granger and Weasley to the café? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>D❤️: </b>
  <span>Also, can you feed sugar? I just realized I forgot to do that. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry smirks. He’s gotten used to the odd proper-ness behind his boyfriend’s texts by now. Draco is not the type to use and/or understand lingo. Harry texted him “imy” one day when he was back in England packing, and Draco had asked him “what the bloody hell he was talking about.” It didn’t make it any less amusing though. Or adorable.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Harry: </b>
  <span>Yeah, still planning on bringing Ron and Mione by. Probably in an hour or so, I just woke up. Will feed Sugar now. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry replies to Ron quickly, as he rolls out of bed and heads to the kitchen to feed Sugar. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Ron: </b>
  <span>Mione and I just got up, still taking us to the coffee shop?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Harry: </b>
  <span>Yup. Meet in 30?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron texts back as Harry is getting dressed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Ron: </b>
  <span>👍🏼 </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco still hasn’t responded so Harry texts him to let him know they’ll be at the café in an hour, and then after making the bed and grabbing his keys, steps out. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>*** </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco is in the middle of taking a young woman’s order when Harry walks in with Hermione and Ron. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hazel, who is flitting back and forth next to him making drinks and humming to herself, pauses briefly to poke Draco and murmur, “They’re here,” under her breath before returning to the drinks she was attending. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco finishes writing the woman’s order down before looking up to see Harry yawning and standing in the middle of the shop with Hermione and Ron. Harry finally turns from saying something to Ron and meets Draco’s eyes. Draco raises an eyebrow at him, and Harry rolls his eyes and says something to Hermione and Ron who look over at Draco and then up at the menu and then walk forward so they’re at the counter. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey Malfoy,” Ron says when they reach the counter.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> “Good morning Ron,” Draco responds, tapping his pen against the counter. His eyes shift to Harry who is yawning again, and Draco wonders what one does in this scenario. </span>
  <span>Usually by now Harry’s said Hello and maybe ordered a pastry, since everyone there knows perfectly well that Harry’s usual drink is the white chocolate mocha, and Harry knows that usually, such as right now, there’s a coffee already waiting for him in the office. But, Harry always comes up to the counter to say Hello, and ask how work is going, and depending on how many customers are there, sometimes Harry just walks right in and behind the counter to kiss Draco Hello. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But now Hermione and Ron are standing there, and Hermione is reading the menu and Draco isn’t sure if public displays of affection are something you do in front of your boyfriend’s best friends who have only recently stopped absolutely hating you. It just doesn’t feel normal to show affection in front of them... </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco is pulled out of his thoughts at the sound of Harry saying his name. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>...</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry watches as Draco blinks and looks up at him. “Good morning,” Harry says nudging at Draco’s foot with his own. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Good morning,” Draco replies. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry searches his eyes for a moment before placing a hand on his shoulder. Hazel shimmies past them then, bumping Harry with her hip and throwing a quick, “Hey Harry,” over her shoulder as she moves to grab something from behind him. “Good morning Hazel,” he responds absently, still very much focused on his boyfriend.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> “What would you guys like?” Draco is asking Hermione and Ron. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“A... vanilla latte? Is that okay?” Hermione asks. Draco nods shortly, “Yes, Hazel will have that ready for you soon... I’m assuming you guys are staying here?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Harry says from next to him, “I thought we could wait until your shift was over. You get off at 12?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco nods and turns to him after writing Hermione’s order down, “Yeah, Xander is coming in at noon... But I do have to come back for closing,” he taps the pen to Harry’s chest. “Ted called in sick so Xander will need someone else here.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry nods, and continues to rub Draco’s shoulder. Ron proceeds to ask for what Hermione got, and after writing it down, Draco taps Harry with his pen again, “You’re coffee is in my office on the desk,” he says turning away as the bell on the door announces new customers. Ron and Hermione have stepped to the side and Ron is eyeing the pastries as Harry nods and nudges Draco to look at him. Draco looks up and Harry stops rubbing his shoulder to cup his chin and press a quick kiss to his lips before moving to leave the back of the counter. He stops when Draco reaches out and squeezes his hand. Harry squeezes back before leaving the back of the counter and joining his friends by the pastries. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>***</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry, Hermione, and Ron are in a booth in the corner of the café. Harry is smiling as Ron rants about the desk clerk at their hotel who is “in love with Hermione.” Hermione is laughing next to Ron. “Ron, he is </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span>, he’s just being helpful.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> “He was flirting with you Mione.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He was not.” Hermione objects, looking at Harry for support. Harry stops chuckling and puts his hands up, “Hey don’t bring me into this. I wasn’t even there so I have no idea if he was ‘eyeing you’.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron snorts, “Trust me, he was.” Hermione huffs. “So you think him showing me pamphlets for things to do in San Francisco was a way of</span>
  <em>
    <span> flirting</span>
  </em>
  <span> with me?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes.” Ron says. Hermione rolls her eyes again, “Ron, even if he was, I married </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“She did mate, I was there.” Harry offers laughing as Ron throws a crumb at him. There’s a noise behind him, and Harry turns around to find Draco there with his hands in his pockets. Harry scoots over in the booth, letting Draco slide in. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Done with your shift?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah,” is the reply before Draco yawns. “Sorry I’m a bit tired.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> “Well, Malfoy now that you’re here, we can vote,” Ron says glancing at Hermione who sticks her tongue out at him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> “Vote on what?” Draco asks, running a hand through his hair before placing it on Harry’s thigh. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ron, thinks the desk clerk at their hotel was flirting with ‘Mione this morning.” Harry says. Draco nods, “Ah, I see. Well, sorry to disappoint but I don’t think my vote will be very useful.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> “Come on, Malfoy,” Ron sighs, sounding a little frustrated. Harry places a hand over Draco’s protectively and shoots Ron a glare.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span> I swear if this turns into another fight…</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span> Draco just blinks at Ron levelly. Harry looks at Hermione who glances at him before looking back at their significant others, worriedly. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ronald,” Draco drawls, and Harry watches his boyfriend carefully. He loves Draco but that doesn’t mean he won’t smack him if he acts like a prat. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco continues, “I’m <em>gay</em>. I don’t flirt with women, and other than watching men throw themselves at Hazel </span>
  <em>
    <span>extremely </span>
  </em>
  <span>obnoxiously when we used to go out to bars, I have no idea how men flirt with women.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry feels his shoulders slump in relief. </span>
  <em>
    <span>No fight</span>
  </em>
  <span>, he thinks happily. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron just stares at Draco. “How do you not...? I mean, it can’t be </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> different.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s different,” Harry says, before he realizes he’s saying it, and immediately regrets it when he feels all eyes on him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“</span>
    <span>Is it now?</span>
  </em>
  <span><em>”</em> Draco asks, amused. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry blushes, “not that I... I mean like</span>
  <em>
    <span> when I dated girls</span>
  </em>
  <span>, like before I met you. Well before we met </span>
  <em>
    <span>again</span>
  </em>
  <span>, not like from current experience.” Harry squeaks. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, Harry,” Hermione says before covering her face laughing. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>What?,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Harry asks flustered, “I’m just saying that I- well, when I was still single, there was a difference, like I didn’t flirt with Draco the same way I did with, I don’t know Ginny.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron makes a face, “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Please</span>
  </em>
  <span> don’t talk about when you were trying to date my sister.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I have to agree with Ron on this one.” Draco says from beside him. Harry groans and flops down on the table, feeling Draco’s hand rubbing circles on his back, and listening to Draco’s soft laughter. Hermione pats his hand. When Harry looks back up he frowns at Draco who smiles at him.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“prat,” he huffs, which makes Draco chuckle again. Harry smiles a bit at that and shifts closer to Draco. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“When Xander gets here we can ask him,” Draco says casually. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ask him what?” Harry says at the same time Ron asks, “That’s the big dude right?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco nods, “Yes, I suppose you could describe him like that.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry snorts, “how else would you describe him?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco shrugs, “Good point. And anyways, we can ask him about the man flirting with Hermione. If anyone knows the answer it’s him.” Harry nods, “Yeah that’s true.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright,” Ron replies, glancing at Hermione who crosses her arms. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re going to feel very stupid when he sides with me.” She says. </span>
</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>
  <span>Xander shows up a while later, pushing through the doors and raising his eyebrows when Hazel jumps from behind the counter, shaking her hair out of her ponytail and untying her apron. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Finally</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” she says, throwing him the apron and making a beeline for Draco. Draco turns when he hears Hazel calling him. He had been trying and (suprisingly) succeeding in conversing with Ron and Hermione without screaming or insulting each other. He was quite surprised that he was having an okay time actually. Still, he felt like a weight had been lifted when he heard Hazel calling him. He turns as she walks up to the table, and pats his shoulder. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello,” she says to Hermione and Ron who respond back with equal odd politeness. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hi.” “Hello.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey Hazel,” Harry says, lifting up a hand. Hazel smiles at Harry, and then leans on Draco’s shoulder, directing what she's saying to him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I am heading out love, but I’ll text you about tonight? Once I speak to Ben.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, that’s fine, I’ll be here with Xander until closing,” Draco replies.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Perfect.” She stands up and stretches, “I am going home and taking a nap,” she says to no one in particular, </span>
  <span>“Alright, I’ll see you later,” she says, pointing at Draco, and then waving goodbye to the general table. Draco watches her as she walks out the door, flipping a strand of hair over her shoulder. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“How’s her baby?” Hermione asks. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Kyla? She’s doing really well.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That’s good.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, XANDER!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco jumps in his seat, “Fucks sake, Harry.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, sorry babe, I didn’t mean to…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“D! I didn’t even see you there,” Xander says, walking over to the table.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey Xan,” Draco says, stifling another yawn. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey, Xander,” Harry says from Draco’s side, “we were wondering if you could do us a favor.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah what’s up?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Coffee, please,” Draco says, raising his hand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>And</span>
  </em>
  <span>, can you settle an argument for us?” Harry asks, pulling Draco’s hand down. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Uh, what kind of argument?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>***</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Xander agrees that the desk clerk was, indeed, flirting with Hermione.</span>
