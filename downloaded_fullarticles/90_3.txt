    <p> </p><p>==========</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades<br/>         Past the near meadows, over the still stream,<br/>                Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep<br/>                        In the next valley-glades:<br/>         Was it a vision, or a waking dream?<br/>                Fled is that music:—Do I wake or sleep?</p><p>From "Ode to a Nightingale" - John Keats</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>==========</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Talking to himself has been a habit entrenched far too deep since <em>last time</em>. He remembers a few last times just enough to count with the fingers of his left hand. The faded tattoo on his left forearm doesn't make him bite his lips anymore. Could be three last times. Maybe four. Make it four. Because it's one to five. That way it's easier to count, easier to remember. This will be the last time, anyway. Let's name it the fifth trip. It's always good to have a name that can be forgotten. No one would remember a name as dull as "the fifth trip". Not like they would remember "Draco Malfoy".</p><p>Draco folds his fingers one by one, feeling the fabric of the bedcloth he's resting on. Soft as sin. The years have worn them down like everything else that wears with time. He swears he could see the yellowing white sheet about to tear where he's scraped with his thumb. <em>Can't have you peeling like a tangerine after all you've done for me</em>, he tells the bedcloth that has been his lone bedmate for twelve long years. <em>Alright, it's time to look smart, </em>he says, <em>You and I both. </em>It's an ordeal even to lift his head. He presses his hands down on the mattress, trying to lift the weight of his torso that in turn shoves him back right where he was. <em>Come on. Help me out here, </em>he reaches out to himself.</p><p>Another grunt of effort and Draco finally manages to hop off the bed. He has to blink away the dust bathed in the beam of light peeking from between the curtains. <em>That makes you and I and this place</em>, he says. The flaking wallpaper on the creamy ceiling winks at him, waltzing languidly around the dim corners of his vision. A burning, acidic sensation creeps up from his chest to his throat. 'Heartburn'--whoever came up with that word the first time is a right prat, he thinks, it echoes <em>heartache</em>. The ceiling pirouettes slowly, in tune with the sharp echoing ring in his ears. He wishes he had a cup of coffee, thick with cream and sweet enough to mask the bitterness. The image drags its pair into his head. Steaming french toast, gilded with hot custard. <em>Not now, it's not helping, </em>he says to no one in particular, and sucks the saliva pooling under his tongue.</p><p>A hand on the dresser bears Draco up against the ebb and flow of spinning vision that teases him. When it passes at last, Draco stands in front of the mirror to get a good look at his likeness. His chatter-patter reflection says all the things that announce the dawn of another morning. <em>Oi, myself, you need a haircut and a breakfast tray</em>. Only, it doesn't apply to his mornings. Particularly to <em>this</em> morning, at the head of the fifth trip.</p><p>Draco pecks his forehead in the mirror. He leaves a damp mark there, but the forehead is soon a faded wall because he steps further away. <em>Thanks for the jokes, </em>Draco says, <em>goodbye.</em> Mirror-Draco nods, and kisses his side of the looking glass. Draco stifles a laugh as he sees his reflection making a momentary duckface for the kiss. <em>It's been an honour</em>, the mirror salutes. Draco rotates the clockwork gear on the back of the mirror. When he peers again into the glass, it's no longer a smiling jolly man that meets him. It's Draco Malfoy with limp silver hair covering the eyes and the nape, looking like a starved squib out to beg for knuts. <em>Hey, Mirror, you look like you're 40. </em>The Mirror doesn't answer anymore. It is really himself in there, the thirty-year-old ex-Death Eater who has forgotten how to groom. Draco throws a blanket over the mirror.</p><p>It's time to look smart, so he folds the bedclothes into neat squares. The topmost threadbare piece that hugged his body for more than a decade. The one under it, upper corner painted with drool stains that have seeped through. Two bedclothes. And a blanket covering the mirror. What am I missing, he thinks. He snatches the idling pillow. <em>Gotcha. </em>For the last time he buries his face in it and refuses to part. <em>Perhaps I'll bring you too. No harm in trying, a pillow stuck in my armpit.</em></p><p>The spray of water from the shower feels like the ceaseless impact of a hundred ice pellets. The water is too cold and too biting on his bone-touching skin. Draco draws a sharp breath when the water hits his body. He closes his eyes and pretends the drizzle is warm when his body cools down enough to be tricked. There had been a time when the cracked tiles of his bathroom were pristine white, mother-of-pearl and all perfumed steams and bubbles. It would be nice if he could soak in the soothing warmth of the bath in Malfoy Manor or Hogwarts. It would be so nice to doze off all surrounded by that warmth.</p><p>He dries himself with a towel and kicks it to the side where it mingles with grey clumps of dust. Then he remembers he wasn't supposed to do that, because it's time to look smart, the last and the least thing he could do for this cramped attic that has cradled him in its bosom for the last twelve years. His knee joints squeak and complain when he bends to pick the towel up. He takes it to the sink and lets the water wash away the now-wet, now dark-grey stains of dust. Some spots have permeated in and resist stubbornly. Draco rubs them with his chipped nails and wrings the water out from the towel. He hangs it on the knob of the bathroom door.</p><p>Draco always loves opening the dresser. It permits him to drift into the illusion that he still has something to cherish. He has a sterling silver pocket watch. It's pretty under the dim candlelight when the studded aquamarines twinkle like stars. It's the cheapest piece of jewelry he's adamantly refused to sell even when he thought he couldn't possibly get hungrier. The golden ones are all gone. They didn't give him the right price for those. A baker shoved a week-old loaf at him and snatched his mother's gold bracelet. At the time it had seemed a blessing. He had torn into the dried bread and swallowed the mould too. The mould in his stomach did its job and rammed him into the bed for the next week. Even that seemed a blessing because the fever had given him good dreams, and better, sleep without dreams sometimes. Piece by piece, he pawned off everything that had once upon a time defined who he was.</p><p>Draco admires the iridescent sparkle of the watch and puts it on the pillow. Another thing to bring with him. He rummages through the odds and ends that have accumulated through his decade-long solitude in and out of this room. A mousy brown hooded cloak to shelter him from people. Dried leaves pressed between a Potions book. Photographs of Father and Mother. Splinters of his snapped wand. That had been his sentence. No magic. His wand-core, a unicorn hair in a locket, its silvery hue lost from time and disuse. Shirts and robes, all too big for him now, some too garish, some too simple for today's tastes.</p><p>He finds what he is looking for after digging through the bits and pieces of his life so far. The best robe that he had wrapped in an oilpaper and stashed in the deepest corner of the bottom shelf. The oilpaper rustles from his touch when he unwraps the robe. It smells like unaired wood and mothballs left in too long. But it's okay. He won't wear it after today in any case.</p><p>Before he steps out, leaning on the wall every now and then to catch his breath, Draco fishes for the vial he knows he kept in his robe pocket. He downs it in several gulps. It tastes like salted water. He welcomes it. <em>Could have been worse. Not that bitter. </em>He opens the pocket watch. <em>Tick tock-- </em>every second is precious now that he has only one day left.</p><p>Draco takes a hesitant step over the threshold of his rented Knockturn Alley attic. A final trip outside, before he runs out of time. A visit to the park, smell the grass, listen to the wind. Get Fortescue's ice cream if he's willing to sell to someone like him. Because he doesn't need to count his pennies after this day.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>==========</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
