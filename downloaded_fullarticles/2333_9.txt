  <b>Leaving Family Behind</b>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>**********************************</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ginny swiped tears away from her eyes as she followed her parents back inside the castle. The funeral had been beautiful, but she had lost so many friends…and Harry. The first boy she ever loved. Yes, she had been dating Dean, but she didn’t love him. She had only ever loved Harry, ever since she had first met him on Platform 9 ¾.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ginevra,” called a familiar, and highly unwelcome, voice from behind them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny turned to look at Maverick in annoyance. However, she was caught off guard by his three companions. Two of them were handsome, grown men probably in their twenties, one with sandy brown hair and the other with dark red hair and streaks of purple highlights that caught her eye at first glance. The third was a woman with sandy brown hair, much like the other man. And, upon closer inspection, Ginny guessed that she was the other man’s twin, as they seemed to be about the same age and had similar facial features.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>All three pretty much towered over Maverick, but he didn’t seem fazed by it at all. In fact, the woman’s arm was looped through his, and she stared at Ginny in much the same manner that Ginny was staring at all four of them: in annoyance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny snapped out of her momentary stupor to say, “Don’t call me that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maverick bowed his head slightly. “Forgive me, but I do not have another name for you. What would you wish to be called?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny was taken aback. For a moment, she didn’t understand what he was asking. When she did figure it out, she answered reluctantly. “Ginny.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ginny it shall be, then,” Maverick said politely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing here?” Ginny snapped irritably.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have come to inform you that we will be leaving before dawn. I must return to my homestead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Great, have a nice trip,” Ginny said, then spun about and began walking towards the Great Hall again. She didn’t get two feet away before Maverick stepped in front of her. She glared at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I understand that you are grieving, but you swore to be my blood donor. Are you breaking your oath?” Maverick asked softly, but somehow the soft tone sent chills down Ginny’s spine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can’t be serious!” Arthur exploded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I assure you, I am. This is no concern of yours,” Maverick told the man coolly. “You may be her parents, but it is she who swore herself to me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I swore to be your blood donor only, and only until you find your mate!” Ginny retorted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And so you shall be. I will not ask for anything more or less than that,” Maverick replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Molly, go get Minerva,” Arthur instructed. With a rushed nod, Molly hurried off to find McGonagall. Arthur glared at Maverick. “You will not take my girl away from me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny rolled her eyes at that comment. She sighed. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m only causing more trouble by putting up a fuss. And if I stay with mum and dad, they’ll coddle me like a baby and I’ll feel useless. I won’t get any time by myself.</span>
  </em>
  <span> “Where is your </span>
  <em>
    <span>homestead</span>
  </em>
  <span> anyways?” she asked Maverick.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The one I wish to go to is in France. I have several others scattered about England, however,” Maverick replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny nodded, thinking it over. “Would I be able to do whatever I wanted when you don’t need me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maverick’s lips twitched slightly, the ends curving into a small smile. “Of course you may, provided that it is nothing that may cause you harm or bring you trouble,” he answered, and looked at Arthur. “I will not let your daughter come to any harm, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course you won’t, because she is not going with you!” snapped Arthur angrily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maverick only smirked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is going on here?” McGonagall demanded, walking swiftly over to them. She looked at the vampire, the three companions that were behind him, and then at Arthur and Molly. “I do not recognize you four. What is your business here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He is trying to take our baby away from us!” Molly spat out. If daggers could shoot from eyes, Maverick would have been skewered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not a baby, mum!” Ginny protested. “And I can’t break my promise, either!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>McGonagall frowned at Ginny. “Miss Weasley, what promise are you speaking of?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I swore to be Maverick’s blood donor if he helped me find Charlie and bring him safely to the castle during the Final Battle,” Ginny answered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>McGonagall’s eyes widened. “Miss Weasley, do you know what a blood donor is?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny nodded, slightly annoyed that everyone was treating her like a child that didn’t know anything. “A blood donor lets a vampire feed on his or her blood.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And… you are aware of the other things vampires demand from their blood donors?” McGonagall asked tersely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny nodded. “Yes, but Maverick agreed that he will only take blood from me, nothing else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>McGonagall turned angry eyes to the vampire. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Good heavens, he’s barely a child himself!</span>
  </em>
  <span> “You are Maverick?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am,” Maverick replied with a slight bow of his head. “Pleased to meet you, Headmistress. Your reputation had much to do with our alliance with the light side.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You cannot take Ginny as your blood donor,” McGonagall said, ignoring his statement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am not taking her forcefully. She willingly swore to be my donor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And she is underage. By our laws, she is not capable of making that promise, and you are not allowed to hold her accountable to it,” McGonagall replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, but also by your laws I am still to be considered a child because the age I was turned was thirteen. This means that I am not to be considered an adult in matters of a sexual nature, and by your laws it is clearly stated that vampires consider feeding on blood a sexual act, even though no intercourse is made. Which means you cannot keep two </span>
  <em>
    <span>teenagers</span>
  </em>
  <span> from partaking in a sexual act,” Maverick replied coolly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just about everyone, except Maverick’s three companions, gasped. Even Ginny was dumbfounded, and she didn’t even understand fully what he had just said. McGonagall looked dismayed, then collected herself and gave him a stern glare as she demanded, “Which clan do you belong to?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do not belong to any clan officially. I am considered Rogue.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>McGonagall’s eyes narrowed, then she looked at Arthur and Molly. “Stay here. I am going to find Ceilidh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ceilidh has no jurisdiction over me. He is not my clan leader,” Maverick said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps not, but he understands vampire laws and codes much better than I do. You will wait here until I return with him,” she replied tersely, then turned and went back into the Great Hall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny decided it was time for her to speak up. “Um, Maverick, you </span>
  <em>
    <span>are</span>
  </em>
  <span> aware that I will not, under any circumstances, have sex with you, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ginevra!” Molly cried, astonished at her daughter’s crude and blunt words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maverick merely nodded. “I never said you would be required to, Ginny. I was merely telling your Headmistress that because I am legally restricted by the laws of wizards in many ways, I am considered a child. Feeding from blood is closely related to sex for vampires, and because I am legally still a child such as yourself, I would not be considered a paedophile for engaging in an act which I consider to be sexual.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Er… right,” Ginny said, a little confused. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Why does he talk so weird, anyway?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maverick,” Ceilidh said, looking and sounding very surprised. He looked swiftly at the three behind the boy and nodded to them, then looked at McGonagall. “You don’t mean to tell me the vampire you spoke of is Maverick?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>McGonagall nodded tersely. “He is trying to use our own laws against us to take Miss Weasley as his blood donor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Greetings, Ceilidh,” Maverick said politely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Greetings,” Ceilidh responded, as he was supposed to. “What exactly are you claiming over Ginny, Maverick?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She swore herself to be my blood donor, and only my </span>
  <em>
    <span>blood</span>
  </em>
  <span> donor, until such time as I found my mate if I helped her find her brother and bring him safely to the castle during the Final Battle,” Maverick answered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ceilidh flinched just slightly, then shook his head. “Maverick, you know–”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, I know. But you cannot keep this from me. You and I both know that,” Maverick cut in, the first sign of his anger showing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ceilidh sighed, but nodded. He looked a bit tense. “Yes, I am aware of the...unique situation. But I can still try to convince you out of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It will not work,” Maverick replied. “And you know why,” he added in a softer tone, one laced with a bit of regret.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ceilidh sighed again. He looked at Ginny. “Did you swear to this and are you willing to uphold your oath?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny glanced around at all the faces looking at her, especially her mum and dad, who looked so worried. She looked back at Ceilidh and nodded. “Yes, I did and I will.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ceilidh nodded tersely and looked at McGonagall. “I am sorry, but Maverick has rightful claim. Not even your laws can stop him, especially if Ginny is willing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She doesn’t know what she is getting into!” Molly protested.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ceilidh shook his head. “She seems to understand well enough.” </span>
  <em>
    <span>And she will find out the rest later,</span>
  </em>
  <span> he added silently. </span>
  <em>
    <span>This is not good, but there is nothing I can do.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will not keep her from you, if that is what worries you,” Maverick said. “She may of course visit, if I may accompany her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will she be staying with you, then?” Ceilidh questioned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maverick nodded. “Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And… your other needs?” Ceilidh asked tersely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maverick looked slightly offended, but nodded his head towards his three companions. “Taken care of.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ceilidh’s eyes narrowed. “I know what they are to you, and each other.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Things change.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not you, and never one of our kind,” Ceilidh replied curtly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I changed a lot when I was turned,” Maverick replied softly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ceilidh immediately looked sad, and finally caved with a nod. “Swear she will see nothing offensive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I swear she will see nothing offensive,” Maverick answered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you talking about?” Arthur asked, real worry in his voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ceilidh looked as though he were about to answer, but then shook his head. “It is Maverick’s secret to tell. You will not wring the answer from any vampire. I am sorry, but Maverick has claim on Ginny, for as long as the oath is valid.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You cannot be serious!” denied McGonagall, furious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m afraid I am,” Ceilidh replied. He looked at Ginny. “However, should you ever come to find things completely disagreeable – and I mean </span>
  <em>
    <span>completely</span>
  </em>
  <span> disagreeable – then I will help you,” Ceilidh told her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny frowned at that, but nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s all? That’s all you’ll do?” Molly asked, shocked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mum,” Ginny cut in, “I’ll be fine. I made a promise, and I’ll keep it,” she said resolutely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Molly looked at her daughter with worried eyes, but faced with the determined look that she had seen on all of her other children at one point or another, she knew she was defeated. She nodded. “You’ll visit, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Ginny said, not even asking Maverick.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Frequently,” Molly persisted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny rolled her eyes. “Yes, mum.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Molly hesitated, then nodded and turned resolutely to Maverick, giving him her fiercest Mother Hen Glare. “If one hair on my baby girl is missing, I will skewer you myself!” she declared.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a snicker from one of the men behind Maverick, but Maverick nodded solemnly. “Of course, that is your right. I assure you, however, your daughter will be quite safe with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want the Floo address of the place you will be staying,” Molly continued.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There is no Floo network connected to my estate, I’m afraid. However, I can give you the address for owl post if you would like,” Maverick politely replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Molly nodded curtly, but Ginny cut in before Maverick could give the address. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to go get started on packing,” she announced. Molly looked torn between wanting the owl address and wanting to go with Ginny, but Ginny didn’t give her a chance to decide before walking quickly back towards the Gryffindor/Slytherin corridor, which had survived the attack with no damage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>****************************</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ginny packed her trunk in record time. She was trying not to cry. After everything that had happened, now she had to leave home. She slammed her trunk lid closed and carted it out of her room. As she stood in the hallway, she looked down the hall, towards the end where Harry and Ron’s room was. She let go of her trunk and wandered down the hall, pausing at each door to look inside. All of the rooms were kept in pristine condition, despite the fact that no one had been sleeping in them the past few days.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she passed the door of someone who had died, she had to quickly walk by or else she would start to think about them, and then she would most assuredly cry. She stopped in front of the door to Harry and Ron’s room. It was closed, but when she lightly pressed on the door it swung slowly open. She stood in the doorway with baited breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nothing. The room was as it was supposed to be, just like all of the others. Why had she expected it to be different? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Because Harry is gone,</span>
  </em>
  <span> she thought. </span>
  <em>
    <span>It shouldn’t look normal… not without Harry…</span>
  </em>
  <span> She swiped her eyes. They were dry, but she felt like she should be crying. She backed away from the room, then forced herself to turn away and walk back to her trunk. Grabbing the handle, she pulled it to the exit, and without looking back, she left the Gryffindor/Slytherin corridor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stood by the entrance to the Great Hall and watched people mill about inside. Her parents were arguing with the twins about something, and the Auror's guarding the Death Eaters were switching posts. Hermione and Ron were talking quietly in a corner, and McGonagall was speaking with Tonks. No one even noticed her standing there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you ready?” Maverick questioned, coming to her side.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Well, one person noticed. But he’s a vampire; he doesn’t count.</span>
  </em>
  <span> “Yeah. How are we getting there?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We would normally run, but I understand that you will not be able to do so,” Maverick said. “Do you have a broom?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, but I’m not </span>
  <em>
    <span>flying</span>
  </em>
  <span> all the way to France either!” Ginny protested.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do not expect you to. You and I will travel by train,” Maverick explained. “I just did not want you to have to walk all the way to the train station.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny frowned. “What about your… companions? And I can’t carry my trunk on my broom.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My companions will run ahead, with your trunk. They will set your room up for you before we arrive. We do not have house-elves.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My family doesn’t have one either. I can unpack my own trunk. If one item inside that trunk is touched, I’ll be really pissed!” she declared hotly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very well, you have my word that your trunk shall not be opened. Now, shall we leave before your parents notice, or would you like to say goodbye?” Maverick asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny thought about it, then shook her head regretfully. “Let’s go. I don’t want to argue with them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maverick nodded. “If you fly, I will run slightly ahead of you. You may follow me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny nodded and, bending down, grabbed her broom out of her trunk. She unshrunk it, then glanced at the trunk. “Um, should I shrink it for them?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That would be kind, yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny nodded and shrunk the trunk, but before she could pick it up, the sandy-brown haired man took it. She hadn’t even known he was nearby. She frowned at him, but he only smiled back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of it,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still frowning, Ginny nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Allow me to introduce you to my companions. This is Georges,” Maverick said smoothly, nodding to the sandy-brown haired man. “And this is Samuel,” he added, gesturing to the redhead who stepped forward. “And this lovely lady is Bethany, Georges sister.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ‘lovely lady’ in question took Maverick’s arm and looked at Ginny coolly.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Great, I’ve already made enemies,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Ginny thought. “Nice to meet you, I’m Ginny,” she said to all three of them. They all nodded, but only Georges looked friendly about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Take Ginny’s trunk to the house and prepare her room, but do not open her trunk,” Maverick instructed them, letting go of Bethany. They nodded and left, then Maverick turned to Ginny. “Ready to leave?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny took one last look around the Great Hall. “I can visit, right? And come to Charlie’s trial?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, as long as I may accompany you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny nodded, gripped her broom, and turned away from the Great Hall. “I’m ready.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>****************************</span>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>
  <span>“Maverick has taken a blood donor,” Ceilidh said quietly to Killian. They were in the darkened classroom, as the Great Hall was brightly lit by the sun today.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Killian frowned. “You don’t mean that he’s fed, do you? You mean he’s actually found a blood donor, to stay with him?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes. The only daughter of the Weasley family. Ginny is her name, I believe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Killian looked shocked. “You can’t be serious. She and her parents agreed to this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Her parents did not, but Ginny swore to be Maverick’s blood donor if he helped her find her brother, Charlie, and bring him safely to the castle. He fulfilled those requirements,” Ceilidh answered solemnly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But… my God, does she know what she is getting into?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I don’t think she does. I doubt she even knows the basics when it comes to being a blood donor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Killian gasped. “No one has ever been a blood donor for Maverick!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ceilidh nodded. “I know, but has he really done anything wrong? It was not his fault, becoming what he is. In fact, much of it could be blamed on all of us. We shunned him for being so young, even though that was not his choice. Over the years he has proved himself to be a worthy, powerful, and respectable vampire. You know as well as I that he can control more werewolves than even myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But those werewolves are abominations! They’re almost as bad as Fenrir!” Killian protested.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ceilidh looked at his son coolly. “No, they are not. They have not murdered anyone since coming under Maverick’s control. They have never turned anyone into a werewolf.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But… Bethany and Georges…” Killian protested.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know. I think, however, that Maverick does not want Ginny to discover that. I believe he will hide her from it. I warned him, even,” Ceilidh said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Killian shook his head. “That boy is so powerful, it’s wrong what he has had to become.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, but hopefully he has given up on finding anyone to fully satisfy his needs. I do not believe he will force Ginny.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long will she be his blood donor?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ceilidh sighed. “That is the worst part. She has sworn herself to him until he finds his mate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Killian gasped. “That… that could be forever!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, but there is nothing we can do. However, I want a vampire from our clan to keep watch over her. It has to be one of our trusted, perhaps Frederick or Holly. Will you see to it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Killian nodded. “How close do you want them to be, and when should they intervene?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maverick will undoubtedly suspect I will send someone to watch. So long as they do not get too close, he will be fine with it. They should only intervene if there is reason to believe Ginny is being forced to do things she does not wish to, or her life is in danger. Understood?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Killian nodded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <span>****************************</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ginny sat tensely in the cabin. Across from her, Maverick seemed relaxed. He hadn’t tried speaking to her since they got onto the train, and although he seemed comfortably with the silence, it was driving Ginny nuts. Finally, she broke the silence. “They were the werewolves I saw you with, weren’t they?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maverick didn’t look surprised that she had broken the silence. “Yes,” he replied simply.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s impressive, right? Controlling so many werewolves?” She remembered Professor Lupin mentioning that most vampires could only control one werewolf. It was only the really powerful and usually really old ones that could control more than one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do not need to control them much. They are a pack, and have been with me for many years. Their wolf forms know me well,” Maverick answered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh… well, um, about this blood donor thing. Maybe we should set some rules, so that I know what to expect?” she suggested, looking for anything to talk about.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course, I would not expect you to go into this without rules. What do you have in mind?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Was that a bit of bitterness in his voice? Ginny thought she must be mistaken and shook the thought away. “Well, obviously, no sex,” she said bluntly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was definitely a small flinch when she said it, but Maverick quickly recovered. “Of course,” he said lightly, as though nothing was the matter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny frowned, something setting off alarms in her head though she didn’t know why. “Um… well, good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is there anything else?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Um...” Ginny felt a bit embarrassed. “Well, I don’t know much about vampires other than what Professor Lupin told us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He is Severus’s werewolf, yes?” Maverick questioned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Um… yeah,” Ginny said faintly. “I… didn’t even know Professor Snape was a vampire until yesterday,” she said. Her parents had told her the truth when she had questioned them about the story the newspapers had been given. They told her Snape had been a vampire since the beginning of the school year, which, looking back on the past few months, made sense. But it still came as a bit of a shock that Lupin was Snape’s werewolf.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would have thought Harry would have told you more. You were one of his friends, correct?” Maverick asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny frowned. “Why would Harry tell me anything?” She wasn’t even sure she wanted to talk about Harry at the moment. It was still too upsetting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“From what I gather, he was very close to his friends. I thought he would have shared something so important with them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s just Hermione and Ron,” Ginny said, still frowning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, my mistake then,” Maverick apologized.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey wait… why would Harry know anything about…” Ginny trailed off. She suddenly remembered all those meals with Harry, Lupin, and Snape missing. And Dean telling her about the cuts on Harry’s wrists and her not believing. Suddenly, it all made sense. “Oh, my God, Harry was Professor Snape’s blood donor!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maverick looked a bit surprised. “Blood donor? No, Harry was Severus’s mate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a moment, Ginny thought she must have misheard him. Then she exploded. “I don’t believe it!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nevertheless, it is true.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But… but Ron must have known, and Hermione! All that research… that was for Harry! Why didn’t they tell me? Why didn’t Harry?” Ginny felt hurt. She felt like her friends had betrayed her. She knew they had secrets she didn’t know about, but she would have thought they would have told her something like this. “H-how many people know?!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not many,” Maverick answered. “Most of the vampires, who will hold their tongues. I understand that your Headmistress wishes to keep the news private.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny nodded numbly. She gave a wry smile. “Anything else I should know about?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You asked about feeding,” Maverick reminded her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh yeah… so, um, how about you tell me what I’ve gotten myself into, and if there’s something I don’t like we can negotiate,” she suggested, trying to be mature about the entire thing. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Mature. Right. Even though it feels like I’ve been ripped out of my world and into an alternate universe where Snape and Harry liked each other and Harry is dead and my family betrayed me and now I’m food for a vampire!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“That would be fair,” Maverick agreed. “What would you like to hear about first?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Um, well, I know about the biting, of course,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suggest we do not partake in biting,” Maverick countered hesitantly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why not? I mean, you need to drink my blood so–”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There are other ways than biting,” Maverick cut in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well why don’t you want to bite me?” Ginny asked, wondering if she should be offended.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Biting causes great pleasure, for both the biter and the bitten,” Maverick explained, suddenly sounding as though he were giving a lecture. “The serum in my fangs will cause almost uncontrollable lust in you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny frowned, a bit disbelieving. “I think I can control myself. I mean, geez, I’m not even attracted to you!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although the corners of Mavericks’ eyes tightened, he said in a casual voice, “Do you trust me if you cannot?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That gave Ginny pause. If he was – by some small chance – right about not being about to control it, </span>
  <em>
    <span>could</span>
  </em>
  <span> she trust him not to do anything? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Well, he has a girlfriend, that Bethany girl, even though she looks a good ten years older than him. But he’s technically over a hundred years old. That’s besides the point, though, guys cheat on girls all the time!</span>
  </em>
  <span> “Um, okay, no biting. No sexual touching at all,” she said brazenly, hoping she wasn’t blushing as much as she thought she was. “You have that Bethany woman for that, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Maverick answered slowly, “I have Bethany.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny nodded, satisfied. She relaxed back against the seat. “So how often do you need to feed?” she questioned, warming up to the subject. Although he spoke funny, Maverick had, so far, been nothing but polite and courteous.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am capable of going without a meal once or twice, but it has been a long time since I have had a regular blood donor. I would like to feed regularly as well: three times a day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, so long as you don’t take too much blood. I remember that Hermione mentioned vampires need more than one blood donor, because one blood donor can’t fully satisfy a vampire,” Ginny said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As I said, I am capable of going without a meal once or twice. Whenever you need a break from regular feeding to regenerate some blood, I will not feed from you,” Maverick replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny frowned. “Well, couldn’t you just get another blood donor or something?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maverick paused before answering slowly, “No. I do not wish to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny, still frowning, shook her head. “Whatever you say. So what is a ‘regular blood donor’ anyway?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Usually, I must go out and find someone willing to let me feed once. None wished to live with me as a regular donor. As such, my meals were rather sporadic as I had to find a new donor each time,” Maverick explained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh… why can’t you feed from Bethany or Georges or Samuel?” she asked, curious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was once a human, and as such only human blood may keep me alive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh… and werewolves aren’t human enough, I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Correct.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny pondered a bit more, trying to think about what else she could ask. “Okay, so if not biting, how will you take blood?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could make a small cut on your wrist and suck on it,” Maverick offered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny made a face. “That would hurt!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maverick acknowledged that with a nod. “Yes, it would. I could, I suppose, use a needle with a tube and draw the blood out directly from the vein. Muggles do that to test blood for diseases.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, no needles. Any other ideas?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am afraid not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny sighed. “Oh, fine, cutting it is. Well, I suppose Harry did the same, with all those cuts on his arm. It must have been awful, being mated to Snape!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maverick remained silent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long will it take you to find your mate?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do not know,” Maverick replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What’s with that tone? He sounds kind of sad.</span>
  </em>
  <span> “I know that it’s a lot about luck,” Ginny said, recalling Hermione’s passing comment about some vampires never finding their mates. “But isn’t there something we could do now to find her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or him,” Maverick added quietly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Huh?” Ginny asked, startled. “Oh, yeah, I guess it could be a bloke. Would you be alright with that, though?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes. I do not have a preference either way.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, well, that’s good. So, can’t we do a search or something?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have searched for many years now,” Maverick said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But where have you looked? I’m sure you haven’t looked everywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps my mate has not even been born yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny frowned. “Well that’s pessimistic!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maverick let out a tired sigh. “I understand you do not wish to be my blood donor until your death. However, if you agree to be so, then I will give you whatever you wish. I will be your protection and allow you to take a husband and have a family; I will even provide for them. I will allow you to live wherever you wish and do whatever you wish, you need only to bleed for me. And when you are old and too frail to feed me, I will cherish you and care for you until your passing. You will never feel unappreciated, nor want for anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny was both shocked and offended. She wanted to yell at him for suggesting that she would stay with him forever, but held her tongue when she realized that she had already promised just that, unless he found his mate before she died. She glared at him, but he merely stared back with that indecipherable gaze of his, which only made her angrier.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, gee, thanks for the consideration!” she snapped angrily. “What happens if I </span>
  <em>
    <span>don’t</span>
  </em>
  <span> agree to stay with you forever?!” Maverick was silent, and Ginny threw up her hands in exasperation. “Why the hell even make an offer like that when I don’t have a choice anyway?!” she demanded angrily, giving him her most fierce glare. And, being the daughter of Molly Weasley, it was very fierce indeed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was hoping it would make the situation more desirable. Many vampires provide for their blood donors. Some even allow their donor to take on lovers and lead their own life. It all depends on the relationship between the vampire and their blood donor,” Maverick explained.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well that’s not us!” Ginny shouted, exasperated. “Why did you even suggest I be your blood donor when there are so many other, much more willing girls or guys to do exactly that? Isn’t there some other way I can pay you back for helping me?!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Maverick said, quietly but firmly. “There is no one who wishes to be my regular blood donor,” he added tersely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ginny paused, and her brows furrowed. There was definitely something in the way he said that which made her believe he was serious. “Why?” she asked, confused.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a moment, Maverick looked as though he might reply, but it was then that the train lurched and began to slow down. Maverick looked relieved. “It does not matter. You are my blood donor, not someone else,” he said, standing. “We are here. Georges and Samuel should be waiting for us outside. It is only a short walk to our house,” he added, opening the door to their compartment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Ginny got up to follow him, she made a mental note that she would not let him get away without answering that question. There was definitely something he didn’t want her to know, and she would find out what it was no matter what.</span>
