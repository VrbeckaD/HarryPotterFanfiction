    <p>As the New York shoreline came into view, the girl smiled. Her white hair blew around her face as the salty breeze wished around her. She took a moment to adjust the bright red glasses resting on the tip of her nose and listened as the people around her began to prepare for docking. Knowing that she still had some time, the girl wandered back to the small cabin she had been staying in and made sure that her bags were all packed. There were of course a few small things she always kept on her person at all times, including her wand, which was made of burchwood and had a core of unicorn hair. Her hand moved unconsciously to the amulet around her neck and her smile widened as she remembered when she had gotten it. Her older brother, Newt had given it to her as a birthday present before he had left for New York. Her fingers touched the secret button and it popped open softly, showing her the little lettering. </p>
<p>"To my dearest Specs. May the air lift your wings high. Much love, Newt." She read aloud before clicking it closed once more and picking up the small worn journal that rested on the top of her case. Inside held every little detail of her life, from when she began seeing signs of magic in her life, to when she boarded the boat from England to America. </p>
<p>"Twenty minutes till docking! Twenty minutes till docking!" She heard and gathered her belongings before walking back to the deck. In the time that she had been under, they had gotten much closer to the shore and her excitement elevated as she realized she was finally going to see her brother after almost a year apart. </p>
<p>"Hello Kaida." She suddenly heard and snapped around, coming face to face with her oldest brother.</p>
<p>"Thesius? What are you doing here?" She cried, dropping her bags and jumping into his outstretched arms. He spun her around in a small circle before placing her back down and smiling down at her.</p>
<p>"Newt sent me. I work at the Ministry, you know. Well, he told me you were coming and told me to pick you up." He explained and Kaida smiled excitedly.</p>
<p>"I can't wait to see him! Where is he right now?" She pulled back to look around the boat, hoping to catch sight of the crazy haired boy. Thesius chuckled and shook his head.</p>
<p>"He isn't in New York. He had to go to Romania to save a Norwegian Ridgeback that was being kept in a magical circus. Poor thing was in terrible condition." He said, and Kaida smiled proudly. Newt had always been so selfless. He really did love his animals.</p>
<p>"Okay. Well, let's go!" She said, grabbing her bags before standing in front of him again. Thesius nodded and grabbed her wrist, leading their apparitions to Newt.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>"Okay, he should be in there." Thesius said, having stopped them in the most beautiful clearing she had ever seen. To her left was a ginormous waterfall which reflected the large full moon beautifully and fell into the clearest pond. Around her there were flowers of every color and type and she took a deep breath of the clean smell before looking to where Thesius had pointed.</p>
<p>"That is a waterfall Thesius." She said, watching as he rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>"Behind the waterfall, you crazy. There is a cave. I'm sure that Newt is in there." He said and began to walk over, Kaida following behind. Sure enough, there was a small walkway on the edge of the rock that led directly behind the waterfall. It actually opened up to a room that Kaida realized was almost as big as her Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom had been. She blinked a few times, realizing that not only was the room huge...it was empty. Kaida placed down her things and looked around before looking back at her brother.</p>
<p>"He must have already left. Let's head back." She said and before she had the chance to walk back, Thesius stepped in front of her, blocking the exit.</p>
<p>"Thesius. Let's go. Newt isn't here anymore." She said and tried to step around him again. Thesius only moved to block her again as a smirk began to grow on his face.</p>
<p>"Well that's the thing Kaida. Newt was never here. I just couldn't allow you to get to him." Kaida tilted her head slightly as confusion washed over her.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" She asked, taking a step away from him.</p>
<p>"I couldn't have you helping him. The both of you are so much stronger together." He purred, almost wickedly. "You see, I had to get you out of the picture. And what better way to get rid of you then to take you somewhere you can't escape."<br/>Kaida didn't understand why Thesius was doing this, but she pulled out her wand and pointed it at him. </p>
<p>"Thesius. If you are playing some kind of sick joke, it really isn't funny." She hissed, but he simply chuckled darkly.</p>
<p>"That fire. I've always envied it. Is that why your anigmas form is a dragon?" Kaida growled and aimed her wand at his chest, ready to protect herself if the need arose. Thesius continued smirking before he pulled out his own wand.</p>
<p>"You know...I have always wanted to hear what a dragon sounds like. Mind showing me?" Kaida was about to shoot back a sharp comment when she heard it. One of the forbidden curses.</p>
<p>"Crucio!" Thesius cried, aiming the stream right at Kaida. <br/>The first thing she felt was a burning electricity running through her blood. And then she heard the most unholy screeching in the world. It wasn't until the pain stopped that she realized that it was her own voice and that in the time under the curse, Thesius had taken her wand. </p>
<p>"That was loud. I wonder if you could do it again!" He said, kneeling over her crumpled form. Kaida screamed again as he hit her with the curse again and her vision flashed bright white as she felt her body writhing on the rock covered ground. Small cuts began to burst forth on her body, but she barely felt them through the white hot pain flooding her blood. Thesius freed her from the curse and she felt sobs rake her body as the pain rang on.</p>
<p>"Now. The next part." He said and reached for her necklace. The one from Newt. Suddenly all she wanted to do was protect it. Because if she was led here, then where was Newt? Just before his hand wrapped around the amulet, Kaida grabbed one of the sharper rocks that had sliced her and drove into his hand. It wasn't quite long enough to go completely through, but he simply cursed and grabbed the necklace, wrenching it from her neck with his now bleeding palm.</p>
<p>"Oh, you will pay for that." He hissed and yanked the rock from his hand before stabbing it into Kaida's unprotected stomach. <br/>Her eyes widened as she looked down at the rock and gasped in pain as he twisted it once before pulling it back out. Blood flowed forth from the jagged gash and Kaida screamed as he pushed his fingers into the gash, forcing her further into the room to stand under the ray of moonlight that was filtering through the waterfall at the mouth of the cave.</p>
<p>"You see, the curse cannot be cast without spilling the blood of the person who is getting cursed. Then of course, I have to put it all over the caves entrance as well. Don't worry though. You won't die from this injury." He said, placing the necklace, her wand, and a strange dark red gem in a triangle around her. He smeared her blood across each item, going back every once in a while to slice her somewhere else in order to keep the blood fresh. Kaida sobbed as each cut burned pain through her, but Thesius simply paid her no mind. The entire time he chanted the same phrase, practically dripping with malice. </p>
<p>"Fortia morpha luna kai sanguis." He hissed a final time, finishing the lines around her. He stood then and looked out, the full moon shone brightly and he turned back, a smirk on his face as he raised his wand once more. </p>
<p>"You know about Haley's Comet, don't you Kaida? It only passes the earth every seventy-six years. And it will pass through the shadow of the moon in about two minutes. Can't have you break the triangle though...Crucio."</p>
<p>Kaida screamed loudly as the electric heat boiled her blood in her veins and felt more blood rush out of the multiple gashes on her arms and legs. The wound on her stomach steadily pushed out crimson liquid as well and just before she felt like she was about to pass out, it all stopped. She only heard the evil laugh of her brother before she felt a sharp pain tearing through her arms and legs. Her mouth opened in agony as it continued to spread through her and she felt her bones snapping and her joints popping as she was forced to change into her animagus form. Her body shrank and her face lengthened as her skin turned pearl white. All she could do was whimper in pain as her small white wings shredded her shirt. <br/>The pain stayed constant throughout the whole ordeal and Kaida didn't even realize that she had passed out until she struggled to sit up. The cave was empty and she tried to change herself back into a human...but it didn't work. Small pained chirps slipped from her mouth as she continued to try. Kaida realized then that the comet had passed. The curse was cast.</p>
