    <p>
  <em>In the dead of night, while the students and staff of Hogwarts slept soundly, a scream rent the still air, followed by a low, vicious chuckle—and then he saw them: green eyes. Lifeless. Blank. Dead.</em>
</p><p>No!</p><p>I couldn’t save—</p><p>
  <em>He awoke with a start, a cry half-strangled in his throat, and found himself tangled in a snare of bed sheets—a cold film of sweat covering his face, his breaths coming in ragged, heaving gasps.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A nightmare. That was all.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His eyes flitted closed. This was becoming an unwelcome routine; his pallid skin and under-eye shadows were testament to that. He briefly entangled his hands in his sheets, gripping them tight as he fought to get his breathing under control and his heartbeat steady.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>After a few moments, he released a trembling sigh, finally calm enough to settle down. He was quietly grateful that he’d at least had the sense to cast some silencing charms about before falling into the restless, uneasy unconsciousness that passed for sleep these days.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Though the castle was silent as a tomb, he still heard that scream echoing faintly in the corners of the darkness, he still saw those eyes—</em>
</p><p><em>Oh </em>god<em>—dead—gone—blank—and it was his fault—!</em></p><p><em>Damn it, why couldn’t the past </em>stay<em> in the past?</em></p><p>
  <em>With a snarl he disentangled himself from his sheets and silently slipped out of bed, stretching in the cold moonlight that filtered through the high window, and pulled on his robes against the castle’s chill.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>No sleep tonight, then.</em>
</p><p align="center">-</p><p>Grabbing his wand and invisibility cloak, Harry Potter stepped out of the door to Gryffindor Tower and into the hallway.</p><p>With a final glance at his rumpled bed, Severus Snape stepped out of his door to roam the halls.</p><p align="center">——-</p><p>Harry tread lightly under the invisibility cloak as he stole past the sleeping portraits, careful not to disturb their slumber lest they report his after-curfew activities to Filch—or worse. A weak <em>Lumos</em> lit his way, but he’d walked this path so many times in the past few weeks he could have traversed it with his eyes closed.</p><p>The damp chill of the air penetrated straight through his robes and seemed to seep into his very bones as the floor sloped ever-downward toward the dungeons. Before officially crossing into Slytherin territory, however, Harry made a quick left turn into a forgotten corridor. It was small and narrow, barely noticeable from the main thoroughfare, and students rarely came this way—it was as if even the ghosts avoided this passageway. As he passed rusted suits of armor and the occasional disused classroom, a certain atmospheric despair began to set in.</p><p><em>The charm of this place, </em>he observed wryly.</p><p>A rush of dark satisfaction greeted him as he came upon the entrance to an abandoned lavatory and stepped inside. Still under the invisibility cloak, the familiar tarnished mirrors did not throw his reflection back at him, but he’d bet galleons to gobstones he looked as bad as he felt.</p><p>No matter—soon enough he would feel better.</p><p>He closed himself inside a stall near the end of the row, the same stall he always used, and only then did he slip the cloak from around his trembling shoulders and let it fall to the floor. Sighing, he sat back on the closed toilet lid. Relief, just within reach—</p><p>Harry rolled up his sleeve and drew his wand.</p><p align="center">——-</p><p>The darkness always beckoned to Severus in times like these, nights when the boundary between present and past blurred and shifted, and he longed to remove himself altogether from the concepts of linear time and causality.</p><p><em>But I cannot go gentle into that good night, </em>he reprimanded himself ruefully.</p><p>No, he had too much responsibility to indulge <em>that</em>. Pawn of two masters and reluctant protector of the Boy-Who-Lived… he was painfully aware that he tread a thin tightrope, but such was his lot in life.</p><p>An embittered string of words, the constant reminder of why.</p><p><em>In </em>loving<em> memory of...</em></p><p>But before he could even complete the thought, her green eyes flashed forcefully into his mind again, and his step faltered. For a moment, a surge of emotion threatened to overwhelm him. Harsh breath, swallowed sob.</p><p>
  <em>Why did she have to die?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Why did I let her—?</em>
</p><p>With more effort than it should have taken, Severus forced the offending sentiment back into the locked boxes of his mind where it belonged and schooled his harsh features into a blank mask once again. He mentally scolded himself for displaying such weakness, but the weeks of sleeping poorly, peppered with nightmares, were taking their toll on him. Perpetual exhaustion weakened his defenses, and Severus Snape couldn’t afford to be weak. Not with so much at stake. Always put the war first, above his own needs and desires. Such was the life of a soldier, a spy.</p><p>He’d sold his soul to Voldemort; there was no going back.</p><p>For a man of discipline and control, he had surprisingly little control of his own life. Briefly, he entertained exerting the only control over his life he had left—ending it. This thought made his lips curl in a perverse smile. Wouldn’t it be nice to be done with all of this?</p><p>Except no, he couldn’t do that, because his life was not his own anymore; that belonged to Dumbledore.</p><p>His expression twisted into a scowl as he prowled the corridors though there was no one to direct his discontent toward save for the empty suits of armor standing silent sentinel over Hogwarts. Severus wouldn’t even care for the Headmaster’s claim on him except he knew the meddling old fool would work <em>tirelessly </em>to save his sorry life for no other reason than to reserve the right to kill him himself, for being so selfish. These were times of war, and war afforded no room for selfishness. He had a role to play, promises to keep, and people to protect.</p><p>So in times like these, Severus was forced to content himself with working through scattered thoughts and shattered emotions in the solitude of Hogwarts’ halls—at the witching hour, as it were. This had been his routine as a student, too, especially in the weeks following the falling-out between himself and Lily. In this way, he had come to know the castle intimately.</p><p>Of course, holding the station of Professor afforded its own privileges: now he had every right to stalk these corridors past curfew without fear of being caught by Filch and sentenced to detention. Naturally, he knew every passageway and alcove he could escape to and—</p><p>And what, do <em>that?</em> Again?</p><p>Severus exhaled sharply and chided himself. He was a damn <em>professor</em> at the finest institution of magic in all of Britain, a master of his craft… but the thought taunted him, tempted him. <em>I’m way too old for such nonsense</em>, he argued, as usual. And as usual, he lost the debate before it had begun.</p><p>It wasn’t any worse than taking the Dark Mark, he reasoned. Not by half. The excruciating pain of that curse would be seared into his memory forever, just as the grotesque skull-and-serpent was forever seared into his flesh. Even thinking of the Mark brought a rush of shame, hot and vile, that burned at the back of his throat, and Severus felt vaguely nauseous.</p><p>But then…  <em>this</em> pain was different. Not excruciating, exquisite.</p><p>He didn’t realize that he’d already decided until he found himself taking a sharp right turn into a nearly hidden passageway by the dungeons. He felt his body move automatically, tracing the familiar path to what he considered his private domain: a disused lavatory he used to seek refuge in during his school days and continued to frequent, after he became employed in Dumbledore’s service, whenever he didn’t want to be found.</p><p>He reached for the door to his hideout and felt a light anticipatory thrill at the thought of using his spell, the one created for <em>this</em> first and foremost. “For enemies,” indeed.</p><p>Severus’ greatest enemy had always been himself.</p><p>But a noise from behind the door, within the lavatory, caused him to freeze like a spotted animal. Everything seemed to come into sharp focus at once, and suspicion slithered into his mind.</p><p>No one ever came here, not as long as he could remember.</p><p>His eyes narrowed in irritation; whoever was here had summarily ruined his plans. Something was going on, and he intended to find out. He drew his wand and slowly pushed open the door.</p><p align="center">——-</p><p>Recalling the curse scrawled in the margins of that strange Potions text he’d acquired, Harry pointed his wand at his arm and hissed, “<em>Sectumsempra</em>.” A thin line of red wavered into existence, bringing with it a welcome sting. It only lasted a scant moment before fading away.</p><p>Harry frowned.</p><p>Those dull green eyes from his nightmare haunted him, from sleep to wakefulness and back to dreams again. They were Cedric’s eyes, cold and dead. Dead, because of him. A pair of grey eyes joined the green in judgment. These belonged to Sirius, who was also <em>dead, dead, dead</em>, because of him.</p><p>Far too many people died because of Harry. He’d never really identified with the image of “the Boy-Who-Lived,” but these days he was almost willing to adopt the title of, “the Boy-Who-Got-Everyone-Killed.”</p><p>Well, maybe not. It wasn’t really as catchy as the other one, even in his head.</p><p>If he was really honest with himself, he knew it was because of his own lack of planning and disregard for the rules. He admitted—only to himself, during these rare moments of hard introspection—that in some ways, a certain hated professor was right about him. It wasn’t so much that he thought he was better than others, more that he could only truly rely on himself, but the effects of his act-first, ask-for-help-later policy were the same.</p><p>Dumbledore enabled this behavior, and this had made him feel justified in his actions, allowed him to absolve himself of the blame... for a little while. But deep down, he recognized a tendency to be downright reckless.</p><p>But now there was a war on, and he could no longer afford to be reckless when so many lives depended on him.</p><p>That was why he needed to punish himself like this. It was a lesson to learn so that next time he would <em>think</em> before acting. It was for all the people who weren’t here because Harry was.</p><p>He needed more.</p><p>“<em>Sectumsempra</em>!” he tried again, a little louder. This time a nice red line appeared and kept its color for longer. The pain was sharper. More, deeper, now.</p><p>“<em>Sectumsempra</em>! <em>Sectumsempra</em>! Sectumsempra!”</p><p>He exhaled heavily, reveling in the pain blossoming in his arms, travelling in his veins, filling his core. Fresh scarlet lines crisscrossed the white scars that lay upon them like lace. Blood coursed in small rivulets, drip-dropping onto the floor and pooling in the grout between the tiles. He took a sick pleasure in the sight. He’d never go to Azkaban for the deaths he’d unwittingly caused, but at least this was some form of justice, crude though it was.</p><p>He raised his wand again, pressing it to his inner wrist, but stiffened when he heard a noise. A soft click—the opening of the door.</p><p>Harry’s breath caught. Who would be here of all places? He stilled, heart beating rapidly, willing himself to take quiet, shallow breaths. Surely there wasn’t anyone here? Perhaps he’d imagined it in his paranoia...</p><p>Reassured by this thought, he relaxed marginally. He was about to reposition his wand when he heard it again. There—a footstep! This time, unmistakable. Someone was here with him. Who could possibly—?</p><p>Another footstep, closer.</p><p>Panic flooded Harry’s mind. Oh god, this was bad. He couldn’t get caught doing something like <em>this</em>... Rita Skeeter would catch wind, he’d be all over the <em>Prophet</em> quicker than you could say ‘quidditch.’ He could just imagine the sensationalized headlines: <em>More scars for Scarhead? </em>This would ruin his reputation, what little respect he had in the eyes of the public would be gone...</p><p>Another footstep. <em>Please, please no...</em> Harry willed himself to be as still and silent and small as possible. The footsteps kept coming, slow and methodical, closer and closer until....</p><p>They stopped.</p><p>Harry squeezed his eyes shut, hoping against hope that whoever was there would just go away. For a long moment, nothing happened. He tentatively opened his eyes again. Perhaps they had left?</p><p>He waited a moment more, a breathless handful of seconds that stretched on and transcended the normal constraints of time, but all remained still.</p><p>Yes, that must be it. <em>Thank Merlin. </em>He began to exhale a sigh of relief when suddenly the door to the stall burst open.</p><p>There, towering over him, was Professor Snape.</p><p>Harry ducked his head. </p><p>“Well, well,” Snape drawled. “What do we have here? Mr. Potter, out of bed at—” He broke off. For a moment the only sound was the steady drip-drip on the lavatory floor.</p><p>The silence was telling. Harry didn’t even need to look up to know.</p><p>
  <em>Steady now. Just breathe...</em>
</p><p>Mustering every scrap of that famed Gryffindor courage, he dragged his eyes up to his professor’s face, but Snape’s gaze was focused on Harry’s arm. Harry felt his heart beating frantically, panic threatening to overwhelm him.</p><p>This was the worst possible scenario. He wished it had been someone else, anyone else, to find him. Dumbledore. Hermione. Even sodding <em>Malfoy</em>. Okay, maybe not <em>him</em>, but hell, he’d enthusiastically accept a showdown with <em>Voldemort</em> over… this.</p><p>Snape drew himself up to his full height, staring down his nose at Harry, face inscrutable. Harry held his breath. What would the acerbic man have to say about Harry’s little problem? He could imagine easily enough.</p><p>
  <em>Our resident celebrity… is a pathetic cutter. How can he ever hope to defeat Voldemort when he can’t even face the consequences of his own failures? How will the Wizarding World ever be able to place their trust in such a fragile, worthless boy?</em>
</p><p>Instead, the only words that came were a muttered, “Follow me,” before he turned in a swish of robes and strode toward the door. Harry wasn’t foolish enough to think the words were a request, yet they lacked the usual malice that infused every syllable Snape uttered.</p><p>Belatedly, Harry scrambled to gather his Invisibility Cloak and push the sleeves of his robe down. He aimed a quick cleaning charm at the floor before tucking away his wand and scurrying after Snape. Best not to leave any evidence. It was bad enough that the Potions Master knew; he couldn’t take the (admittedly unlikely) risk of anyone else finding out.</p><p>In grim silence, the pair made their ways through the labyrinth of corridors that led to Hogwarts’ dungeons. Harry’s mind was racing. What was going to happen to him? Detention for a year? Detention till <em>graduation? </em>If they didn’t expel him on grounds of mental instability first… was there a room at St. Mungo’s with his name on it?</p><p>Dread coiled in the bottom of his stomach as they decended and the chill damp of the air penetrated his bones even further. Involuntarily, he shivered; from the cold or the fear, he wasn’t certain. He was just thankful that at this hour, no Slytherins were milling about in the hallways to witness his disgrace, though he couldn’t shake the feeling that one would jump out from around a corner any moment now.</p><p>Eventually, they reached a blank expanse of stone wall. The Professor tapped the bricks in a complicated pattern. Almost instantly, the bricks responded, popping out and shifting in strange, magical patterns until a heavy wooden door with wrought iron fastenings appeared. Snape tapped the door with his wand again, and it swung open. He glided into the room beyond.</p><p>Harry paused before the open door, afraid to even look inside. <em>Snape’s private quarters?</em> How could he? He’d probably be hexed the second he set foot across the threshold, or repelled by the strong wards that surely guarded the man’s rooms, or any number of other nasty safeguards. As Harry grappled with the dilemma, an irritated voice beckoned him in.</p><p>“Quit dithering, foolish child, and <em>enter.”</em></p><p>Harry hastily stepped across the threshold and into the Great Unknown. He wasn’t sure what he expected to find. A torture dungeon maybe—complete with racks and manacles and an iron maiden? Bare, gloomy walls dimly lit by lanterns that flickered ethereally, shadows jumping in menacing dances? But Harry found none of that.</p><p>Instead, he stepped into a room decorated in warm earth tones. A soft rug in shades of brown covered the sitting area by the fireplace which cast a warm and inviting glow throughout the room. Framing the hearth was a rich velvet couch and two easy chairs. Between them sat a low coffee table. A Slytherin tapestry done in customary House colors hung on one wall, with silver-threaded snakes winding between an ornate <em>S</em> on an emerald background, eternally slithering around and around its edges. A small dining table was placed near the wall, cluttered with papers and potions journals but for one place cleared away. It was evident that the man rarely entertained company.</p><p>And, oh, the <em>bookshelves</em>. They covered the unoccupied walls, floor-to-ceiling, housing hundreds of books, many appearing ancient and rare. Hermione would have transcended this plane of existence at the sight.</p><p>“Sit.”</p><p>Harry had almost forgotten about the Professor amid his fascinated examination of the man’s quarters, until he heard the barked command. He noticed him now, standing near another door that led to an unknown room, pointing one spindly finger toward the couch.</p><p>Harry hesitantly crossed the room to the sitting area indicated by the professor. He gingerly perched on the plum-colored velvet couch. It looked like something from the Victorian era, all heavy wood and worn fabric, but not entirely uncomfortable.</p><p>“Don’t move.”</p><p>Snape crossed his arms and pinned Harry with an intense stare until, seemingly satisfied that Harry would comply, he whirled around and disappeared through the doorway. Harry couldn’t help but feel as if the man had been dissecting him with his eyes, studying him like potion ingredients.</p><p>He returned a moment later with what looked like a first-aid kit, but instead of plastic tubes of antiseptic, little glass vials of potions were neatly arranged in the box.</p><p>“Give me your arm.” A low murmur.</p><p>Harry shrank back against the couch, wary of the professor. Where was all of his sarcasm, his venom? Why hadn’t he insulted him yet? Perhaps he was just waiting until he could tell his Snakes all about pitiful Harry Potter…</p><p>“Your <em>arm</em>, child.” Slightly more forceful.</p><p>Harry shook his head minutely. It was enough that Snape had seen it once; he really didn’t want to bare all. Maybe Snape hadn’t seen how bad it was?<em> He only got a glimpse</em>, he desperately rationalized. Maybe he could convince him it wasn’t so bad.</p><p>“That’s okay, Professor, I don’t need—if it’s all the same to you, I’ll just be go—”</p><p>A careful but firm grip on his injured arm cut him off.</p><p>“It is <em>not</em> all the same to me, Potter,” Snape growled. “Now, relax, and let me work.”</p><p>The Potions Master tugged Harry’s arm forward and gently pulled the blood-soaked sleeve back. Only then did Harry realize that the blood had seeped right through the fabric and pooled on the couch, a sizable stain spreading over the antique fabric.</p><p>Instinctual fear shot through Harry like an electric shock. <em>Oh Merlin, I’ve made a mess of Snape’s furniture… he’ll kill me!</em></p><p>“I’m sorry!” he gasped. “Sir, I’m so sorry sir I’ll clean it up right away! Let me go, I’ll—please don’t—”</p><p>“Hush.”</p><p align="center">——-</p><p>Distractedly, Severus waved his wand to vanish the stain, not sparing it a second thought. Merlin knew he had enough reason to perfect such cleaning spells; between his own vice and the Death Eater meetings, things could often get… messy.</p><p>“Now,” he murmured, pitching his voice low as if talking to a scared animal, “This will sting.”</p><p>Severus reached inside his medi-kit and withdrew a vial of brownish liquid: essence of dittany. He uncorked the vial with his teeth, still keeping a firm grip on the boy’s arm, and carefully tipped it over the open cuts. A drop landed on each gash, glinted for a moment, then absorbed into the wound. He worked quickly, deftly wrapping a bandage around the arm and securing it with a sticking charm. Finally he pulled two more vials of potion from the medi-kit, one a light blue and the other a dark gold, that he instructed him to drink. The boy did so without complaint, a small mercy, though he remained tense all the while.</p><p>Severus sat back in grim satisfaction. He fixed his gaze on Potter, noting that the boy kept his own gaze glued to his lap.</p><p>“Potter.”</p><p>The boy recoiled a little, still not meeting his eyes. Impatience flared in Severus for a moment before rationality took over. The ‘scared animal’ analogy was accurate; he might say the boy was terrified, even—now that he’d been caught, and by his least favorite professor no less.</p><p>Severus had always been careful not to get discovered himself though he sometimes suspected Albus knew. The old man never said anything, but on the days following Severus’ little ‘accidents’ (usually after Death Eater meetings, recently), Albus would fix him with those damned eyes that seemed to pierce him to his very soul, a sadness hidden in their depths and a tight smile on his lips.</p><p>If the older wizard did know, he seemed perfectly content to never discuss the issue with him. Whether it was out of a kind-intentioned avoidance of unnecessary awkwardness or because he truly viewed it as a non-issue, Severus didn’t know, nor did he care to find out. But he could fully understand Potter’s reluctance.</p><p>Severus was also acutely aware of the history between himself and the boy. To say merely that they were not the best of friends would be a grave understatement. Part of him even took a sort of twisted pleasure in the boy’s discomfort.</p><p>If circumstances had been different, he wouldn’t even feel guilty about it. He could so easily see James in the mop of dark hair, the lanky figure in front of him, and this brought the ghost of a cruel smile to his lips for just an instant, then it vanished—for he could also see himself: sullen, scared, distrusting of anyone. And though he tried desperately to deny it, the barest tendril of sympathy was worming its way into his heart.</p><p>He sighed, resigned, and tried again.</p><p>“Harry.”</p><p>This time, the boy looked up at him, surprise flashing in his green eyes that were so much like Lily’s.</p><p>“Yes, sir?”</p><p>“You will explain—” Severus began, but stopped as something in the corner of his vision caught his eye. Swiftly, he glanced down at Potter’s arm, and with a muttered oath noticed that blood was still seeping through the bandage, bright red like jequirity beans against the stark white linen.</p><p>The dittany should have healed the wounds—why hadn’t it worked? This could mean only one thing: the injury was not physical, but magical, in nature.</p><p><em>“What did you do?”</em> Severus growled, low and menacing now. Potter stared back owlishly, not quite comprehending.</p><p>“I—I think you know what I did...”</p><p>“The <em>curse!” </em>he all but spat.</p><p>
  <em>Keep it together, Severus, now is not the time to lose your temper.</em>
</p><p>Severus leaned forward, eyes keen, bridging the space between them. He took a deep breath—one, two—out. “What <em>curse</em> did you use?”</p><p align="center">——-</p><p>“I, erm—I don’t—” Harry spluttered, frantically looking everywhere but at his professor. Instinct urged him not to reveal the secrets contained within the pages of the Potions book that once belonged to the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. The gears of his mind spun in an attempt to concoct a believable lie, but he was getting nowhere fast. He could tell he was trying Snape’s patience, however kind (could he use the word kind?) the man had been to him tonight.</p><p>
  <em>“What. Curse.”</em>
</p><p>“Sectumsempra!” Harry blurted.</p><p><em>“Sectum...”</em> The Potions Master trailed off, the remaining color drained from his already-pale face. Harry started at him in confusion. Snape’s eyes glittered with a strange emotion, and if Harry didn’t know better, he might’ve said it was regret. For the briefest of moments the Professor looked pained before dispelling the expression altogether. Instead, bowed his head and peeled off the bandage.</p><p>“W-What are you doing? …Professor?” The atmosphere of the room had become suddenly leaden, and Harry wondered if he’d said the wrong thing.</p><p>“Silence.” Snape pointed his wand at the cuts and muttered in Latin.</p><p><em>“Vulnera Sanentur.” </em>The blood still leaking from Harry’s wounds began to stagnate.</p><p>“<em>Vulnera Sanentur.” </em>His arm was cleansed as with a wet rag, the sticky residue banishing itself.</p><p>“<em>Vulnera Sanentur.”</em> The cuts knitted together as if they hadn’t been there at all.</p><p>Harry stared in quiet awe at the newly healed flesh. Of course, the old scars still criss-crossed the interior of his forearm, as it was far too late to heal<em> those</em>, but the ones he’d made just a half hour ago had completely disappeared. He gingerly touched his skin.</p><p>“Now,” the Professor’s low voice cut through his fascination. “You will tell me <em>why</em> you are regularly slicing yourself to ribbons.”</p><p>Anger flared within Harry as he defiantly held the gaze of those fathomless black eyes—void, like the man’s heart, probably, with only the barest glint of something he didn’t understand hidden in their depths to suggest he was human at all. Why would Snape want to know? Ever since Harry was eleven the man had hated his guts, and Harry had no trouble admitting that the feeling was mutual.</p><p>And now he suddenly cared? Not bloody likely.</p><p>If Harry knew one thing, it was never to trust a Slytherin, and Snape was a Slytherin as they came. No doubt he wanted to file the answer away and use the knowledge against him as some kind of spiteful blackmail. Surely, he’d only tolerated him this long in an attempt to lull Harry into a false sense of trust, but Harry wouldn’t fall for it. He’d thoroughly learned his lesson last year.</p><p>“What does it matter?” he retorted hotly.</p><p>“<em>Because</em>,” Snape stressed the word as if he were talking to a particularly dim-witted flobberworm. “You are a <em>student</em> and I am a <em>professor</em> and that makes your welfare <em>my responsibility</em>.”</p><p>“I bet you can’t wait to tell all your slimy Slytherins what you caught <em>‘poor Harry Potter’</em> doing, can you?” Harry accused.</p><p>In a remarkable display of self-restraint that wasn’t lost on Harry, Snape ignored the accusation entirely. “The way I see it, you have few options.” He leaned back, tapping his fingers on the edge of the chair he was occupying as if considering some matter carefully before continuing. “Your safety is imperative to Dumbledore, and so I must inform the Headmaster of this recent… development. I have no choice in the matter; this is not up for debate.”</p><p>“I—” Harry began, then he looked down. There was no use arguing, and the alternative to involving the Headmaster was to allow Snape alone the power of this knowledge. The thought of Snape holding it over his head, unchecked, was not appealing. At least Dumbledore would be fair… he hoped. “Yes, sir.”</p><p>“Furthermore, I should take this matter to your Head of House and let Professor McGonagall deal with it. That is protocol. But somehow, I don’t think it…” he paused, frowned. “…prudent.”</p><p>Harry imagined McGonagall staring down her nose at him, the judgment plain in her eyes. Gryffindors were supposed to be stronger than this, braver than this. He’d just bring shame to his House if they knew.</p><p>“Why?” Harry asked, genuinely curious. It wasn’t like Snape to do him (or anyone) any favors.</p><p>“Because,” Snape replied, lip curling in thinly veiled contempt, “the usual rules do not typically apply to famous Harry Potter. <em>You</em> seem to be the exception to every policy and protocol in place at this school, and so I will delay action until I have conferred with the Headmaster on how he wishes to proceed.”</p><p>“I see,” he returned coolly.</p><p>Silence stretched between them for a long moment and Harry became suddenly aware of how tired he was. Amid the panic of waking from yet another nightmare and being caught by a professor, the late hour had become meaningless, but now the adrenaline was wearing off. The warmth of the fire in the hearth and the hazy, soft glow it cast upon the room did nothing to stave off the encroaching drowsiness, and Harry stifled a yawn.</p><p>“Right,” Snape started brusquely, leveling a stare at Harry and waiting until he had his full attention, “We can discuss this matter later.   It is quite late—”</p><p>“Of course, sir, I’ll just be going then—”</p><p>“—and I daresay I do not <em>trust</em> you to just head back to your tower and go to sleep like a good little Gryffindor.” The last words were said with a sneer. “No. That won’t happen. Therefore,” he paused, grimaced, then appeared to have to force the rest of the sentence out, “you will stay here tonight, where I can keep an eye on you.”</p><p>“<em>Here!”</em> Harry gasped incredulously. “In <em>your</em> quarters?”</p><p>“Did I stutter?” Snape retorted severely.</p><p>“N-No sir. I just... am surprised, is all,” Harry mumbled, glancing away. He wanted to protest, but found he didn’t have the energy for it. Any place to sleep was as good as another at this point, and he was reasonably sure he wouldn’t wake up in the morning to find he’d been murdered in his sleep after all.</p><p>“First thing in the morning,” Snape continued, and Harry pulled his attention back to the present conversation, “I will have a little chat with the Headmaster. Until then…” He waved his wand, and a trunk flung open. A pillow and a blanket nestled inside drifted up and through the air to settle on the couch. “Make yourself comfortable. If you should need anything, you may knock on my door—first door on the right. The rooms are of course warded; should you get up to any mischief, I <em>will</em> know. Oh, and Potter?”</p><p>Harry glanced up. “Sir?”</p><p>“Your wand.”</p><p>“But—!”</p><p>
  <em>“Now.”</em>
</p><p>Sullenly, Harry placed his wand in his professor’s outstretched hand. Long pale fingers curled around it and stashed it away. With that, Snape rose and glided down the hall out of sight, leaving Harry to make up the couch and settle in for the remainder of the night.</p><p>Despite the strange circumstances and the fact he was to spend the night in Professor Snape’s quarters, all that was on Harry’s mind was getting a good night’s rest. Belatedly, he wondered if one of the vials Snape had given him was a sleeping potion. That would be just like him, the bastard.</p><p>But Harry was too tired to care; he’d already drifted off.</p><p align="center">——-</p><p>Severus closed the door to his bedroom, slipped off his robes, and sank into a desk chair. Almost as an afterthought, he flicked his wand, warding his bedroom against curious boys.</p><p>Only then did he allow himself to relax. Now that he had attended to the most urgent of tasks, he let his mind consider the events of the evening.</p><p>The irony of discovering Potter doing exactly what <em>he</em> had set out to do did not escape him. He felt like a hypocrite, tending to Potter’s self-inflicted injuries while at the same time intending to cause harm to himself. But Severus’ case was different. What did the Boy-Who-Lived have to be so depressed about that he used curses to slice his arms?</p><p>And not just any curse; <em>Sectumsempra</em>, Severus’ own creation! That reality hit him like a punch to the gut, and he sunk lower in his chair, covering his face with one hand. Where had the boy even learned that curse? Though he fully intended to find out later, Severus didn’t think it seemed so important just now.</p><p>What was important was that he’d failed. He’d failed everyone.</p><p>Dumbledore—for allowing Potter to get to this point unnoticed. Severus was supposed to be watching him from the shadows, guiding him toward his destiny. Keeping him safe from harm. He always prided himself in his skills of observation. Nothing got by him! Nothing except… this. He couldn’t even keep Potter safe from himself.</p><p>Hogwarts, for letting a student hurt themselves. Another thing Severus took pride in was his position as Professor and Head of Slytherin House. He regarded his responsibilities very seriously. Naturally, he’d encountered all manner of troubled students during his tenure at Hogwarts, as had all the Heads of House. They’d dealt with students who were experiencing bullying and abuse, students who were abusing substances, students with eating disorders, and so forth. He’d also had past cases of self-harming and, Merlin forbid, suicidal students—and he’d handled all of those cases with grace and discretion. Being distinctly aware of popular bias against Slytherin House, Severus focused most of his efforts to looking out for his own, but he kept an eye out for trouble with any of Hogwarts’ students. As a professor, it was his job to maintain a standard of quality, and that simply did not allow for overlooking a student’s distress, not even a bloody Gryffindor.</p><p>Harry, for letting him get to this point at all, for letting him think it was okay to hurt himself to deal with whatever pain he must be feeling. Of course, Severus dealt with his pain the same way, but that was different—he was a spy, he’d been a <em>Death Eater</em>. He’d done unforgivable things, things he’d never be able to atone for if he had a thousand lives to live. But Harry… was just a child. Sixteen years old. Sure, he’d lost people in this war too: his parents and that mangy mutt—though Severus had no love lost for him, even he realized how close the two had been. Still, he was too young to be feeling so devoid of hope, so alone, that he turned to the metaphorical blade to cope. (Severus himself had been twelve.)</p><p>And Lily. Oh <em>Merlin</em>, Lily. It was true that after that disastrous day, Severus and Lily had never spoken again, but with the rise of the Dark Lord and Death Eater activity, he’d made a promise to himself that he would do all he could to keep her safe. He remembered all too vividly the night that his best friend was murdered, or at least his reaction to the news—a blur of tears and anger and soul-wrenching pain, a desire to join her, and the commitment that stayed his hand: Lily lived on in her child, this child that had defeated the greatest Dark wizard of his time, and Severus swore then he would protect him to his dying breath. It was the least he could do for Lily.</p><p>And he’d failed her. He’d let harm come to her son by the boy’s own hand. Severus wasn’t sure he could forgive himself for that. He knew Lily wouldn’t. If only he’d done better…</p><p>In that moment he didn’t care if it was wrong, or if it made him a hypocrite, or what Albus would say, or if the very Fates were laughing at him now; he slowly, methodically unbuttoned the cuff of his sleeve and withdrew from his desk drawer a Potions knife.</p>
