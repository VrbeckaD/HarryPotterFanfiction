    <p>"Boy! Hurry up!" Vernon bellowed, looking at Harry with impatience evident in his eyes.</p><p>Dudley and Petunia were already seated and were staring out of the car at Harry who was struggling to bring their suitcases down with nasty sneers on their faces.</p><p>"Co… Coming, Uncle V-Vernon," Harry wheezed, coming to a stop at the back of the car where he quickly put the suitcases in and closed the trunk; he then walked around the side of the car and quickly got inside the backseat next to Dudley who was grinning maliciously at him.</p><p>"Not one word out of either of you, or else," Vernon threatened, ignoring the confused look Dudley sent his way.</p><p>During the entire ride to who knows where, Harry ignored the punches Dudley aimed at his leg and instead focused on the fact that wherever they were going was slowly but surely being hidden from view.</p><p>Finally, the car stopped and Vernon practically hustled them all out of the car and ordered Harry to remove the two suitcases from the car.</p><p>When Harry finally observed their surroundings, he swallowed deeply, they were at an old dock with a small, rickety looking boat tied to a stump. The worst part was that a storm was already approaching and he had to put the suitcases in the boat.</p><p>"A-Are you sure the b-boat can handle these suitcases, Uncle V-Vernon?" He asked softly, not looking at the man in case he got angry.</p><p>Vernon spluttered and was about to yell at the boy when he finally realized that the boat may not be able to hold much weight so he ordered Harry to leave the suitcases in the trunk of the car and instead ordered everyone into the boat. When they were all finally inside, he untied the rope and threw it inside of the boat and picked up the paddles then began rowing them.</p><p>Harry wrapped both of his scrawny arms around his body to get as much warmth as possible; he really wished that he couldn't feel the cold right now.</p><p>"M-Mum?" Dudley asked, trembling horribly.</p><p>Harry ignored the others only to gape when his body instantly became warmer and instead of questioning it, he just smiled and thanked whatever it was that made his coldness go away.</p><p>In reply, Petunia huddled Dudley closer to her side and ignored Harry who was doing much better than all of them combined.</p><p>After a couple minutes of rowing, they came upon a broken down shack which was situated on a piece of island and Harry's eyes widened at the fact that Vernon looked ready to tie the rope of the stake which was cemented into the island when a large body of water slammed against the boat, propelling them away from the island and causing the paddles to break off.</p><p>Vernon cursed and tried to lean his weight to anchor the boat and instead waves upon waves of water washed down on them signifying just how dangerous the storm had already become. Even more rain started pelting them down heavily and Vernon immediately huddled up to his wife and child and wrapped both his arms around them.</p><p>Harry's eyes began watering and he could feel the coldness begin to seep into his clothing once more; he whimpered when pieces of the broken paddle which had broken off of the boat almost hit him in the head; he watched as Vernon shielded Petunia and Dudley and left him to fend for himself.</p><p>He felt so much hurt at the fact that they didn't care about him enough to try and protect him also.</p><p>He sniffled and cried out when the boat began rocking side-by-side dangerously and before he could react by holding onto the boat to anchor himself, he was knocked unconscious by a stray piece of debris from the old shack.</p><p>The last thing Harry saw was the wide eyes of Dudley looking at him in fright.</p><p>
  <strong>8 Hours Later</strong>
</p><p>It was 6:13 Am the next day that Harry groaned before sitting up with a gasp only to begin coughing when sand clogged his nasal way; he quickly blew his nose and turned towards the body of water and gathered some into his hands and hastily washed his face to get rid of the excess sand.</p><p>After successfully washing his face, he looked around and saw the Dursleys a couple feet away from him, Vernon's arms wrapped protectively around Petunia and Dudley and all three looked to be unconscious as Harry could clearly see the rise of their chests.</p><p>Harry ignored them and instead focused on the fact that their boat was destroyed and they were stranded on an island with no one knowing exactly where they were; he slowly got up off his bum and began looking around at where they washed up.</p><p>During the time that Harry searched around what was visible of the island, he found a very large, rusty dagger half hidden in the sand and looking up, he noticed that there were large trees with round, yellow objects on them and there was this one tree with round, green objects handing from it.</p><p>He had no idea what they were.</p><p>Five minutes had passed and that was when Harry noticed that the Dursleys were waking up. He sat down and watched as Dudley shot up out of Vernon's hold and began looking around in confusion before his eyes landed on Harry before they turned back to his father who was struggling to sit up with help from a now awake Petunia.</p><p>"B-Boy! Get over here!" Vernon ordered angrily when he realized Harry sat there staring at them.</p><p>Harry didn't even twitch when he heard Vernon; he instead looked at them with dull, green eyes and waited for them to get themselves together… which was not very long.</p><p>"Didn't you hear me calling, you, Boy!" Vernon bellowed, angrily stomping towards Harry with Petunia and Dudley in two, the latter grinning at the thought of Harry getting punished.</p><p>Harry only rolled out of the way when Vernon's meaty hand descended towards him and instead, he spun his dagger clumsily, jumped on Vernon's back and held the dagger at his neck.</p><p>"If any of you come closer, I won't be responsible if my hand slips," He monotoned when he heard scuffling behind him.</p><p>It was quiet for a few seconds before Vernon's hand came up to punch him and doing what any frightened kid would do, he took the dagger and hit Vernon's hand with it causing the man to cry out when his index and middle finger was cut off along with piece of his ring finger.</p><p>Harry then jumped off the man's back and ran in front of him and held the dagger out in front of his body, ignoring Vernon's pained bellows.</p><p>"If any of you come closer, I'll stab you!" He yelled threateningly when he saw Petunia about to march over to him.</p><p>The woman glared at him before a smirk flittered across her face.</p><p>"If you don't put down that weapon right now, Boy, see if we take care of you."</p><p>Harry frowned then huffed at her before replying, "So be it. You've never taken care of me before, what makes now any different? I'll feed and protect myself, I don't need any of your help. You've already looked after yourselves when you left me on that boat to fend for myself! I don't need any of you to help me! I'll help myself!"</p><p>By the end of his rant, all three Dursleys were looking at him in shock and Harry turned around and walked away from them.</p><p>"I don't need any of you to do something you've never done before," He said loudly before walking to the opposite side of the island.</p><p>
  <strong>Unknown P.O.V</strong>
</p><p>I watched as the three humans bickered back and forth with each other than gasped in excitement when the tiny, magic user cut off the fingers of the fat, mortal man.</p><p>"Ooh, this is so exciting," I said with a giggle as I watched blood spurt plentifully from the man's stump.</p><p>"The tiny, magic user is so adorable," One of my brother's squealed.</p><p>"And powerful."</p><p>I nodded then bit my lip when the boy began climbing one of the trees which held the delicious coconuts.</p><p>"Lusting there, brother?" Another one of my brother's murmured into my ear causing me to squeak in surprise.</p><p>"Aren't we all?" I swooned, fluttering my long eyelashes when I saw the smirk on the boy's face.</p><p>"Well… yeah."</p><p>"I want to go closer!"</p><p>"Are you kidding me?! We don't know what they're capable of yet!"</p><p>I only pouted then glared at my brothers, all six of them.</p><p>"I hate you all."</p><p>They only smirked at me then went back to watching the magic user.</p><p>"He's so beautiful, imagine what he'll look like all grown up." All of us groanrd when the image flittered in our minds.</p><p>"I can't wait!" I said with a delighted squeal.</p><p>
  <strong>Back to General P.O.V</strong>
</p><p>After picking one of the yellow objects and washing the dagger in the ocean, I stabbed the object with the dagger then frowned when there was only a shallow cut. He then stabbed the dagger continuously and only achieved the same outcome and eventually he grew agitated then threw down the dagger and picked up the object and held it closely to his face and inspected it.</p><p>Harry looked up and snickered when he saw the Dursleys' trying to catch fish and failing terribly; he then looked back down and began feeling around the yellow object then knocked at it with his fist then his eyes lit up.</p><p>"Maybe If I have something heavier to hit it with then it'll open," He mumbled then began looking around the island and his eyes skipped over the different size rocks scattered across the shore and he huffed.</p><p>"What is heavier than this?" He murmured, throwing the object up in the air and catching it again.</p><p>He surveyed the shore once more then he frowned as his eyes stopped on a medium sized rock and his eyes widened then he looked down at the yellow object and back at the rock before he sped over to the rock with the object in his hand and as he stopped in front of the rock, he bent down and slammed the object down on the rock and immediately his eyes lit up when he saw the huge crack appear on the object. He then hit it against the rock again and gasped in delight when what looked like water spurted out of the object and he immediately put it to his mouth and began drinking the water, moaning at the sweet taste which flooded his mouth.</p><p>After he finished drinking the 'water,' he licked his lip then glanced down at the yellow object.</p><p>"Tasty."</p><p>He then took the object then began furiously pounding it against the stone, thinking that it may hold something else and he laughed in delight when it split in two but then he became confused when he saw that the inside was empty.</p><p>"Well that's off-putting," He muttered, picking up the object only to shout when his fingers slid along the inside.</p><p>Harry picked up one of the halves of the object then swirled his fingers inside then dig off piece of the jelly-like substance and put it into his mouth.</p><p>"Wow, this is so delicious," He said softly before proceeding to scrape out the jelly out of the two halves before dropping both the halves on the ground.</p><p>Harry looked back over at the Dursleys to see that Petunia had torn off piece of Vernon's clothing and wrapped his hand in it; he smirked as Dudley moaned in hunger then turned away when he looked over at him.</p><p>Now, he had to find somewhere to live.</p><p>
  <u> <strong>At the Headmaster's Office, Hogwarts</strong> </u>
</p><p>"Are you positive, Hagrid?" The hard eyes of Albus Dumbledore questioned the fidgeting half-giant.</p><p>"Yes, sir. Every time I try to follow the owls, they are always diverted."</p><p>Dumbledore frowned then smiled tightly at Hagrid who didn't even notice. "Well, I suppose there's nothing else you can do, Hagrid. I'll investigate the matter myself."</p><p>Hagrid smiled widely at Dumbledore and before he could get up, he was hit with a strong <em>'Obliviate' </em>causing Hagrid to forget about not being able to locate Harry Potter.</p><p>"Thank you again, Hagrid and have a good day," Dumbledore said jovially</p><p>Hagrid nodded dazedly then left the Headmaster's office</p><p>"Seems like I would have to take matters into my own hands." He murmured softly, sucking on a Lemon Drop.</p>
