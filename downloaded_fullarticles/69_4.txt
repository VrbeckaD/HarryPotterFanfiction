    <p>She found the charm in a locked drawer.</p><p>Ever since Hermione Granger had arrived at Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, she’d been set to work. In a way, it helped. The boys and Ginny complained about how ineffective it was to use household spells on the literal decades of grime that had crusted themselves into the walls—when you mixed filth with Dark magic, it seemed to solidify like amber and stick around—but Hermione was, at her heart, a roll-up-your-sleeves-and-do-it-yourself sort of person. When a <em>Scourgify</em> Charm didn’t work, she’d go back downstairs and get a bucket of water to scour the damn mold into submission. It helped her escape the guilt.</p><p>Four weeks since she’d come to Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place. Three since she’d last seen Professor Dumbledore. <em>It would be best,</em> he’d said, in his gentle voice, <em>if you not tell Harry where you are or what you are doing, Miss Granger, Mr. Weasley. It would only put him in more danger. I’m afraid you must swear to it. </em>And she’d done it, she’d sworn, but she <em>hated it</em>. Harry’s letters were only getting more and more disconcerting. He was angry, that much was clear. Upset. They’d never kept things from him before, even if Ron had had to go through a telephone call and get hung up on by Vernon Dursley. And he must be miserable, all alone on Privet Drive, dealing with—everything.</p><p><em>He must be so awfully angry with us</em>, she thought, and banged open one of the cabinets with the glass inlay, to show off all the foul, terrible Dark magic artifacts inside. <em>I would be. I’d be furious. Not hearing anything, not having any questions answered, four whole weeks after Cedric died and Harry saw it happen and Lord—</em></p><p>She realized she was muttering aloud when Kreacher, skulking through the hallway, said “never shuts up, does it, Mistress, filthy, know-it-all Mudblood” and pattered away downstairs before she could turn around. She thought, for a moment, about going after him—to check on him, more than anything; nobody had seen Kreacher for days, if you didn’t count Fred and George, who regularly banged around at two or three or four o’clock in the morning and disturbed Kreacher undoing some of their cleaning—but decided against it. He wouldn’t appreciate her going after him; he might even think she was coming to attack him, after what he’d called her. She’d talk to him later, after this room was finished.</p><p>Or—well. She put her hands on her hips, and looked at the cabinet again. Finishing the room might be too optimistic. After she’d finished the <em>cabinet</em>, at least.</p><p>It’d taken the better part of an hour to charm the thing open, and even then she’d had to ask for Sirius’s help to do it. <em>My mother,</em> Sirius had said, darkly, and tried eight different unique locking and unlocking charms before one of them finally worked, and all the cabinets and drawers popped open with a resounding click. <em>Bloody—madwoman.</em> It’d been the same in every bedroom, guest or resident: a tall cabinet with doors made of glass, showing off all the rattling, squeaking, whirring, or disturbingly still bits and bobs of what Hermione presumed were Dark Objects. They certainly <em>felt </em>foul enough when she picked them up and tossed them one by one into the bin she’d brought for this exact purpose. She was quite sure that if she hadn’t been wearing gloves a few of them would have leapt to life and hexed her silly. As it was Mrs. Weasley had charmed a handful of garbage bags not to melt or tear or rip no matter how much thrashing the artifacts were doing inside; once they were collected, Tonks and Professor Moody would heave the bags up with Levitation Charms, not wanting to touch them, and Apparate away somewhere to dispose of the nasty things. Probably the Ministry, since sometimes Mr. Weasley would take things that looked like Muggle-baiting traps, and one of the other members of the Order, Emmeline Vance, would be called in to check on anything particularly nasty. Hermione wasn’t entirely sure who Emmeline Vance was, aside from a Ministry employee. She suspected the woman was an Unspeakable, but nobody would talk about that. You weren’t, after all, supposed to speak about Unspeakables.</p><p>Hermione tossed a human skull that chittered and said “All right, mate, steady on!” into the bin, feeling only the slightest bit bad about treating someone’s bones that way, and kept on cleaning. This cabinet wasn’t nearly so filthy as some of the others, mostly because the sealing charm that had kept the doors closed hadn’t cracked like the one in the bedroom she and Ginny were sharing, but it was still filthy inside. It stank of cigar smoke. She had a theory that Sirius’s father had been a smoker, but she hadn’t asked Sirius. Sirius had a tendency to retreat to Buckbeak’s room and lock the door if anyone asked him questions about his family, and she didn’t want to trigger him into another bout of strained silence.</p><p>She dumped an enchanted domino set that looked as though it had blood runes etched into the side into the bin, and cast another <em>Scourgify</em>. Down the hall, there was a loud <em>crack </em>of apparition, and Ginny—who was supposed to be cleaning another spare bedroom—shrieked and began to swear so loudly and creatively that the twins started laughing at her. Ron poked his head into the room, dust and grime smeared all over his freckled face.</p><p>“Lunch in ten, Hermione.”</p><p>“All right,” Hermione said, somewhat distracted, and dumped another set of artifacts into the bin. “Be there in a tick.”</p><p>Ron nodded, and clattered down the stairs. Down below, someone rang the doorbell, which set off Walburga’s portrait. No point in going down to the kitchen until she’d been silenced; she’d already been called Mudblood once today, and she didn’t need to repeat the experience. Hermione swept the last of the cabinet into the bin, and then started in on the drawers. It was a lot of papers, mostly—things she would have expected to find in a study, not in a bedroom, old wills for people long dead that she set aside for Sirius to look over when he was in a decent mood—and a few tins of what she thought were mints until she opened them to find a strange, oddly shiny mix of human molars, canine fangs, and teeth from what she thought was probably a goat.</p><p>She was just about to slam the last drawer shut when she heard it. There was a shifting, like something was moving about. Not of its own volition; just like the movement of the drawer had knocked something loose inside. When she peered in, she couldn’t see anything. Hermione fixed the gloves tighter on her hands, hoping the dragon leather would protect her from any nasty traps. It hadn’t helped Bill last week when he’d opened a secret compartment in the kitchen to get bitten by eight doxies at once, but then again, Bill was a cursebreaker and used to that kind of nonsense. When she felt around in the drawer, she couldn’t feel anything—there was no Disillusionment Charm anywhere that she could find—but there was a little fleck of a spot at the back of the drawer that seemed rougher than the rest of it. Hermione opened and closed the drawer again, listening to the shift, and then reached her whole arm in—almost up to the armpit; there was an Extension Charm here somewhere—and pushed hard at the rough spot at the back of the drawer.</p><p>The base of the drawer drew back with a snap. It was a false bottom, she realized; only a few centimeters deep, not enough to be obvious to the casual observer, and if Walburga Black hadn’t abruptly stopped screaming as she’d been closing the drawer, she probably would never have noticed it at all. There was what had to be at least a century or two of dust beneath the false bottom, and settled at the lower left-hand corner was a watch.</p><p>Hermione looked at it with a frown. It wasn’t quite a watch, exactly. It was more like the clock at the Weasleys, one with a hand for every member of the family and states of being marked around the edge instead of times. Only this one—she picked it up in her gloved hands, turned it over—had only one hand, and the whole thing was etched in runes. It more effectively looked like a blend between a compass and an open-faced pocket watch, with a needle inside that turned as she moved it around in her palm. There were no numbers or words etched around the edge, only a long, interlaced set of runes that seemed to glow softly when she looked at them for too long. They faded in and out as she watched, vanishing and rising in the burnished silver. She thought it might be Elder Futhark, but there was something off about the carvings that made the hair on her arms stand on end. There was another, smaller compass laid into the face of the watch, but that was still. Every gear that she could see was carved with runes, too. The needle was tipped with the rune <em>ansuz</em>.</p><p>Hermione put the charm back in the drawer, and looked at it. It didn’t feel—bad, exactly. Or maybe she’d been handling so many Dark Objects today that something that felt more Grey than anything was practically Light to her. They were supposed to be tossing out the <em>Dark </em>objects, not the ambiguous ones. Still, there was something odd about the thing that she couldn’t quite shake off. As she turned it about with the tip of her wand, careful not to touch, the one moving arrow, marked with <em>ansuz</em>, pointed unerringly towards the eastern wall, towards the hallway and other people in the house. It didn’t speak, it didn’t wriggle, and it certainly didn’t seem capable of hexing her. All the runes around the face of the watch that she <em>could</em> read—fewer than she liked—were protective. <em>Eihwaz</em> seemed to be the most prominent. Then <em>raidō</em>, though not in a configuration she’d ever seen before, in conjunction with <em>ōþila</em>, and then the rest—the rest she didn’t know.</p><p>She frowned. She’d been studying Ancient Runes for years now, was almost halfway through her fifth year textbook, and she still didn’t recognize these. Some of them <em>might</em> have been Anglo-Saxon, others Ogham, but others seemed to be a mix of Egyptian hieroglyphs and archaic Sumerian as well, which was only taught at the NEWT level. Ancient runic alphabets didn’t like being mixed like that, she knew. Professor Babbling was very strict about keeping her students from mixing alphabets until they knew the ins and outs of every single one, since combining runes from different magical origins often had explosive results. There were three—maybe even four—different runic combinations on this thing, and when she cast a <em>Wingardium Leviosa </em>and spun it in the air, she found an alchemical sigil carved on the back, engraved at the bottom with the words <em>Toujours Pur</em>. Which settled the matter—this was a Black family special, and with all the various runic alphabets it was saddled with, it could very well make the house explode if it was disposed of in the wrong way. She had no way of knowing what it did when she couldn’t even read a quarter of the inscriptions in the silver. She should put it back in the drawer and get Professor Moody and Emmeline to come and take a look at it when they had the chance.</p><p>Still—she hesitated. Her brain itched, and her fingers, the way they always did when her parents brought home a particularly fascinating puzzle. Hermione lowered the charm, but into her pocket, careful not to let it touch her bare skin. She was fairly certain both Professor Moody and Emmeline would be at dinner that evening; there was an Order meeting tonight, and they were both obligated to show up. She could ask them before they left.</p><p>As luck or fate or <em>something </em>would have it, though, she didn’t get the chance to ask Professor Moody that night. Harry turned up, as furious as she’d anticipated, and the watch in her pocket completely slipped her mind until the next morning, when she slung her robes on over her jeans and striped sweater and felt the lump of it in her pocket. It stayed there, ominously unmoving, until the next time Professor Moody turned up at Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, at which point she turned it over to him for inspection. Sirius watched her do it, his sharp grey eyes fixed on the thing as she Levitated it from her pocket to the tabletop for Professor Moody to poke at, but he didn’t say anything. She had the feeling Sirius wouldn’t have been particularly disturbed if someone lit Number Twelve on fire and burned the whole thing to the bloody ground.</p><p>She’d almost forgotten about the thing all over again when Professor Moody and Emmeline Vance turned up at the next Order meeting, and gave it back to her. “It’s harmless, I think,” said Emmeline, her mouth full of beef stew and carrots, and Sirius snorted.</p><p>“Nothing my family made is harmless.”</p><p>“None of the spells on that thing are actively <em>harmful</em>, anyway,” Emmeline said, serenely ignoring Sirius’s tone. He’d been growing increasingly sour and snappish the closer it came to the start of term, and everyone was learning to ignore it. “There’s definitely magic in it, but it seems more like something to keep track of all the scions of the Black family than anything else. See, here—” She set it on the table, and moved it back and forth, and no matter what, the arrow inscribed with <em>ansuz</em> pointed unerringly towards Sirius. “It’s probably been hidden in that drawer for ages and everyone’s forgotten about it.”</p><p>“How old is it?”</p><p>“Hard to say.” Emmeline tapped the end of her spoon against her teeth. “How old is the Black family?”</p><p>“Founded in the year 1138,” said Hermione promptly. Sirius’s lips drew back from his still-yellowed teeth.</p><p>“<em>Toujours Pur</em>.”</p><p>“Maybe not <em>that </em>old,” said Emmeline, “but certainly close. I’m not good with antiquities. The dating spell I used said it was eight hundred years old or so, at least. It’s not dangerous, whatever it is. Whatever spells were laid on it are probably completely deteriorated, at this point; I could only get so much out of the diagnostics.”</p><p>Hermione, her grip loosening on her spoon, looked at the thing. It sat, without comment, in front of her on the rough-hewn dining table. Next to her, Harry was moody again; he was prodding at his beef stew with his spoon and not listening to a word anyone was saying. Ron was eating the way he always did—quickly and with gusto—while talking to Fred and George about doxy venom.</p><p>“The runes I can translate are all protective, if that helps,” said Emmeline, and Hermione jumped. “What few spells <em>are </em>still active are all protective as well, and the most important thing is that there’s no magic on it primed directly against Muggles or Muggleborns. It seems to be a defensive charm of some kind, and only when it’s activated. It can’t hurt anybody.”</p><p>Hermione hesitated, and looked at Sirius.</p><p>“If you want it,” Sirius said, correctly reading her face, “go ahead. I don’t give a damn.”</p><p>Hermione darted another little look at Sirius, but it was clear he had no further interest in the matter, instead dipping his head to say something quiet into Harry’s ear. Trying to get him to eat, most likely. Emmeline spooned up more stew, and swallowed it, thoughtfully.</p><p>“I’d take it to Professor Babbling,” she said. “She’s much better at runic combinations than me. She might be able to tell you what the charm does in more detail. Or you could make it a project. Try to work it out yourself.” </p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“The runic combinations are interesting,” said Emmeline, smiling a little. “I’ve not seen archaic Sumerian combined with Ogham in a long time. The art was lost around the sixteenth century. If you were able to unravel some of the runic combinations and translate them, you’d have a very interesting topic to write a paper on. I’m sure there are more than a few academic journals that would be interested in a student who worked out how to lay the alphabets alongside each other again. If you’re ambitious you could even make it into a mastery project, post-NEWT. If you’re inclined that way, of course.”</p><p>Hermione picked up the charm, and turned it over in her hands. It was cool to the touch, and silent, despite the little shifting arm inside. A project, maybe—she could talk Professor Babbling into giving her extra credit, she was fairly certain, especially with something so very old and delicate as this. She’d have to teach herself three new runic alphabets—her heart beat a little faster at the thought—and probably would need another time-turner to devote the amount of energy to the charm that it deserved, but she <em>could</em>. She’d talk to Professor McGonagall about it, see if she thought it was reasonable to do during her OWL year.</p><p>She tucked it into her pocket, and finished her stew with a secret smile on her face.</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p>The watch—charm, Emmeline had called it—became her side project.</p><p>It wasn’t like she didn’t have <em>enough </em>to do, but still: with Harry in a semi-permanent foul mood, Umbridge destroying everything that Hogwarts stood for, Dumbledore’s Army, and OWLs creeping up on the horizon, she spent what little free time she still had not mopping up Harry’s upsets, fixing Ron’s essays, or finishing her near-literal mountains of homework studying the charm. She spent most of her weekends on it, going through old textbooks from the library—not only about the extra alphabets she now had to learn, but also what little history was available about complex runic enchantments like this one. That meant getting into the Restricted Section, but unlike second year, no professor had to be bribed into signing her permission slip.</p><p>“Most inter-runic charms like this get destroyed in the making of the object,” Professor Babbling had said, when Hermione had shown her the charm after the first Ancient Runes class of the year. “There’s a complex enchantment built into the thing, but I think your friend is right; nothing dangerous about it. See what you can do with it. I’ll sign whatever you need to access resources in the Restricted Section. It might be a little advanced, but I trust you.”</p><p>“Thank you, Professor.”</p><p>“Be prepared for a long haul, though,” said Professor Babbling, as Hermione slipped the charm back into her pocket. “Rome wasn’t built in a day.”</p><p>Hermione knew, logically, that it would take a while to unravel the charm’s secrets. But when the Halloween feast came and went and she was still struggling with the most basic building blocks of the runic enchantments, though, she grew frustrated. The thing simply <em>would not be translated</em>. None of the runic configurations made any kind of sense. Even beyond inspecting the runes—which in and of itself took some doing, as she spent the whole of September and October teaching herself Ogham and Sumerian to try and determine whether the marks on the rim of the watch meant <em>protection </em>or <em>endurance</em>, <em>resurrection </em>or <em>continuance</em>—it was layered with so many smaller concealment charms that she couldn’t read half the runes carved on its surface. They moved, if she stared at it for too long; shifting, changing shape. It weighed on her. More like a complex maths problem than anything; a puzzle she could not solve.</p><p>She started keeping it on her. It gave her something that was all cold logic to focus on when the world was going to hell, and she appreciated it. The little charm became something, like her wand, that simply lived in the pocket of her cloak, or on her bedside table. She even wrote Sirius a few times to ask if he still had any books on runes in the Grimmauld Place library, and he sent back a massive pile of books that had been <em>marked for the bonfire if you hadn’t asked for them, kitten</em>. (This made Hermione frown, but of course, it was Sirius’s library, and he could do what he liked with it; she simply didn’t like the idea of burning books in vengeance for his family’s allegiances.)</p><p>“It’s a pureblood family thing,” Ron said, when he caught her for the eight-thousandth time pouring over the charm with all her books on Ancient Runes open in front of her on the floor of the Gryffindor common room. “Half of it’s probably sealed with the Black family magic. You won’t be able to unlock it.”</p><p>“Thank you for your opinion, Ronald,” said Hermione, a bit more snottily than she should have, but Ron had forgotten his rounds the night before <em>again</em> and she was not best pleased with him at that moment. Harry was out somewhere, probably moping about Cho. “I’ll be sure to keep it in mind.”</p><p>Ron scoffed at her, looking sour, and turned back to the Herbology essay he should have done three weeks ago as Hermione made another notation in the book of Ogham runes with her quill.</p><p>The most irritating thing was that Ron was probably right. Pureblood family magic had its own locks and keys that one could only access if you were <em>of </em>that blood; it was why Sirius could unlock the cabinets without much trouble, but even Professor Moody would have trouble undoing the charms on the Boggart-filled desk in the study at Grimmauld Place. She collected a handful of books on family magic—all written in broad descriptions, obviously; no living pureblood family would let their family secrets be published, especially not the nitty-gritty detail she needed to unlock the secrets of the charm—and found somewhat to her distaste that it was mostly to do with blood magic. At least a few of the runes had probably been inscribed with Black blood, and that explained quite neatly why it would not activate for her, or even show its purpose. Whatever it did, it likely would not activate unless someone with a Black-dominant bloodline put a few drops of blood on one of the runes. And <em>that</em>, she thought, was certainly not happening, not until she found out a little more about the thing. The last thing they needed was Sirius setting off some kind of anti-Black bombshell in the middle of Grimmauld Place.</p><p>She tried her own blood, out of curiosity—despite her slight revulsion of the concept, there was no general harm in blood magic, just the possibility it could be used wrongly, though she deliberately did <em>not </em>mention to Ron that she’d tried it; blood magic was hailed as Dark for a reason—but when she pricked her finger and let three drops fall on the glass of the compass, it just sank in and stayed there. Probably because she was Muggleborn, she thought, and put a sticking plaster on her forefinger. Nothing else for it.</p><p>It wasn't an artifact like Tom Riddle's diary. That, at least, she was sure of. It didn't speak to her or haunt her if she didn't think about it for a while. Half the runes still wouldn't reveal themselves to her, no matter what she tried. She wound up asking Sirius about it once over Christmas, but all he did was roll his eyes. “It's a Black family heirloom,” he said, when she pressed. “There are too many of them as it is. Even if it isn't Dark, it can't be good. Better off if you just toss it in the fire and forget about it, kitten.”</p><p>Hermione frowned, and kept the charm in her pocket. She meant to ask him about it at a later date, when he was in a better mood, but he was so irritable all through the latter half of the Christmas holiday that she didn't dare bring it up again. If she was fully honest with herself, she was hesitant to press the matter with Mr. Weasley still so weak after the snakebite. Harry was tetchy enough as it was, and she didn't need Ron snarling at her about <em>that bloody watch, Hermione</em> on top of it all.</p><p>The charm became third tier after the DA exploded. OWLs distracted her, too, and Grawp. It lived in her pocket for most of spring term, and when she needed a break from revising, she turned it over and over into hands. It was a soothing weight, but it didn't weigh on her, exactly. She could not emphasize enough how little she thought about the charm, after Christmas. She forgot it was there, even, through Easter, through all her OWLs. She forgot it was there, even as Harry fell out of his chair, howling; even as he stammered about Sirius; even that night, as they went out to the Forest with Umbridge. She forgot it was there as she mounted a thestral she couldn't see, outside of shifting the thing to keep it from jamming into her leg. It was just something she kept in her pocket.</p><p>Until the Department of Mysteries.</p><p>Hermione didn't remember much of the Department of Mysteries. She remembered the doors, and the spinning, whirligig Xs she left on them. She remembered doors that would not open; brains in a tank; a bell jar with a beautiful hummingbird inside. She remembered the sudden shock of <em>something</em> in her chest when the curse the masked Death Eater threw hit home.</p><p>She was unconscious for a while. Someone must have carried her. When she opened her eyes, they were in a different room. Somewhere close by, there was screaming. Spells. A bright light rose and died against the doorway, the way lights filtered through a window in a street full of police cars. Blue and orange. Red. Green.</p><p>The green made her sick.</p><p>Hermione rolled into her knees. Something was very wrong. She coughed, and blood spattered the floor. Her insides were—something was wrong. Something was <em>wrong</em>. She couldn't breathe right. Her heartbeat seemed too loud, and uneven. When she touched her pocket, her wand was gone. <em>Where’s my wand? </em>Gone. Stupid question to ask.</p><p>“Hermione,” said a voice—Luna, she thought. When she turned her head, her eyes ached. Luna was there, white as a sheet with blood dribbling from her nose. So was Ginny, sitting on the floor with one leg outstretched. Ron was unconscious. Hermione opened her mouth and gagged on blood.</p><p>“Harry and Neville ran,” said Luna. “In there.” She pointed at the door. “Neville borrowed your wand.”</p><p>“Ron,” said Hermione. There was blood on her teeth. It was a singularly unpleasant sensation. “Is Ron—”</p><p>“Ron had a tangle with some errant thoughts,” said Luna, and Hermione would have been confused if not for the muck of—something lying beside Ron’s head. It looked as if someone had shoved a grenade inside a brain. Luna patted Ron’s shoulder gently, not looking away from Hermione. “Ginny—”</p><p>“Just my ankle,” said Ginny, in a skeletal-thin voice. “It’s fine.”</p><p>“It’s broken,” said Luna at the same time. “You shouldn’t move, Hermione—” </p><p>But Hermione had already heaved herself up, clutching at the door frame. She could see into another room from here. When she looked back, Luna waved at her.</p><p>“Go. We'll follow you.”</p><p>Hermione nodded. There was something dribbling from her lips, and she refused to consider what it was.</p><p>Three steps, and she saw it. The room with an arch. There were spells. Bright lights driving into her head. She was at the top of a set of stairs down to the dais, and down at the base there were ten Death Eaters, and more—<em>Sirius</em>, she thought, and her knees gave out as she slid to the floor. <em>Professor Lupin.</em> There was a prone form on the floor with vibrant pink hair that could be no one but Tonks. Professor Moody was bending over her. There was no mistaking that cane. And—<em>Dumbledore.</em></p><p><em>Safe</em>, she thought. Hermione gagged, and only then realized her mouth was full of blood. <em>We're safe.</em></p><p>“Come on,” said Sirius, in a loud, laughing voice, “you can do better than that—”</p><p>She felt it as if the spell hit her own chest. Bellatrix's casting was silent, but the color was red—<em>Stupefy</em>, maybe. It hit him hard, hard enough that it knocked him off his feet. The veil fluttered, and even at this distance she could see that it seemed to part for him. Seemed to swallow him.</p><p>Sirius fell, and in her pocket, something clicked.</p><p>She heard Harry's shout in the same moment the light flared. An alchemical circle, but it was too bright, she could only make out the symbols for Saturn and the element of mercury before something bit into her chest. She choked. Blood, and pain, and the light was too bright, it was blinding, she couldn't see, and her bones were on fire, her skin, <em>let it end let it end let it end—</em></p><p>Something touched her cheek, a whisper—</p><p>The world went dark.</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p align="center">.</p><p>
  <em>Línan er yfir, línan er hafin.</em>
</p><p>Hermione breathed.</p><p>She was in darkness. She could not remember how she'd come to be there, or how long she had rested in the balance. There was simply darkness, and herself within it, suspended in the warm dark.</p><p>
  <em>Línan er yfir, línan er hafin.</em>
</p><p>She could not remember first hearing the voice, but she wasn't sure she was <em>hearing </em>it at all. It seemed to simply be there, vibrating in her head. She wondered, for a moment, if she had ears, but when she reached up she had hands, and when she cupped her hands over her ears they were certainly there. So was her hair, which was, oddly, comforting.</p><p>
  <em>Línan er yfir, línan er hafin.</em>
</p><p>“Hello?” said Hermione. She rested a hand to her chest, and could not taste blood anymore. She supposed—with a faint sort of distaste—that she might have died. The last thing she remembered was light, after all. Isn't that what people usually saw?</p><p>
  <em>That's the brain having one last synaptic explosion before expiring, Hermione. What you saw was magic. Alchemy and family magic combined, most likely. Don't be ridiculous.</em>
</p><p>Her wand was still nowhere to be found. Somehow this did not disturb her. Hermione took a step, and then another, but the darkness around her seemed to swallow all sound. Aside from the voice, curling through the dark, there was nothing. Perhaps only the rustling of feathers.</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p><em>Ravens.</em> This was magic. She was not in the least bit stupid, it was obvious this was magic, but it was not, she thought, something done by Death Eaters. It did not feel like Dark magic at all, but nor did it feel <em>Light</em> exactly. It seemed to simply exist in a way that air existed, the high pure air you only found on mountain peaks. She was dizzy with it.</p><p>
  <em>Línan er yfir, línan er hafin.</em>
</p><p>“Be rude, then,” said Hermione, in a voice that shook more than it should have. Her chest started to ache, but at a distance, raw and echoing. “I don't speak Old Norse.”</p><p>This was not strictly true—she spoke a <em>little</em>, mostly from translation in Ancient Runes—but certainly not enough to understand the conjugation this person was using. This woman, Hermione thought. The voice seemed to have no gender, but something about it pushed at her.</p><p>“You need to take me back,” said Hermione. “I have—friends—I need to go help them, you have to take me back.”</p><p>Stars. Points of light in the dark. She found Aquila, Ursa Major, Scorpio. Draco. The Dog Star made something clench tight in her chest, for reasons she couldn't recall. She smoothed her hands over her robes. It occurred to her that here in the dark, she didn't need them—she couldn’t even see herself, so she doubted anyone would be able to see her, regardless of clothes—but she had them, and they were good for her nerves. The darkness seemed to swirl. This time, when she took a step, it echoed, and around her there was a rustling, as if of many wings. Things were moving out of the corner of her eye, but when she turned, there was nothing to see.</p><p>“<em>Alle veje ligger åbne for dig</em>,” said a voice. It was a voice, this time. Something she could hear. When she turned, a woman stood there with a face that Hermione did not know. It seemed to shift and change, like Tonks’ metamorphmagery, but—different. Less like a person changing flesh and bone, and more like a ghost struggling to hold onto the memory of shape. Unlike a ghost, she was in brilliant technicolor; black hair and grey eyes and a mouth that went from thin to plush to crooked as she spoke. “<em>Rejsende, alle veje ligger åbne.</em>”</p><p>
  <em>Línan er yfir, línan er hafin.</em>
</p><p>“I don't know what you're saying,” said Hermione. She clutched at her robes, and found a hard, warm lump in her pocket, a lump that went hot as blood when she touched it with her bare hands. “I don't know where I am. Take me back.”</p><p>“<em>Alle veje ligger åbne</em>,” said the woman, and her hair moved. Ravens’ wings rustled. “<em>Du vil gå dertil hvor der er brug for dig</em>.”</p><p> “<em>Take me back</em>,” Hermione said. “I need to help Harry, I need to help Sirius—”</p><p>“<em>Línan er yfir,</em>” said the woman, and reached out with her hand. Her fingers changed as she moved, from long and slender to short and thick to the fingers of a very small child. She touched Hermione's forehead, then her breastbone. “<em>Línan er hafin.</em>”</p><p>Blood bubbled on her lips. It tasted sweet. “Stop,” said Hermione, but the woman did not. Her face morphed to the beak of a raven—she was growing feathers—</p><p>“<em>Línan er hafin</em>,” she said, and with a great rush of wings, Hermione woke up.</p><p>She was in a hospital bed. As she blinked, slowly, the light changed. She had the vaguest notion of time passing, mostly due to the color of the light, but it took a while for her mind to fully process it. She’d blink, and the ward would change from bright to dim. Once, she saw a woman with bright blue hair standing beside her bed, and thought, muzzily, that Tonks had survived. That was good. Her very bones seemed to ache when she moved, but after a while, she started to get frustrated.</p><p><em>I will be awake,</em> she told herself, the next time she opened her eyes. <em>I have to wake up. They’re probably worried, all of them</em>.</p><p>She blinked, and it was dark again. There was a figure seated beside her bed, a figure in garish purple robes and with long white hair. Hermione swallowed, and rasped at him. Professor Dumbledore was reading, but as soon as she croaked, he was up in a moment, finding a cup at her bedside table and conjuring a straw out of nowhere. “Slowly,” said Professor Dumbledore, but Hermione was too thirsty and her mouth still tasted of blood—she took three heaving gulps and then began to cough, which set her lungs and ribs on fire. It took probably a good ninety seconds before she could steady out again, before her voice eased.</p><p>“Professor,” said Hermione blearily. The half-moon spectacles glinted a little as Professor Dumbledore leaned back in his chair, and blinked at her, waving a hand to light the lamp at her bedside. “Professor Dumbledore, where’s—where’s Harry? And Ron? And—”</p><p>“My dear, lay back.” Professor Dumbledore put a hand to her shoulder, and pressed her back against the bed. In the same moment, the gnawing pain in her chest flared white-hot; a starburst; a supernova. Hermione closed her eyes and bit the inside of her cheek until it died away, and realized there were tears streaking back over her temples. Her cheeks warmed. “You’re in St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. You were discovered in the Department of Mysteries three nights ago in the Time Room, unconscious beneath a desk. It is a miracle that you survived.”</p><p>St. Mungo’s was obvious. It wasn’t the same ward as Mr. Weasley had been in, more like the Janus Thickey Ward, but it was still clearly a hospital. It smelled and looked nothing like the Hospital Wing at Hogwarts. <em>And </em>it was closer to the Department of Mysteries than Hogwarts was. <em>I must have been more hurt than I thought</em>. Hermione took a deep breath through her nose, and forced her eyes back open. There might not have been sunlight, not anymore, but the lamp Professor Dumbledore had lit was stinging her eyes. <em>Three nights ago</em>. Three nights since they’d ridden thestrals to London, three nights since— “Professor Dumbledore—is Harry all right? And—and Ron? Ginny, Neville? Is everyone—”</p><p>“Take a deep breath,” said Professor Dumbledore, and Hermione obeyed. She couldn’t help it. Professor Dumbledore was the sort of man you just <em>obeyed</em>, even if you weren’t a girl like Hermione who had obedience and rule-abiding respect bred into her very bones. She took a breath, and then another, and then waited until the ache in her chest died down a little bit before she looked at him again. He was giving her a very odd look, his eyebrows roosting in his hairline; concern had settled in around his nose and mouth, the way you’d nestle into an old, familiar blanket.</p><p>“You know me,” said Professor Dumbledore, as if this were a surprise.</p><p>“Of course, Professor,” said Hermione. “You’ve—you’ve been the headmaster for all the time I’ve been at Hogwarts. You’ve helped Harry since first year. Of course I know you.”</p><p>Professor Dumbledore looked at her for a moment longer. Then, slowly, he leaned back in his chair, rested his elbows to the arms of it, and steepled his fingers. Hermione watched him, and wondered. There was something cool, turning cold, in her chest; like a block of ice had slid down her throat and was now freezing her lungs. That, in tune with the ache from the Death Eater’s curse, made her palms sweat like anything.</p><p>“I see,” said Professor Dumbledore. He met her gaze for a long, unsettling moment—her head ached, as if something was pushing at her from the inside—and then nodded again. “I see, Miss Granger.”</p><p>He hesitated over it.</p><p>Hermione said, “Where’s Harry?”</p><p>Professor Dumbledore drew his wand from his sleeve, and waved it. In a moment, the sounds of the rest of the ward dampened; it was as if someone had drawn a curtain of static around them, tucking close around her hospital bed. She couldn’t hear anything, and she was sure nobody else could hear them. Professor Dumbledore stowed his wand away again, and said, “Forgive me, Miss Granger, but it seemed wise to keep things private. Just for now.”</p><p>“Of course,” said Hermione, as an icy fist clutched at her throat. She curled her hands tight around the fabric of her blankets. “Professor, I—”</p><p>“If you could wait,” said Professor Dumbledore, and her mouth snapped shut. “I understand that you are eager for answers, Miss Granger. But if you would give me just a few more moments of your time, and explain to me how you came to be in St. Mungo’s, I believe I can answer some, if not most, of your questions at the end of it.”</p><p>She did not like the look in his eyes. Tired, as if he had a great many things to weigh, all resting in his hands at once. Still, Hermione wet her lips, and began. She started with what Harry had seen during their OWL—the Department of Mysteries, Sirius, Lord Voldemort—and then told him about Umbridge, about Grawp, about the centaurs, the thestrals; Ron, Ginny, Luna, and Neville tagging along with them; their arrival in the cramped phone booth, the badges that read <em>Rescue Mission</em>; going through the doors in the Department of Mysteries, the Time Room, the room with the archway, the room with the door that would not open; their encounter with Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange. The rest was harder: the woman, the ravens, the magic. It sounded unbelievable even as she said it aloud, but Professor Dumbledore didn’t interrupt. The more she spoke, the hoarser her voice became; at three separate points Professor Dumbledore had to take down their privacy spell to call for a Healer to bring her more water. It was only once it was finished, and she trailed off rather lamely with <em>and then I woke up here</em>, that Professor Dumbledore rubbed a hand over his mouth, down through his beard, and let out a long, steady breath.</p><p>“I see,” he said. Then: “May I see the charm you described?”</p><p>Hermione turned her head, and looked at the charm resting on her bedside table. Professor Dumbledore said “Ah” in a delicate voice, and then Summoned it with a silent spell, turning the thing over and over between his fingers. It shimmered gold and silver, and it was thrumming, somehow, with magic; some of the runes were glowing, leaving starry spots on the insides of her eyelids as she blinked. Professor Dumbledore said “Ah,” again, in a somewhat more revolted voice this time, before turning it over to study the engraved sigil of the Blacks on the back of the compass. <em>Toujours Pur.</em> “I see.”</p><p>“But I don’t see,” Hermione burst out, and tried to sit up again. The muscles in her chest spasmed, and she flopped back onto the pillows, feeling furious with herself. “Where’s Harry? And Ron? And Sirius, was—did the Order—is everyone all right? Did I—”</p><p><em>Did I really see Sirius die?</em> she thought, and then bit her tongue. She wasn’t a Seer. If they even existed. Besides, it had been a hallucination, that much was clear.</p><p>“So far as I am aware,” said Professor Dumbledore, looking at her with sharp eyes, “Sirius Black is alive and well and residing in Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place.”</p><p>“Then I was right,” Hermione said, and stared at the ceiling. “It <em>was </em>a trap. For Harry.”</p><p>“My dear,” said Professor Dumbledore, and tucked the empty charm away into his pocket. “Would I be correct in calling you a Ravenclaw?”</p><p>The icy hand closed tighter around her throat.</p><p>“No, sir,” said Hermione in a tiny voice. “No, I’m—I’m a Gryffindor.”</p><p>“I see,” said Professor Dumbledore. Then: “What day were you born, Miss Granger?”</p><p>Hermione blinked at him, very slowly. The fist clenched tighter, and tighter. She had to swallow twice before she said, “The nineteenth of September, sir. 1979.”</p><p>Professor Dumbledore stroked his beard again, for a long, terrifying moment. His eyes, when he looked at her, had an immeasurable sort of sadness to them. He said, “My dear, today is the twentieth of June, 1975.”</p><p>Hermione blinked. She blinked again. The ache in her chest started to pound, louder and louder with the beat of her heart. It echoed in her ears, raw, unending, loud <em>noise </em>that she could barely hear herself through. The buzz of the privacy spell ate through her words. “But—that’s not possible.”</p><p>Professor Dumbledore looked at her, sadly. He said nothing.</p><p>“Time-turners aren’t capable of sending people back in time more than five hours,” said Hermione. Her voice cracked. “I—I read everything I could on them when I—but I—it’s not—it’s not <em>possible</em>—”</p><p>The Time Room. She’d been in the Time Room. She’d watched the Death Eater fall into the glass bell, watch his head shrink to that of an infant. But that had been time in a loop, time—time in a <em>loop</em>, not time thrown to pieces like this—<em>1975—</em>if it was 1975—</p><p><em>I’ve not been born</em>, she thought, and darkness closed in. <em>Harry and Ron and—they’re not alive. They’re not people. They’re not—the timeline, I’m not supposed to be here, the timeline will go wrong, Professor Dumbledore knows—he knows—he saw—</em></p><p><em>You must not be seen.</em> It was the first rule. It was the most important. <em>You must not be seen</em>. Meddling with time was the worst possible thing you could do. It would destroy <em>everything</em>. <em>You must not be seen, Miss Granger.</em></p><p>She’d told him—she’d told him—</p><p>The glint of half-moon spectacles filled her vision. Professor Dumbledore put a hand to her brow, and said, quite firmly, “<em>Breathe</em>, Miss Granger.”</p><p>She breathed. It was ragged, much too fast, and it made her <em>hurt</em>, made tears leak out her eyes, but she breathed. <em>I am real</em>, she told herself, and turned her face away from him. <em>I am real, I am real, I am real.</em></p><p>“If you’ll forgive me the liberty,” said Professor Dumbledore. His voice echoed, as if from a long distance. “The Department of Mysteries informed me of your arrival as soon as they became aware of it. They believed—and I must say, they were not wrong—that a Hogwarts student had broken in to the Ministry of Magic, and somehow found herself in the Time Room, a place where, logic dictates, she should not have been able to enter. However, this—illuminates things. Your predicament is—complex, but that is not to say that we cannot attempt to find a solution. But until then, you must <em>breathe</em>.”</p><p>That was sensible. That was logical. Cold hard logic was what she needed at that moment. She needed <em>logic</em>, not panic. She clung to it, and tried hard to steady out.</p><p>“With your permission,” said Dumbledore, “I will teach you to siphon part of your memories of this incident into a form I can take with me to the Department. There, they will study it, and attempt to find an answer as to why you are here. Until then, I’m afraid you must remain in the hospital.”</p><p><em>Harry</em>, she thought. <em>Ron</em>. But she bit her lip, hard enough to sting. “But—the rules—”</p><p>“The rules of time travel dictate that you must not be seen,” said Professor Dumbledore kindly. “Yes, I know. But at this point, you have only been seen by me, Healer Chatwicke, and one very startled Unspeakable, and I daresay that outside of healer-patient privilege and the rules of working in the Department of Mysteries, the only one who ought to be warned into keeping a secret is me. And I hope, Miss Granger, you can trust me to keep your secret, for now?”</p><p>His eyes twinkled, just a little. Hermione bit her lip, and then stopped herself. “Yes, Professor.”</p><p>Professor Dumbledore smiled, then. It was sad, but it was gentle, and he squeezed her hand tight. “Excellent, Miss Granger. Now—I believe Healer Chatwicke mentioned that you were found without a wand. If you’ll permit me—I’ve taken the liberty of bringing a spare, here. I’m not sure how well it will work for you, but it should be serviceable until we either return you to your proper place in the world or—find another solution. Now: extracting memories into a tangible form has a simple incantation, just—tricky to get hold of the first time. If you’ll observe?”</p>
