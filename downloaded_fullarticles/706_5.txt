    <p>“You’re no good for me.” He murmured quietly, a hand either side of her on the stone wall. She looked in to his ice blue eyes, almost as if she was entranced. His hand lifted and in a split second landed hard on her cheek, eliciting a hiss of pain though she didn’t pull away in fear, she simply pulled him closer. </p>
<p>“But I want you.” She said, her fingers insinuating themselves through the buttons of his shirt. He said nothing to her, he stood taller than she was, looking at her, watching the beautiful woman he so adored, he couldn’t hurt her –no that was a lie, he loved to hurt her. He liked leaving marks on her skin, destroying her mentally and physically. He tortured her with the most inexplicable reasoning. He had none, no reason. He’d taken her innocence at the age of 12, she was scared and 5 years on, she was stunning, perfect and all his. She devoted herself to him, sat at his feet. She was his slave. She was the servant and he the master.</p>
