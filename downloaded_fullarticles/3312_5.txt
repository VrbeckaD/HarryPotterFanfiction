    <p>On the night of the Yule Ball, Harry Potter went missing. He was last seen by Rubeus Hagrid leaving the rose garden and walking towards the Forbidden Forest. The search of the castle and grounds began in the early hours of Boxing Day but no trace of the boy was found. Rita Skeeter broke the story in the next dayâ€™s <i>Prophet</i>. The piece was illustrated by a photograph of Harry and Parvati Patil opening the Yule Ball. The pair waltzed across the frame from right to left before the image looped. Months later, when hopes of finding Harry had faded, someone stuck an enlarged copy of the photograph over the fireplace in the Gryffindor common room. The photograph remained there until Voldemort took Hogwarts.</p>
