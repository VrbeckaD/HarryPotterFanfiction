    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Renuka Lupin sighed contentedly as her mother handed her a cup of tea and tucked in the large poofy comforter that surrounded her small bony figure. She squished more cozily into her favorite reading chair, with a large book of <cite>Whit and Charms for Clever Young Witches and Wizards</cite> on her lap. Her two cats Dickens and Lewis were purring, one at her feet and the other on an arm of the chair. She could feel their warm, vibrating bodies so close to her own.<br/>
She was in her favourite room in the house. It was the biggest room in the small cottage they had relocated to, deeper in the hilly country side, shrouded by the large forest behind it.<br/>
It was a circular room with a large window overlooking the small lake and the hills that stretched out behind it. Her reading chair was perched conveniently close to it so she had plenty of scope for daydreaming, when her head wasn’t stuck in a book. The surrounding walls were covered in deep book shelves with colourful books and old scrolls and parchments. Her father had picked them up from his travels all over the wizarding world as part of his work for the Ministry of Magic in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Her mother had also brought back many books from Sri Lanka, including <cite>Spirits and Spirituality in Sri Lanka</cite>  which was a particular favourite. <cite>Mysterious Creatures of Iceland</cite>, was another favourite. Her father had brought it back for her, after one of the few trips he had finally made to his home country.<br/>
He always said, “Magic suddenly seems insignificant when surrounded by deep fjords, glaciers, vast volcanic deserts, black sand beaches, snow-capped mountains, staggering waterfalls, all shaped by the mysterious forces of nature. Everywhere you turn something far more wild and untamed is at work then mere magic. It puts a pompous wizard back in his place, that’s for certain.”<br/>
The language had been even more precious to him and his parents had urged him to hang onto it even when they had moved to England so that he could go to Hogwarts.<br/>
This meant that he had spoken both English and Icelandic to Renuka ever since she was born.<br/>
Her mother almost always spoke to Renuka in her native tongue of Sinhalese and laughed at her father when he went on and on about Iceland.<br/>
She preferred, “The thickly vegetated rainforests, mountains rich with history, and sacred ruins that make one feel truly rooted in the deep spirit of the Island. And of course the elephants and the dazzling warmth of the sun.”<br/>
It continually amazed Renuka that they had ended up together, and in England.<br/>
Renuka was a Sri Lankan name that meant Born of Dust.<br/>
Renuka’s skin was light brown, and there were now streaks of grey in her black hair, due to that unfortunate event when she was nine. Her big, brown eyes also had an amber and gold glint to them because of this unfortunate event. Her mother trimmed her hair short so as not to draw too much attention to the streaks of grey.</p><p>When she was just nine years old, she was bitten by Fenrir Greyback, the deadliest werewolf in the wizarding world. Her father had offended him and his kind, though she never found out exactly what had passed between them. She did know that her father would never forgive himself for it.<br/>
It seemed Fenrir had tried to kidnap her as well, presumably to raise her to be like himself, but her father and mother had rescued her before he could, though the deadly deed was already done.<br/>
They moved deeper into the country side and enlarged the basement of their new cottage to become a werewolf proof cellar, where she could roam around somewhat freely.<br/>
She had always been a quiet girl, who preferred reading above anything else, so she convinced herself that living a secluded life wouldn’t be such a tragic thing. Of course she could never go to Hogwarts now, but she could continue her education from the cottage, where she was safe from prying eyes and could not hurt anyone.<br/>
It was a difficult thing for a young girl to go through such a painful transformation every month.<br/>
But her mother tried to comfort her by saying that every woman went through a transformation each month. Hers just brought out her wild side a little more severely.<br/>
This was the running joke in the family and it certainly helped to lighten spirits a little.<br/>
But the pain was almost unbearable, and the morning after her transformation she was always covered in bruises. The first few times she transformed, chunks of her hair kept falling out and she would sometimes convulse uncontrollably, foaming at the mouth like a feral child, as the sensation of sharp teeth lasted long afterwards. She also had an unhealthy desire for raw meat that hardly dissipated during the rest of the month.</p><p>Slowly and painfully as the months past, she had begun to accept her time of the month as just an extra burden she had to bear, and tried to ignore it for the rest of the month. Both her parents encouraged her to see that she was not the wolf, and it did not define her.<br/>
“You are our sweet, quiet, and intelligent, bookworm daughter, and this wild, horrific beast has nothing to do with you. It is a curse that you must learn to bare, but it is not who you are.”<br/>
And so she would try to convince herself of this, despite a strange sensation that her human limbs were starting to feel stronger, and her bones harder.<br/>
She attributed this to the intense yoga sessions her mother did with her each day, to keep her body healthy, as she often felt haggard after the full moon, like she was growing old somehow. They did it in the basement, filling its echoing prison like walls with music, so that the room would not be a place she dreaded every month.<br/>
Meditation was a practice that her mother encouraged her to do for at least 30 minutes each day. It did help her to compose her thoughts, especially after the transformation. It helped her to gain an inner peace to balance the unmistakable wildness that she felt growing inside her.<br/>
Sometimes she would just run and run and run in the fields outside their little cottage, without thinking, just feeling her muscles moving, the sinews in her arms and legs, her heart pounding and her breath coming short and fast.<br/>
When she was out of doors she felt that her senses were enhancing. She could hear and smell the smallest of changes in the landscape around her as the seasons past. She thought this had to do with her endless practice of Meditation. She told her mother that she thought her senses were becoming sharper and more focused because of the meditation.<br/>
For some reason her mother did not look entirely convinced.</p><p>With her cats to comfort her and her books to guide her, she almost believed she was a normal young girl. As she sat in her reading chair and sipped the cup of tea her mother had handed her, she smiled and purred at her cats.<br/>
It was the morning of her 11th birthday, three days after the full moon, the worst of it finally over, except for a stuffy head cold that wouldn’t go away, even with cold charming spells.<br/>
She was excited because today she would receive her first real wand. Her father was on another trip for the ministry, and he was stopping by Diagon Alley to purchase it before his return.<br/>
He did a considerable amount of his work from home now, but he had not been able to decline this trip.</p><p>She became immersed in a page on Pun Charms, which if applied properly could help you hear a pun in every sentence. Amaze and annoy your friends with your cleverness. She was determined to try it for her Dad when he gave her, her wand. He was the king of puns and she wanted to see if she could out smart him with the charm.<br/>
Suddenly there was a tapping at the window and she looked up in shock to see a large grey owl tapping at the glass with an envelope in its beak.<br/>
“Mother! Come quick!” She called in her mother’s native tongue, as she jumped from her chair to open the window. Both her cats jumped up too and hid behind her legs, looking curiously at the huge owl as it swooshed into the room. It circled once before landing on her shoulder and dropping the letter into her hand. She giggled as it nipped her ear lightly.<br/>
Her mother entered the room at that moment and gasped. “Where did it come from? Is it your father? Is he alright?”<br/>
Renuka’s eyes widened as she looked at the seal on the envelope. “Its from Hogwarts,” she stuttered.<br/>
She quickly tore it open before her mother could protest and scanned a letter written by Minerva Mcgonagall, welcoming her to Hogwarts and listing the items she was to bring for her first year.<br/>
“Mother, I...I thought they knew. I thought you’d told them. What does this mean?”<br/>
Her mother looked just as surprised and confused. “We did my darling, it must be a mistake. I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean for this to-”<br/>
At that moment they heard a loud pop and: “Its me, I can explain!” as Mr. Lupin burst through the front door.<br/>
He rushed in, looking a little sunburnt from his trip. His graying blonde hair was tousled, his robes in disarray.<br/>
He rushed to his daughter and pulled her into a tight hug. “Happy Birthday, my little Renuka!” he boomed in Icelandic. Then he reverted to English so her mother could understand. “A little bit of a surprise eh! I was trying to make it back before they sent the owl, but I had a few loose ends to tie up first and I see the owl has preceded me, if only by a few minutes.”<br/>
He pulled a treat out of his robes and fed it to the owl. “Thank-you kindly,” he said patting its head. And just like that it spread its wings and soared out the window.<br/>
“But...” said Mrs. Lupin, looking confused.<br/>
“I know this is a bit of a shock Rushani, but I ran in to Professor Dumbledore. He said he had been thinking for some time about a way to allow Renuka to come to Hogwarts this September. With the help of Professor McGonagall, Madam Pomphrey and some of the other professors, they built a sort of safe house for Renuka during the full moon, so she can transform in peace, so to speak. And they would be happy to let her come to Hogwarts and keep her secret so no one is the wiser. And of course this means that she can study alongside other witches and wizards her age.” Mr. Lupin was stumbling over his words looking very excited.<br/>
“Imagine,” he continued, “our daughter, a student at Hogwarts, showing them all her magical prowess. Dumbledore said it took a bit of convincing on his part, but all the professors have agreed and they will keep it quiet and aid in helping Renuka to receive a top education just like her peers.”<br/>
He was beaming down at his daughter.<br/>
Mrs. Lupin had many questions and concerns and they stayed up nearly the whole night discussing the details, but Renuka remained silent for the whole ordeal, simply breathing and taking in the information.<br/>
She would no longer be resigned to a life of seclusion. She would be learning magic with other witches and wizards her age. She did not know if she was more terrified, or more happy then she had ever been in her life.<br/>
Finally she interrupted her parents quietly. “You haven’t asked me yet if I would like to go.”<br/>
They both looked at her, surprised. “But we assumed-” they said together.<br/>
She cut them off smiling. “Of course I would like to go.” She said those words as much to convince herself and she let out a breath she thought she had been holding in for a very long time.<br/>
They both squeezed her tightly and urged her to get to bed. They would all make a trip to Diagon Alley the next day to buy all her things.</p><p>					                                      *           	                            *            	                        *</p><p>She had not been to London since before she was bitten and her parents were very nervous and jumpy. Her mother was fussing over her robes and her hair.<br/>
“I thought you might enjoy choosing a wand yourself at Ollivander’s,” Mr. Lupin said cheerfully. However, he glanced around him furtively as they walked into the bustling Alley together.<br/>
They had packed her all sorts of little herb remedies that would help calm her before and after the full moon. They also suggested all sorts of stories to cover up her disappearance. They finally decided on a ‘sick mother,' if it got so bad that she had to skip a few days of classes.  And of course they also packed her loads of chocolate, which was definitely something that kept her senses at ease before and after the transformation.<br/>
They had a wonderful time staying in a room at the Leaky Cauldron and eating out every night. It was one of the first vacations they had, had together in a long time.<br/>
Her mother encouraged her to keep up her meditation and yoga. “There is deeper magic steeped within these practices than any charm or herbal remedy,” her mother reminded her.<br/>
“And keep up your languages,” they reminded her. “We’ll write to you, so it’ll stay fresh.”<br/>
“I don’t think a few months will do any harm. I’ll be back for Christmas,” said Renuka, smiling in an exasperated sort of way.<br/>
Her father suddenly began to wipe tears from his eyes and her mother blinked furiously. It was their last night together and they were eating at a muggle Indian restaurant. The food was very good, “and authentic,” Mrs. Lupin stated proudly. Diagon Alley did not have a lot of exotic variety in its food choices.<br/>
“Oh maybe this wasn’t such a good idea. What if something happens? I can’t bear the thought of you leaving us for so long,” said her father, stifling a sob. Her mother patted him on the back. But she sniffled too. “I don’t know what I’ll do without my baby at home with me,” she said.<br/>
“You’ll have the cats with you.” Renuka tried to assure them, but to be truthful, she almost felt like crying herself. She had thought she would always live with her parents. She still could not quite imagine being without them. Even if it was only for a few months.<br/>
“I just hope you’ll make some nice friends,” said her mother, squeezing her hand.<br/>
“And I hope they won’t be too nosy,” said her father, wrapping his arm around her shoulder.</p><p>The next day she stood nervously on platform 9 and 3/4, trying to breathe deeply, counting to five very slowly, as she did during yoga. Trying not to think too hard.<br/>
Her parents were fussing and both of them were fighting back tears. They were pretty early, because her parents wanted her to get a good seat on the train before any prying eyes arrived. A lot of the witches and wizards at the ministry still thought that Mr. Lupin’s daughter had a terminal illness, so he did not want anyone asking questions.<br/>
They hugged her tightly and said their last goodbyes and her father helped hoist her heavy trunk onto the train. She found a compartment near the back of the train and put her trunk under the seat. Then she settled herself in the corner of the carriage seat with a book she had pulled out of her trunk.<br/>
She waved at her parents and watched them disappear through the barrier, just as a crowd of witches and wizards began to arrive.<br/>
Her heart was beating fast as girls and boys, her age and older, began to get onto the train. She watched as all of their parents said their goodbyes.<br/>
She felt strange watching the other parents waving tearfully. A lump was beginning to form in her throat. She buried her nose deeper into Hogwarts: A History, trying to understand the process of the sorting. Her father had explained it to her, but it was still a little hazy.<br/>
The train was getting quite full. Suddenly her carriage door burst open and three girls entered breathlessly.<br/>
“Hullo,” said the girl wearing glasses, “can we sit here?”<br/>
“Ok,” said Renuka, in the calmest voice she could muster.<br/>
“Cheers,” the girl said brightly. She resumed her ceaseless chatter to the two girls behind her as they all seated themselves. She had short, black hair like Renuka’s, except her hair stuck out at odd angles. She had beautiful black eyes and her glasses were perched on her small, elegant nose. They kept slipping as she talked excitedly.<br/>
“Too bad you can’t try out for Quidditch until second year,” she said to the other girls. “Cause I will simply die if I can’t play for Gryffindor.”<br/>
“What makes you so sure it’ll be Gryffindor?” said the other girl. She had dark brown hair that cascaded down her shoulders in beautiful waves. It was thick and shiny. Freckles dotted her pale face and her eyes were a piercing blue.<br/>
“My parents were both Gryffindors and everyone knows Gryffindor's the coolest,” said the girl with glasses.<br/>
“My mom says I’ll probably be in Hufflepuff like her,” said the third girl, looking downcast. She was blonde and very petite. Her hair was mousy and her eyes were a light brown.<br/>
"Oh cheer up Patty,” said the blue eyed girl. “At least you don’t have the grim prospect of Slytherin hanging over your head. Hufflepuff’s not so bad. I’d rather be in anything but Slytherin. My mom would screech if she heard me say that. Family bloodlines and all that rubbish.” The girl laughed loudly, looking pleased with herself. “I’d do anything to keep from turning out like my mother, or the rest of my family for that matter.”<br/>
The girl with the glasses said, “I’m sure you’ll get in to Gryffindor with me, Serena and then we can both try out for Quidditch together.”<br/>
The train began to move with a jolt. Renuka looked up from her book and gazed out the window as the platform and the train station quickly disappeared.<br/>
She turned to see all three girls staring at her curiously.<br/>
“Bit of a dry book for a day like this. You actually enjoy reading that?” asked the blue-eyed girl, suddenly addressing her.<br/>
“Yes.” Renuka smiled shyly. “I want to know as much about Hogwarts as I can before I get there. And so far it is a fascinating school with a rich history.”<br/>
The girl raised an eyebrow at her. “I see,” she said, smirking, but not in an unfriendly way. “I’m Serena Black, and this here’s Janeru Potter and Patty Pettigrew.”<br/>
“Its nice to meet you,” said Renuka, politely. There was a long pause.<br/>
“Well, what’s your name then?” Asked Janeru.<br/>
“Oh right,” said Renuka. “I’m Renuka Lupin."<br/>
“Your accent sounds foreign,” said Serena. “Are you from around here?”<br/>
“Well, my father is Icelandic and my mother is Sri Lankan, so I speak those languages a lot. But I grew up here in England.”<br/>
"Yeah same," said Janeru. "My family's Japanese and my parents like me to keep up the language. But people always ask me where I'm from and I'm like: I'm British, bitch."  She nudged Serena in the stomach.<br/>
"What?" protested Serena. "You don't have an accent like Renuka."<br/>
"I guess I'm spending too much time with you and your sloppy slang," said Janeru.<br/>
"Oi!" Serena elbowed Janeru.<br/>
Patty rolled her eyes at this exchange. "So what house do you think you’ll be sorted into?” she asked Renuka, politely.<br/>
"I don’t know,” said Renuka. "The sorting hat knows best, I suppose.”<br/>
Serena snorted, tossing her hair. “Well it better know how much I detest Slytherin.”<br/>
“I’m sure there are some fine witches and wizards in Slytherin. It can’t be all bad. There’s good and bad in every house I’m sure,” said Renuka calmly.<br/>
“Ha!” Serena looked at Renuka, her eyes blazing brightly. But she only muttered “I doubt it.” She turned away and began talking to Janeru again, Patty piped in whenever she got the chance, as the two of them went at it, debating about the best Quidditch teams.<br/>
Renuka buried her nose back in her book, still keeping her ears sharp to their conversation.<br/>
“Oi!” said Janeru, a few minutes later. “What’s your favourite Quidditch team?”<br/>
“Oh, well I’m not very familiar with the game and I don’t have a lot of interest in it. Sorry,” said Renuka.<br/>
Patty giggled at the look on both Janeru and Serena’s faces. “What?” they said in unison. “Not interested in Quidditch?” They looked incredulous.<br/>
“Too busy reading I bet,” said Serena, snorting.<br/>
“Precisely,” said Renuka, smiling at Serena. Serena rolled her eyes.<br/>
“Oh pullease,” said Janeru.<br/>
And with that they launched back into their wild discussion. Both girls were very animated, using strong ejaculations and even jumping around the carriage to dramatize their wild stories, which Renuka thought must be very exaggerated. They were talking about broomsticks now.<br/>
Renuka would have liked to gaze at the girls in wonder, as it had been so long since she had interacted with any girls her age. But she decided they would probably think it strange, so she turned back to her book. It was not quite as captivating as it had been.</p><p>They arrived at the Hogsmeade train station and all of the first years traveled by boats across the lake. The waves were crashing around them and the sky above was stirred up like a boiling cauldron threatening to spill over. Renuka caught her breath at the sight of Hogwarts.<br/>
No moving pictures in Hogwarts: A History, could have prepared her for the real thing.<br/>
She was absolutely brimming with excitement, awe, fright..............<br/>
“Hullooo Ren, Reny, RENUKA!” Serena was waving a hand in her face and tugging on her robes. “We’re here! Come on! You don’t want to miss the sorting do you?”<br/>
“Hmm what?” She was staring up at the castles’ towering battlements, but Serena’s loud voice brought her out of her trance.  “Oh no of course not,” she spluttered.
The three girls laughed at her as they followed the line of first years up to the castle.</p>
