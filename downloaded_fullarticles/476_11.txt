    <p>Prologue: Goblins VS Dumbledore.<br/>
October 31st, 1981 Diagon alley, Britain, Gringotts lobby<br/>
It was a busy day at Gringotts bank, witches and wizards were doing business as usual and goblins were acting their normal selves. This meant that they were sneering at everyone, nothing unusual. All they wanted was respect, and none of these wizards gave it to them. Gunrack, the head teller was making sure things ran as efficiently as possible because the lines were full. Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, Chief warlock of the Wizengamot and Chairperson of the International Confederation of Wizards strolled in and went to the nearest teller and slammed a forged copy of the Will of James and Lilly Potter, who had just been killed by lord Voldemort on the counter. Gunrack, seeing this, knew that something was wrong. Gringotts had already seen them 3 days ago, along with Dumbledore as witness to update it.<br/>
Calling him forward, he took notice that it did not have the official Potter seal. He sneered at him.<br/>
"What do you want?"<br/>
"Good afternoon Goblin, I am here on behalf of James and Lilly Potter, who were killed by Voldemort to execute there Will."<br/>
Hearing this, Griphook, the Potter accounts manager came over and started speaking rapidly.<br/>
**"Gunrack, this is suspicious. We need to take it to Ragnock. This is forged, anyone with common sense can see that. Wizards don't seem to have any."<br/>
"I agree. The fact that James and Lilly were here only 3 days ago and that they were friends of the nation is cause for concern."<br/>
"Yes, this wizard forgets that we are the only ones that do Wills and we have already made it official in the eyes of our bank and the ministry."*<br/>
The Goblins of course knew who he was, but they didn't care. By this point, the guards had their spears raised in a threatening way at Dumbledore. Most of them considered them personal friends and so it was unfortunate for the idiot.<br/>
**"Don't worry Gunny"*,at this he scowled, he hated that nickname.<br/>
**"I will deal with this."<br/>
"Very well and don't call me Gunny!"*<br/>
Griphook smiled on the inside, turned to Dumbledore and the guards with a severe look on his face and then yelled.<br/>
"Albus Persival Wolfric Bryan Ariana Gellert Dumbledore! Pick up that Will and follow me, now!"<br/>
Dumbledore looked furious but followed them anyway.<br/>
OOOOOO.<br/>
They went down the halls to the Director's office. Griphook knocked on the door, went inside and spoke.<br/>
**"Director, I'm sorry to disturb you like this, but we have a problem."<br/>
"What is the problem, Griphook?"<br/>
"It appears that Dumbledore is trying to forge the Will of the late James and Lilly Potter."<br/>
"Are you sure?"<br/>
"Yes, they were here only 3 days ago, and now he has come in claiming that he has to execute a clearly forged copy, it doesn't even have the Potter seal!"<br/>
Ragnock looked truly furious, he motioned Dumbledore inside and told the guards to leave and resume their normal duties.<br/>
He had never done this often, but he sealed his office doors and asked Griphook to get some biscuits and tea for Dumbledore so they could decide what action to take against him. Dumbledore had no idea what he was getting himself into.<br/>
The Potter family had been friends with the Goblin nation for a long time, and they were not going to turn against their friends willingly. Ragnock was going to do everything in his power to make Dumbledore pay for even attempting to get his hands on the Potter fortune and their heritage.<br/>
**"Ragnock, we need to do something about this, we can't let it continue."<br/>
"Yes, it appears he wants to take control, we will get permission to kick him out of Gringotts worldwide for this. At the same time, we will close any vaults of his own that he controls."*<br/>
Griphook grinned, showing sharp, pointed teeth. Ragnock snatched the forged Will from Dumbledore and peered at it with his eyes. This was fake indeed.<br/>
Meanwhile, Dumbledore was thinking.<br/>
/Oh, I think everything is fine. As long as they think that it is real, then there is nothing to worry about./<br/>
They never believed it was real from the beginning. Ragnock, Nicknamed Rag, turned to Dumbledore, summoned his guards and unsealed his doors.<br/>
?Thank you for waiting, Dumbledore. We were processing the Will and there seems to be a problem."<br/>
Dumbledore, who was starting to worry, put a smile on his face and spoke.<br/>
"What's the problem, is there anything I can do to help?"<br/>
At this, Ragnock and Griphook's faces turned deadly, Ragnock bellowed loudly for all to hear.<br/>
"How could you? You came here 3 days ago to witness the updating of the Will of the deceased James and Lilly Potter, who I might also add were friends of the Goblin nation. You also just now tried to authenticate a false Will of a Most Ancient and Noble House. Do you understand what this means?"<br/>
"Yes, but it was for the greater goodâ€¦"<br/>
"I don't care about your greater good shit old man, the fact you tried to do this means attempted line theft under British Wizarding law, attempted forgery of a Will under both and serious harm to a Most Ancient and Noble House. Essentially, what I am saying is, nothing is looking good for you at the moment."<br/>
"I am the leader of the light! No one will ever find out!"<br/>
Griphook spoke up.<br/>
"Oh, really? What if I sent this information to one of my informants? They work in the DMLE, who I'm sure would be happy to know!"<br/>
Dumbledore was beyond pissed.<br/>
/These little shits dared to treat him like this? Didn't they know who he was? He was Albus Dumbledore, leader of the light. Didn't they understand what ever he did was for the greater good?<br/>
First, they had dared mention his sister's and Gellert's name, now they dared to threaten him like this? He had had enough./<br/>
Dumbledore pulled out his wand at Griphook and said "Avada Kedavra."<br/>
The jet of green light zoomed through the air. Griphook moved just in time to avoid the killing curse, that smashed into a wall exploding it.<br/>
Ragnock came forward and took the elder wand from Dumbledore. He saw the markings on the wand and his eyes widened in shock.<br/>
**"Griphook! Look at this wand."*<br/>
Griphook was curious. He had never seen Ragnock angry, curious, and shocked at the same time. He wondered what could be so special about this wand. He came over and after seeing the markings of the wand, stone and cloak, he also was shocked.<br/>
The tail of the Three brothers was known throughout the Goblin nation and some of them believed that the Hallows were real. Today, it turned out that the doubts that the goblins had were confirmed. The deathly hallows were indeed real and if Griphook remembered correctly, Harry was the Heir of the third Peverell brother so technically, the elder wand belonged to either Harry Potter or Antioch Peverell.<br/>
"Give my wand back to me!" yelled Dumbledore in a slightly panicked voice. 'You have no idea of what wand." Ragnock interrupted. "We know that this is the elder wand and We don't think that someone like you should even be allowed near it."<br/>
Dumbledore tried his best to control his temper and asked "Why is that?<br/>
"It's because a lot of your decisions are questionable and we think that something is very wrong.<br/>
First, we start off with your Order of the Phoenix. You don't take proper action against the death-eaters. You just stun them and hand them over to the aurors who put them in Azkaban, they should be killed like the monsters they are."<br/>
"But everyone deserves a second chance!" Dumbledore interrupted. "They need to go to Azkaban, think about what they have done, and then redeem themselves."<br/>
Ragnock was very angry and he started yelling at Dumbledore.<br/>
"Shut the fuck up and listen to what I have to say! Didn't I tell you that we don't care about your grater good shit?"<br/>
Dumbledore fell silent and listened.<br/>
"Now, as I was saying. You put the death-eaters in Azkaban where Voldemort can easily break them out. What do they do after they get released? They start killing more people. If you keep that up, then eventually, the whole world will crumble.<br/>
Second thing. You already knew that there was a spy in your order.<br/>
You could have used ligilimency or veritaserum on everyone to determine who the spy really was. Why did you not do that?<br/>
Third, we find the situation about James and Lily to be very suspicious.<br/>
We were notified about the death of James and Lily just before you came. How do you know that they had died? And when did you forge a copy of the will? At the way things are going right now, I wouldn't be surprised that you deliberately set the Potter's up to die." Dumbledore's face went completely white and Ragnock's suspicions were confirmed.<br/>
"Fourth thing, in your forged will, you said three things.<br/>
1. Sirius Black was the Potter's secret keeper. In the original will, it clearly says that Peter Pettigrew is the secret keeper not Sirius Black<br/>
2. If anything happened to us then Harry is to go to the Dursleys. In the original will it clearly says that under no circumstances is Harry to be placed with my sister Petunia and her walrus of a husband. They hate Magic and we are pretty sure that they would mistreat him. Just what are you playing at? Are you seriously thinking about getting Harry abused and coming as the saviour so that he can look up to you?<br/>
3. A thousand galleons is to go to the vault of the Order of the Phoenix every month. Why is that? Voldemort has been defeated. I think that you are using the Order of the Phoenix to steal Harry Potter's money.<br/>
You are another dark lord like Tom Marvolo Riddle who calls himself Lord Voldemort.<br/>
Now, I never thought I would have to do this to any British customer of this wonderful bank, but I suppose it was going to happen at some point. Anyway, I am going to contact my cousin, Arnuk, who is the Lord of Gringotts andâ€¦"<br/>
At this, Dumbledore's face shot up and asked Ragnock if this was really necessary.<br/>
"Of course, it is, you bloody idiot! You don't seem to understand that you are in deep shit."<br/>
Ragnock beckoned his guards back in and asked them to surround him. He asked Griphook to re-seal the doors and told Dumbledore that he was going to contact Goblin control using a Non-magical, muggle, device called a Walky Talky. This one had runes on it so that you didn't have to worry if you were in range.<br/>
**"Goblin control, this is G274, we have a problem with Albus Dumbledore, the self-proclaimed leader of the light."<br/>
"G274, thank you. What has he done this time?"<br/>
"He has decided to try and tamper with the Will of the wonderful James and Lilly Potter, who were also friends of the Goblin nation. We also have reason to suspect that the whole thing was set up as well."<br/>
"G274, can you give us more information?"<br/>
"Yes, three days ago, James and Lilly Potter came in with Dumbledore as a witness to update their will. He came in today with another forged copy. The official Will has already been filed with the British Ministry as well as this bank."* Ragnock went on to explain what happened since he came in and what he wants to do.<br/>
Within five minutes, Arnuk, the Lord of Gringotts was on the scene. Ragnock showed him his memories, he also asked for Griphook's memories too.<br/>
He gave Dumbledore a look of pure disgust and hatred then started to speak.<br/>
"So, you think that you can get away with this? Attempted falsifying of the Will of a Most Ancient and Noble House, serious harm and line theft? Not only that, but trying to kill another Goblin. Probably many other things too, if what I'm being told is any indication."<br/>
Dumbledore tried to keep his temper in check, but it was proving difficult.<br/>
"I only did it forâ€¦"<br/>
Arnuk took over.<br/>
"I know, the greater good. How lovely, but I don't have time for it. Let's move on to what we are going to do with you."<br/>
Dumbledore was quietly thinking about how he could kill all the Goblins, but he was also worried about what they would do. Arnuk looked up then spoke,<br/>
"I'm sure Griphook will send that letter to his informant at the right time, but now I will sentence you for attempting to kill him.<br/>
I, Arnuk, Lord of Gringotts,, order that no more business is to be done with Albus Persival Wolfric Bryan Dumbledore at any Gringotts location around the world. Furthermore, I order that he be fitted with a blood thought and speech tracker, so that we are aware of everything that he does. His vaults, and any that he controls will be sealed and the money put into the Potter vaults. Any heirlooms that he has will be given to Aberforth Dumbledore, his brother.<br/>
Finally, his life will end by beheading immediately if he shows up unless he is asked to be at any Gringotts location for any reason.<br/>
So, I say, so mote it be."<br/>
Dumbledore was horrified. He was going to be broadcasting his thoughts and plans and there was nothing he could do about it. There was a brilliant flash of grey light, signalling that magic wanted the final part of the punishment to take place.<br/>
Griphook and a few guards surrounded Dumbledore, grabbed him by his arms and dragged him out of the bank.<br/>
Griphook also placed a spell so that he could not go blabbing to humans about the treatment he received. The last words of Dumbledore were, "One day, you will pay for this.<br/>
Before letting Dumbledore go, Griphook stabbed Dumbledore's arm with a knife and collected some of his blood in a glass vial. He used this on the ward stone of Gringotts as well as the tracker to make sure that it would work. Griphook cut his arm and placed the tracker in, sealed it, never to be opened again. There was a flash of white light before he got thrown down the steps of the bank, he picked himself up and disappeared.</p>
