    <p>Taehyung isn’t afraid of the dark. The heavy summer air settles when the sun goes down and Taehyung feels like he can finally breathe. In the dark, when he has to concentrate on navigating the rough cobblestone path overgrown with grass and weeds because the caretaker has been on vacation, Taehyung’s too preoccupied with what’s in front of him to remember the worries that plague him in the daylight.</p><p>It’s late, way past the time he was supposed to be home, but Taehyung makes the turn that carries him deeper into the cemetery. He knows this path well enough that he can navigate the potholes and knolls without much thought—he frequented this part of the cemetery long before his grandmother passed away.</p><p>The other boys call him the Grim Reaper, the weird kid who would rather hang out with dead people than play football. Despite Jungkook’s attempts to stop them, his threats only pushed the loud taunts into whispered horror stories that ward off any new transfer students from the sunny, loudmouthed kid who might just be an alien.</p><p>He’s not so sunny anymore. Not since Jungkook transferred to a boarding school in the north and his grandmother died. His teachers are concerned, but have explained away his retreat into silence as grief, grief from missing his best friend and losing his grandmother.</p><p>“Hi Mr. and Mrs. Potter.”</p><p>Taehyung kneels on the grass in front of the twin marble stones, quickly touching his forehead to the ground before sitting back on his heels.</p><p>“I’m sorry I don’t have anything for you today. I was visiting my grandma. Maybe you’ve met her by now?”</p><p>Taehyung’s eyes crinkle as he imagines his grandmother meeting the couple who filled her bedtime stories when she tucked Taehyung in at night.</p><p>“And I’m sorry if I haven’t visited in a while. Jungkook came back for the summer and he’s been showing me everything he learnt. Not <em>everything-</em>” Taehyung corrects hurriedly. “He doesn’t cast any spells because that’s <em>illegal</em>- but he shows me all of his textbooks and let me hold his <em>wand</em>.”</p><p>Taehyung leans in towards the stones, lowering his voice conspiratorially.</p><p>“He even got me a Dungbomb from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes to use on Alex when he tries to tease me again.”</p><p>Just as suddenly, Taehyung is somber again as little boys are, thoughts flitting between their ears as often as they blink.</p><p>“Jungkookie asked me if I was mad at him for going, but I told him no.”</p><p>Taehyung contemplates this.</p><p>“I’m not mad,” he decides firmly.</p><p>“Just sad.”</p><p>The boy wilts a little at the admission, shoulders bunching, curling in towards his ears.</p><p>“Mum says that being a Squib is nothing to be ashamed of because magic doesn’t make you a good person. I make me a good person,” Taehyung says slowly, twisting his fingers.</p><p>“But if I’m a Squib, I won’t get to see Jungkookie anymore. Only in the summer.” Taehyung scrunches his nose. “I miss Jungkook when he’s gone.”</p><p>Taehyung’s head snaps up when he hears a rustling behind him. There’s nobody there, only more tombstones. Taehyung shrugs away the prickle on the back of his neck and pushes himself onto his feet.</p><p>“You’re right, I should head home,” he agrees, reaching over to brush the dust off the tops of James and Lily Potter’s graves.</p><p>“I’ll be back soon,” Taehyung promises.</p><p>Taehyung hums to himself as he picks his way through the grass. The moon is bright tonight, casting its pale glow against the marble stones.</p><p>He’s almost at the main gate when he hears it again. A rustle of leaves, a twig snapping. A low growl. Taehyung freezes when the sound is answered by an even deeper rumble— a predator’s warning. The first growl comes again, this time closer to the tree line and Taehyung jumps back, heel catching on an uneven stone and falling onto his bum.</p><p>Taehyung isn’t afraid of the dark. But he’s definitely afraid of monsters that prowl at night.</p><p>Taehyung’s breathing is loud and ragged. He claps a hand over his mouth as he scooches backwards, jeans dragging in the grass. He wishes he had gone home after he’d left his grandmother’s stone. He hopes Jungkook will come visit him at his grave.</p><p>A howl startles a shriek out of Taehyung despite his attempts to be quiet and the shattered standstill kicks him into motion. He scrambles onto his feet and books it, sprinting as fast as his legs can carry him. When he turns onto the main road, there’s a crash overhead and Taehyung’s head snaps up to see the streetlamp above him explode in a shower of sparks. Taehyung doesn’t stop to wait and see if he’ll get hit by the shards of powdered glass, the chorus of howling that starts up behind him propelling him forward. But then it happens again. And again. Taehyung stares up in wonder as he runs, arms pumping to compensate for his craning neck throwing off his balance. Is this-</p><p>“Mum! Dad!” Taehyung yells as he skitters through the front door, the screen door slamming shut behind him.</p><p>“Taehyung!” his mother’s sharp voice sounds from the kitchen. “It’s almost eleven, <em>where</em> have you been?”</p><p>“Mum, Mum, I think I made the streetlamps explode!” Taehyung gushes breathlessly as he rounds the corner.</p><p>“You <em>what?</em>”</p><p>“Something was growling in the trees near the cemetery, and then something else <em>answered</em> it— they sounded like wolves, do we even have wolves here in Godric’s Hollow?” Taehyung blurts, pausing only to suck a deep breath into his aching lungs.</p><p>“Wolves don’t travel out this far,” his father frowns from the kitchen counter, his customary evening paper and mug of coffee spread out in front of him.</p><p>“I’ve never heard growling like that before!” Taehyung insists.</p><p>In the warm light of his kitchen and the normalcy of his parents having a late night snack in the kitchen, Taehyung feels a little silly for running all the way home without looking back. The chills that ran down his neck settle, taking the ability to describe the fear that lodged itself in his throat with them.</p><p>“You know better than to stay out so late, Kim Taehyung,” his mother frowns, but she strokes his hair. “I guess you’re going to have to mow the lawn after dinner tomorrow.”</p><p>Taehyung’s shoulders sag at the familiar punishment, but he cocks his head at the odd detail.</p><p>“After dinner?”</p><p>“Well, you’ll be busy tomorrow morning carrying packages in Diagon Alley,” his mother smirks.</p><p>Taehyung makes a face.</p><p>“I’m not going to follow Jungkook around and carry his parcels. I’m not a house elf.”</p><p>His parents burst into laughter and Taehyung watches in confusion as his father wipes the froth from his chin, setting his mug carefully on the kitchen counter.</p><p>“Don’t be silly, Taehyung-ah,” his mother scolds, wiping her eyes.</p><p>“Jungkook can probably carry you and all of his packages without breaking a sweat,” his father adds with a snort.</p><p>Taehyung bristles, but doesn’t protest. His father is probably right. </p><p>“Then why am I going to Diagon Alley? Mum, I told you I don’t want to go this year. Kookie knows too and he said it’s fine—”</p><p>“I know, hun,” his mother nods sympathetically. “Last year must have been hard for you, watching all the other kids preparing for their first year.”</p><p>She reaches into the drawer by the door and pulls out a heavy envelope.</p><p>Taehyung’s breath hitches when he catches sight of the familiar crest pressed into the wax seal- has stared at Jungkook’s and his parents’ until he could draw it from memory. His mother stoops, pecking him on the cheek while setting the letter in front of him.</p><p>“But this year we’re shopping for you.”</p><p>Taehyung feels his jaw unhinge as he stares at his own name shimmering across the thick parchment in emerald ink.</p><p>“Congratulations, son,” his father smiles. “You’re going to Hogwarts.”</p><p align="center">҉</p><p>“Did you really burn out every streetlamp?” Jungkook asks in awe later, as they’re having celebratory hot chocolate. Mrs. Kim had invited the Jeons over after Taehyung stopped crying.</p><p>Taehyung snorts at the foam mustache sitting unaware on his best friend’s lip.</p><p>“I’m not sure,” he shrugs. “I was too busy running for my life, but it sounded like it.”</p><p>“You were probably spooked by the caretaker’s pitbull,” Mr. Jeon hums, shooting a glance at Taehyung’s parents. Mrs. Jeon squeezes her husband’s knee gently.</p><p>“ But Rapmon <em>never</em> barks at me,” Taehyung gasps, affronted.</p><p>“Whatever it was, did you really have to explode every lightbulb?” Taehyung’s father rolls his eyes as he gets up from the couch. “I suppose I should see to it before the muggles wake up.”</p><p>“We should probably head home too,” Mrs. Jeon says, tapping Jungkook’s shoulder. “We’re going to be up pretty early tomorrow.”</p><p>“Can’t I sleep over?” Jungkook groans as his parents start fussing over the dishes on their way to the door.</p><p>“You’re seeing Taehyung in less than eight hours, Kook,” Mrs. Jeon laughs. “I’m sure you can manage.”</p><p>Jungkok grumbles, but his frown slips grudgingly when Taehyung tackles him, burying his face into Jungkook’s side.</p><p>‘G’night Kookie,” Taehyung mumbles.</p><p>Jungkook laughs, jerking away as Taehyung jabs his stomach.</p><p>“Goodnight Tae.”</p><p align="center">҉</p><p>“Jungkook,” Taehyung hisses once they’re tucked under the covers. “Where do you think I’ll be sorted?”</p><p>“Hufflepuff,” his friend answers immediately.</p><p>“Do you just not want me to room with you and embarrass you in front of all your friends?” Taehyung teases, pinching Jungkook’s cheek.</p><p>“Yes,” Jungkook huffs, smacking Taehyung’s hands away.</p><p>There’s a moment of silence as the two tussle, resulting in Jungkook’s legs wrapped around Taehyung’s middle, arms pinning Taehyung’s hands to his sides.</p><p>“Not fair,” Taehyung gasps as he fails to squirm free.</p><p>Jungkook flicks Taehyung in the forehead before releasing him, rolling back onto his side of the bed and burrowing deep into the sheets.</p><p>“But I’m being serious,” he says as Taehyung lies down beside him. “You’re my best friend, Tae. You didn’t even blink when I got my letter early, when you should have gotten yours. And you still won’t let me beat up Alex Jerkoff-”</p><p>“It’s <em>Jerkin</em>,” Taehyung chokes, smacking Jungkook on the shoulder.</p><p>“Even though he continues to make your life miserable-” Jungkook continues without pause. “You’re a Hufflepuff, Taehyung. I’ll eat my wand if the Sorting Hat sorts you anywhere else.”</p><p>Taehyung bites his lip, trying to ignore the tears welling in the corners of his eyes. He scooches over into Jungkook’s space and buries his face in the crook of his shoulder.</p><p>“Thanks, Kook.”</p><p>Jungkook moves his arm, pulling Taehyung closer and flipping him over so that his arms wrap around Taehyung’s chest. Taehyung can feel Jungkook’s soft, snuffling breaths against his neck.   </p><p>“What for?”</p><p align="center">҉</p><p>“Hi, I’m Hoseok! Welcome to Hufflepuff!” the bright-eyed third year sitting across from him in the Great Hall beams, reaching over the pumpkin pasties to shake his hand rather vigorously.</p><p>“Hi,” Taehyung blinks.</p><p>Hogwarts is…overwhelming. Taehyung thought he’d know what to expect from his parents’ photo albums, Jungkook’s animated stories and <em>Hogwarts: A History</em>, but Taehyung can’t even begin to describe how he feels actually <em>being</em> in the castle. There’s a lightness bouncing around his chest and he’s not sure if he’ll ever be able to properly catch his breath as he stares at the floating candles and the glittering stars above.</p><p><em>Enchanted ceiling</em>, Taehyung reminds himself.</p><p>It’s beautiful.</p><p>Jungkook is waving at him from the Ravenclaw table, grinning from ear to ear as they make eye contact.</p><p><em>Okay?</em> He mouths.</p><p>Taehyung shoots him a thumbs up, comforted by the familiar face.</p><p>
  <em>So okay.</em>
</p><p>And then Hoseok is grabbing his attention, introducing him to everyone at the table with a flourish.</p><p align="center">҉</p><p>Taehyung’s a little disappointed when things don’t really change. He’s not surprised, because people don’t really <em>get</em> him, but it does sting when it turns out that young witches and wizards can be just as mean as young muggles. They’re all still children, at the end of the day.</p><p>“Wait, so you’re like, a whole year older than we are, but you’re still a first year?”</p><p>“Did you flunk out or something?”</p><p>“Are you sure you’re a wizard? What if they got it wrong and you’re still a Squib? I’ve never heard of a Squib who could suddenly do magic.”</p><p>“Are you just stupid?”</p><p>Jungkook is amazing as always, but he can only do so much as a second year Ravenclaw. They see each other at mealtimes and some evenings when Jungkook doesn’t have Quidditch practice, but it’s not like they can have sleepovers like they used to. Taehyung had gotten used to it when Jungkook was away, but now that he’s <em>here</em> and they <em>still</em> can’t, it makes his chest ache something fierce. Jungkook’s popular—Hogwart’s resident celebrity as the wizard prodigy who started a year early and Ravenclaw’s darling Seeker. It’s hard for them to get a minute alone even when they are together. Taehyung’s happy for his friend, how couldn’t he be? But he misses Jungkook.</p><p>At least he has Hoseok, the third year Hufflepuff who refuses to stop sitting with him in the common room and always drags him to sit with his friends in the library. For the first two weeks, he’d walked Taehyung to all of his classes until he was sure he wouldn’t get lost. Hoseok is like sunshine. Every time he greets Taehyung in the hallways, Taehyung will feel warm inside as he waves back.</p><p>“I’ll see you at lunch, Taehyungie!” Hoseok will yell over his shoulder even as he’s rushing to the greenhouse for Herbology. There will always be at least one chocolate éclair saved for him when he gets to the Great Hall.</p><p>So Taehyung can’t complain, not really. Like his mum always says, there will always be people trying to bring you down. What’s important is that he remembers to count his blessings and hold onto them. He’s finally here at Hogwarts, after a whole year of thinking that he’d never get the chance. He’s learning <em>magic</em>, he gets to see Jungkook and he’s met Hoseok, sunshine hyung.</p><p>Taehyung tries not to think about how nice it would be to have a friend in his year. He tries not to feel lonely.</p><p> </p>
