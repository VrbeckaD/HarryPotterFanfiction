    <p>“We have to <em>hurry</em>!” Hermione shouted, tugging Ron as he cast one last lingering look at Harry, turning away from them with his small shoulders squared. With a resolute huff, he took off after Hermione, their pounding footsteps nearly drowned out by the sounds of spells and the castle crashing all around them. Somehow though, she could still hear the pounding of her heart. They were running out of time, out of time, out of time. Harry had gone to go into the forest, to try to buy them time, so that she and Ron could find the last Horcruxes and destroy them. Hermione pulled Ron with her behind a pillar just in time to avoid the jet of pulsing purple light that had been coming right for them. Given the warped scorch mark on the wall behind where they’d been standing, she didn’t want to know what that curse would’ve done. She started to peek around the corner of the pillar to fire, but she heard a strangled yell from the Death Eater as a familiar voice first shouted a Bat Bogey Hex, followed by a Stupefy. </p>
<p>“Ginny!” Ron said, jumping out from behind the pillar with his wand brandished for aid. </p>
<p>“He’s down, Ron, I’m fine,” the younger redhead said, panting as she cast a cool, assessing gaze over the pair before her eyes grew wide in realization. “Where’s Harry?” </p>
<p>When Ron just avoided her eyes, Ginny’s stare turned to Hermione, losing any calm it had once had. “Hermione, where’s Harry? He was with you two.”</p>
<p>Hermione took in a deep breath. “Ginny… He went to… to the forest. To meet… him. We have to get to the Horcruxes, <em>now</em>.” </p>
<p>For a moment Ginny trembled, seeming to sway on her feet, before she blinked several times, and seemed to pull some kind of steel from within herself as she looked past Hermione and nodded. “I’m coming with you, then. I’m helping you destroy them… destroy <em>him</em>.” </p>
<p>Ron started to protest about danger, but Hermione just started forward and grabbed each of them. “Then we need to <em>hurry</em>,” she said, gesturing behind her where the group could hear the sound of yells and footsteps pursuing them. At that, the group took off running, darting through the castle, but when their pursuers came upon the immobile, bat bogey covered form of their compatriot, the chase seemed to escalate. Jets of light were blasting at the three now, red and purple and even green. Hermione’s lungs were burning as she watched Ron’s long legs send him ahead of the group, while Ginny, clever girl, had started zig zagging back and forth across the corridor, sparing barely a moment to fire jinxes over her shoulder before she changed direction, while Hermione tried valiantly to keep up her shield. </p>
<p>They needed time, time, time, more time, they were running out of time, <em>time</em>, she was thinking, desperate, legs screaming as she pushed herself to run even faster, and then she saw, on the corridor to the side of them, a door appear. Had they—had they made it to the Room of Requirement already? She tried to think through the castle layout, but it had been changing around them as the battle raged on, and frankly she couldn’t find it within herself to care. The castle wanted to protect them, wanted to help them and repel the intruders, so she yelled out for Ginny and Ron, gesturing toward the door, deciding to trust it, trust the castle, trust <em>Hogwarts</em>. </p>
<p>Ginny flung herself to the side, opening the door as Ron turned around to swing back inside, while Hermione put all of her strength into her shields and leaped through the door. She saw just a glimpse of a room full of clocks of all shapes and sizes, cuckoo clocks, grandfather clocks, hourglasses, sundials, before the combined power of their pursuers’ curses hit the not-quite shut door and the ensuing explosion flung her across the room, right into a giant hourglass.</p>
<hr/>
<p>“Hermione?” </p>
<p>“<em>Ennervate!</em>” </p>
<p>“Wake up, Hermione!” </p>
<p>She blinked, hearing Ron’s familiar voice above her, and slowly red hair and freckles swam into view. At first, she thought she was seeing two Rons, two sets of red hair and freckles, and then she realized, as her vision started to clear, that Ginny was there too, hovering over her. </p>
<p>“Oh thank Merlin,” Ron said, visibly sagging in relief. </p>
<p>“What happened?” Hermione croaked. Her throat was sore and her voice hoarse, as if it’d been days since she’d spoken or had a drink, but that couldn’t be right, because her body was still <em>aching</em> as if she’d hit that hourglass just moments ago.</p>
<p>“We don’t quite know,” Ginny said, frowning. “We made it into this room, and we’d almost gotten the door shut when they must’ve hit us with some kind of exploding jinx, because we both remember a big crash, flying across the room, but then… we just woke up here, and the door’s still there, and we’re still alive and there’s no Death Eaters.” </p>
<p>Hermione blinked, pulling herself to a sitting position and wincing as bits of glass from the hourglass dug into her palms. Ginny, noticing, pulled Hermione’s hands over to her to begin to heal them as Hermione surveyed the room. Sure enough, the walls of the room looked intact, as did the door she <em>knew</em> she’d watched get blown up. But the clocks—some of them were broken, clearly destroyed in the blast, but even the ones that looked like they’d escaped the explosion were stopped. </p>
<p>“I… I don’t know,” Hermione said, voice trembling. It didn’t make any sense. “It has to be something to do with the castle, the castle’s protection and wards.” </p>
<p>“Well, I know one way to figure out what’s going on,” Ron said, jaw set, as he stepped towards the door and flung it open. Ginny winced, whipping her wand at the open door, just as Hermione gritted her teeth against the pain and cast a shield around them, only to pause. </p>
<p>Beyond the door was… the castle corridor. Clean, quiet. Neat and orderly. No blast marks, no crumbling stone, no shouts of pain or spells. Beside her, Hermione felt Ginny begin to tremble. </p>
<p>“Where’s Harry?” she whispered, turning to Hermione with wide eyes. “Have we… if we’ve been here through the whole battle, where’s Harry? And why are we still here?” </p>
<p>Hermione fought the urge to shiver herself, and instead tried to force her body to stay still and her mind to work, harder, faster, to just <em>think</em>. “I… I don’t think… If we’d been here during the battle, there’d be marks on the walls. There were marks there before, from us deflecting the curses. And if the Death Eaters won, they wouldn’t have spent the time cleaning up Hogwarts.” </p>
<p>“Um, guys?” Ron said, as he took a tentative step into the hall. Hermione took Ginny’s proffered hand and stood up, her muscles quivering with the effort, as they shuffled over to the corridor where Ron was standing, gaping. </p>
<p>Everything was pristine. Sure, there was the usual amount of dust and cobwebs one could expect to find in the castle, but otherwise it looked exactly like it usually did during the school year. Not a hint of battle. Hermione could even see a few of the customary suits of armor further down the corridor, in their usual positions, not called into battle by McGonagall’s spell. </p>
<p>“What in the bloody fuck is going on!” Ron suddenly yelled, dropping his wand to turn around and slam a fist into the stone wall behind them. </p>
<p>“Ron!” Hermione yelled, at precisely the same moment as she heard someone round the corner and turn down their corridor. </p>
<p>“Language! Five points from…” the person scolded, before they paused, cocking their head. “Who are you three? I don’t think I’ve ever seen you at this school before. And where are your robes?” </p>
<p>Hermione felt like ice had replaced the blood running through her veins as she took in the scene. The girl in front of them was wearing familiar robes, with a red and gold tie, but her hair was pulled back in a severe bun and the glasses she was wearing were outdated. Severely outdated. And she didn’t recognize them. She turned back to the door to the room they’d come from, only to cry out in dismay as the door shut on its own and then dissolved back into stone. </p>
<p>“No!” Ginny said, rushing over to the stone wall and pounding on it with her fist, as if it would open back up. </p>
<p>“What on earth is going on? If you’re intruders, I will have no choice but to apprehend you and take you to the Headmaster for punishment.” The girl, clearly a prefect, now that Hermione could focus and see the glinting gold pin on her robes, had pulled her wand out and was looking at them warily. </p>
<p>“Apprehend us?” Ron was glowering. “I bloody dare you,” he murmured softly, dangerously.</p>
<p>“No, no! We… we, erm,” Hermione paused, mind racing. “We got lost. We need to see Dumbledore.” She desperately hoped Dumbledore was at the school and that she wasn’t entirely off-base in her wild guesses. </p>
<p>Ron and Ginny shot her alarmed glances, but Hermione just shook her head slightly. </p>
<p>“Professor Dumbledore? Why would you need to see Professor Dumbledore?” The prefect had finally lowered her wand, but only to fold her arms across her chest and give them a fierce glare.</p>
<p>“P-Professor Dumbledore?” Ron breathed, his voice shaky. </p>
<p>Hermione felt her hand start to tremble at the confirmation of her fears and shoved it behind her to hide the shaking. “He’s expecting us. You see, we’re his, erm…” </p>
<p>“Transfer students. We’re transfer students.” Ginny cut in now, stepping forward. From close to her, Hermione could see her pulse pounding in her throat, but, bless Ginny, who was almost as good a schemer as the twins. “He’s supposed to welcome us. We’re doing a special, erm… Transfiguration study.” </p>
<p>Hermione gave her a barely perceptible nod and Ginny relaxed slightly. </p>
<p>The prefect tensed, her lips growing thin in a manner Hermione couldn’t help but feel was familiar. “He never mentioned that to me…” she said, and Hermione waited, almost holding her breath. “And you’re dressed very oddly.” </p>
<p>“We’re… We had trouble on the way in.” Hermione glanced at the dusty, bloody clothes the three of them were wearing and winced, trying to make a face that said it had been a painful experience she didn’t want to talk about. It wasn’t far off the truth.</p>
<p> Luckily, the girl didn’t seem to require anything further before she nodded sharply. “From the continent, then? Fine, I’ll take you to Dumbledore’s office, and we’ll see what he says.” She did, however, give them all an obviously suspicious glare before turning around and striding down the corridor furiously. Clearly she believed that Dumbledore would sort the three of them.</p>
<p>The trio took off after her, rushing to catch up, and clumped together tightly to speak in hushed tones. </p>
<p>“What do we do now?” </p>
<p>“I don’t know, but if anyone’ll help us it’s Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>“No, we don’t know what’s going on. We can’t trust anyone.” </p>
<p>“Anyone? We need help if we’re going to figure out what’s going on and make it back, and Dumbledore can help us.” </p>
<p>“Shush,” Hermione whispered, seeing the prefect shoot a glare over her shoulder at the whispering group. “Let me…” </p>
<p>Hermione picked up her pace, coming closer to the prefect. “So erm, what year are you?” </p>
<p>“Sixth,” the girl replied in a clipped tone. </p>
<p>Hermione frowned, as if she were thinking. “So that means when you graduate, you’ll be the class of…” </p>
<p>“1945.” The prefect was giving a Hermione a look that said she thought the girl truly daft now, but Hermione had stopped in her tracks momentarily before she shook herself and could continue walking. She slowed her pace slightly, letting herself fall into formation with Ron and Ginny again. </p>
<p>“It’s 1944, maybe 43 depending on what time of year it is,” she said, ignoring Ron’s muttered swear and Ginny’s sharp intake of breath. “Dumbledore is… I don’t know. I think we have to tell him that we’re from the future, because we’ll need his help to come up with names, papers, a way back, but… Grindelwald hasn’t been defeated yet. And this is a very different Dumbledore than the one we knew…” She mused, half to herself, as Ginny clenched her jaw. </p>
<p>“You’re right, and I don’t trust him. Him now or the one we knew. He played Harry, keeping information back, setting up a wild goose chase full of hints and clues for you guys instead of telling you what he knew.”</p>
<p>Ron shook his head. “Yeah, but he had a reason for doing all of it. I still think he’s the best chance we’ve got.”  </p>
<p>The prefect turned them down a corridor leading to the the room the three were familiar with as McGonagall’s office before knocking sharply. </p>
<p>“Moment of truth,” Ron muttered under his breath. </p>
<p>The door swung open, and Hermione fought to control her face as the door opened to reveal a man who was familiar and yet not at all—the same tall frame and twinkling blue eyes she was familiar with, but this man was lean and wiry, with auburn hair and a neatly trimmed short beard. </p>
<p>“Minerva, to what do I owe the pleasure?” </p>
<p>Hermione felt Ron jerk beside her and elbowed him sharply as she realized why that displeased expression had seemed so familiar. Minerva… McGonagall. They’d been caught and dressed down by their own professor. </p>
<p>“These…,” McGonagall said, giving them a look that let them know that she was having trouble coming up with an appropriate word in light of their ragged appearance and strange behavior, “people say they’re transfer students here to do a special Transfiguration study with you.”</p>
<p>“Er, yes, sir,” Hermione said, stepping forward, “We were hoping to speak to you in private. About getting ourselves oriented, and about our project. I, for one, am greatly looking forward to hearing your thoughts on how Morgana’s Fourth Thesis interacts with the second Principal Exception to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration.” </p>
<p>Ron made a slight choking noise next to her, and Hermione stepped on his foot rather harder than was necessary. Luckily, the young Dumbledore standing in front of her tilted his head, giving her a considering look, as the twinkle in his eye dimmed somewhat and instead grew sharp. </p>
<p>“Yes, yes, of course, please do come in. I’m so sorry for the difficult journey, and thank you, Minerva, for bringing them to me.” He gave them a broad smile that didn’t reach his eyes, and ushered the nervous teenagers into his office before giving McGonagall a nod and shutting the door in her face. </p>
<p>“Take a seat, please,” Dumbledore said upon turning around and seeing the three students still standing stiffly. They all remained standing. </p>
<p>“Morgana’s Fourth Thesis and the second Principal Exception to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration, then?”</p>
<p>Ron began to frown and opened his mouth, quite probably to say that he couldn’t do an independent study on those topics since he hadn’t the foggiest what Dumbledore was talking about, when Hermione stepped forward and nodded. Dumbledore frowned, and then waved his wand at them in a series of complicated maneuvers. When nothing happened, he seemed to relax and tilted his head, looking  at Hermione closely.</p>
<p>“So you can help us?” </p>
<p>“I can try,” Dumbledore said, leaning back against his desk and crossing his arms, his brow furrowing. “When?”</p>
<p>“1998,” Hermione answered sharply.</p>
<p>“That’s… quite some time in the future. And do you know how you came to arrive at this time? Not the usual way, I expect.” </p>
<p>Hermione frowned. “No, I’ve had experience with a Time Turner before, but this…” She paused, thinking through how best to reveal their experiences without disturbing the timeline too greatly. She had no idea if this would operate like the Time Turner, and was already incorporated into the time stream—the Time Turner was only designed to go back hours, not decades, and she’d rather not take her chances on completely ruining her own time. “In our time, Hogwarts was… under attack. We were fighting, and a room appeared. Like the Room of Requirement, but I’m not sure we were in the right place. It was full of clocks and hourglasses and timepieces, but right when we entered there was an explosion, we don’t know what spells, quite possibly Dark magic, and when we all woke up the wall was still there, the door shut, but the clocks were damaged and we were, well, now.” </p>
<p>Dumbledore’s lips thinned and his eyes grew slightly glazed as he stared off into the distance. “Very curious, Miss…?”</p>
<p>“Granger,” Hermione supplied. “Hermione Granger. And Ron and Ginny Weasley,” she added, gesturing behind her. Ron waved slightly, while Ginny just continued staring at Dumbledore, her fingers fidgeting against her thigh. </p>
<p>“And you came to me because…?”</p>
<p>Hermione frowned. Even just telling Dumbledore that they knew him in their time could harm the timeline, if he gained the knowledge that he lived until the 90s. Especially considering he had apparently not yet dueled Grindelwald. “You’re… known to us, in our time,” she said, giving him a somewhat apologetic smile. </p>
<p>“Ah, yes,” he said with a small smile back at her. “Well, one can never be too cautious with the time stream.” </p>
<p>“So can you get us back or not,” Ginny interrupted, her voice flat. </p>
<p>Dumbledore turned his stare on Ginny, any hint of a twinkle fading as he took in the blood smeared across her clothes, her squared shoulders, and the sharp intensity in her brown eyes. Hermione took in a deep breath; she hadn’t really begun to appreciate, really had time to begin to appreciate, caught up in the battle, what Ginny had been going through this year at Hogwarts. This Ginny was a soldier, and she could see Dumbledore assessing and coming to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure yet,” he said, raising one hand as Ginny started to open her mouth again. “I have many thoughts, several maybe even promising, but I will need to do further research. As your Miss Granger will attest, time travel is a delicate art in the best of circumstances, and these circumstances are not at all clear.” </p>
<p>Ginny seemed appeased, and nodded solemnly, though Hermione could see her chewing on the inside of her cheek furiously. </p>
<p>“In the meantime, we will get you settled into the school. You have conveniently arrived at the tail end of the winter holidays, so your transfer student story shouldn’t be too difficult to maintain. Now, if you’d please take a seat, I’ll need to make some arrangements for you all. Lemon drop?”</p>
