    <em>AU in which a lot of characters are still alive and well and a lot of characters went into careers that actually fit their characters. I’m feeling like this takes place before Cursed Child, even tho i love Scorpius and Al’s romance that was literally the only thing i agreed with in that book. In this AU probably the biggest thing is that Harry never became an Auror because it was time for him to chill out a bit, so he travelled around to different cities, played Quidditch professionally for a while before becoming Professor Potter, the Hot Dad whose glasses are always crooked. Like he SHOULD BE. Honestly does JK not understand her characters at all??? </em>

    <em>Also Sirius is alive, and so is Tonks but Lupin isn’t. Fred is still dead but you’ll be hearing from him sooner than you think. I honestly don’t know how many throwbacks will come up? I’m sure you’ll notice them when they do. </em>
