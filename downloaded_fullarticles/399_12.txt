    <p>
  <span>Harry woke with a start, in a blur of a hammering heart and clammy limbs and shaking fingers. Grasping for his wand in panic, he looked around the room with blurry vision for the threat that woke him, desperately patting his bedsheets as he searched for his glasses.</span>
</p><p><em><span>It was a dream</span></em><span>, he thought as his vision cleared, </span><em><span>just a really fucking accurate</span></em> <em><span>and horrifying dream</span></em><span>. In the cruel reminder that even unconscious he couldn't escape this, his dream had been filed with flashes of green light skimming orange hair and dead bodies almost holding hands and the ghost of a laugh he could still hear. </span><em><span>Fucking great. The flashbacks have already started. Yay. Fun. Exactly what I need.</span></em></p><p>
  <span>He must have slept then, he supposed, for at least a couple of hours as when he had staggered up to bed - all but held up by Ron and Hermione - the sun had just about risen casting a dull light over the wreck of the castle. Yet, the sun was streaming through the hangings of his four poster now, blinding him as, with tremendous effort, Harry managed to convince his body to stop quaking and his mind to stop racing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hadn't even managed to undress himself last night before passing out on top of his covers. He wished he had. The clothes he was wearing were gross and old and almost definitely covered in blood, most of which he wasn’t even sure belonged to him. He desperately needed a shower, to change out of these clothes, and eat. He was hungry, starving even and yet the thought of doing any of those things filled his body with dread.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The events of the last few days still hasn't fully sunk in but the weight in his chest and the effort it took to reluctantly move one foot in front of the other towards the bathroom felt like indicators of what was to come. He’d been through this before, loads of times, with Sirius and Dumbledore and Dobby, yet something felt different this time, he’d never grieved so many people at once before. Remus and Tonks and Fred and Colin, names that permeated his thoughts with every movement and made his heart skip as if falling down a trick step. He would be okay eventually, happiness would come, it had to, it would feel like hell but it would be okay in the end. One foot in front of the other, one step at a time and before he knew it he’d feel warmth again. Not now, but soon. He hoped at least. “A lot more people died this time” the voice in his head goaded, between naming the dead “and it’s all your fault.” Harry just shook his head as if the action itself could dispel the thoughts. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Absolutely not, I’m not dealing with this right now,</span>
  </em>
  <span> because right now he needed a shower, and that was that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he crossed the room, his gaze roamed to Ron’s bed where he slept, wrapped around Hermione, a mess of entangled limbs and hair. They’d at least managed to change before bed, Harry might have wondered where they got their pyjamas from, if it wasn't so much effort. The sight did however have the corners of Harry’s mouth twitching and a loving thought of </span>
  <em>
    <span>fucking finally</span>
  </em>
  <span> to cross his mind, he was glad this had happened, but that didn’t stop the feeling of sudden, painful loneliness and jealousy that hit him like a punch in the gut; because fuck, he wanted Ginny like that. Now more than ever he needed her comfort, her guiding hand, her floral scent, everything was just better with her around. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That wasn’t a possibility now though, because there was no way Ginny would want to start things up again, not after he had broken it off with her, not after he had left her for months, not after Fred. It wasn’t out of the realm of possibility that she hated him even, that she blamed him for her brother’s death and anyway he wouldn't blame her if she did. It was his fault. If only he had given himself up sooner maybe.... He shook his head again. Shower. He just needed a shower.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The hot water hurt as it ran over his body, he was more bruised than he had realised, the remaining burns from Gringotts had blistered with some even busting under the flow, there were gashes on his skin, he’d done something to his leg, there was dried blood everywhere and every muscle ached. Yet nothing compared to the pain in his chest. Having caught sight of himself in the mirror as he undressed, Harry had finally seen the effects of the curse that should have killed him. His chest was a mess; a sharp, jagged lightning scar sat right above his heart this time and the skin around it was black, he was pretty sure he had a cracked rib and the whole area hurt, badly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry cried out as the water continued to fall, forever thankful for the permanent silencing charm on the bathroom door. He found this made it easier as the water continued to clean his wounds and ran, murky down the drain. At least while he was under the shower spray the physical pain seemed to push any other thoughts to the back of his mind, he didn’t have to think about anything else except the stinging and the pain and the water running red as it washed the previous night away. He could handle this, it was tangible at least.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Leaning against the wall for support and placing his face under the water, an odd thought crossed his mind. In any other context, it might have been comical, the drastic change in the scene he was in now compared to that of a year ago, when he was interrupting his revision sessions and quidditch practises in a stance just like this, spending blissful fifteen minute bursts immersed in fantasies of a girl he thought was unattainable. Even, just once, in their few weeks together, he had gotten the real thing in the quidditch changing rooms, she’d even- </span>
  <em>
    <span>stop that. Stop thinking about that. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He screamed again, because it was the only thing he could do.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t until twenty minutes later that the water finally ran clear and Harry could will himself to move again. He still ached, maybe even more than before, but at least he’d cleaned the dried blood and dirt and sweat off himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He thought of Kreacher after redressing himself, and though sure the house elf would bring him something to eat if he asked, but was also sure that the crack associated with summoning him would most definitely wake his friends from their well deserved slumber. He’d have to venture into the common room; and so he did, adorned in his invisibility cloak for fear of bumping into anyone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He needed to eat, that’s all. He’d feel better after he’d eaten. </span>
