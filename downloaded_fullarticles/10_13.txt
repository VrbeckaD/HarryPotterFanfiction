    <p>Harry gazed around at his solemn compatriots. The lights were off, and all the curtains had been pulled shut. Everyone had arrived before the sun had risen in order to avoid arousing suspicion, and now they were twenty minutes into what promised to be an utterly demotivating discussion.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll do it,” Harry said, willing his voice not to tremble.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry,” Ron said, horror written on his face, “<em>no!</em>"</p><p> </p><p>“Harry, <em> yes,</em>” Harry said, somber. “As the office’s unofficial Chaos Manager—”</p><p> </p><p>“The only chaos you manage is jamming the paper copier whenever you come within a meter of it,” Draco muttered from across the table.</p><p> </p><p>“—I assign myself the title of the Chosen One,” Harry finished. “Unless there are any <em> other </em> volunteers,” he added, staring at Draco.</p><p> </p><p>A few people shifted uncomfortably. “We need to discuss this,” said Daphne. “Reconvene in five.”</p><p> </p><p>And then the other half of the table—HR, marketing, and accounting—pulled away into a huddle, their whispers only vaguely audible from where Harry and his other coworkers sat.</p><p> </p><p>“He’ll fire you!” Hermione said in a sharp tone. “Harry, what are you thinking?”</p><p> </p><p>“Better me than anyone else,” Harry replied.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” said Ron. “Better Malfoy than you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Learn to whisper, Weasley!” Draco called out.</p><p> </p><p>Ron crossed his arms, stubbornly rolling back in his chair, but his mouth snapped shut into a flat line.</p><p> </p><p>“You know what I don’t get,” said Ginny, “is how accounting gets along with marketing. Aren’t those two departments slated to be enemies?”</p><p> </p><p>“They’re all equally soul-sucking,” Ron said, sitting back up.</p><p> </p><p>“We can <em> still hear you</em>,” said Pansy.</p><p> </p><p>“Good!” Ron said. “You’re all soul-suckers!”</p><p> </p><p>“Anyways,” said Hermione, looking at Harry. “Are you <em> sure </em> you want to do this? No one will judge you if you change your mind.”</p><p> </p><p>“I can do this,” Harry said confidently. “How hard can it be?”</p><p> </p><p>His coworkers exchanged a dubious look, which was rude, because Harry was right <em> here, </em> and they were all visibly doubting his sanity right in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>The other half of the office adjourned their little meeting and turned back to face the rest of the room at large. It looked like they had elected Pansy, who was head of HR, as their spokesperson.</p><p> </p><p>“We have come to the conclusion that Harry is the most acceptable tribute,” said Pansy. “You have the full support of our departments in this endeavour.”</p><p> </p><p>“Great,” Ginny said. “What does that ‘support’ look like? ‘Cause if it’s anything like how long it takes you to respond to an email—”</p><p> </p><p>Harry rubbed at his face as the table dissolved into bickering. Riddle was going to be here <em> any moment now, </em> and they were all going to get yelled at for wasting time even though the regular work day still didn’t start for another two hours.</p><p> </p><p>“Listen!” Harry said, raising his voice so as to be heard above all the barbed insults that were flying back and forth. “I’m going to do this, and no one is going to get in any trouble. I <em>can</em> do this. Riddle’s not going to know what hit him.”</p>
