    <p>Voldemort looked at the package the white owl had dropped on his head and decided to find a perch on the mantel. The package had bounced off of his head, his shoulder, the arm of the chair, landing on the floor. After casting a lot of detection spells at the package, he had placed it on his desk. He slowly opened it and found a kitten staring up at him. The kitten was solid black with yellow eyes. There was a note attached.</p><p>Dear Voldie:</p><p>I know it's a little late but since I didn't know your birth date until two weeks ago, I had to find the perfect Villian Starter Kit accessory. After all, it has to be done correctly. Now, since I wasn't sure what you had already I decided to gift you with the complete kit.</p><p>1-Kitten-check</p><p>2-Lair-You will also find a deed to some land. I have enclosed the address for you. It's under a Fidelus Charm and as you can see the address is written in Parseltongue. I'm your lovely secret keeper.</p><p>3-Minions-You really need some new ones. The ones you have are idiots with the exception of a few like Lucy and Sevvie. </p><p>4-Cool toys-The twins are masterminds at creating some wonderful things. You will find a small sample enclosed.<br/>
</p><p>Voldemort noticed there was a pouch by the now purring kitten. He picked up the pouch and found a variety of potion vials. Each had a small description of what they did was written on the tag.</p><p>5-This is optional but a lot of villains have scars. No idea why but they do. Hedwig, my owl, should have dropped another package for you. Voldemort didn't see another package. "Well?" Hedwig hooted at him and using her foot pointed to the left of his desk. He peeked over the side of his desk and saw another package. After casting several spells he slowly opened it and found Muggle makeup and an instruction book on how to make scars. He picked up the book and saw a cell phone under a book. He opened it and Harry's name and number programmed into the phone.</p><p>6-Flunkie-You have Pettigrew for that. I figured unless you want a different one you were set on that. </p><p>7-Information-Call me.</p><p>Voldemort put the phone down and got an angry hoot from Hedwig. "You aren't going to leave until I call?" Hedwig bobbed her head up and down. He called Harry Potter.</p>
