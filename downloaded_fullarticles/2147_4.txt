    <p>Epilogue</p>
<p>Well, Harry didn’t mean to act like a stalker, he swears he isn’t one. It just so happens that he felt so gay that his jaw dropped when he saw this dude. </p>
<p>He saw this guy with whitish blonde hair just across from his table, Harry immediately concluded that this guy was pretty attractive just by looking at his beautiful styled hair. He tilts his head to catch a glimpse of his face and boy it looked so holy. So he decided to stare at him, memorizing his face so he could paint him later, till the beautiful boy noticed him and probably thought he was a creep. </p>
<p>So the boy stood up from his chair and left without bringing his cup of coffee. Harry being a creep stood up and followed him. </p>
<p>“I’m being stupid.” He mumbled under his breath but he was too desperate to create a painting. </p>
<p>It’s been 20 minutes, and it was getting dark; he was still following the boy like a lost puppy. The boy head for the alley and harry felt like he really needs to stop but he just can’t. </p>
<p>“Okay, who are you?” The boy faced him when they reached the alley, Harry gawked at him like a loser that he is.</p>
<p>“I um I-“ Harry stuttered while looking at the boy’s face, he had beautiful silver eyes that seemed to glow like the moonlight. “I’m harry and I don’t mean no harm you’re just-“</p>
<p>“Hot?” The boy asked with a smirk playing on his face, totally checking Harry out. </p>
<p>“Beautiful.” His face reddened, the boy was hot and he knew it. “I’m sorry I’ve been following you like a creep I-“</p>
<p>“You talk too much..” The boy shushed him, he stared at Harry, grinning he then looked at his lips “maybe, I..I can shut you up.”</p>
<p>“I—“ Harry gulped down the rising tension between them making him nervous, excited and aroused. </p>
<p>“Why were you following me?” He asked softly </p>
<p>“I wanted to paint you because you look mesmerising, attractive and hot.” Harry explained his face getting hotter “you look like an angel and-“ </p>
<p>“You’re cute.” He cuts him off and paused for a moment then asked  “Harry, can I kiss you?” </p>
<p>“Of course.” Harry said immediately without any hesitations. He felt his heart beat a thousand times faster “b-but first of all what’s your name?”</p>
<p>“So you can scream it?” He chuckled looking at Harry’s flustered state “it’s Draco.” </p>
<p>Harry just nodded and took note of his name trying to memorise it, worried that he might forget it that he totally did not expect for a pair of soft lips pressing against his. At first, he did not move his lips, drew or whatever this boy’s name was, he was such a great kisser. As he was about to kiss him back draco pulled back and smiled at him and said</p>
<p> “see you.” </p>
<p>———<br/>
The next day, Harry was a mess by means he can’t function properly. He seemed to forget how to speak and draw. Even his best friend Ron noticed and asked him why he was acting like an idiot. </p>
<p>“L-lack of sleep.” He muttered, his brain replaying the memory when draco kissed him. He covered his face and groaned, he was acting like a stupid child who just got his first kiss which is true, Draco was his first kiss. </p>
<p>“Mate, I’m concerned do you want me to take you to the clinic?” Ron asked, confused.</p>
<p>“I-it’s fine.” Harry stuttered “I’ll skip classes today and maybe rest.”</p>
<p>He did not rest at all, instead he went back to the coffee shop where he first saw the pale skinned boy. Hoping he will see him again and maybe kiss him back this time. </p>
<p>As he was ordering his usual cup of tea, he felt someone looking at him so he turned around to see a red haired girl looking at him, laughing with her friends. He just smiled and got the tea that he ordered, he sat far away from the girls and waited for draco. As time passed by he was making some homework in his laptop. </p>
<p>It was 7 pm and there was no sign of Draco, he felt disappointed and sad. Maybe, he will come around 8 or 9 pm but harry wasn’t in the mood anymore. He wanted to leave but he wanted to see his face. </p>
<p>The red haired girl approached him and shyly said hi and introduced herself</p>
<p>“I’m ginny and I’m hoping that maybe you’ll hang out with me to watch some movie?” She said </p>
<p>“Well..” he looks at her “ we don’t really know each other yet I mean I haven’t told you my name and-“</p>
<p>“You’re Harry, I know you.” She said “I’m Ron’s sister.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Harry said in a sudden realisation, he remembered ron talking to him about her little sister liking him “I just remembered ron talking about you.”</p>
<p>Ginny blushed “that’s great.. so do you want to hang out?”</p>
<p>“I’m quite busy this week and the next.” Harry explained “is it okay that we will meet up around next next week?” </p>
<p>“Yeah.” Ginny smiled and handed him her number “here’s my number, text me.” </p>
<p>After, Ginny left. Harry stood up to leave the Café and walked towards his dorm. </p>
<p>——</p>
<p>“Mr. Potter, why were you absent yesterday?” His professor asked </p>
<p>“I wasn’t feeling well, I’m sorry.” Hardy explained </p>
<p>“Did you at least make the homework I asked you to do?” She asked</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am.” He replied and took out the 3 page essay and gave it to her</p>
<p>“Good job, Mr. Potter.” She smiles “just by reading at your first sentence I can tell that you are an excellent writer.. like your father.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Harry smiled sadly </p>
<p>“You May now take your seat.” She says and harry obliged </p>
<p>“Why do you look so grim?” Hermione his other friend asked him </p>
<p>“Just remembered something awful.” Harry said “it’s nothing I feel ok now.”</p>
<p>“Hm.” She hums “Okay.”</p>
<p>The professor discussed some rules about writing a good essay while Harry’s mind drifted about the time his father died protecting him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry, listen to me you’re gonna be okay.” James said “you have your mom.” </p>
<p>“No dad don’t die.” Harry cried as he sees his dad wince in pain </p>
<p> “I won’t, the medics are coming.” James reassured him, but deep down Harry knew he wasn’t going to make it. He was bleeding too much and it was his fault if he had just been alert to their surroundings they would have been safe.</p>
<p>James sighed as he read his son’s mind and held Harry’s hand “Harry, this wasn’t your fault.. remember that I love you and I’m so proud of you.”</p>
<p>“Dad..” Harry sobbed softly “I love you too.”</p>
<p>He was 9 years old when his dad died, he failed to protect him. But he knew it wasn’t his fault he was a child back then and knew nothing about protecting himself and the people he cared about.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You okay?” Hermione asked him as she handed him a handkerchief.</p>
<p>“Yeah.” He wiped his face and said thank you to Hermione </p>
<p>“You can talk to me about it, you know.” She says </p>
<p>“Yeah, I know.” He smiles “thank you.” </p>
<p>When the classes has finally ended, Harry headed back to his dorm. As he passes by an alley he remembered the pretty boy that kissed him named Draco. he wondered where Draco was and why he didn’t give him his number. Harry sighed and looked down at his shoes, still walking down by the street. He silently hopes that he will see him again, maybe tomorrow or the following week.</p>
