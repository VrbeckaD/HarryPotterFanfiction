          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry hated the phrase: "A dirty little secret." </p><p>It wasn't what their relationship was, but it also wasn't out in open. He'd not meant for it to go on like this, and for so long. There was no easy way to do this; to come out to his friends and family. To tell them that for the past three years, several times a month, for over four hundred and fifty hours, he'd hidden himself away with Malfoy. </p><p>He knew the way Draco's breath hitched when he was going to come undone. He knew how his eyes glazed over, trying diligently not to fall asleep, but eventually giving in. </p><p>And Draco? Draco knew when Harry was in one of his moods and didn't leave him alone. </p><p>No, they weren't a dirty secret, but coming out clean was problematic for them both. Draco's name had been dragged through enough filth; Harry didn't want to contribute more. </p><p>But he couldn't wait forever. Taking in a sharp breath, Harry faced the audience. "Ladies and gentlemen. I have something to sayâ€¦" </p><p>He loved Draco.</p></div>
