I seem to be doing a lot of little one-shots.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>XXXXXXXXXX</p><p>Draco Malfoy ran a hand through his blond hair and paced, though he would deny it if anyone asked him. Afterall Malfoy's don't panic and they definitely are not scared. But in his thought Draco was scared, he was going to be playing the violin in front of a big audience. Ten years of being trained to play the violin and the piano, and now it was his big moment.</p><p>"Dear, you will do amazing!" Narcissa spoke up, after having knocked on the dressing door.</p><p>"But mother! What if they think I am lousy and don't like my playing?" Draco asked and tugged on his tie.</p><p>Smiling the Lady knelt, her dress pooling on the floor and her blonde bangs falling into her eye. "You will make them cry my love, they will be blown away, after all, Malfoy's are the best at everything," Narcissa said and straightened her son's tie and heard more applause from the auditioning room. Kissing his forehead, Lady Malfoy stood and walked to the reserved chair for her.</p><p>"Malfoy, Draco" the announcer called out and the boy put his pureblood mask on and walked forwards, his father stopping him to give him a handshake before he sat next to his mother and friends.</p><p>Back straight, head up, face blank and an air of confidence, he was better than all of the others, Draco thought over and over again.</p><p>He brought the violin to his chin looked to the judges and at their nod, he brought the bow to his stringed instrument and began.</p><p>The tune was sad and getting quicker as the seconds ticked by.</p><p>He plucked the strings at the right time, humming as quietly as he could. His face changing as he put his all into the piece he had been working on for ages.</p><p>Marching like music came out and Draco began to play like he was mad, but it was all part of the music.</p><p>"let the music take you, emotions are best when you play" his instructor: Baldor had told him so many times.</p><p>…</p><p>The music was slow with harmony, it swirled in the air, and you could practically see the notes. His posture was tilting as the boy put his heart into the music.</p><p>Notes fluidly changing and making it seem like more than one person was playing.</p><p>Judges took note of the posture, the clothes, any mistakes, and anything else they could think of. After three minutes of the music going from sad and sombre to a dark and fast tempo, did it end? The boy finishing with a big flourish of the bow.</p><p>Malfoy bowed and walked off the stage, applause following his every footstep.</p><p>…</p><p>Draco Malfoy didn't lose his cool until in the safety of his house and let out a big whoop of joy, running to his father and jumping into his arms, hugging him, and letting tears of joy to fall.</p><p>He had won first place and in second place came to a girl named Daphne Greengrass, but he didn't care. HE HAD WON! Draco felt a bit stupid for being so nervous, but Lady Luck was with him.</p><p>"I am proud of you Draco," Lucius said, and Draco's mouth hurt from smiling all day.</p><p>THE END!</p>
