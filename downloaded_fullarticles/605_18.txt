    <p>Somewhere, in a room outside of canon--perhaps even out of time--a boy with dark hair, round glasses, and a pale but distinct scar on his forehead sits in an armchair. The room is cozy and cluttered, and a record player sits on a table next to the chair. The boy finishes rifling through a box of bric-a-brac by his feet, pulling out a record. He looks up at you. </p><p>“Hello,” he says. “How are we today?” He pauses. “A little quiet? I’m feeling a little blue myself. A little anxious for no particular reason, a little sad that I should feel anxious--a little self-conscious anxiety resulting in non-specific sadness: a state that I call ‘blue.’”</p><p>He pauses to take a sip from a glass of water sitting on the table on his opposite side. “Anyway, whenever I’m feeling this way--blue--I like to take a look through some of my parents’ things. They were found in vault just last year, isn’t that exciting? So, I dug about, and what did I find, but one of my favorite shows!”</p><p>He holds up a record. The sleeve is worn, and the words “A Butterbeer Betrothal” are printed on it in big letters. </p><p>“It’s a two record set, and it tells this story about a wedding full of mishaps and mayhem. It’s wonderfully fun, and even better, its main characters have the same names as my parents! Of course, I’m sure it’s not really about them; after all, it’s a musical and it seems far too ridiculous to be true, but that coincidence must be why they loved it so much!”</p><p>He takes a second to remove the record from its sleeve and place it on the record player. “Oh, and Professor Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall are in this too! It figures, of course, they’re certainly famous figures here in the wizarding world. There’s also this guy, they keep calling him ‘The Drowsy Chaperone,’ and he sounds a little bit like Professor Snape? Except I think that he’s really drunk, and he sings a lot, and I can’t even imagine Professor Snape singing. That would be frightening.” </p><p>He sets the needle on the record and a smile lights up his face as the static clears and the overture begins. “Here we go! Oh, this show is wonderful, I’m sure you’ll all love it!”</p>
