    <p>Harry settled into his studio, a small flat on the edge of the city, where if you leaned out of the bedroom window and turned your head and squinted you could see the city skyline through the overgrown tree in the shared yard. He felt safe, the flat was small, only 500 square feet but was perfect for him… he was used to small spaces, and had always felt a bit unsteady when the rooms were large and the space felt overwhelming instead of comforting. </p>
<p>He hung art from every available place, the walls covered in his own pieces, and those of other artists, local and abroad, famous and relatively unknown. His kitchen always smelt of freshly baked bread and herbs, his bathroom held continuous remnants of herbal remedies and the smell of masculine tea tree and cedar. </p>
<p>The curtains were always open and when the wind and air were crisp, the windows as well, the flow between the front of the flat and the back, allowing for a clean breeze to blow through the mustier heaviness that set in when the hot months were afoot. </p>
<p>He spent his time studying, working and working out. Learning early on, that keeping his mind and body active was the only effective way of keeping the ghosts at bay, of keeping the gnawing anxiety quiet, of keeping the heavy regrets just a little off his shoulders. He was coming up on the end of his Defense Mastery and was beginning to admit that it would be time to enter back into the Wizarding World. </p>
<p>The Mastery required a final year of apprenticeship, and he was not willing to use his name to obtain favor. His grades though good, showed where he struggled, and his talents, though there, were also equaled out with his inability to keep calm for long enough to create anything new. A Mastery required one creation or assistance with a creation, to obtain. It was a failing he was all too aware of. </p>
<p>He penned a letter to the only person that he knew would be able to help him locate a suitable Master to train under, and sent Ares off in search of the Dowager. Letting the air escape his lungs with forced meditation techniques, he turned and set out his painting tools, he needed to get out of his mind for a bit. </p>
<p>**~~**</p>
<p>Severus was a hard man to contend with when he was in a good mood, and even more difficult all the rest of the time. The war had left him with scars that were both visible and hidden, but the weight of paranoia that he’d carried with him for more than 30 years was a weight he had lost when he was found innocent and his story had been released when the ashes had blown away and fires had died down. The Order of Merlin – First Class and Second Class, always prominently displayed on his mantel, not for the people that rarely visited, but for himself – it never hurt to remind himself that he was worth more than the constant conflagration that filled his mind with thoughts of pain and darkness. </p>
<p>His childhood home had been a place of pain during the first 20 years of his life, a place of hiding the next 20, and after the war had been a weight he’d shed with ease when the city of Cokeworth offered to purchase it to build a manufacturing plant for muggles. He’d taken the nice chunk of muggle money and had purchased a home in Oxford, and hadn’t looked back on that blight in a long time. </p>
<p>His home, a tidy three story, narrow brown brick, was older and perfect for him. Every wall that was available was lined with sturdy thick bookshelves, which were leaden with heavy tomes, books, potions, artifacts, pictures, and the occasional odd trinket. His home was exactly what he’d always wanted and nothing he didn’t. The first floor was a small kitchen with black and white tile and a large window looking out on his small garden, and a larger open den that he’d split with magic into a dining room and office space. The fire place against the farthest wall was large and gave off an abundance of heat when his bones were cold. </p>
<p>The second floor was a lab, brilliantly laid out with nary a space wasted. Originally two rooms, he had taken out the wall in the middle, built a small bathroom into the side, and created a wall of shelves and long door closets that held or hid his potions ingredients in appropriate measure. The front wall was nearly all windows and the back was built with ventilation flats that could be opened either up or down depending on the time of year and the weather outside. The floor was dark oak, and charms were built, layer on layer, for cushioning (hours on ones feet often found pain in the soles of ones feet), and protection after protection spell. </p>
<p>The third floor was his private oasis. And an oasis, no matter how trite the word was, it had become. Plush dark grey carpet, a king size four poster bed in the middle of the far wall, a dark green accent wall complimenting the lighter grey walls remaining. He had two sturdy shelves on either side of the bedroom door, with small accoutrement littering their respective place, the furniture white cedar and the ensuite built of white marble and dark black tile. The shower on one side, and claw foot bath on the other, with a small room for the facilities built into the back. The gold gilt mirror with magic inlaid was the one small nod to his new life. </p>
<p>His life was one of peace and serenity. He’d built up a well-to-do business selling potions and treating special magical ailments. He didn’t see people often, unless he chose to, and he kept to himself. Occasionally, he would be asked to come up and guest lecture at the Oxford magical potions class, and also Hogwarts, and would do so willingly, if only to see the next generation and find out if there were any promising potioneers in the next batch. </p>
<p>Life, though quiet and alone, was good, and he didn’t forget every day, how this had never been a dream, but now was a life he lived with relish. </p>
<p>**~~**</p>
<p>Minerva retrieved Harry’s letter and penned back that she would look into a couple of Masters for him, and advise him when she’d had any promising options. She’d penned a missive to Severus and asked to move their normally scheduled tea up a week and leaned back in her tall wingback chair. After nearly a decade, it appeared her two favorite boys may finally following the ties that bind to one another. She sipped her tea and wrote to Poppy and Pomona. She had some small plans to make, as it had taken this long for the strings of fate to force a move, she wasn’t going to allow the tenuous possibilities fade if strong emotions overweighed possible optimism. </p>
<p>**~~**</p>
<p>The pub was loud and the friends were plentiful. Harry having passed his last test was only an apprenticeship away from his Mastery and everyone willing to celebrate for any reason, found this to be as good as any reason to do so. He smiled and found he meant it, and sipped his ale as his friends pursued games of question and chance. The warded zone around their area of the pub allowing them, all survivors of far more than war time crimes, having been hounded by press in each their own right off and on for years, their greedy need of privacy. </p>
<p>“Oy, Harry! You’re up, truth or dare!” Seamus threw up his ale in a mix of salute and attention grabbing. </p>
<p>Harry smiled and leaned back, avoiding the slightly concerned glare of Hermione and the nudging of Ron. Both wanting him to do something completely different, for their own reasons. </p>
<p>“I believe this will be the final one of the night lads, and I’ll make it truth.” He said, downing the last of his ale and tapping the glass on the table, it disappearing with a pop to the kitchens. </p>
<p>“Harry! You know Seamus doesn’t play by the rules!!” Hermione wailed, and sat back. He ignored her, it really wouldn’t have mattered if it had been a truth or dare, Seamus would have found a way to embarrass him regardless. </p>
<p>“Alright, Hare! What was the Professor you found most attractive at Hogwarts, during our tenure there, aye?” He said, splitting a gut laughing, nearly falling back on Dean while he waited for Harry’s reveal. The wizarding variation on the common pub game, put a spell over the players causing the truth to be the only thing said or risk something happening to their skin, hair, etc. </p>
<p>He leaned forward and thought on it, his mouth quirking on the side, as he contemplated if it was worth the risk to keep the truth a secret. As it was, Ron and Hermione knew the answer, and they were both looking at him with the same level of curiosity and humor. </p>
<p>He threw some galleons on the table in payment for his part of the tab, and leaned in so that they all could hear him a smirk on his lips and a charming pink to his cheeks, “I would have to say, of all the Professors at Hogwarts, the most attractive and the one I spirited a crush on for neigh on more years than I would care to admit, was… Severus Snape.” He leaned back and laughed as a mixed bag of emotions flittered across the group. He’d not been very vocal about his preferences, and though he had been with Ginny for a couple years, they’d broken up nearly as long ago as they’d been together. He’d had his share of men in his love life as he’d had women, and lately he’d also had his share of peace and solitude. “That’s it for me then, have a good one! ‘Mione, Ron – I will see you both tomorrow.” He nodded, winked at Seamus and walked himself through the ward and towards the door. A small spring in his step and a smile on his lips. </p>
<p>He walked home, opting to avoid the possibility of splinching himself and using the air to cleanse his heavy head. His flat welcomed him like a lover after a long day, comforting and embracing him in its own personal way. He undressed as he moved through to his bathroom, no bothering to worry about the clothing that trailed after him he would do to clean in the morning before he went about his normal Sunday errands. </p>
<p>A soft tapping at the window, caused him to move over to the Juliet balcony and let in a beautiful tawny owl with a letter attached to its leg. He pet it behind it’s ears and took a bit of biscuit out of his pocket and watched as it greedily took the offering and took to the darkened blue night time skies.</p>
<p>He fell back on his bed and opened the letter, noticing immediately that it was from Minerva. </p>
<p>	“Mr. Potter, I have reached out to several contacts, and have obtained a promising possibility for you. One of the foremost Masters in DADA happens to live not too far from you, in Oxford and is willing to meet with you regarding your application for apprenticeship. I have not informed them of who you are, but did provide them all your grades and previous essays. I have had a couple of brief conversations with them, and they are most willing to meet with you. <br/>Please be advised that they are a tasking Master, but you should stand to be trained under the best. They will not be easily pleased. I have provided you a portkey that will be available for Sunday morn at 0900. <br/>Not that I feel the need to remind you of customs, but it is customary to bring something as an offering to show your honorable intent. Think well on this. </p>
<p>As always, make me proud my boy.</p>
<p>x Minerva”</p>
<p>He fell back against his pillows and sighed, the next step in his great adventure was happening in less than 12 hours. And he couldn’t be arsed to care about the enormity of it. He set his alarm and closed his eyes. He would have to gather a gift not only for his meeting tomorrow, but something to send to Minerva for her application in assisting him.</p>
<p>~~**~~</p>
<p>Severus spent the morning in his lab, getting it ready for the possible apprentice that was coming today. It had taken nearly three hours of bemoaning but Minerva had convinced him to give the nearly graduated student a chance. Though she wouldn’t share their name, or gender, or really any part of their identity, she swore to him that the student was worthy and had gone out of her way to obtain their credentials. </p>
<p>They seemed above average, if not a perfect apprentice, but if what Minerva said, was to be believed, then this pupil needed a strong hand and clear guidance to flourish. And he was blessed with the ability to be able to provide both. His potions lab was set up for a demonstration and his tables had been moved to the side. A good Defense master would be talented in all of the arts; potions, charms, arithmancy, runes, and even to a smaller degree divination. He was impressed with all of the grades for the pupil except potions, and was willing to bet that it was not the student, but the Potion professor, if all the other grades were as they were, then potions wouldn’t be as low as they were due to an inability to understand. </p>
<p>His wards tingled on the edge of his skin, and he accepted that his peace was going to be a little broken for the rest of the day. But clapped his hands together behind his back and made for the stairs, it was either going to end up for the best, or it was going to be a great disaster that he could hold over Minerva’s head for the rest of her life. Either way, it appeared it might be a win for him. </p>
<p>He was reaching the first floor landing, when a soft polite knock sounded o his door. He straightened his frame, took a deep breath, and opened the door – </p>
<p>To Harry Potter.</p>
