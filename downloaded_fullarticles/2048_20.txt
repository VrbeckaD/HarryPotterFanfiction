    <p>The crackle of the dying fire was a muffled popping noise through the threadbare blanket seven-year-old Remus had pulled over his head. Embers glowed a violent red kissed through with charcoal black, and emanated very little heat to cut through the bone chill that encased the small, one room hut.</p>
<p>Outside the snow was falling for the fifth straight day, only muffled by the overhanging trees that surrounded the little shelter that Remus and his father had holed up in when the snows had started. There didn’t seem to be any indication that they were letting up any time soon, and Remus was starting to fear that they wouldn’t be able to dig their way out after another day or two.</p>
<p>They had been trying to keep the doorway cleared, shoveling the snow out with bits of broken pots and pans that had been left to rust by the former occupant of the hut, but the snow on the far side had slowly crept over the edge of the window, a ghost peering in and waiting for them to freeze. The stores of firewood were running low.</p>
<p>Shivering, Remus pulled the blanket tighter; stiff, chubby fingers, still in the midst of losing their baby fat, slipped off the edges of the cotton twice before he finally gave up and curled up tighter. His father’s oversized jumper was tucked over his knees, tugged down to his ankles, dark green cotton starting to unspool at the edges. Bare wood dug into his joints, rail-thin limbs sharply jutting into the planks until bruises bloomed purple-blue just beneath the skin. Winter flowers burrowing deep into his sinew and taking root until spring.</p>
<p>The Northern cities were inhospitable to any Southern migrants without a winter work permit, which Remus and his father did not possess. To be caught was a likely prison sentence for both of them, and the little hunter’s hutch they had found, while remote enough to offer some safety, was not built for weathering out the cold.</p>
<p>They had been looking for someplace to suffer out the season when they realized that they were going to miss the last travel date to cross back into the South. The borders were being closed earlier each season, trying to protect against raids from the starving people in the South who knew that there was food just across the border. When they found the little hut, it was just in time as the first snow started to fall. This was now the third such storm in a matter of weeks, and Remus was starting to believe they would never move on again.</p>
<p>Remus had broken his ankle at the beginning of the dusty season, recklessly trying to climb a pear tree for the last fruits hanging on the highest, slimmest branches and it had slowed them down to the point that reaching the border gates had been an impossibility. Even at seven Remus knew it was his fault that they were freezing now; hungry and hiding in their stolen hunter's hut with no heat, thin walls and snow piling up on the inside of the windowsills like the dust of winters past. His father would never say it, may not even think it, but Remus felt it every time he shivered so hard his bones ached and his jaw locked up, teeth grinding together until his neck hurt all the way down his spine and he walked like he was seventy instead of seven.</p>
<p>Every year saw Remus and his father travelling North, to the cold country, where the rich could afford insulation and warm clothes, and it wasn’t so hot and dry that nothing grew. The jobs were more plentiful up North, or so his father said every year when they started their trek back again. And every year saw them leaving later and later, trying to earn those last few coins, before heading back South to ride out the winter. This year they hadn’t made it, and Remus was certain it was because he couldn’t walk as fast as he always could the years before. He would never say that to his father, though, for fear of having his father agree with him, so he just held it inside, poking it any time he was too cold, or his stomach growled, reminding himself not to complain when it was his own fault.</p>
<p>Inching his way closer to where the fire was barely smoldering, a hazy, suffocating cloud of soot hanging lowly over the room where he was curled in the pocket of air below it, Remus tried to hold his hands as close to the embers as he dared hoping to gain enough feeling back into them that he could properly hold the blanket closed around him.</p>
<p>Laying against the edge of the firepit his shivering slowed so that he could feel the muscle cramps just barely easing. All he wanted was to sleep for a while and forget that he was cold and hungry, but he knew it was the insidious kind of sleep, that lulled you into a calm before you froze, so he held his eyes open.</p>
<p>He was just starting to lose the battle to stay awake, however, when the door creaked open and the wind snapped inside, the air condensing as it swirled around the room nearly guttering the fire out entirely. His father blew in with it, frost forming in the edges of his hair and at the corners of his mouth where his breath had frozen. The edges of his jacket hood were frayed and the threads that were hanging in his face were frozen to his hair, frozen tendrils worming their way inside.</p>
<p>Blinking blearily, Remus heard more than saw his father stamp his feet to knock the clinging ice off at the door, the floorboards rumbling with each heavy footfall.</p>
<p>They didn’t speak, it was too cold and they were too hungry to have any extra energy to expend, but Remus watched through heavy-lidded eyes as his father put the last few pieces of wood onto the fire. Soon they would have to try and break apart the heavy bed to keep the fire burning for a while longer. It wasn’t as if it had a mattress anyway, probably sacrificed long ago to the firepit for the last person who tried to survive the winter there.</p>
<p>There were trees outside, heavy evergreens weighted down with wet snow as well as barren deciduous trees, stark and boney against the pale sky. On days when the wind was milder, and the snow was clinging to the clouds making the sky a flat white sheet of imminent precipitation, Remus would sometimes go out and gather loose branches and twigs for the fire. They didn’t have any sort of axe, however, so chopping down anything larger than what he could snap off wasn’t possible, and they were running out of loose limbs.</p>
<p>Once the fire had been coaxed into a small crackle of flames, sputtering and hissing, but maintaining itself, Remus felt a small package land in his lap. Unfurling from his fetal position, he found a small bag of dried apples and nuts almost the size of his fist. It was a small feast, and Remus felt his stomach clench just looking at it, but he didn’t open the bag. He knew from experience he could go at least two more days before he truly needed to eat, so he stuffed the bag into his trousers pocket and the curled himself back up into a ball under the blanket, and closed his eyes, trying to get as close to the flames as he could without scorching himself now that they were crackling a little bit more forcefully.</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes again, his hip so stiff from digging into the hardwood floor that he yelped out loud trying to unfurl himself; his father was nowhere to be seen, but the fire was freshly stoked and Remus had an extra blanket draped over him that he didn’t recognize. As Remus watched the dancing flames, holding out his small hands to try and feel his fingers again, he saw, at the heart of the fire, curling words, peeling off the spine of a book. He recognized the book as the one his father had been carrying with them everywhere they travelled. The one that his father had shown him as a small boy, fingers tracing lovingly over the illustrations. The only thing his father had left of his own mother and the only possession his father had ever truly cared about. Burning as kindling to keep them alive a few days longer.</p>
<p>As he watched <em>Celestial Birds</em> smoldered and curled until he could no longer make out the words, and he fell back to sleep, dreaming of fantastical plumage and soaring through the skies.</p>
<p>When Remus woke up in the morning, rubbing the half-frozen sand out of his eyes, the fire had gone out and his father was nowhere to be seen. There was a small coin purse next to Remus’ head and two more small bags of dried fruit, all wrapped up in the jacket his father had been wearing the last time Remus saw him.</p>
<p>His father never came back.</p>
