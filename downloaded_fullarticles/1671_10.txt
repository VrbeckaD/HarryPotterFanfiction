  <b>Property 1: Subservience</b>
</p><p>The mating of dragons is a complex and difficult affair, especially for the male. Female dragons are frequently twice the size of their male counterparts, and notoriously short-tempered. Therefore, draconic precum and semen, as well as the natural lubrication draconic penises produce in the early stages of mating, have evolved into essentially potent aphrodisiacs and depressants, promoting a slightly more passive state in the female while she is being mated. For humans, bereft of the extreme magical resistance inherent to dragonkind, draconic sexual fluids have a much more serious effect, causing the victim to become excessively suggestible and submissive, particularly sexually so, and creating permanent physiological changes (see property 3, below). Even being near an aroused male dragon is dangerous, as the creatures’ intense body heat leads their slick and precome to evaporate. In this state, the sexual fluids also create an intense thirst and fixation on the dragon’s genitalia.</p><p>Dragons have been known to use this suggestibility in tandem with the hypnotic traits of their eyes and low-pitch vocalizations - usually used to aid in catching prey such as cattle and ineffective on humans - and high-level problem-solving skills to get humans to do things for them, or occasionally even to create cults of sexual slaves (see the case of the Persian dragon Zahhak). Victims of this permanent effect have reported a powerful attunement to the dragon’s wishes and an ability to instinctively understand what it wants, to the point of holding conversastions. These effects are not permanent if conveyed only by precum or slick, but taking actual semen internally (via mouth, anus, vagina, injection or otherwise) cements the effects, making them irreversible by any known means. Due to this fact, dragon semen is an expensive and highly-regulated potions ingredient, mostly used in permanent mind-altering draughts, but it can also be specially treated to simply cement a potion’s effect as permanent with only minimal submissive and wanton tendencies.</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p><em> They’re mad, all of them! </em> thought Oliver Houghton to himself as he gathered his notes from the table where he’d spent the last three hours beating a group of escaped asylum patients masquerading as officials over the head with the fact that bringing in <em> nesting mothers </em> for the dragon stage of the Triwizard Tournament - and why the <em> fuck </em> did it have a stage with <em> dragons?! </em> This was a competition for <em> children! </em> - was pure insanity. In the end, he’d managed to talk them down to males, which at least were smaller than the females and far less aggressive.</p><p>

</p>
<hr/><p>It wasn’t until Ludo Bagman was home and had had a good glass of Odgen’s best firewhiskey that the idea came to him. </p><p>That administrator in the meeting had been a colossal pain in his behind, getting the rest of the officials to agree to male dragons, and to restructure the task around that instead of getting a hold of eggs. Honestly, Ludo had only been trying to get the best possible spectacle out of it! It had been genius! A clear objective, so the audience could follow, coupled with the biggest dragons possible, so much the better for the shock value and the sheer awe they could inspire. And that pencil-pusher had ruined it! Male dragons were often half the size of the females, and although at least the aspect of the singular goal could remain - dragons of both sexes liked their hoards, or so the book he’d picked up had told him - it just wouldn’t be as exciting.</p><p>Which was why he was a genius twice over for coming up with this idea: Use males in their rut. According to the old <em> Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them </em>, males getting ready to mate built up and protected their hoards zealously, for the sake of displaying to females. It was perfect!</p><p>The former Quidditch player took a self-congratulatory sip of the firewhiskey, waited for the burning sensation to calm and summoned his dictation quill. There were letters to be sent.</p>
<hr/><p>Harry’s heart sank as he saw what lay beyond the cordon of trees: Dragons.</p><p>There were four of them, all painted in dark hues by the flaring light of torches and fiery breath. The smallest, on the far side of the clearing, was as big as a van. The largest, near him, was more like a lorry. It writhed and ranged around its cage, seeming to test every inch of it for any hint of weakness. Its body was covered in spines and wicked-looking protrusions, and its scales looked hard as steel. </p><p>Then the young wizard saw something underneath the dragon; a flash of red-pink. A weakness? Perhaps something he could use, when the Task came, whatever it would be.</p><p>He crept closer, keeping hidden under the invisibility cloak and leaving Hagrid behind with Madam Maxime. As he crossed the line from forest to clearing, the dragon seemed to slow its pacing. He couldn’t tell what it was underneath the creature, though. He edged nearer. The dragon raised its head. Harry could hear the rushing air in its nostrils as it scented, then turned inexorably towards him. </p><p>The young wizard froze. The dragon’s mouth opened and he could see the fire roiling at the back of its throat. For an endless moment, he pictured the fire rushing out, incinerating him. Then it passed, and the dragon’s mouth closed. Smoke curled from its lips, and its eyes…</p><p>Its eyes were volcanoes; portals to the molten heart of the Earth. Harry found himself stepping forward again, coming within metres of the cage. The cloak caught on something on the forest floor and pulled away from him. He didn’t care. Those eyes…</p><p>The dragon reared up, baring what had been hidden beneath its - no, not its, his, definitely his - body: a cock. Harry had seen dicks before - he was on the Quidditch team; they changed together - but this was unlike any equipment a human could ever pack. Two feet long if it was an inch, ribbed along its length, with soft-looking spikes trailing down the underside and a bulbous expansion towards the base it seemed to burn red-purple in the wizard’s eyes, the axis of the world. In a daze, Harry reached out a hand to touch it.</p><p>The great dragon dick was hot and leathery-tough, like touching a leather bag filled to bursting. His fingertips trailed along the smooth, oily-damp skin. Some part of him was screaming at the rest <em> what are you doing?! </em> He paid it no mind, putting up his other hand to cup the other side of the penis. With both hand, his fingers almost touched at the base of the head. Harry swallowed, suddenly feeling parched. It was the heat, it must be, but he didn’t have any water on him. His eyes were drawn inexorably to the tip of the enormous organ, where a clear liquid was beading. </p><p>The dragon let out a low, bone-shaking hum as Harry pulled the tremendous cock down towards him so that the tip was within reach of his mouth. He licked his lips, feeling a warm flush run from tip to toe just at the <em> smell </em> of it, like copper and iron and warm firesides. His own dick was rock-hard, straining at his pants. He paid it no mind, intent on quenching his thirst. </p><p>His tongue tentatively reached out, and the flavour of the dragon’s cum exploded on his palate. It was salt and blood and treacle, and he needed <em> more </em>. Harry’s plump lips closed around the pointed tip as he suckled, tongue lapping at the slit and reaching in - the slit was big enough that he could fit almost half his tongue in if he wanted to - to get every trace of his prize. His hands kneaded at what parts of the great shaft he could reach. A firm two-handed pump was rewarded with an explosion of thick, syrupy liquid across his tongue. </p><p>The dragon purred, right next to his ear. The sound made his dick jump in his pants, straining against the material. The thought of taking a hand from the dragon’s member to tend to his own, though, never crossed his mind. Instead, he repeated the manoeuvre, bobbing his head forwards to fit more of the cock in. The cockhead was fat and almost rock-hard. With only the slightest of give to it, it filled his mouth and pressed down his tongue until he could barely even move it. The young wizard pushed forwards, swallowing the precum already in his mouth, desperate to at least get the whole head in. It was a strain to get his jaw around it without brushing teeth against the hot flesh but with a groan of triumph, he managed it, lips sealing behind the arrowed bulb while the pointed tip pressed against the back of his throat. The muscles pulsated and the young wizard felt the beginning of a gag, but another burst of clear, sweet precum rewarded him, and as he gulped it down gratefully he felt the urge subside. </p><p>The dragon purred again, the end of the sound tailing off into the beginning of a growl, and Harry got the message loud and clear. He began to run his hands up and down the creature’s dick properly, pressing and squeezing and paying special attention to the soft spines beneath, aided by the oily slick that the organ seemed to produce naturally. At the same time, Harry was taking eager advantage of every bit of space that remained in his stuffed mouth, exploring every facet and crevice of the dragon’s tremendous cockhead. It was a tapestry of tastes and textures; here smooth and firm and salty, there knobbled and sweeter. He greedily concentrated his attention, though, on the dragon’s slit, situated a little above and back from the very tip of the cock, from whence issued the thing he wanted - no<em> , needed </em> - the most of everything in the world. </p><p>Long minutes passed as the wizard did his pathetic best to service the godly organ under the growling, hissing guidance of the dragon. Slowly, the bursts of precum began to speed up, transforming from sporadic shots, each large enough to be the whole of a human man’s cum, to a constant stream, flowing down the boy’s throat and into his waiting, hungry stomach. With every gulp, Harry’s dick grew harder, his skin more flushed and his nipples more sensitive as they rubbed against his clothes. </p><p>Finally, the dragon growled fiercely and the wizard, knowing that something was coming, thrust his head as far forward as he could, feeling the cock stretch his very throat out as he furiously massaged the ribs and burning flesh of the shaft. The wizard’s lips pushed up from the raised rim of the cockhead to the second rib, anchoring there. The cock pulsed once, twice, and the last thought Harry had before the searing cum came pouring from the organ was bone-deep regret that he would never be able to fit his lips around the swelling knot at the member’s base which filled his vision.</p><p>Rushing from the dragon’s cock like water from a hose, cum filled the boy’s mouth within moments, just this side of scalding. Harry swallowed quickly, then again and again, barely able to appreciate the orgasmic taste as he tried desperately to handle the flood. His own dick burst, filling his pants with a spurt of cum, but he paid it no mind. He drank as fast as he could, but the sheer volume of seed was insurmountable. The cum struck the back of his throat with such force that his hands scrabbled for a hold where the dragon’s cock met its body. He sealed his lips around their ridge as hard as he could, but accidentally touched the dragon’s cock with his teeth.</p><p>Instantly, the dragon growled, every reverberating note promising retribution for the wizard’s sin. Shocked, Harry’s mouth-hold on the cock slipped for a moment and that was that. The force of the next cumshot blasted him off the cock and onto his back, his fingerholds proving utterly inadequate. The dragon continued to snarl as he covered the cringing wizard in his cum, penetrating through Harry’s clothes and soaking him to the bone in hot, creamy jizz. </p><p>Finally, the cumshots began to subside, though the wizard’s low, whimpering litany of <em> sorry, sorry, sorry </em> didn’t. </p><p>The dragon climbed down from where it had been holding itself, fixing the wizard with a stare as he waited for his new bitch to come back to lucidity. There was work to be done.</p>
