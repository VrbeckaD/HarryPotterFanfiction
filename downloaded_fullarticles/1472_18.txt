    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Potter, of number twelve, Grimmauld place, were proud to say that they were perfectly unexciting, thank you very much. While they weren’t the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, they kept their lives perfectly peaceful, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense anymore. Especially after the 'defeat of the dark lord' as the daily prophet so aptly puts.</p><p>Mr. Potter was a normal member of the Auror Department, with his best mate Ron Weasley cum brother-in-law. He was still as short, having never gained in height since the seventh year, although he did grow into an impressive frame on the job. Mrs. Potter was loving and red-headed and was nearly as tall as Mr. Potter, which came in very useful as she was the perfect build when she was still a chaser for the Holyhead Harpies. The Potters had three children named James, Albus and Lily, respective of age. And in their opinion they were the best children they could ever want. Together, the Weasley-Potter family was the largest most loving family and the best thing Mr. Potter could ever ask for. That and not being the media's fodder—a debatable matter but better than anything else. Everything was normal and peaceful now, no more surprises for Mr. Potter.</p><p>Nothing special happens. Nothing means monotony. Monotony is <i>good</i>. Monotony is peace. No more fuss. Unlike earlier years. Such mediocrity is almost a godsend in Harry Potter's life. Almost.</p><p>Of course things wouldn't be so easy for the boy turned man-who-lived. No. The infamous Potter Luck wouldn't allow it. Only the blind would think his life monotonous.</p><p>And <i>Merlin</i>, was Harry Potter blind.</p><p>He had to be. To turn a blind eye to the fact that the auror job was nothing if not draining, to have to face the atrocities wixen were capable of; <i>had always been capable of</i>. He had lost count on the amount times he had to submit paperwork regarding unnatural deaths and illegal activities only for them to be useless in the long run. It had grown into quite the guilty pleasure of his to commiserate over tumblers of firewhiskey the <i>irony</i> that was that during the most troubling period that was early post war, it had also been the most peaceful period Wizarding England had ever seen. Funnily enough in the brief year post-war, where instability was rampant, <i>that</i> was when the public had been on their collective best behaviour. Instead of acting out on every little inconvenience like spoiled children. Unlike now. Everyone was too busy then rebuilding what they lost to have cared much about others. </p><p>He was also blind to not see that his jealous friend never really grew out of his jealousy. Sure, it was hidden better but slip ups still happened—even with Hermione's help. One too many of those subtle jibes about missing his fame was all he needed.</p><p>And his loving wife, had oh so much love to share that he came home to squeaking mattresses and new names to learn. Both his eyes were shut so tight, his beloved Lils and James were still his beloved children. </p><p>The Weasleys, they definitely were loving. So much so that half the family were there by his side whispering sweetly as he struggled with his last few breaths. </p><p>"You poisoned me."</p><p>"We did."</p><p>"Rat poison." Ginny added, voice unable to contain her glee.</p><p>"Thought you'd like something less exciting after all that," Hermione added fondly. "I know you hated the adventures, but we hate every second we had to spend with you even more, you know."</p><p>"And now we can have all your money and seats."</p><p>"Without having to see your face."</p><p>"Oh the media will have a field day."</p><p>"Tragic death of the man-who-lived, Lady Potter widowed. Weasley family in grief. Just imagine the media attention we'll get..."</p><p>At this point, he just tuned them out in favour of taking in all the faces present. Hermione Granger. Ginevra Weasley. Ronald Weasley. Even Mrs. Weasley, no, Molly Weasley. They watched wide-eyed, taking every bit of evidence of his dying self, and he let them. <i>If they wanted to stroke themselves more, let them.</i> Faintly, he remembers the children were still at school.</p><p>'At <i>least</i>, Albus won’t have to see this.' </p><p>Then, a creak of the door catches his attention and out walked a very much still alive twinkle-eyed bastard. Albus Dumbledore. </p><p>And all the memories flashed. Of the night and the fight. <i>And the fall.</i> So much fear. And hate. And terror. And anger and—red. So much red. Red. Red. Red. <i>Liar.</i> He wanted to shout. To scream obscenities at this man. Yet, his rage-stiffened jaw refused to budge. Instead, he was reduced to glaring at the walking lump of fashion mistakes. Oh, how he regrets tarnishing his precious son with this man’s name.</p><p>"How dare you look the Headmaster like that! Have some respect <i>boy</i>!" The shrill shriek by his side reaffirmed the presence of the Weasley matriarch. Internally his snarled at the reminder of the Dursleys in her tone. </p><p>"Now, now. Molly, he's going soon, I say let him be." Dumbledore pacified, ignoring the loud huff of the woman. "Harry, my boy, you've done such a good job-" <i>Liar. Liar. Lies.</i> "-defeating Voldemort. Too good. I fear his shade might have tainted you too much.” <i>Lying fool.</i> "It's time you retire, my boy, for the greater good” the old headmaster smiled his twinkling grandfather smile as Harry seethed internally. <i>How dare he.</i></p><p>"You weren't supposed to have survived anyways." The others couldn't help but add.</p><p>"Think of it as your final sacrifice, Harry."</p><p>"And you've done it for us."</p><p><i>Lies.</i> Lying liars. Lies. Everyone lies. Including Harry Potter.</p><p>It was only because Harry Potter’s lies to himself that he was blind to all the machinations. Blind to all of the things that were so very obvious. To every thing that had happened right in front of him. </p><p>But <i>Harry </i>was not.</p><p>He simply hadn’t been for a very long time. Not since he’d made amends with the goblins regarding Gryffindor's sword and the stolen dragon.</p><p>Not since he found out.</p><p>Not that he'd done anything about it. He wanted them to continue the facade for even just a bit longer. If only to have the family he never had. He really shouldn’t have. Should have gotten out. But he was weak.</p><p>Now it was too late.</p><p>As his sight finally began to grow spotty, his magic losing the fight, he resigns himself to his fate. Being offed by the people he once loved—still loved—was poetic in a way. Then again, his life was never all that peaceful in the first place.</p><p>Breaking out of his trance of self pity, he took a final scan of the room, dully noting that the room had fallen into a lull. The occupants all leant back in their seats as they watched him die. Then out of the corner of his eyes, he saw. </p><p><i>A knotted stick, a broken ring and his beloved cloak.</i> </p><p>And that thing that held them. His thing. Shrouded in an all encompassing darkness that kept writhing. Maybe there was an instant or two where it briefly had the shape of a blackened dementor. It was always just <i>there.</i> But today it has those things. </p><p>He laughed.</p><p> A hoarse and terrible wispy wheeze between painful gasps, but a laugh nonetheless.</p><p>“Why are you laughing, my boy.” Dumbledore puzzles, more to himself than anything.</p><p>“Yeah, Potter. Why are <i>you</i> laughing?” The Ron Weasley jeered. “Gone round the bend, have you?"</p><p>“…l …”</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>“…his horcruxes… had more…"</p><p>And this got them on their toes, hanging on to his every word.</p><p>"soul than you…”</p><p>He was gone.</p><p>Just in time not to feel the punch to the jaw by his best mate.</p>
