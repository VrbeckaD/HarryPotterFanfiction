    <p class="p1" align="center"><span class="s1">(Musical Selection: </span> <span class="s1">The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1, Prelude in C Major)</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hermione Granger was having an exceptionally bad day. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">To start, she had accidentally pressed the off button on her alarm instead of hitting snooze that morning, making her supremely late to her proseminar on the Second Viennese School and launching her straight into her packed Friday without any breakfast. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Then, to make matters worse, her piano lesson with Josef had <em>not</em> gone well; he harped at her for about ten minutes about her Mozart sonata and apparent lack of progress. It was true, she had been neglecting that piece slightly during her practice sessions, but to have Josef Dušek yell at her loudly in Czech was never fun.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Now, the zipper in her evening gown seemed to be stuck and she had discovered a run in her stocking. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Glancing at the time and simultaneously hopping around her room to unstick the zipper, Hermione began to panic. The Conservatory Patrons Gala was tonight, and she was performing. She had been practicing her Bach obsessively for this evening, knowing that some of the city’s wealthiest (in her mind, snobbiest) would be gathered in Vager-Mills Hall to observe the top students from the Conservatory. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">She rifled through her sock drawer, drawing out a pair of stockings that were thankfully <em>not</em> ripped, and poked her head out into the living room.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“Harry! Could use a hand!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Her best friend practically bounced into the room, already dressed in a neat and spotless suit. Harry took one look at Hermione and understood, gently working the zipper until it loosened and secured the gown.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“You look stunning, ‘Mione,” Harry said, giving her an approving head-to-toe. “If I wasn’t gay, I’d—”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hermione interrupted. “Hit me up. Honestly, Harry, you say it every time I’m wearing something that isn’t pyjamas.” She looked in the mirror, trying to figure out how to wear her hair. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“Hey, you’re cute in your P.J’s,” Harry chuckled. “And wear your hair down, Hermione.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“I can’t. It gets in my face when I play,” she retorted, and secured the unruly curls with a hasty up-do and pin. “Now come on, we’ll be late.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">They were almost out the door when Harry ran back in to grab his scarf. Hermione, muttering something about singers and their weird particularities, called an Uber in the hallway. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">She and Harry arrived at the Conservatory at quarter to six, just as fluffy beginning-of-November snowflakes began to coat the sidewalk. Hermione shivered, wishing she had worn a warmer coat. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hermione parted ways with her best friend to go run through her concert pieces a few times before their call. The Bach was challenging, that was for sure, but Hermione let her mind and muscle memory take over, following the same patterns of repetition, over and over until she felt calm enough to go down to the green room. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry was already there, sitting down and reviewing his music, humming slightly to himself. Not wanting to disturb him, Hermione made her way over to a free chair next to Fleur Delacour, a graduate student at the Conservatory who, in Hermione’s opinion, was a bit full of her self but generally kind. Fleur was playing the fourth movement from Prokofiev’s Violin Sonata no. 2, and Hermione had heard her practicing all term. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"><em>She really is quite good</em>, she mused. The school in France that Fleur had studied at before coming to the Conservatory was one of the top in Europe. Josef had mentioned it to her when they discussed her plans after graduation in May. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Thinking about graduation sent a flurry of nerves to Hermione’s stomach. She glanced at the time, hearing the chatter of audience members outside the Hall. It was almost time for the Gala to begin, and sure enough, the voices of patrons and donors faded away as they entered to take their seats. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hermione and the other musicians glanced up when the faint voice of the Conservatory’s Head could be heard greeting the audience. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Soon enough, the concert began. Harry was a few performers ahead of her, and Hermione whispered a quick ‘toi toi toi’ (the classical musician’s version of ‘break a leg’) as he passed to go onstage. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry had been practicing Schumann’s <em>Winterreise</em> for the past year, hoping to perform it in his graduate recital, and was performing one of the songs from the cycle at the Gala. His mellow baritone could just be heard in the green room, and Hermione smiled proudly. The two had met during their first day of classes at the Conservatory, and had quickly become best friends. Sure Harry could be a bit arrogant or moody at times, but he was deeply loyal and shared Hermione’s drive and ambition. You certainly needed it in this business. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">It was time for Hermione’s set. Breathing slightly on her hands to warm the fingers, she stood at the side door to the stage. When the audience’s applause began, she stepped forward through the opened door, walked to the piano and bowed. Taking care that the bench was raised enough, Hermione took a deep breath, eyes on the keys, and began. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1" align="center">
  <span class="s1"> * * * * *</span>
</p><p class="p4"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">After the performance, audience members mingled with faculty and students in a grand side room. Hermione was chatting with Fleur and a few of the other students that had performed, sipping lightly on a glass of champagne. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"><em>Wow, the Board really went all-out on this event</em>, she thought, glancing at the lavish decorations in the room. All of this was supposed to encourage to city’s elite to donate to the Conservatory and to showcase the school’s talent. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hermione saw Harry talking to a blonde-haired boy with a pale face. She excused herself and made her way over to them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“Hey, Harry,” Hermione smiled. She was introduced to the blonde boy—Draco Malfoy, who was dressed elegantly in a green silk top. Draco was very obviously into her best friend, from the looks of it. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry congratulated Hermione on her performance, and she noticed that his eyes never looked away from Draco for long. Harry had just mentioned the after-party a few music students had organized for later that evening when she heard her name. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Josef walking towards her, alongside the Chair of the Conservatory’s Board of Directors. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“Hermione,” Josef said, “I was just telling Cornelius here that you are only graduating this spring. He thought you were at least a graduate student.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hermione smiled, turning politely to the other man, who was chuckling. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“You’re a talented performer, that’s for sure,” the Board Chair said. “In fact, Professor Dušek and I were hoping you could do us a little favour.” He motioned slightly to across the room to a woman whose back was turned to them. “Over there is the CEO of Black Industries. We’ve been trying to sign her on as a patron for some time now, but to no avail.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Josef interjected. “Ms. Black was highly complementary of your performance, Hermione. We’d like you to introduce yourself.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hermione sighed inwardly. Chatting up donors was part of being a musician, and she had been fully prepared to do so at the Gala. Her performance had taken more energy out of her than she’d realized, however, and brown-nosing to some wealthy stranger was the last thing she wanted to do. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">She smiled, though, and nodded. Before heading across the floor, Hermione drained what little was left in her glass and placed it on a table.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hermione looked in vain for the woman that had been pointed out to her and a quick survey of the room didn’t reveal the CEO of Black Industries. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"><em>Maybe she’s in the bathroom</em>, Hermione thought, <em>or maybe she’s gone home…</em></span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">A light hand at her elbow and a low voice in her ear caused her to jump slight. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“Miss Granger. Congratulations on a…<em>thrilling</em> performance.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hermione turned to meet a pair of pitch-black eyes under heavy lids. A tall, stunning woman was standing before her, with a cascade of thick, shining dark hair draping her pale face, and dressed in an extremely smart suit.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The woman took her hand off of Hermione’s elbow and extended it to shake. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“Bellatrix Black. A pleasure.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hermione took the offered hand, still staring like an idiot, then remembered her manners. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“Ms. Black, thank you for coming,” Hermione heard her own voice squeak. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The woman looked amused, and Hermione followed her gaze to realize that she was still holding her hand. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Embarrassed, Hermione let go at once, letting her hand fall down by her side. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“Please,” Ms. Black said, with laughter dancing sightly in those dark eyes, “call me Bellatrix.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Blinking rapidly, Hermione cast about for something to say.</span>
</p><p class="p5"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"> <em>C’mon, idiot! You’re supposed to get her patronage for the school.</em> </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“Well, Ms. Bl—Bellatrix, I’m pleased you enjoyed the performance. The Conservatory prides itself on—” Hermione found herself interrupted with a small laugh from the other woman.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“Oh please, Miss Granger, save your well-rehearsed speech for the other would-be-donors.” Bellatrix laughed again. “You can tell old Cornelius that he wins. If your performance tonight was anything to judge by,” here Bellatrix cocked an eyebrow and gave Hermione an appraising look, “then the school is obviously doing some good and fostering the arts… yada yada.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Bellatrix took a sip of her drink—it looked to be scotch, Hermione noticed—and stood silently, eyes locked on Hermione. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">She felt a flush spread across her cheeks at the way the older woman was looking at her, like something <em>wanted</em>. Suddenly Hermione wanted nothing more than to have this woman stare at her. Forever. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"><em>Don’t be daft, </em>she chided herself. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“Hermione!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry’s voice cut through Hermione’s train of thought. She turned to see him walking towards herself and Bellatrix with a grin. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“We’d better head out soon if we want to change before the party,” Harry mentioned to her before introducing himself to Bellatrix. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hermione racked her brains. <em>Party?</em></span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Harry caught this and rolled his eyes slightly. “The party, Hermione. At Seamus’ place?” He shook his head.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“Hermione lives in a world of her own,” Harry told Bellatrix. “Eat, sleep, play the piano. Repeat. I sometimes think she’s a music alien or something.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hermione scowled slightly, poking Harry in the ribs. “I am not an alien, thank you very much. Maybe you should follow my example and actually spend more time in a practice room.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Bellatrix observed the two with an interested look. “I know what you all do here is intense, but both of your performances were superb. It clearly pays off.” The last part was directed at Hermione. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“I’ll call an Uber when you’re ready to leave,” Harry mentioned, “It was a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Black, and thank you for attending!” He a sly look in his eye as he glanced at Bellatrix before heading off.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hermione looked at his retreating back, suddenly not interested in leaving. Her tiredness post-performance was gone, erased by whatever electric thrill had surged through her body upon meeting Bellatrix.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"><em>The party…</em> She had been planning on skipping, and practicing her usual post-performance ritual of a hot bath, peppermint tea, and lots of sleep. Hermione found that sleep was the furthest thing from her mind at this moment though. The alluring woman in front of her captured all of her interest.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"><em>Harry obvious wants me to go, though…</em> and there had been too many nights where Hermione had begged out of social gatherings to sleep or practice. Plus, she knew Harry would want to gush about Draco. Blondes were definitely his type.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Bellatrix leaned in, lightly placing her hand on Hermione’s arm. “Congratulations again on a wonderful performance, Miss Granger. You’d best not keep your friend waiting, however. Unless…” The older woman seemed to be struggling internally with something and pursed her lips. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hermione shifted slightly. Her palms felt sweaty. “Unless?” She prompted.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“Unless you’d like to join me for a drink,” the dark-haired woman asked. “Away from all…this.” Bellatrix waved her hand derisively. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hermione could’t think of something to say. Bellatrix seemed to take her silence as an answer. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“Of course, how terribly rude of me. Of course you have a party waiting. All of you deserve a little breather after tonight’s performance. I can’t imagine how stressful it must be.” The older woman was talking a bit faster, and her hand left Hermione’s arm. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">“I’d love to,” Hermione answered, some bold part of her brain speaking up. She looked up hopefully.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Bellatrix’s dark eyes sparkled. “Here’s my number,” she said, handing over a card. “My personal one, not for work. Give me a call, and I’ll see you for that drink...either tonight, or some other time.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Hermione watched as Bellatrix smiled at her then turned away. Her head felt light as air, and she gathered her things to go meet Harry and Draco outside the Hall. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">Putting on her coat, Hermione looked down at Bellatrix’s card. It was black, with raised silver words detailing a phone number and the initials B.B. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1"><em>Bellatrix Black</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p3">
  <span class="s1">The name sent a thrill through Hermione. </span>
