    <p>He doesn't know when this game started, but it came out at the oddest moments. Henri told him that it was an ice breaker they played in school to make each other laugh and he just decided to take it up a notch.  The first time was when they just finished a Star Trek marathon since she's never seen it before and held her as he watched the puffs of air displaced the hair on her face. </p>
<p>"I love you, baby. Will you smile for me?" He was met with silence as the credits rolled and a brush of her lips on his neck.</p>
<p>The next time he said it was when they were getting ready to go to a charity event last minute and she was scrambling to get ready, he slipped behind her as she was putting her earrings on and caught her eyes in the mirror.</p>
<p>"I love you, baby. Will you smile for me?" He whispered in her ear, seeing a spark of recognition of what he was doing.</p>
<p>"I love you too Tony, but I have to finish getting ready so that I won't smile for you." She pushed him off with a quick kiss, flicked her wrist and everything was sorted in seconds. He loved magic. </p>
<p>They've been together for a good 2 or 3 years now, and he accidentally found out Henri had magic when she was sick and sneezed changing her hair from her lovely auburn red to a sickly green. The soup he was holding never made it. As Tony was silently freaking out, Henri was trying to explain. Tony's mind worked a million times a minute, and the only thing that would stop Henri from freaking out was a kiss, so that's what he did.</p>
<p>"I just needed time to process, sweetheart. Can you let me do that?" She nodded with a guarded expression, oh that wouldn't do, he kissed her again slowly filling it with his love and desire, even if they've only been together for six months, he hasn't told her yet. But he has a feeling she knows. </p>
<p>"So I'm guessing you're magic is all funky because you can't control it when you're super sick?" Tony said as he held her close, the germaphobe in him didn't care about Henri being sick he just had to make her better. "Is that why you don't have electronics here? And why you won't move in with me?" With her nod, he just held her tighter and gave a loud smack on her burning forehead. "Well I can fix all of that, it's not an 'X' gene, right? It doesn't seem like one." At her dazed expression he couldn't help but fall in love with her more, did she think he was going to run for the hills, she's been the best thing that happened to him in forever. He wasn't giving that up.</p>
<p>The next time Tony said it was back from his impromptu kidnapping in Afganistan, he just got off the plane with Rhodey, and he sees her holding back her tears as she sees him coming towards her.</p>
<p>"I love you, baby, will you smile for me." He said as he held her close only to feel her shudder and silently sob into his shirt as she grabs him to make sure he's real. It's alright because he was holding her just as tight to make sure he wasn't dreaming and wake up in that God awful cave. The events that happened was a nightmare in itself; his godfather was a dickwad that orchestrated his kidnapping and selling his weapons. But after that he found out that he was suffering from palladium poisoning and didn't want to tell Henri or she'll be overly worried, so he went back to his defense mechanism of being a jackass. Drinking and throwing parties, Henri was never too jealous, but he knows she was insecure and after four years of being together, Tony knew he had an image. So when he was on lockdown for S.H.E.I.L.D. when they got him out of the donut, he found her waiting for him and everything all cleaned up as if nothing went wrong.</p>
<p>"I love you, baby. Will you smile for me?" He said as he stepped into her line of sight, she gave him a grimace and all he could think about was what the hell.</p>
<p>"I love you too, Tony. I've been pulled in for an assignment." Henri said as he noticed the bags on the other side of the couch. </p>
<p>"Wha- but you're retired, you said so. They don't need you. How long is this for?" He gripped her waist afraid if she'll disappear at that moment. </p>
<p>"I know the timing is bloody awful, Hermione called me. They said that they came across an artifact that may need my expertise." Henri said as she placed her head on his chest. </p>
<p>"No heroics and come back promise." He held her tightly.</p>
<p>"I can't promise you that, love." With that, she grabbed her bags and disappeared with a pop.</p>
<p>Months turned into a year, and he hasn't seen Henri until he sees her walk into the helicarrier in her dragonhide armor, letters and phone calls do no justice.</p>
<p>"I love you, baby. Will you smile for me." She was the one who said it as he gapped like a fish until he came to his senses and kissed the ever living shit out of her.</p>
<p>"Wha-How, sweetheart you have to give me something here." He held her tightly.</p>
<p>"Remember that artifact I got called upon, looks like we're teaming up for this one." She shrugged her shoulders, and all he could do is look at her in amazement.</p>
