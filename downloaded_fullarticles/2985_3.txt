    <p dir="ltr">"Well, I didn't expect to be here until four years ago," Logan said as he, Dicky, Andrea, and Hunter walked through the streets of New York. Although the city continued to progress as it always did, Logan couldn't help but feel that something was wrong in the city of New York.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Such as, a kid on his hoverboard sped past the Cousins, shouting, "Hey, watch where you're going, grandmas!"</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Why don't you, you stupid mudscraper!!" Hunter snapped as he glared at the kid in question. (The kid was wearing the outfit as featured in "<em>Back to the Future II</em>") After the kid left, Hunter said to his mother, "Can you believe that guy? He was so rude!"</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Indeed," said Logan. "I don't know what's wrong with kids nowadays."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"And what the heck is a Chitauri?" Dicky said as he pointed to a poster reading "<em>Remember the Chitauri</em>" and "<em>May 4, 2012</em>". The poster also had pictures of said aliens as well as the names of the people killed when the Chitauri attacked New York three years ago.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Uh, that was the "<em>Revengers</em>"," said Hunter. "You should know about that, Uncle Dicky, as we saw that movie in theaters."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Of course," said Logan. "The attack just HAD to happen in New York, didn't it?"</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Well, why not?" said Andrea. "After all, King Kong showed up here, TWICE, and I'm not even going to mention how many movies I worked on which took place in New York..."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, let's ask those kids over there about what's going on," Hunter said as he pointed to a group of children sitting around a picnic table in Central Park. One of them noticed Hunter and said, "Are you guys tourists?"</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Nope," Logan said as he stared at the boy. "We just came back here after living in Africa for a few years..."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Uh, if you're from Africa, why are you White?" Another boy said as he stared at Logan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Oh my God, Riley, you can't just ask him why he's White!" said the first boy. To Logan, he said, "I'm sorry if my friend offended you with that racist question..."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"That question isn't racist, Pepper," said a girl. "That's from "<em>Mean Girls</em>" and you know that!"</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dicky snorted as Andrea said, "Dude, you've watched that movie over 40 times, so don't even start."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Anyway," said Logan, "do you know anything about why the Chitauri showed up and attacked New York in 2012?"</p>
<p dir="ltr">"That was the "<em>Avengers</em>"," said Pepper.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Told you," said Hunter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah, that's kind of weird," said Logan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Indeed," said Dicky. "OK, this question is stupid, but I have to know..."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Know what?" said Riley.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Is Stan Lee still around?" said Dicky.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Of course," said the girl. "He's right over there." The group turned to see a familiar old man waving to them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"He's still alive?!" Andrea cried out in shock.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"That guy will outlive us all!" said Logan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hunter sighed, saying, "And what's so special about Stan Lee?"</p>
<p dir="ltr">"That guy is in almost every Marvel movie ever made," said Pepper.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"And was he in the "<em>Avengers</em>"?" said Dicky.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Yes," said Riley. "Plus, he already outlived everything that happened in <em>Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, The Avengers, Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Guardians of the Galaxy, and Thor: The Dark World</em>."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, what about the new Avengers movie?" said Pepper.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"I'm sure he's in that movie," said the girl.<br/>"Anyway, who's the president of the United States?" said Logan. "I already know that the last time we were here, George W. Bush was president..."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, didn't you hear?" said Riley.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Hear what?" said Dicky.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"America hasn't had a president since 2006," Pepper said with a frown on his face.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"What happened?" said Andrea. "Did America have a second revolution or something like that?"</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Well, some people decided that for some odd reason, America was better off being ruled by a king, so they made it so that there could be no more presidents being elected," said Pepper. "Which was a shame because we could have had a Black president by now."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"So, who is running this place now?" said Logan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"It's King Joshua Washington," said the girl. "I know, it's kind of odd with a Black man using George Washington's last name. Plus, the same people who overthrew America had made it so that only a certain group of people can be elected into office."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Plus, all positions are for life," said Riley. "But let's not worry about that; I'm sure you guys have more questions for us that don't deal with this."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Well, I take it that there isn't a "<em>Jaws 19</em>" movie coming out in theaters anytime soon?" said Dicky.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Nope, but we're getting a "<em>Jurassic World</em>" this summer," said Pepper.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Whatever, but the dinosaurs in that movie still look fake," said Hunter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"And what's up with everyone wearing those bad outfits in "<em>Back to the Future Part II</em>" and riding on those hoverboards?" said Dicky.Â </p>
<p dir="ltr">"Who knows when that happened," said Riley.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"And will the Chicago Cubs finally win the World Series?" said Logan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At this, the three children laughed as Hunter rolled his eyes in disgust. Logan, Dicky, and Andrea frowned as Pepper said, "Now you and I both know that that's never going to happen, right?"</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Wow, it looks like they're never going to win anything," said Dicky. "What a tragedy."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"And what's the most popular TV show right now?" said Hunter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Game of Thrones</em>, which my mom won't let me watch for obvious reasons," said Riley.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"What's that?" said Andrea.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Clearly, you haven't read the books by George R.R. Martin," said Dicky.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"And you have?" said Logan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"OK, now I'm confused," said Andrea. The others stared at her. "I don't know what's going on here, but something is off."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Off like how?" said Dicky.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"This isn't the United States of America anymore!!!" said Andrea.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Indeed it's not," Sean Michael Rowes said as he approached them. "It hasn't been that way since someone nearly destroyed this country almost 9 years ago and our team had to go back in time and fix the problem. You're right, Andrea; we're not in the United States anymore."</p>
<p dir="ltr">"We're not?" said Logan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"In fact, we're in Columbiana now," said Sean.</p>
