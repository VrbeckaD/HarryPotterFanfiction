  <b> Chapter 1: The Hidden Dream</b>
</p><p>It was always the same set of dreams each night. They began with her being back at the rubble of Hogwarts. The feel of the walls crumbling and shaking while her, Ron and Harry ran from room to room trying to find the last of the Horcruxes. In her dream, they always started at the Room of Requirement where Hermione would watch as Goyle shot the Killing Curse at her—’It’s that Mudblood! <em>Avada Kedavra!</em>’—and then she would turn to see Ron narrowly missing a jet of green light that Goyle then aimed at him. She always shrieked. She always cried. She always narrowly avoided death by a fraction of a second.</p><p>Even while asleep, Hermione knew what memory was going to appear next in her dream. After all, she lived through it once and dreamt of it every night since. Her body shook as silent tears fell down her cheeks.</p><p>The images of the Room of Requirement shifted in her mind and then settled on her watching Fred and Percy face off Death Eaters. She could see Fred laughing at something Percy had said, his head tipping back—’You are actually joking, Percy!’—before the air around them exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and Percy, the two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other Transfigured; and in that fragment of a moment, when danger seemed temporarily at bay, when Percy and Fred were embracing so tightly, Percy crying and apologizing, the world split itself wide open. The only thing Hermione could hear was screaming and crying. Debris and wreckage from Hogwarts, from their home, had her half buried in the corridor.</p><p>Suddenly, she felt cold air against her face and saw that where the wall to the castle had once been, she could now only see the sky. She felt Harry stirring next to her; his cheek steadily bleeding and Hermione looked down at her arm to see dirt mixed with blood running down to her fingertips. Slowly, she sat up struggling against the wreckage of the castle that had her trapped and then she heard it. It started off as a disbelieving shout before it turned into a cry that was unlike anything she had ever heard before. It was the kind of cry that ripped out your heart, an agony so strong, so gut wrenching, she had never been so scared in her life to find out who was making the noise. Why they were making the noise.</p><p>Harry grabbed her hand as they staggered over to the three redheaded men grouped together on the ground where the wall had blasted apart.</p><p>‘No — no — no!’ someone shouted. ‘No! Percy! No!’</p><p>She shivered in her sleep as the dream shifted once again. This time instead of the Hogwarts castle surrounding her, Bellatrix Lestrange’s face loomed over her own, ‘I’m going to ask you again! Where did you get this sword? Where?’ she bellowed, her dark eyes practically slits as she stabbed the knife deeper into Hermione’s skin.</p><p>'We found it — we found it — PLEASE!' She screamed. Her voice raw and eyes stinging from the tears that refused to fall. Her body shaking involuntarily from the aftershocks from the Cruciatus curse. Broken sobs escaped her lips as Bellatrix moved closer to her face, seeming to visibly delight in Hermione’s terror.</p><p>‘Are you scared, Mudblood? Are you scared of what I’m going to do to you? Scared that I’m going to kill you?’</p><p>Hermione gasped awake, heart pounding in her chest and hair sticking against her neck from the sweat she seemed to wake up to each night. She brushed away the tears from her face with the back of her hand, not wanting Ron to see that she had woken up crying again. However, he laid next to her in bed fast asleep. His bright red hair fell across his face and his gentle snoring filled the small room. Hermione smiled, shifting to her side to reach her hand out to brush the hair from his face as she waited for her heart rate to settle down.</p><p>She felt stupid still having nightmares as everyone else seemed to go about their lives as if they hadn’t been hunted down. She felt stupid still hearing Bellatrix’s words, still feeling her retched breath against her face asking if she was afraid of dying. But she didn’t die. Harry and Ron saved her. Dobby saved her. They always saved her, but never in her dreams. It was hard to imagine that it was all over. That the war they had been fighting their entire childhood was finally over. Harry, Ron and Hermione survived the war. The Golden Trio survived the hunt. Survived it all. And now, they were slowly trying to rebuild their lives in the aftermath. Harry with Ginny. Hermione with Ron.</p><p>She glanced at him again, smiling as his body twitched in his sleep until she leant forward to place a kiss on his forehead. He sighed deeply, instinctively reaching out to her, his arm wrapped around her waist bringing her closer into his body. She wished that she could talk to him about her dreams, about seeing Bellatrix, about having her arm cut open each and every night, about Percy, but Ron didn’t want to talk about it.</p><p>‘It’s over now, yeah? Can we please stop talking about it?’ he asked her the last time she brought it up. Shame and weariness distinct in his features. In a way, she understood why he never wanted to talk about Percy. It hurt too much. Fred was still dealing with his own guilt as he was standing where Percy had been moments before. But at least Fred wanted to talk to his family about it. His girlfriend, Angelina, even had him seeing a Mediwitch that specialized in trauma. But, Ron never wanted to discuss anything about the war. Never wanted to discuss anything about the deaths. Never wanted to talk about any of the events that happened to them over the past seven years. He shut down and shut Hermione out if she brought it up.</p><p>Sighing, she traced her fingertips over his mouth before lightly pressing her lips to his. She turned over, vowing to talk to Angelina in the morning about the mediwitch Fred went to see. Perhaps she should finally go see someone as well and maybe, just maybe, she’d stop dreaming about Hogwarts in ruins and Bellatrix and her scar … and Sirius Black.</p><p>Closing her eyes, Hermione drifted to sleep once more. Hoping her last dream would be pleasant like all the times before. And then, almost at once, he stood in front of her in a leather jacket, white t-shirt and dark jeans. Sirius Black seemed to be one of the only people she had met in the wizarding world that was more comfortable in muggle clothing than robes. His arms were crossed over his chest and as soon as he saw her, his mouth broke out into a wide smile.</p><p>It was like this every night, as if he was delightfully surprised that she was in his presence. His eyes wandered down her body and every part that he looked at, Hermione’s skin seemed to light up under his gaze. Curious to see what Sirius saw, she looked down at the dark purple sweater that seemed to not want to stay on her shoulders and the faded denim cut offs that seemed much too short. Every night it was the same outfit. Every night it was the same gleam in Sirius’ eyes, like he was drinking her in that Hermione couldn’t help but bask in. Every night they were in the same place, standing in what looked like a flat on Diagon Alley. She could see the twisting and turning of the road outside leading to Gringotts, the sun was beating down in the lounge where a plush red couch was pushed against a wall and a cream colored rug covered most of the hardwood beneath her bare feet.</p><p>Sirius stepped towards her, the click of his dragonhide boots against the floor was the only sound in the room. His dark hair was pulled back in a small leather band and Hermione could see the black ink of tattoos peeking out from his shirt. He was only a foot away from her now, and she tilted her head upwards to see his smokey gray eyes up close. Wondering why she never noticed when he was alive how they changed color in the light—sometimes appearing almost blue. The left side of his mouth quirked up as he looked at her, again, with something close to longing. As if he had been waiting his whole life for her.</p><p>‘Sirius?’ she whispered, not daring to speak any louder. Not wanting to wake up from this dream again. It was the only reason why she didn’t take Dreamless Sleep potion because she knew this would be taken away.</p><p>Slowly, his fingers brushed along her arm, rubbing slow circles over the scar that she hated so much. She could feel the tears building up and willed them away. Sirius placed a hand beneath her chin, running his thumb along her bottom lip before leaning in close to her ear:</p><p>‘<em>Semper Vester,</em>’ he breathed before she woke up with a startled gasp as Ron snored loudly in his sleep. Hermione’s cheeks flushed and her heart raced, but this time not from fear. She delicately removed Ron’s arm from her waist and walked to the bathroom down the hall. Turning the faucet on, she splashed cold water against her cheeks before looking at herself in the mirror. It was only a dream, she told herself. So why did she feel so incredibly guilty?</p>
