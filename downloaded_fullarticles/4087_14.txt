    <p>Harry James Potter, a rather androgynous man with emerald green eyes, raven black hair, glasses and a lightning bolt scar was, not for the first time, wondering if the deal he'd made was worth it. To escape the Wizarding World, not to mention all the witches wanting to be the next Mrs. Potter when he was <em>gay</em> thank you very much, had researched a way to get to alternate worlds, making sure <em>no one</em> could find him. If he did it at random, there was very little chance <em>anyone</em> would be a be able to find him <em>and</em> return him. He'd discovered, upon completing the ritual, that all worlds had a gatekeeper of some sort and they all had a toll to pay for safe passage into their respective realms.</p><p>The options had included, but hadn't been restricted to: becoming a woman, de-aging, losing his magic, losing one of his senses, being turned into various creatures/aliens/beings etc. He'd finally settled on eating a fruit that would take away his ability to swim. After he'd chosen, he was given information on the world he would enter. The world was largely unexplored, mostly due to the entire globe being mostly just sea. There were no continents, only islands. Large islands included, but still. This world had something called Devil Fruits, like the one he was required to eat. Anyone who'd eaten one would never again be able to swim and would be weakened by sea water and a mineral called Sea Stone. The world contained mostly civilians, Marines and Pirates. Harry would keep from judging until he actually encountered either. He knew personally just how corrupt the Government could become. Once he heard about the Celestial Dragons, he was leaning towards interacting with Pirates rather than Marines. As long as they weren't being stereotypical bad guys.</p><p>The fruit he'd been given was the Paramecia Haha Haha no Mi, the Mother Mother Fruit. It gave him the ability of compelling people to see him as their mother. Or at the very least <em>a</em> mother. He wasn't exactly sure how it worked. It also gave the eater the ability to never miscarry and, were the eater male, gave them the ability to actually <em>bear</em> children. Unfortunately it also made him look feminine. Well, he'd never liked his looks anyway, so it wasn't all bad. So long as no one commented on it. He didn't like his masculinity being questioned. Just because he actually liked the thought of bearing his own children with whomever he chose to start a family with <em>did not</em> make him a woman.</p><p>He didn't mind being a mother, so long as people didn't mistake him for a woman. Unfortunately, ever since he'd entered this world, this had happened many times. He was not transgender, dammit. If he was transgender, he'd be flattered and feel confident in his own skin by people calling him “miss”, but since he was not, it only added fuel to the fire. He was self-conscious enough without people battering at his masculinity.</p><p>He soon also found out about the slavers and the Devil Fruit enthusiasts. Even worse, he encountered a combination of both, which was how he'd ended up in his current predicament. Locked in the hold of a slaver ship with seastone shackles keeping him weak and disoriented. He wasn't sure how, but someone had figured out his fruit and had seen a way to make profit. He wasn't sure how long he'd been in the hold, but he knew they were nearing the Sabaody archipelago, where he'd be sold to whatever sick fuck decided he was pretty and had enough money to throw around.</p><p>Harry was once again sitting curled up in a corner in his own piece of personal Hell when he heard the footsteps. It wasn't that unusual, really, he got a daily portion of water and sub-par food. Except, he could also hear someone mouthing off and the tell-tale clinking of chains.</p><p>Another victim, then.</p><p>A raven-haired teen wearing a yellow button-up shirt that was open, black shorts and an orange cowboy hat was thrown in, a smile firmly on his face “That all you got?”</p><p>The answer to that question was the cell door slamming shut.</p><p>“Well, screw you too!”</p><p>Harry couldn't help the snort that left him, causing his cell-mate to look at him and blink.</p><p>“Oh, hi. Any idea why we're in here?” the raven asked the elder, a cocky smirk firmly on his face.</p><p>Harry's own smile dropped and he curled into a tighter ball “They're slavers. And Devil Fruit enthusiasts. I'm here because someone recognized my Devil Fruit and thought they could make a pretty penny out of me. You're probably here for the same reason, if those seastone cuffs are any indication.”</p><p>The teen's expression darkened before he smiled “Don't worry, these guys won't get far, my brothers will get us out of here.”</p><p>Harry looked up, arms now crossed on top of his knees “You have a lot of faith in them?”</p><p>The freckled teen grinned wider “You have no idea who I am or which crew I belong to, do you?”</p><p>The emerald-eyed man shook his head “I don't remember much about anything before I woke up on some island in the first half of the Grand Line. Care to enlighten me?”</p><p>The now confirmed pirate settled himself against the wall, one of his arms resting on a bent knee as the other tilted his cowboy hat up “Portgas D. Ace, of the Whitebeard Pirates.”</p><p>Harry's eyes widened, he'd heard of Whitebeard. It was hard not to, what with the man bearing the title of 'Strongest Man in the World' and Harry could respect the man if for nothing else then for viewing his crew as family. He wanted a big family too, but he would never achieve one the size of the Whitebeard Pirates.</p><p>“Whoa.”</p><p>Ace just grinned.</p><p>Harry hummed before asking “You wouldn't happen to have any wire or something like that on you?”</p><p>The teen eyed him weirdly before going through his pockets “Maybe, why?”</p><p>Harry shrugged “I know how to pick locks, but my lockpicks were... let's just say they were <em>very</em> thorough when searching me for anything I could use to escape.”</p><p>Ace frowned darkly, obviously catching on to what he <em>wasn't</em> saying. He finally fished out a bundle of hairpins and tossed them over to Harry. The young looking man raised an eyebrow but didn't comment and instead began to work on one of his cuffs. Ace had stolen the pins from Izo and was glad he had. Maybe he should learn how to pick locks too. Once Harry had gotten one of his shackles open he stood up and walked over to Ace, starting on his.</p><p>Ace eyed him weirdly “Why didn't you open both of them?”</p><p>Harry didn't even glance at him as he answered “My powers are a kind of mental suggestion and have been locked away for... a while, which would make them hard to control at the moment and I'd rather not accidentally incapacitate you. I'll take these off once there's no chance of getting recaptured. I might be weakened, but I have also built up a sort of tolerance for seastone and I can move much better than before. Not to mention, with the mineral being so hard, it will make a great way for me to block sharp objects coming my way. And possibly bullets.”</p><p>Ace eyed him skeptically, but didn't protest and grinned once both shackles had clicked open, making his body roar to life, flames flickering in a more subdued way than he'd probably like, but... </p><p>Harry appreciated not being burnt.</p><p>Said raven-haired man jerked his head in the direction of the door “Come on, let's blow this joint.”</p><p>The Logia grinned as he stood up, holding a flaming hand in front of himself, pointed towards the door “With pleasure.” and then the air in front of him exploded.</p>
