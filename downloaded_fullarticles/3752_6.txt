    <p>Astoria Greengrass opened the door to her flat with a tired sigh.  As much as she enjoyed her new job as a photographer for the Daily Prophet, the hours were much longer than she'd worked at Eeylops Owl Emporium.  It had been especially draining over the past week, with one Ministry function after another that her boss had assigned her.</p>
<p>What she needed right now was some stress relief.  She briefly considered popping in unannounced at the Potter residence.  She had a standing invitation to show up any time she pleased, a privilege that wasn't even granted to Ron, Hermione or Tracey.  (Their exclusion had nothing to do with any lack of trust though.  It was simply so their friends wouldn't accidentally walk in on something obscene.  That wasn't a concern with Astoria.  She'd seen it all, and joined in plenty of times.)</p>
<p>Regretfully, she discarded the idea.  As tempting as the thought was, Harry and Daphne had only gotten back from their honeymoon yesterday.  She'd give the newlyweds their space for a few days longer, after which they'd damn well better be ready to make up for lost time.</p>
<p>She tossed her purse on the kitchen table and slipped off her shoes before walking into her bedroom, where she planned on rubbing out a quick one and then hopefully getting to sleep without too much trouble.  She almost shrieked in surprise when she realized her bed was already occupied, but the shock immediately turned to delight once her brain fully processed the sight.</p>
<p>Harry Potter, her new brother-in-law as of two weeks ago, was nude on her bed.  That vision, though every bit as wonderful as it had always been, wasn't uncommon.  What was new was the fact that he was flat on his back, his hands bound above his head by what appeared to be some kind of rope.  He picked his head up off the pillow as she walked in and gave her a sheepish smile.</p>
<p>"Welcome home, Astoria," he said.</p>
<p>"I guess I could say the same to you," she said.  "I'd ask how your honeymoon was, but now doesn't really feel like the time to chitchat, what with you laying here bound and naked in my bed and all."</p>
<p>"Daph and I figured you'd be waiting to greet us yesterday when we got back.  Honestly, we were kind of disappointed when you weren't," he said with a frown.</p>
<p>"I assumed you guys would want your space for a few days.  You know, newlyweds and all."  She began stripping off her clothes as she talked, because let's face it, this night was only going to end one way.</p>
<p>"Daphne thought that might be the reason.  That's why she sent me over here to wait for you and show you how wrong you are."</p>
<p>"How considerate of her," Astoria said.  She meant it.  After all these months of being a happily willing participant in...well, in <i>whatever</i> it was she had with Harry and her sister, going over two weeks without getting laid felt more like two years.  Daphne couldn't have given her a better present than her brother-in-law, naked in her bed and ready for her.  She would sincerely thank her the next time she saw her.  But right now, there were more important matters to attend to.</p>
<p>The moment she'd gotten her bra and panties off, she climbed onto the bed and straddled Harry.  There was no need for foreplay; he'd been ready before she came in, and she'd been waiting for this moment for the past two weeks.</p>
<p>Astoria sank down onto Harry, groaning in satisfaction as he filled her.  How had she gone so long without this?  How stupid had she been, not being there in their bed with bells on (and nothing else), waiting for them to fuck her brains out the moment they got back from their honeymoon in Paris?</p>
<p>She rode him hard and fast, not pacing herself in the least.  This wasn't the time for anything other than pure, frantic fucking.  She rose and fell on him as quickly as she could manage, seeking nothing other than her immediate gratification, the release of two weeks' worth of pent-up sexual frustration.  </p>
<p>She truly was fond of Harry, but for the moment she was using him as a mere tool with which to get off.  He seemed to understand her urgent need, or at the very least did not have a problem with her using him in this way, because he stayed on his back, kept his mouth shut and did nothing to object to anything she was doing.  There wasn't much he could do to participate.  Trying to thrust up into her from below would have been pointless with how hard she was riding him.  He usually loved to squeeze her breasts or especially her arse when she rode him, but he couldn't even do that this time since his hands were bound and useless.  Normally that would be as disappointing for her as it was for him, but she was too focused on getting off as fast as humanly possible to care about anything else.</p>
<p>Astoria came with a high-pitched shriek.  She hadn't thought to cast any silencing charms to keep her neighbors from hearing her, but that was the furthest thing from her mind at the moment.  She wasn't attached to this flat anyway; let the neighbors complain and get her thrown out.  It would be well worth it.  She pulled off of him and exhaled in relief.  How badly she'd needed that!    </p>
<p>As she came down from her high, Astoria realized her brother-in-law hadn't gotten off and was still hard and ready for more.  She grinned, settled down on her belly between his spread legs and took his cock into her mouth.  She'd figured he'd be sexed out after his honeymoon, but apparently Daphne had left some for her.</p>
<p><i>'What a thoughtful big sister'</i>, Astoria thought to herself as she began sucking off said sister's husband.</p>
