  <em>“I must go in, for the fog is rising.” </em>
</p><p align="center">-The last words of Emily Dickinson<br/> </p><p>The wind blew viciously up here and it hurt just a tiny bit. It was sheer perfection. Her hair had grown long, and she hadn't really noticed, given that it was usually twisted into a complicated plait so it didn't get in the way beneath her goggles. She hadn't paused to tie it back this afternoon, and it was blowing wildly around her, occasionally whipping her across the face with stinging force. She'd have to see about a solid chop off.</p><p>She hadn't paused to tie her hair back for the same reason that she hadn't paused to check that the broom was hers – which, incidentally, it was not, although the team brooms were all of decent enough quality. She also hadn't stopped to put on britches, or grab practice balls, or check that the pitch was even free, because she'd been far too close to an all-out meltdown. The type she didn’t want the team to see.</p><p>They didn't, because she was used to fleeing. The last thing they saw was her anger. That was well-orchestrated, well-practised.</p><p>She didn’t have to hear them to know what they’d say:</p><p><em> Oh don't mind her, </em> they'd chuckle to themselves, <em> you know what they say about redheads. </em></p><p>She supposed that there was no reason to keep flying now that she was calmer. She tested a grin to see if she could pull it off, and when it felt convincing enough, she pushed the broom forward to dangerous speeds and did six more laps before dragging back and heading down. Her cheeks were burning, her eyes hurt, and she was pretty sure it was going to take twenty minutes of warm water to regain feeling in her hands.</p><p>But at least she was breathing normally again.</p><p>She remembered, from a long forgotten conversation, how Harry hadn't gone for professional Quidditch because he didn't want the flying to turn into a chore. She hadn't understood then, and now, five years on the team, with gruelling practices and long seasons on the road, she still didn't.</p><p>Flying never felt like a chore. Flying was always safety and control, freedom and containment, all at once. When she was flying nothing touched her. The roar of the wind drowned out her thoughts, and her attention was kept by the quaffle, meaning it couldn't settle on anything else for long. Even during practise, she was constantly on high alert; Henrietta had them constantly switching positions, which Ginny had thought was stupid until she had learned a few tricks while playing Beater that had saved a game or two.</p><p>Ginny Weasley was twenty-four-years-old, and her hair was too long. She was trim and tall, despite too much beer round the pub, and shitty food while on the road. She hated her brown eyes and she hated her freckles.</p><p>And she hated the panic that regularly gripped her soul and robbed her of the ability to think or feel or breathe.</p><p align="center">━━━━━━┛ ✠ ┗━━━━━━━</p><p>Being the youngest of too many children certainly had its ups and downs. Advantages included being the only girl, never blamed for anything (even she knew that one was true), and always getting the best gifts at Christmas because of parental guilt.</p><p>Disadvantages were definitely hand-me-downs. And this.</p><p>Eleven-year-old Ginny was as wide-eyed as every other eleven-year-old standing on the platform, but no one quite took the time to notice or offer words of encouragement. Her Mum and Dad were honestly not to blame, having been through this a total of five times already. It hardly held any mystery for them. They could be forgiven for not noticing that their only daughter was slightly terrified.</p><p>It hadn’t taken long for her to start dragging her feel, to fall behind. The boys had disappeared immediately, running ahead; Fred and George jostling for attention as always. Ron and Harry are actually completely missing, disappeared as soon as they’d stepped out of the car. Bill was there, somewhere, for some reason, but she'd quite lost sight of him, and he'd be of no help anyway. She gulped again, clutching her trolley a little tighter.</p><p>She hadn't been prepared for being nervous. She'd been on the platform every year since she could remember. She knew what the departure looked like, chaotic and loud. She was excited for Hogwarts, too; finally, she would see what all the fuss was about. The boys had been tormenting her and Ron for years, and last year had been a long one, being the only one at home. Stupid baby sister problems. She took a deep breath.</p><p>She squared her shoulders and lifted her chin. She strode forward to catch up with her parents. Molly smiled down at her as she stepped in line.</p><p>“Alright, love?” she said, petting Ginny's hair.</p><p>“Course, mum,” Ginny replied, a smile of her own.</p><p>And she was. She was going to be alright.</p><p align="center">━━━━━━┛ ✠ ┗━━━━━━━</p><p>As her feet touched the ground, Ginny could already sense Miranda's heavy stride heading in her direction. She grimaced. For the most part, this team was much better than last year, skill-wise, but she and Miranda hadn't quite worked out how to deal with each other yet. Right now, it was more dragons circling each other than respectful sportsmanship and Ginny was not going to put up with it much longer. It was exhausting.</p><p>“Weasley, want to tell me why exactly you are on my <em> fucking </em>broom?”</p><p>Of bloody course. She looked down and saw the bright gold ‘Avery’ stamped across the back of the handle.</p><p>“Look, Avery, I'm sorry. Won't happen again,” she said calmly.</p><p>Miranda wasn't convinced, crossing her arms and staring daggers at her.</p><p>“Why'd it happen now?” she challenged.</p><p>“Accident,” Ginny groundout. “Just grabbed one and left.”</p><p>“You gotta learn how to control that temper of yours, Weasley,” she taunted.</p><p>Ginny took a deep breath and refused to react. She'd just calmed down. She would not get in a tizzy over Miranda Avery, whose family origins were dubious at best. Even if the three year age difference meant she'd been nowhere near the battle, it still seemed questionable to Ginny that Miranda was a ‘Muggle-born’. Sacred Twenty-eight names didn't just disappear.</p><p>Ginny paused a moment, counting silently to keep hold of her temper. “Said I was sorry, Miranda. Going to shower. I'll polish it up after.” She wearily ran a hand over her face.</p><p>Miranda watched her for a moment, then reached out and snatched her broom back, growling ‘I'll do it’, before storming away.</p><p>Ginny shook her head. Whatever. She couldn't be friends with everyone.</p><p>Standing under the hot water fifteen minutes later, it happened. One moment, she was revelling in the steadily pounding stream she had charmed to attack her with an almost painful pummel of pressure. The next, a grey hand was reaching out from the faucet, the taps dripping an inky black grease, and the light in the showers had gone gloomy and green. She was screaming and scrambling backwards before her conscious brain had time to catch up.</p><p>She heard his voice, whispering her name. Always just her name, before she passed out.</p><p>She woke up on a physio table in the training room, wrapped in a robe, with two equally unimpressed faces standing over her.</p><p>“Thanks for having the decency to be alive, Weasley,” Miranda said icily.</p><p>Ginny's throat hurt, and the light felt bright and hard.</p><p>“You're lucky Miranda was here, Weasley,” Henrietta grimaced, leaning towards her and scanning her wand, held out in a shimmering blue light. “That's the third time this month. Care to explain?"</p><p>Ginny swallowed, “I'm sorry, Spear, I've been a bit stressed and tired, and–”</p><p>But on seeing the look on her captain's face, Ginny fell silent. Henrietta had already decided whatever it was she was going to do. She was not a woman to change her mind.</p><p>“Yes, Well,” Spear said, arching an eyebrow. “I'm suspending you.”</p><p>“What?! No. Spear. Henri. Please, don't. I promise I'll–”</p><p>“Ginny,” Henrietta said gently. “I thought you'd been seeing someone.”</p><p>Ginny felt her dumb, pale, ginger skin betray her instantly as her cheeks heated embarrassingly.</p><p>“I am. I was. The year…the season gets…”</p><p>“Busy,” Henri finished. “I know. But listen, Ginny. It's early in the season, exhibition games and nothing serious. It won't impact your stats if you take some time now. It's the best option available. I can't… I can't have you in the air. You could hurt yourself. Or someone else.”</p><p>Ginny nodded. There was no point explaining that it never happened in the air.</p><p>Henrietta nodded, “Six weeks. Go, see someone.”</p><p>Miranda was standing further away, staring at the ceiling. Ginny felt an odd surge of gratitude eat through her animosity. Miranda may be a royal pain in the arse, but she was a teammate. She was still an ally.</p><p>Ginny sighed. There was no getting around this, and she was honestly too tired to try.</p><p>Henri patted her hand and said, “It's okay, Weasley. Sometimes, we all need to just take a collective breather.”</p><p>“Sure,” Ginny said, swinging her legs off the bed and sitting up. “I get it.”</p><p align="center">━━━━━━┛ ✠ ┗━━━━━━━</p><p>Hogwarts was not what she'd been sold. It was really just <em> school </em>, in an old and supremely creepy building. People liked to just glaze over the fact that there were dark creatures in the forest, whose cries and howls you could hear at night, especially sleeping in a tower as the Gryffindors did. No one talked about the fact that that the staircases sometimes led you to passages and corridors that were both abandoned and definitely dangerous. They liked to ignore the fact that the ghosts were occasionally volatile and mean, or that there were a number of deadly school supplies in every classroom.</p><p>It's not that she was scared, not in the simple sense of the word. She <em> was </em> a Gryffindor. And a Weasley. And the baby sister of seven mischievous brothers. Ginny Weasley did not scare easily. Her skin was tougher than that.</p><p>But the castle did <em> unsettle </em>her significantly more than she'd been anticipating. The way the boys went on, she'd expected to feel at home the second she crossed the threshold. That hadn't happened.</p><p>When you added to it that she was really only good at Potions, where Professor Snape was confusingly lenient with her, even helpful for some reason, despite the reputation that preceded him. Technically, she was good at Charms too, but that was because Charlie had sneakily been teaching her for years. Without a wand, and growing up in a magical household, the underage magic department usually turned a blind eye to simple stuff.</p><p>She refused to acknowledge that part of her discomfort might have been loneliness, and yet, deep down, that was definitely the problem. It had always been an issue, really, that she and Ron were so close in age. Now that she was here, sharing a common room with him again, he seemed to have decided that it was time to up his teasing, increase his tormenting, attempt to banish her from speaking to his friends.</p><p>It’s not that she didn’t have friends; she did, and she fit in just fine in classes. At night, though, when she got back to the common room, she found herself exhausted by the gossip of the other girls, but also by the immature pranks and games of the boys. Some evenings, she would wander around for a few hours after dinner, trying to avoid people. Of course, that’s how she’d managed to meet Michael, and Luna, and they were good friends.</p><p>Still. Finding that diary in her transfiguration book had been a wonderful thing. Not only did she have somewhere she could write, but she hadn’t had to go and buy it herself, risking the torment of her brothers.</p><p>The first night she’d put quill to paper, it had been a particularly bad day. Fred had made some snarky remark about her being ‘pointlessly feisty’, and Ron had taken her last roll of parchment without asking. She’d spilt a whole jar of beetle wings in Potions, and had forgotten to finish her essay on the principal laws for Charms. Dinner had been exhausting, so she’d huddled into a corner behind a tapestry and poured her soul onto a page.</p><p>Yes, Ginevra Molly Weasley was sharp and intelligent, brave and independent. She was strong and friendly. But, she was also eleven. And when a mysterious boy, whose writing had a friendly slant and whose words were a balm to every frustration she’d ever felt, Ginevra Molly Weasley became one of the most dangerous things for a preteen girl to be – enamoured.</p><p>For the next month, she ignored the little voice in the back of her mind. The one that told her just how dangerous it was to be interacting with a book. Ignored her father’s words, the ones she’d heard since she was very small. No, she couldn’t see where the diary’s brain was kept.</p><p>The problem was that she just didn’t care.</p>
