    <p>Staring around the rebuilt Room of Requirement with apprehension, Harry frowned. He was unsure how this was going to be received, so he knew he had to make it as perfect as he possibly could. Taking a step back, he took a few seconds to admire his handiwork.</p>
<p>The room was set up just like one of the Gryffindor dorm rooms. Round and homey-feeling, it served to relax him a little. Streamers and banners adorned the walls, each with a different birthday message on them. A large, soft bed sat off to one side, draped in Slytherin green and silver. Right in the very middle of the room sat a table, with an enormous chocolate cake in the dead centre. Harry had lit each of the letter-shaped candles himself, spelling out the words ‘Happy Birthday’ with them. He jumped when he heard the sound of the door opening behind him.</p>
<p>“Harry?”</p>
<p>The torchlight in the room reflected off Draco’s pale hair, lending him a touch of warmth that Harry didn’t usually see. The surprise on Draco’s face when he got a look at what awaited him in the room sent another jolt of nerves through Harry’s stomach.</p>
<p>“Happy birthday, Draco.”</p>
