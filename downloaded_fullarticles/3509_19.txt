  <u>July 1976</u>
</p><p>Luna Goldwin was making her way through the long rows of trees and bushes which were covering a large part of the Malfoy family estate. It was eleven in the morning and the sky was a pale grey. The air was much too damp and cold for a summer day. While hearing the quite whistling of birds in the trees, Luna started climbing the white steps of the outside staircase before arriving at the massive walnut wood door. After a little moment of hesitation, she grabbed the bronze knocker in her shaking hand and tapped it against the door. There, she waited, her heart beating tensely.  </p><p>The one who answered the door wasn’t quite what she had expected. It was a tiny creature, with enormous tennis-ball eyes. Its stare was suspicious, and it looked as nervous as her.</p><p>‘Yes?’ it squeaked.</p><p>By the sound of the voice, she concluded that she probably faced a male house elf. </p><p>‘Hello. My name is Luna Goldwin. I am your neighbour and I thought… Well, I’m looking for a job for the holidays and I was wondering if help was needed here.’</p><p>The elf’s withering ears suddenly rose. His suspicious stare made way for a very curious one.</p><p>‘Help, miss?’</p><p>A smile illuminated his face. But before she could answer anything, a strange sweet voice came from behind him:</p><p>‘What is it, Dobby?’</p><p>The elf jumped with surprise. His ears came back to their usual place, and he bowed his head, as if he had wanted to dodge a blow.</p><p>There stood a young man with a pale face and long light blond hair. His grey eyes were cold as ice, but Luna noticed immediately a kind of light in them. He was wearing a rich-looking long black cloak. He stared at her curiously, his mouth slightly open. Ever more nervous, Luna decided to speak:</p><p>‘Oh, hum… Good day. My name is Luna Goldwin. I am your neighbour. I’m looking for a job and I was wondering if help was needed here.’</p><p>She tried to figure out whether she had said something stupid because she’d just let everything slip in one breath, and the young man looked quite puzzled.</p><p>‘A job?’ he asked, eyebrows knitting.</p><p>‘Yes,’ she said slowly. ‘I have been searching the whole neighbourhood, but I haven’t found one yet. Usually, I work in the fields during summer… But I can do anything, like gardening, cleaning and cooking…’</p><p>There was a silence. He definitely seemed surprised and she began to feel more and more stupid.</p><p>‘Anyway, I… I can see that you’ve already got house elves,’ she added quickly, looking at Dobby’s concerned face. ‘Surely am I disturbing… Maybe I should go…’</p><p>However, as she was ready to turn around, the young man stopped her:</p><p>‘Not at all. You may enter if you wish. I’ll introduce you to my father. He’s the master of our house.’</p><p>There was no smile on his face, but it was a good start. Everywhere else she went, the doors would be closed on her. Even muggles were becoming more suspicious towards strangers in those troubled times.</p><p>But at the same time, Luna started to wonder if this was a proper house to enter. Maybe because of Dobby’s sudden, surprised expression which had followed the words of his master… or because of the general nature of the manor. On top of being huge, the entrance hall was very dark. Enchanted candles were suspended in mid-air, faintly lighting the scene. The young man was leading the march, followed by a curious-looking Luna and a worried Dobby. They climbed a very large staircase and turned to their right, reaching the west wing.</p><p>They crossed over a long and even darker corridor. There were paintings on the walls. Some of their owners roused from their sleep to watch the new visitor with prying eyes.</p><p>But before opening the last door of the corridor, the young man turned around, facing Luna. His voice was then just a whisper:</p><p>‘Before introducing you, I think it would be wise to ask. Do you know my father?’</p><p>‘I… I’ve only heard a couple of things about him. I know he’s got an important job at the Ministry of Magic.’</p><p>Then, as though it was the right password, he grabbed the doorknob and let her enter in what seemed to be a very large living room.</p><p>However full of ebony furniture, the room was less dark: there were three chandeliers, full of lighting candles. Several black leather armchairs surrounded a coffee table made of glass. There also stood a luxurious fireplace.</p><p>In one of the armchairs was a wizard, probably in his fifties. He was light-blond-haired and wore a neat moustache, as well as a severe look. His black robes were shining like diamonds at his regular breathing and his belt was most likely made of the purest gold. He had a particularly deep voice:</p><p>‘Not left yet, son?’</p><p>‘I was just about to leave. But I ran into someone at the door.’</p><p>He turned his head to Luna. It was difficult to say whether it was Dobby or her who was looking the most embarrassed. Abraxas Malfoy craned his head to catch her eye:</p><p>‘So? Who is this girl, why did you let her in?’</p><p>‘I am deeply sorry, Mr Malfoy, I didn’t introduce myself. I am Luna Goldwin and I was wondering if you needed help in your estate. If so, I would be happy to offer you my services…’</p><p>‘Hang on a moment,’ he snapped. ‘Show me your wand.’</p><p>Luna’s eyes suddenly widened with surprise. She had never been asked such a thing.</p><p>‘Father…’ his son suddenly muttered.</p><p>‘One can’t be too careful,’ he said heavily. ‘With all those muggles lurking around our grounds…’</p><p>A sudden look of disgust had appeared on his face at the word ‘muggles’. Gulping, Luna thought it was best for her to do as she was asked, so she pulled her wand out of her pocket.</p><p>‘Show me.’</p><p>As she went closer to him, - and she was nearly sure to have noticed the young Malfoy’s eyes rolling discreetly – he stretched his arm to take her wand. He looked at it closely, with frowning eyebrows.</p><p>‘I happen to know a lot about wands. This one is slightly flexible… 12 inches, I see… And of… rowan. Really?’</p><p>He raised his eyes to watch her reaction. She didn’t know anything about wands, but this didn’t look good, because he had a mocking smile.</p><p>‘What’s its core?’</p><p>‘Unicorn hair, sir.’</p><p>Mr Malfoy then started sniggering. Wondering what could cause such hilarity, Luna turned around to catch the young Malfoy’s eyes, but from then on, he looked distant and lost in his thoughts. However, to her great relief, his father stopped laughing and gave her wand back.</p><p>‘Well, we don’t need sneaking little housemaids here, thank you very much,’ he snapped again in an unpleasant tone. ‘Dobby, you’ll see her out.’</p><p>Not knowing what to answer to that, but deeply relieved not having to work on behalf of such a person, Luna lightly bowed her head and left the room, following Dobby and closing the door behind her. She was upset to have been humiliated that way and her stomach was hurting with an unbearable feeling of shame.</p><p>However, as she was going down the stairs of the entrance hall, a voice came from the top:</p><p>‘Dobby! It’s time you left for the kitchens. I shall see her out.’</p><p>It was the young Malfoy. Dobby turned around to watch him, a new curious look on his face, but as his master scowled at him, his ears lowered. After giving a strange kind smile to Luna, he disappeared behind a door on the left of the hall. She then heard the footsteps of her host coming back to her. Nevertheless, she kept on walking to the exit without looking at him:</p><p>‘You really don’t need to bother,’ she said quite sharply, without minding her tone. ‘I know the way out.’</p><p>She was ready to open the door, but he interfered by grabbing the knob before her.</p><p>‘For what it’s worth,’ he said slowly, his sweet voice echoing in the deserted hall, ‘I am sorry.’</p><p>She looked at him and was surprised to see that he had a displeased expression on his face. She made her way outside once he finally opened the door but he hadn’t finished:</p><p>‘You’re at Hogwarts, aren’t you?’</p><p>His look was now quite awkward, but Luna thought it was a good way to change the subject, so she answered:</p><p>‘Yes, but I don’t think we know each other, do we?’</p><p>‘We don’t. I’m 22. I left Hogwarts five years ago.’</p><p>‘I see. Well, I’ll go back to school for my sixth year in September. I’m in Gryffindor.’</p><p>He suddenly looked down, as if she’d just said something bad. But at the moment she started to wonder about the Malfoys’ strange behaviour, he raised his eyes and let a very faint smile appear on his face:</p><p>‘Good luck, then. Name’s Lucius.’</p><p>And he disapparated as quickly as a shadow.</p><p> </p>
