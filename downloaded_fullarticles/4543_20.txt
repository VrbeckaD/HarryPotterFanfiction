    <p>Heroes</p><p>Iris has just found out Bruce's secret... but can she trust him with her own secrets? Find out in this sequel to 'New Beginnings'. Fem HP, bashing of RW/HG</p><p>Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter or DC.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>*Previously*</p><p>Iris turned her awed attention from her surroundings and onto her cousin who was watching her with a blank face.</p><p>"What is all this, Bruce?"</p><p>"You asked whom I am, Iris, and this is who I am."</p><p>"I don't understand."</p><p>Bruce sighed but led her over to some display that held what looked like costumes. One was in green, red, and yellow, as well as black and looked like it was made for a child. While the other was clearly made for an adult, with different tones of black and gray, and a unmistakeable mask. Iris gasped and turned around to look at Bruce who was standing behind her and to the side with his arms crossed and watching her reaction.</p><p>"Do you understand now?"</p><p>Iris nodded. "Y-You're Batman."</p><p>*Now*</p><p>Bruce nodded.</p><p>"Yes, I'm Batman. And I don't think I have to tell you how dangerous it would be if this got out."</p><p>Iris glared at him instantly.</p><p>"Do you really think I would tell anyone about this?"</p><p>Bruce shrugged.</p><p>"I don't know you well enough to judge what you would do, Iris. But I do know that a mother's instinct is to protect her children first if they are in danger. As my instinct is to protect Dick and Alfred from any and all threats, even if it is from my newly discovered cousin."</p><p>Iris felt a spark of anger but swallowed it down. She knew that if their roles were reversed, she would do the same thing. Then she though of something. Tit for tat, is what she believed it was called.</p><p>She took a deep breath. "Since you showed me your secret, Bruce, I think it's fair for me to tell you mine."</p><p>Bruce's eyes narrowed.</p><p>"Go on."</p><p>"I'm a witch."</p><p>Silence.</p><p>"You're a what?"</p><p>"I'm a witch, Bruce."</p><p>Bruce stepped toward her menacingly. He didn't like magic users, he barely tolerated Dr Fate and Zatara.</p><p>"Start. Talking."</p><p>Iris took a deep breath, waving her hand, a chair appearing behind her for her to sit down in the Bat Cave.</p><p>"I guess I should start from the beginning, then, shouldn't I?"</p><p>Bruce didn't show an outward reaction to her display of power and instead grabbed his own chair from in front of his supercomputer.</p><p>"I found that is always a good place to start."</p><p>"Well, my story began on October 31st, almost twenty-two years ago."</p><p>"Wait, you're twenty-two?"</p><p>"Almost, my birthday is next month."</p><p>"How old were you when you had...?"</p><p>"Teddy is my godson. And I had James when I was 16, almost 17. Albus when I was 19, and Lily when I was almost 21. Now may I continue?"</p><p>"You may."</p><p>"As I was saying, it all started on October 31st, in a little cottage where a daughter and her parents resided..."</p><p>Iris told her cousin exactly what he wanted to hear, all of it the truth.</p><p>After almost four hours of story telling and several questions later, the cousins stared at each other for a moment.</p><p>"And your ex?"</p><p>Iris took a deep breath. She had foregone any mentions of her ex, her children's father, and hoped Bruce wouldn't ask anything about him.</p><p>"His name is Blaise Zabini and he cheated on me with Hermione, even though she is with Ron. And Ron knows is what is really messed up about the whole thing! My bestfriend knew that my other best friend was cheating on him with my husband but he didn't say a word because he was too focused on Qudditch to care. And do you know what the really f*cked up thing is?"</p><p>Bruce silently shook his head, a slight pang of pity hitting him.</p><p>Iris let out a humorous laugh. "I found out from Draco Malfoy when Blaise told him after he had drank to much firewhiskey. And when I confronted all three of them, none of them even had any remorse about what happened!"</p><p>Bruce met her eyes and leaned forwad in his chair, taking her hand in his own, causing her to look at him.</p><p>"I know it hurts, Iris, I know that you are most likely crushed at what those you thought you could trust and love and cherish did to you. But you have to move past it, to show them that you are stronger then them, that they didn't break you. You're the Girl-Who-Lived, the Woman-Who-Conquered, right?"</p><p>Iris nodded, still absorbing his words.</p><p>"Then show them why the Wizarding World looks to you as their Savior."</p><p>"How do I do that?"</p><p>"By getting stronger."</p><p>Iris hesitated, meeting his eyes once more. He already knew what she was going to ask him.</p><p>"Will you teach me?"</p><p>Bruce allowed a smile to grace his face.</p><p>"Of course. We have to stick together, don't we?"</p><p>Iris smiled at him.</p><p>She was glad that she finally had someone that actually cared about her and what she needed.</p><p>She was glad she had found him and that he was going to help her to rise up and show the whole world why she was in fact called the Wizarding Savior.</p>
