    <p>"Bloody hell." Harry muttered under his breath. He hadn't even been awake for 10 minutes and already the day was going downhill. A copy of the Daily Prophet had been delivered and he had once again made the front page. It wasn't uncommon, though the attention surrounding him had significantly decreased as time had gone on, but he certainly had not expected this morning's headlines.</p><p>

    <em>Boy Who Lived Has Another Reason To Celebrate</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Harry Potter, newly initiated Auror and war hero, who is largely considered to be one of the greatest wizards of our time, has yet another reason to celebrate. After taking off time to spend with friends after the Battle of Hogwarts over two years ago, Potter was invited by Minister for Magic Kingsley Shaklebolt to join in the Auror department, waiving requirements of N.E.W.T.'s for students whose last year of schooling had been disrupted.</em>

  <em>"I have every faith in Mr. Potter and the members of the DA who fought alongside those in the Order of the Phoenix during the war. They have all shown that their abilities are equal to other highly trained Aurors, and after they participate in training it will be my pleasure to welcome them. No time frame has been set up for training, nor will one be announced. We have encouraged them to take time off, assuring them that the offer stands whenever they feel the time is right."</em>

  <em>Potter took the rest of the year off and spent it in the company of the Weasley Family at their home until the start of classes at Hogwarts after the holidays. Potter along with Ronald Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Dean Thomas, amongst others, joined the Auror training class that winter. After a year of grueling and rigorous training Potter was welcomed as a full Auror just this January. Since then he has made it his mission to find the last of the Death Eaters, along with their sympathizers, and see them put to trial for their various war crimes.</em>

  <em>While Potter is thought to have a one-track mind in his quest for justice against the Death Eaters, it is obvious by his recent activities that this is untrue. Many thought that the delay of his Auror Training was due to none other than Ginevra (Ginny) Weasley newly selected chaser for the Holy Head Harpies. Although unconfirmed, sources close to the couple reported that they just wanted time to themselves to "grieve for the loss of our friends and enjoy life to fullest amount possible in their memory" after the battle. The Golden Trio along with other members of the DA including Ms. Weasley and Mr. Longbottom, were also seen at funerals for fallen Hogwarts students following the war.</em>

  <em>The couple, while not often seen in public, is thought to spend all their quality time together at the Weasleys home, especially considering the unconfirmed reports that Potter has continued to reside there with the family since the end of the war. While no official announcement has yet to be made from the couple a source close to the pair has confirmed that the couple are now engaged and are planning the wedding in the imminent future. Plans are thought to already be in the making, with a fall wedding at Hogwarts Castle the most likely venue for what is sure to be the largest wedding - Continued Page 6 Column 2.</em>

</p><p>Harry grimaced at the large heart shaped photo that took up most of the front page, if he didn't know any better, he would think the two were trying to smother one another. Groaning he went down the stairs in search for Ginny who he knew wouldn't want to be blind-sided by this at practice. Hearing the shower closest to her room going he went in search for the other Weasley woman who he assumed also wouldn't be pleased by this morning's developments.</p><p>Making his way to the kitchen he could hear the familiar sounds of Mrs. Weasley making breakfast and regretted that the morning was about to be ruined.</p><p>"Good morning Harry, dear." Mrs. Weasley called as she spotted him walking in. Thankfully the kitchen was empty except for Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.</p><p>"Good morning." He replied, trying to decide whether to show them the article now or to wait until the end of breakfast.</p><p>"Oh no, what's happened?" Mrs. Weasley asked worriedly. "You've got a look about you."</p><p>Harry sighed before handing her the Daily Prophet he had been carrying. He watched as shock flowed over Mrs. Weasley's features quickly followed by anger and rage.</p><p>"Why those little!" She shouted before thrusting the paper at her husband.</p><p>Mr. Weasley remained silent as he read through the article, putting it down on the table after he was finished reading it. "Well, we certainly can't say we weren't expecting it. Though I wish, and I'm sure you do as well Harry, that we'd had a bit longer before it had come out."</p><p>"That's an understatement," Harry muttered. "As if work wasn't crazy enough let's add this into the mix. I knew my life would never be private, but you'd think they'd be tired of me by now."</p><p>"Who would be tired of you?" Ginny asked as she made her way into the kitchen.</p><p>Harry stayed silent and waited for her to see the prophet spread out across the table. Ginny grimaced as she saw the photo.</p><p>"You'd think I was eating your face. Goodness, well one day maybe they'll have something better to write about." She sat down at the table, picking up the paper in one hand and piece of toast in the other, eating as she read. "Oh look 'arry apparently, we're getting married this fall at Hogwarts. Who knew?"</p><p>"Certainly not me," He said with a grin on his face as he sat down next to her, digging into Mrs. Weasleys eggs. He always admired how nothing seemed to shake Ginny. "Have you been planning without me?"</p><p>"Only since I was about 9." Ginny replied, laughing at the look on his face.</p><p>Harry sighed, "I wouldn't mind this as much, but we haven't even told everyone yet. Only Ron and Hermione know, your brothers are going to kill me."</p><p>"Doubtful, but just in case, Mom think you could write to the boys see if they'll come over for dinner? I'm sure they'll know by then but." Ginny shrugged finishing the rest of her toast.</p><p>"Do you have practice today?" Harry asked.</p><p>"No thank Merlin, those reporters would have a field day out there. Do you have to go in?"</p><p>"No, Ron's in today going through some paperwork. I've already gone through it, but I was half asleep while I did it, so I asked if he'd go back over it to make sure I didn't miss anything. My only plan is to catch up on some sleep."</p><p>"Good you need it; I can't think of the last time you actually got a full night of sleep." Ginny said.</p><p>"If I think really hard I can, it was probably in my fourth year before that damned goblet spewed my name out." Harry said jokingly.</p><p>The rest of the morning passed in peace, with Mrs. Weasley coming in to tell them that all the boys would be over for dinner that evening. Ginny spent her time reading an article about the greatest quidditch players of all time, while Harry used her lap a pillow and dozed in and out while she ran her free hand through his hair. In the early afternoon they got up and had a light lunch before talking a short walk through the garden. As they came back into the house Harry reveled in the feeling of relaxation and sat down across from Ginny as they began a game of chess.</p><p>They had made it to the end of the game when the fireplace suddenly erupted in green flames producing a frantic looking Ron.</p><p>"Harry!" Ron yelled when he spotted him. "We need you NOW, we have a potential location on Greyback."</p><p>Just as quickly as he appeared Ron was gone leaving, Harry jumped up from the table rushing up the stairs to change into his robes.</p><p>When he made it back down to the fireplace Ginny was standing next to it, a worried expression on her face.</p><p>"I'm sorry I wouldn't go if I wasn't needed." He apologized.</p><p>"Oh quiet, you know I'm not upset about that. Just be careful, I expect you to come back in the same condition you leave in."</p><p>"I'll do my best." He promised before leaning in to kiss her cheek. Harry stepped into the fireplace and was quickly engulfed in the emerald flames.</p>
