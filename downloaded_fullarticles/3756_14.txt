    <p>At the age of 20, Harry Potter realised that he was special. Something he had already thought he knew but it changed. After the war, everything changed. All of his family are now gone. He couldn't have saved them and he realised long ago that he could do nothing to change time. Very few from his year survived the war. Luna Lovegood, Neville Longbottom, Susan Bones, and Draco Malfoy.</p><p>Draco and Harry had managed to become friends after the deaths of the final Weasleys. They died suddenly. No one was sure how maybe it was that they didn't want to go on three Weasleys out of nine wasn't anything good. George was the only one left. </p><p>He had nightmares worse than them all. He always said it was his job to show people how to have fun. He's a shell of his former self. One that neither of them can recognise. He moved to America to start fresh.</p><p>The five of them all sat at the same table in the great hall. They weren't exactly students but they weren't professors either. They had nowhere left to go. Headmistress Mcgonagall had let them stay she couldn't throw out her children. All of them had become her children. </p><p>No one had come out of the war unharmed, undamaged. Poppy and Minerva were the only original staff members left. Both of them swearing they were too old for this. The school still ran all of the staff members who had died were replaced. Their names were carved into the great hall doors. Every single loss of the battle, there wasn't a single area of wood free from the names.</p><p>They had won. The light side won not that there were many key members alive. Most of the light side died due to being hit with spells that delayed their death. At least some were lucky enough to see the end of the war.</p><p>"Harry. It's not your fault." Luna watched Harry carefully. All of them knew he blamed himself. He would stare into the mirror at himself like he saw a ghost.</p><p>"I know that now Luna. I couldn't change anything. No matter how much I wish to change things. Even if I go back in time I cannot change anything. I promise I'm okay." Harry told his friend. He believed that there wasn't anything he could change.</p><p>"It gets better, trust me on this Harry. This isn't the ending this is the beginning. You'll see. Minerva has called for us. To finish on our Animagus transformations."</p><p>"Let's head down, I'm sure the others are waiting for us." The five once students were as close as they could get. Neville and Susan became a couple and Luna and Draco did the same. Harry was happy for his friends. It was hard to find his place here again. Minerva and Poppy helped the both of them unsure. So they did what they always did and became mothers, Harry took care of the others as a mother. His hair was much longer now and his need for glasses was gone. </p><p>"Are you excited, Harry?" Draco acted much like a dog these days. Maybe it was to keep himself sane. No one questioned it all of them had changed.</p><p>"What do you hope to be?" Harry asked his blonde son.</p><p>"Maybe a bird. What about the rest of you?"</p><p>"I like the idea of becoming a bird but maybe I'll be more of a Bear. A protective mama bear." Harry teased.</p><p>"I think maybe a rabbit for me. It's my Patronus even if she isn't as pretty as she once was."</p><p>"Hopefully an Otter or maybe a Badger," Susan said. Hermione was one of the last people to die. It was a weeks after Ron.</p><p>"I have no idea what I would be. Maybe I'll be a lion or something cool like that."</p><p>"No matter what. I'm proud of us all of us."</p><p>○○○○</p><p>Harry became a phoenix. Everyone was proud. Luna gave him that look that told her she knew all the answers in the world. She always knew things before the rest of them considered it a possibility. Luna became a Dove, Draco became a baby dragon, Neville was a bear, and Susan was a Unicorn. Harry didn't understand how someone could become a magical creature. </p><p>Harry's watch went off. It was a special watch it alerted him to birthdays. Important birthdays. Days he refused to forget just as many death days.</p><p>"Who?" Minerva asked.</p><p>"Ginny. Another day remembered."</p><p>"Harry, can we speak privately?" Luna asked. He nodded and followed her out of the great hall.</p><p>"What did you want to talk about Luna?"</p><p>"You feel as if you're missing a piece for your heart, you're missing something but you don't know what it is. You're ignoring the urge to get lost in time."</p><p>"I can't leave you like that. None of you. Besides where am I supposed to go, what should I do if I choose to stay somewhere I have no way to bring money."</p><p>"You're a phoenix. Go to Gringotts and tell them what you need. You already have a small bag that you keep everything you need in it."</p><p>"It was Hermione's purple bag. She had it when we were on the run."</p><p>"Go find your happiness, Harry. We forgive you, there was nothing for us to forgive you for."</p><p>"What if I land and end up taking care of Voldemort or something?"</p><p>"Follow your instincts. Visit sometime." She turned to leave after a quick hastily spell he called for her to wait.</p><p>"Luna, this is a copy of my bracelet. Keep it. This part will tell you where I am. Stay safe, and happy. I'm going to miss you, all of you." He gave her a hug before he disappeared. She already had explained it to everyone else.</p><p>○○○○</p><p>Harry stopped at Gringotts and set up his bank account. He let the goblins invest in it at a 25% share. In return, they connected his bag to his account. He will have access from his account no matter where in time he was. After that, he grabbed a quick snack before he finally gave into his instinct and followed the wave of time. Harry wasn't sure where he was going but he did see he ended up in a bedroom. Severus Snape's bedroom. Harry knew he didn't look 20 normally but he knew he could barely pass for 12 right now.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>"Can I make up a name?" Harry asked the young Severus. He sat on the floor. Severus looked to be around eight.</p><p>"Why do you want to make up a name?"</p><p>"I don't like mine. It has too many memories."</p><p>"It cannot be worse than mine."</p><p>"What is your name?" Harry knew it but it sounded like something he should ask. Following his instincts for as long as he can.</p><p>"Severus."</p><p>"I like it. It's smooth when you say it. So can I pick mine?"</p><p>"If you must." Harry gave him this giant smile. </p><p>"How about Henry? Actually, maybe I'll go by my real name. It's Harry."</p><p>"I suppose it will do."</p><p>"So what do you want to do? I have no plans for today. Unless you have something important to do today."</p><p>"Aren't you curious as to how you're here?" Severus asked him. He didn't understand the dark haired boy whose hair bordered on red and green eyes.</p><p>"I know how I got here. I just don't know why I'm here or where here is."</p><p>"That makes no sense," Severus grumbled. Harry turned into a phoenix at this. Maybe that would be enough to explain it to the boy.</p><p>"I'm a Phoenix. I wasn't always one but I became one about three weeks ago."</p><p>"How did you do that?"</p><p>"Magic," Harry said softly. He knew that in his house that magic was a forbidden word and as Severus was a half-blood maybe it was forbidden here too.</p><p>"Very well. What do you wish to do? There isn't much to do around here."</p><p>They spent the afternoon playing games. Harry gathered food for dinner, being a phoenix had its perks. Harry told him about Hogwarts and magic. Told him all kinds of different stories. It was late when they finished.</p><p>"I'm glad I was brought here," Harry said helping Severus to bed.</p><p>"Are you leaving?" Severus asked in a quiet voice.</p><p>"I'm unsure. Do you want me to stay?" Harry asked as he soothed the dark hair away from Severus's face.</p><p>"Please."</p><p>"Very well." Harry climbed into the bed next to Severus. The bed was small but neither seemed to mind.</p><p>"Good night." Harry said he was almost asleep when he mumbled: "I love you, Sev."</p><p>At that moment in time, Severus felt loved by this strange boy. Being held for the first time he could remember. He gave in to the urge to cuddle up to the boy. It was a new feeling to feel loved.</p><p>○○○○</p>
