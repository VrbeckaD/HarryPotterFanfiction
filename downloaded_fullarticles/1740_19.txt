    <p>And he woke up. To the howling wind and pouring rain. Albus had left his window open the previous night. He shivered from the coldness and tried to get up. What he did not expect was that an insufferable pain filled his whole body. He stopped moving and carefully reached to touch his nose. He had only placed his fingers gently on it and already a hiss of pain had escaped from his lips. He immediately drew his hand back. And then he felt the dampness of his pillow. He had probably cried earlier. He started to remember everything. And oh, how he wished he would remember nothing. He had already forgotten the open window and slumped back into the cold sheets. Thoughts started fill his head again. He felt the urge to cry. Just like yesterday. And the day before yesterday. </p><p>Slowly he gave in and the tears started to spill out of his eyes. The poor boy looked as miserable as the weather. Even his surroundings looked equally wretched. His usually tidy bookshelf was now nearly empty. Instead of their usual place, most of the books were thrown around the floor. You could also see colourful socks laying here and there. Albus' desk that was usually the tidiest place in his room was now completely covered with letters and envelopes. Letters from a certain person. Gellert Grindelwald. Albus had gone through every single letter they had exchanged during their time together at least thrice. He had been looking for something. He had been looking for a sign of Gellert not loving or caring about him. For a sign of Gellert lying or not sounding genuine. But he hadn't been able to go through the letters with a critical eye because they had brought back too much memories. </p><p>As Albus was laying on his bed his head was filled with an image of Ariana laying dead on the floor and Gellert looking at him with an unreadable expression for the last time before he disapparated. After that came the memories from Ariana's funeral with the image of Aberforth punching him. He could still hear the cracking sound his nose had made when Aberforth's fist had met it. Albus hated himself for the fact that even after what had happened, he still cared about Gellert. And because of that he was now drowning in self-pity, misery and hatred towards himself. He felt pathetic. </p><p>After the funeral Aberforth had disappeared who knows where. But Albus didn't blame him. He knew it was all his fault. He should've stopped Aberforth and Gellert before the fight got out of hand. He should've taken better care of Ariana. He should've...</p><p>His thoughts were interrupted by someone knocking on the door. He silently cursed and slowly rose up. The aching had not stopped. But he decided to fight against the pain for a moment. He stood up and walked slowly to the mirror. And he couldn't recognize the person that was looking back. His skin had always been pale but now it looked like his skin had gotten rid of all the colour it had ever had. His eyes looked puffy and he had dark circles underneath them. His white shirt had a few stains on it. He put on black trousers and blueish socks that had stars in them. He had gotten them from Gellert.. Albus looked like he had lost some weight. And not just a little. He quickly combed his hair down a bit because it was sticking to every direction. Albus hated the reflection. He hated how vulnerable and fragile he looked. He, who had always been the strong one. He, who had always carried his burdens without a complain. He, who...</p><p>And again a knocking interrupted his thoughts. Albus sighed and quickly put on a brown waistcoat before he left his room. When he had gotten to the door and opened it, he had been met with his neighbour, Bathilda Bagshot. She was wearing a slightly concerned look on her face.</p><p>"Good..." What time was it? Albus panicked but continued "morning, Bathilda. " He tried to sound gleeful but the voice that had left his mouth was just raspy.</p><p>Bathilda sighed before answering.<br/>
"You mean good afternoon, dear Albus..?"</p><p>Albus internally cursed himself and answered<br/>
"Oh.. yes of course, I didn't realise it's already that much. Come in, come in!"</p><p>Bathilda walked inside and took her jacket off. They walked to the kitchen which looked just as horrendous as Albus' room.</p><p>"Oh, ehmmm.. "<br/>
Albus coughed awkwardly.<br/>
"Sorry about the mess! I've been so busy writing my new article and I..."</p><p>Bathilda interrupted him.<br/>
"No, you haven't. Sorry Albus but you're a terrible liar." said Bathilda firmly. "As if I wouldn't have noticed your puffy eyes. And you've always looked way too skinny but now you look like you've lost even the last flesh around your bones." Her tone had changed gentler and her eyes were glistening with tears.</p><p>"Thank god I came... I knew something was wrong..."<br/>
She muttered quietly before hugging Albus who immediately winced. She let him out of her grasp and looked even more concerned than before. She walked Albus to a kitchen chair and pulled it out for Albus to sit down.<br/>
Bathilda started to clean the kitchen by muttering some spells. Dirty pans and dishes flew around the room. After everything was cleaned she made some delicious food as quickly as possible. Albus had not muttered a word and just had been watching Bathilda cooking. Bathilda levitated the food to the table and started to pile a big amount on a plate which she handed to Albus. </p><p>"Thank you, Bathilda." Came a quiet answer from Albus.<br/>
"Oh Albus, it's nothing! Just eat my boy! And I'm staying here for a while and I'm going to watch you eat at least most of it." Exclaimed Bathilda as she also finally sat down. </p><p>Albus had almost eaten everything. He had not realised before that he was so hungry and he had just simply forgotten to eat. But now he had eaten. A lot. And first it had felt good to eat but now...<br/>
"I..." Albus could manage to say before he turned away from the table and vomited to the floor.<br/>
"I.. I'm.. so sorry..."<br/>
He was trying to grab his wand but before he could get his wand, Bathilda had already vanished the vomit. Even deeper frown was on her face now.<br/>
"Darling, tell me when was the last time you ate?" Albus heard her ask. And he honestly didn't remember. He tried to think but he had completely lost the count of days.<br/>
"I'm sorry, I can't remember.." A heavy sigh escaped Bathilda's lips as she stood up and walked to the kitchen. She started to make something again. A few minutes later she placed two glasses in front of Albus. One big glass of weird and clumpy looking potion and other smaller glass full of potion that luckily didn't look as horrible.<br/>
"As your body can't take any food, you need to drink these. The other will give you all the nutritions and other will prevent you from vomiting all the nutritions out again." Bathilda explained as Albus stared at the potions blankly. Of course he was grateful for Bathilda's help but the other potion looked a bit... dreadful.<br/>
"Thank you Bathilda, I really appreciate your help." Albus managed to answer. He drank both of them under Bathilda's intensive stare.<br/>
"Where's Aberforth by the way?" Bathilda asked and Albus noticed his hands had started to sweat.<br/>
"Oh, I'm not sure..." He knew better not to lie again to Bathilda. Bathilda saw Albus' mood changing and raised her eyebrow.<br/>
"What do you mean you don't know?"<br/>
"He left... After Ari's funeral.." came the answer.<br/>
And Bathilda was slightly shocked to hear that. That was not what she had been expecting. She knew the brothers had never been best friends but still..<br/>
"Of course I tried to stop him but he wouldn't listen to me... At least he promised to go to Hogwarts. It's important that he finishes his education. But he.. didn't feel like living with me anymore.. Not after Ari's death..." Albus told Bathilda honestly.<br/>
"Oh, I don't blame you! It's not your fault he left. But I thought you would've supported each others during this hard time."</p><p>Bathilda and Albus talked for a while and Bathilda promised to come and visit Albus again tomorrow even though Albus tried to assure her it wasn't necessary. Albus felt a bit better after many days of sorrow.</p><p> </p><p>* * *</p><p>Albus couldn't sleep. Bathilda's potions had made him feel a bit more energetic, so he decided to go out for a walk. He was going outside for the first time after Ari's funeral. It was midnight and there would probably be no one outside anymore. Which was good because Albus didn't want to meet anyone. He didn't want their pity or sympathy. The rain had luckily stopped but it was surprisingly cold outside so Albus decided to put on a coat.<br/>
He walked out of the house and decided to go for a walk to the hill that was close to the village. </p><p> </p><p>The grass was really slippery on the hill because of the earlier rain. Albus stumbled but managed to stay on his feet. He walked up the hill to his and Gellert's meeting place. There was an old oak and underneath it a big rock. Gellert used to climb to the tree when Albus on the other hand preferred to stay on the rock. Albus climbed first to the rock but decided to climb to the branch where Gellert used to sit. But he had forgotten how slippery everything was after the rain and as he was just sitting down, his feet slipped on the branch and he fell. The fall wasn't luckily long but he fell to the rock that was underneath and his head hit the rock hard. He felt a horrible pain on his forehead. Then something warm started to fall down his face and his vision started to darken until he couldn't see or hear anymore. And there in the coldness and darkness he was laying unconsciously. All alone in the middle of the night. Without no one knowing... </p><p>***</p><p>Elsewhere Gellert hissed as he pulled the blood pack out of his pocket. He had not touched it after the day he had fled. He hadn't even looked at it. It would've been too painful. </p><p>He had wanted to give Albus everything he deserved. And oh, he deserved so much. Gellert couldn't vanish the sight of Albus next to Ariana, as he had looked at Gellert with betrayal and pain in his eyes. Gellert had never meant to hurt Albus in any way. Nor had he wanted to hurt Albus' family. He had wanted to relieve Albus from all his pain but all he had brought was more misery.<br/>
After Gellert had left Godric's Hollow he had been just living quietly in Vienna. He had gotten himself a cheap hotel room where he had been researching the Hallows. He had kept his mind busy with the research because he knew if he had stopped, all the horrible thoughts and images would've filled his head. And he couldn't face them, not yet. He didn't want to realise the fact that he had lost Albus. </p><p>But now for the first time after that horrible day, he was holding their blood pack. He had been researching again but the reason he had taken the blood pack out of his pants' pocket now was because he had felt his pocket becoming colder and colder against his skin. And as he had taken the blood pack he had realised it was really cold. He didn't understand. Why was it so cold? He had not read about the blood packs being able to change temperature. It was also quite warm in his hotel room so it didn't just make sense. Gellert was already putting it back into his pocket as he thought he was imagining things when he noticed some liquid coming from the bloodpack. Gellert had only a candle as a light so he muttered a spell to turn on the light of the lamp on the table. As the lamp gave him now a better vision he realised what the liquid was. And Gellert felt his heart skip a beat.<br/>
"Was zur Hölle...?" he muttered with his hands now covered in blood.</p>
