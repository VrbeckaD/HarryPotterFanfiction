    <p>“Well, well...what an unexpected visit.  I do believe you’re a wee bit early, wife.”</p><p>“Grindelwald—”</p><p>“No need to be so formal, dearheart.”</p><p>“—cease all correspondence with Tom Riddle.”</p><p>“You haven’t seen me in nearly a month and yet you’re so cold.”</p><p>“Don’t play coy.  I saw the owl.  I know it came from here.”</p><p>“Is it a crime to exchange letters?  Regardless, you act as though I don’t write to my own son.”</p><p>“It’s the summer holidays.  Mr. Riddle must have neglected to inform you that he and his wife are staying at Hogwarts for the upcoming school year,” says Albus, the man continuing to stare down his nose at the seated figure of Gellert Grindelwald.  Despite being imprisoned for nearly three decades, Gellert’s blue-eyed gaze twinkles nearly as much as Albus’ does.  It is equal parts charming as it is infuriating.</p><p>The smile, curling across that handsome face of his, is even moreso.  “Well, you would have found out sooner or later, regardless.  Although, I’m glad it was sooner or I wouldn’t have received this delightful little visit, now would I?”</p><p>A small frown overtakes Albus’ lips as he steps closer, his long periwinkle robes brushing against the stones as the distance between the two men shortens by quick degrees.  When Albus finally stops, he’s standing a hair’s breadth away from Gellert, close enough for their robes to brush.  “Gellert.”  A blond eyebrow arches because there are only two instances in which Albus uses his given name, and in this case, it means that he wants something.  “You know I...appreciate that you keep in contact with Aberforth.  That was one of the allowances made when I facilitated your capture here, instead of at Azkaban.”</p><p>"It's a wonder who paid the ultimate price: You, me, or our children?"  Albus face hardens a bit but he remains stoic at the line of questioning, refusing to let those familiar words deter him.  Gellert's lips quirk in something akin to a grimace before he turns back to the conversation at hand.  “I suppose if any of my estranged followers were to discover that I’d somehow managed to sneak out unauthorized correspondences…”</p><p>“Exactly," says Albus, and he almost has to force himself to continue because Gellert's earlier questioning, as always, is like a poisonous barb, digging into him and if left untreated, would yet again cause him to question everything he's done in his life.  Or, just everything that had lead up to Ariana's death.  "The state of the wizarding world is precarious enough without adding fuel to the fire.”</p><p>“And why are you so sure that Tom’s agenda would align with my own?”</p><p>“You’re writing to him.  I knew he was dangerous before, but now…”</p><p>“I write to Aberforth as well.”  At Albus’ silence, Gellert sighs.  “Are you still upset about the goats?”</p><p>“This isn’t about the bloody <i>goats.</i>  I don’t trust Tom Riddle, not as far as I can throw him.”</p><p>“Why, because he’s ambitious?  He’s a talented wizard with a vision, and drive enough to see it come to fruition.  Or is your lack of trust because he reminds you of someone?  They say the memory can grow fuzzy with age but a Pensieve should take care of that.  If you look back, to all those years ago, you’ll realize that when you see Tom Riddle, you see me.  But if you look a bit deeper, you’ll actually see yourself.”</p><p>Albus’ face crumbles a bit before he steels himself, voice cool and biting as he replies.  “His status has nothing to do with this.”</p><p>“It has everything to do with this, but that’s not what I’m talking bout, and you know it.”  Albus falls silent, gaze lowered as he stares blankly into Gellert’s lap.  His eyes only refocus once the movement of Gellert’s hand catches his gaze, the elegant fingers that had once commanded the elder wand reaching up to gently pull at the ends of Albus’ hair.  “I remember the first time I saw you.  Your hair was like spun copper, and even more dazzling than your eyes as it gleamed under the sun.”</p><p>“There’s about as much grey as red now.”</p><p>“Hm, true.  But I don’t mind since I’m the one who gave you your first greys.”  </p><p>Albus doesn’t get a chance to respond as Gellert’s fingers wrap in the strands of his hair, finding purchase so that he can pull Albus down far enough for their lips to press together.  The kiss is soft, yet Gellert’s lips and tongue stroke a heat in Albus as they draw sighs of pleasure from him.  When Gellert draws back from the kiss, Albus finds himself kneeling across his husband’s lap, chest rising and falling—panting, really.  His own hands had risen of their own accord to twine in the golden locks of Gellert’s own hair.</p><p>Albus lets out a laugh.</p><p>“What is it?” asks Gellert, his hands gently rubbing across Albus back and shoulders, warm hands cupping his neck and his cheeks, brushing through his hair again, as he stares up into Albus’ eyes.</p><p>“You gave me quite a laugh, you know.  About my hair.”</p><p>“It’s true.”</p><p>Albus’ lips twist into a wry smile as his fingers continue to stroke at Gellert’s golden locks.  “I suppose.  Although I find it a bit ironic, or fitting perhaps, that while I should be the one going grey you’ve yet managed to keep every single strand of that golden hair of yours.”</p><p>“The wicked don’t age.”  Albus falls silent, his hands dropping down to his sides before, abruptly, he moves to stand up.  Gellert’s roaming hands tighten, his larger hands managing to keep Albus closer.  “Don’t go.”</p><p>“...then perhaps next time you shall think before saying such things in jest.”</p><p>“Yes, of course, dearheart.”  Gellert grins up at Albus before the two are kissing again, and this time when they draw back for breath it’s not until Gellert has Albus pressed beneath him, his periwinkle robes hiked up to his waist and the long strands of his hair all askew.</p><p>“He’s not like me.”</p><p>“What?” asks Albus dazedly.  Usually, at this point in the visit, there isn’t much talking going on.  Plus, Albus has practically trained his ears to filter out most of the conversation after this point as sweetly whispered endearments are much too bittersweet for him.</p><p>“Tom Riddle.  He’s a Half-blood raised by Muggles.  He actually raised quite a few interesting points…”</p><p>“I don’t want to talk about Riddle any longer, not now.”</p><p>“Yes, I suppose you have to deal with him nine months out of the year so it’s only fitting that you should allow me to occupy the other three.”</p><p>With that, the couple fall silent, leaving all manner of disagreement in the wind as their bodies come together in a way that had felt akin to destiny once upon a time, when they’d finally had tied the knot after that fated day of their first meeting.  Like most of Albus’ visits, their lovemaking usually starts out as such.  Soft kisses and heated gazes, murmured words against his skin as Gellert parts Albus’ robes so that his lips can try the impossible task of kissing every freckle upon his skin.  They aren’t very visible as Albus’ traditional upbringing had kept him muchly out of the sun, but Gellert enjoys the task nonetheless.</p><p>Gellert’s mouth moves lower, and lower still, until Albus is gasping in pleasure as his husband finally finds that secret place behind his bollocks.  Gellert wraps a hand around Albus’ cock, causing the other wizard to shudder in pleasure as he strokes the heated flesh twice before carefully moving it out of the way.  Every time he’s like this, back arched and legs spread with his hole wet and twitching in eagerness, Albus can't help but to feel utterly wanton.</p><p>If the wolfish grin on Gellert’s face is anything to go by, the other man knows exactly how Albus feels.  “What’s this?  It hasn’t even been as long as usual yet you’re <i>aching</i> for it, aren’t you.” </p><p>“I am <i>not</i>,” Albus gasps out, thighs quivering now as Gellert wastes no time in pressing his lips to that secret place, licking and sucking and practically lapping up his juices as though he hasn’t eaten in days.</p><p>That thought alone has Albus groaning in pleasure, his fingers once again twining through Gellert’s golden locks as his hips begin to grind back and forth in a sensual movement, desperate for more of that sinful touch.</p><p>“Please, <i>please</i>, I’m so close.”  Gellert just hums against Albus’ folds, and the vibration goes straight to Albus’ clitoris.  It’s enough to have Albus’ eyes rolling into the back of his head, his half-moon spectacles sliding off of his nose as he begins to thrash around.   “Oh, <i>oh</i>.”  Albus’ limbs grow taunt, and his thighs that had been quivering about Gellert’s ears turn into iron bands are he tightens them around his husband’s head.</p><p>Certainly, it’s a bit uncomfortable for Gellert but it’s absolutely worth all of the gasps and cries leaving Albus, so the blond rides out the wave, his mouth wrapping around the sweet nub before sucking ferociously on the sensitive bundle of nerves.  It’s not until Gellert manages to slip a finger inside of Albus’ opening that the redhead finally tumbles over the edge.  His cries of pleasure echo around the room as a rush of fluid splatters across the trim beard of Gellert's chin.  The iron grip around Gellert’s head turns lax, and when Gellert draws up to view his handy work, it’s to see a flushed and quivering mess.</p><p>“Well, aren’t you a sight for sore eyes,” says Gellert, voice smug as he smacks his lips.  His chin is still wet from Albus’ release but he doesn’t make a move to wipe at the moisture.  “But you’re quite the greedy little thing, aren’t you?”  </p><p>Albus stares up at Gellert with a hooded gaze, the man swimming in post-orgasmic bliss and rendered momentarily speechless.  Gellert does, however, manage to draw another shuddering gasp from him when those warm hands of his wrap around Albus’ weeping cock.  When Albus reminds silent outside of his soft cries of pleasure, Gellert gives the man's cock a slow stroke, all the way up the shaft before his palm twists at the head.  As if a switch has been hit, Albus’ body begins to quiver again.</p><p>“P-please.  I need you.  In me.”  </p><p>Hearing those words has Gellert groaning in pleasure, which causes the flush on Albus’ skin to deepen.  That finger that had pushed Albus into orgasm once more finds it’s home between the soft, silken folds of Albus’ heat.  Albus’ hips begin to move along the digit, his body jerking inelegantly as it tries to seek out both pleasures at once: of Gellert fingering him while his other hand continues to stroke Albus’ cock.</p><p>Once Gellert adds a second finger, Albus is an unintelligible mess.  The hold on his cock isn’t tight enough to milk him to orgasm, and the two fingers in his cunt aren’t thick enough, <i>long enough</i>, for what he needs.  “Need you.  In me, in me.  Please.”  Albus’ voice ends on a small keen as his body begins to thrash around again, tortured by dual sensations of pleasure.</p><p>Gellert lets out another hum, as though assessing the situation and indeed that is so, because the moment that Albus finds himself teetering on the edge, is the moment that Gellert removes his hands from Albus.  Albus’ lets out a frustrated cry as his hips continue to move on nothing but air for the brief seconds it takes for his body to realize the futility of continuing it’s earlier motions.  Albus lets out a little mournful wail at the loss, and when his eyes finally manage to flutter back open it’s to see Gellert hastening out of his prison robes.</p><p>Albus lowers a hand to wrap around his cock, stroking himself as he watches with hooded eyes as Gellert mirrors the motion on his own dick.  When Gellert lowers himself to kneel between Albus’ spread legs, the redhead parts them wider, nearly feverish for the body in front of him.  It’s not until the firm press of a cockhead against his wet folds that Albus seems to snap out of his lust-induced haze.</p><p>“Gellert, stop!”  Gellert’s body is poised, taut like a bowstring as the order from Albus holds him still.  Albus doesn’t speak again until the echo of his voice has died in the room.  When he does, it’s barely above a whisper.  “You know that I cannot.”</p><p>“You <i>can.</i>”</p><p>Albus’ head shakes and, dear Merlin, there’s even tears prickling at the corner of his eyes.  “N-no, I cannot.  I can’t go through that again.  Ariana...”</p><p>Gellert sighs.  “Albus, you're not the only one who lost something that day.  Ariana paid the price for my capture; this cannot change.”</p><p>“Yet, even so…”</p><p>“Dearheart, we’re practically in our middle years.  Do you truly believe I’m going to get you with child?  It’s utterly preposterous!  Anyone who heard such a thing would surely laugh themselves into an early grave.  And if you mention Aberforth yet again, that was well over fifteen years ago!”  Albus frowns, and when his cheeks flush Gellert knows it’s with indignation instead of with pleasure.  “Fine, just.  Give me the lubricant.  Let us not kill the rest of the mood.”</p><p>Albus' fingers move into his robe pocket to pull out the bottle of lubricant.  Gellert accepts it silently before gesturing for Albus to turn over.  “I’m not young anymore, you know,” Albus grouches out as he’s positioned on his hands and knees, with his robe being pushed to the side so that his pale bottom is bare.</p><p>“Young enough to catch a child but too old to enjoy it?”</p><p>Albus doesn’t respond to the sarcastic quip.  Instead, he braces himself on his hands and knees as the fingers from earlier once more breach him, although this time it’s his arse instead of his cunt.  Two fingers go in easily enough because, despite their separation, there’s a reason that Gellert always refers to these times as conjugal visits.  The fingers, slick with lubricant, pump back and forth with unerring precision as they seek out Albus’ prostate.  Suffice it to say, it’s not long before Albus is once again a moaning and quivering mess.  </p><p>“H-hurry.”  Gellert lets out a grunt before adding a third finger.  Albus’ back arches in pleasure as he desperately moves his hips back and forth to meet those digits.  His cock is leaking onto the bedsheets, weeping for attention.  “Use b-both hands.”  Gellert wastes no time giving into his wife’s demands, but from Albus’ desperate cry it’s not exactly what he was looking for, as Gellert’s other hand moves to slip two fingers back inside of his sobbing pussy.  “<i>Oh.</i>  Fuck, <i>fuck.</i>  Merlin!”</p><p>Albus’ deafening wail at his second—or third, climax, if one counted his cock and pussy separately—is cut short as his arms give way, causing him to land face-first into the bedding.  His hips are kept afloat despite his body's weakness thanks to the strength of the fingers inside of him that are still fucking into him, even while his overly sensitive body tries to shudder away from the motion.  It’s useless, however.  Albus doesn’t have the strength.  In fact, he barely has the strength to breathe as his lungs fight with the sheets clogging his throat and nose.</p><p>“Quite the little minx, aren’t you?” Gellert says, voice smug as he finally withdraws his fingers from Albus’ twitching holes.  Both of them are wet and nearly gaping, begging to be fucked.  The body beneath him is covered in sweat, hair and robes plastered to flushed skin with the bedsheets wet from the evidence of Albus’ pleasure.</p><p>Gellert’s own cock is aching to be inside of Albus, so Gellert doesn’t bother to waste any more time for Albus to pull himself together because with all the years they’ve been doing this Gellert knows that’s a notion that rarely comes to pass.  In fact, pleasure-infused as he is, the only thing that Gellert’s observed able to draw Albus from this state is the few times that Gellert tries to slide home into that wet cunt that was damn near like a siren song, calling to him.</p><p>But, as he’d done for nearly the last twenty years, Gellert ignores it.  Instead, when his dick slides home it’s in the incredible tightness of Albus’ arse.  “Fuck, but you’re tight,” groans Gellert, drawing his hips back before snapping them forward again.  Albus moans pitifully, face still firmly planted into the bedsheets as his thighs tremble.</p><p>Gellert has to wrap his hands around Albus’ hips, because trembling as he is, there’s no way Albus is going to be able to keep his arse in the air.  The sound of their lovemaking echoes around the room, flesh slapping flesh in concert with the grunts and moans of the pair as their bodies frantically move together.  Halfway through, Albus seems to gain enough energy to untangle himself from the bedsheets as his arms once more support his upper body weight.</p><p>Gellert takes immediate advantage of the improved position, reached a hand forward to wrap around Albus’ neck, his fingers taking hold of the man's chin so that the sounds of their kisses are added to the age-old rhythm that their bodies dance to.  When they were younger, Albus would have been well on his way to another orgasm by now, certainly blessed in that department considering he has the extra equipment.  Yet, it’s been quite a few years since that development’s happened so Gellert isn’t at all surprised that he finds himself cumming alone.</p><p>“Yes, yes.  In me.  Cum in me,” moans Albus’ between the kisses, blue eyes feverish as he tightens his arse around Gellert’s spasming cock, his arse as eager as his cunt is for what is being pumped into his body.</p><p>“Merlin,” groans Gellert as his hips stutter, thighs pressed flushed to Albus until his twitching cock has been milked dry.  “<i>Fuck</i>.”</p><p>When Gellert pulls out, he collapses onto the bed next to Albus, arms reaching out to draw the other man against his side.  Albus throws a leg over him, and it’s at this point that Gellert can feel the hardness pressing into him.  When Gellert reaches down to wrap his hand around the shaft, Albus just sighs, body weak from pleasure.</p><p>“Mmm, that feels nice.”</p><p>Gellert begins to stroke, up and down, fingers finding all the weak spots that he’s spent what feels like a lifetime learning.  Albus’ moans are soft in his ear, the redhead pressing eager kisses to his neck and the shell of his ear.  As Albus nears closer to another orgasm the redhead unexpectedly bites down on Gellert’s shoulder.  Two groans echo in the room as Gellert’s hand and thigh is splattered with Albus’ release.</p><p>Both men are left panting against each other, secure in the other’s arms before the two doze off into a restful sleep.</p>
