    <p>The sun was shining in the bright blue sky as a playful breeze danced through the Vatican’s gardens, ruffling hair and twitching skirts, causing more than a few nuns to squeal with laughter. More than a few smiles were generated by those happy sounds, including one that appeared on the face of Father Abel Nightroad as he cross the gardens on the way to his meeting. His long silver hair dancing around him from the high tail it was caught in. He had to admit to some curiosity as to why he was being summoned to Cardinal Caterina Sforza’s office as missions had been slowing down with the signing of the Peace Treaty between the three large kingdoms. Those in the Department of Foreign Affairs had been enjoying the peace in between the minor missions to put out brush fires from those trying to fill the void left behind by the destruction of the Rosenkreutz Order’s destruction, but Abel had not heard of any missions in the works that would require a meeting with Caterina.</p><p> When he arrived at her office, he was surprised to find two elderly gentlemen having tea with her. Both were dressed in suits that were fashionable several decades ago but were still very sensible. One had short cropped silver white hair and a walking stick next to his chair that showed a great deal of wear, indicating it was a needed accessory instead of a casual one. The other one had long white hair pulled back in a sensible tail, and a long beard that appeared to be longer than his waist with a little bow tied around it in an almost whimsical way. He also had a pair of half moon glasses perched on his nose, giving him a very grandfatherly image.</p><p> “Thank you for coming so quickly, Father Nightroad,” Catarina said, waving him to an empty chair before handing him a cup of tea prepared the way he liked it. “Masters Nicholas Flamel and Albus Dumbledore have requested the help of one of my best agents in a delicate situation.”</p><p> “What we require is someone to investigate a few things for us, and if necessary, deal with the problem,” admitted Dumbledore, absently pushing his glasses back up on his nose. “The first is the issue of a young man’s security and health. He is being emotionally abused by his relatives, and I could not swear that there is not physical abuse as well.” He sighed and stared at his cup. “I made a desperate yet foolish mistake nearly eleven years ago, and I wish to rectify that.”</p><p> “At the end of the Magical World’s Blood Conflict against the self-proclaimed Dark lord Voldemort?” Abel clarified as he did some quick math. The Vatican had been keeping an eye on the conflict, ready to move in should the situation expand out of the Magical World, but the situation had never progressed quite that far.</p><p> Dumbledore nodded. “Harry James Potter, Duke of Gryffindor, Potter, and Heir of Black, survived the murder of his parents during an attack on his home in Godric’s Hollow. While most of the Magical World celebrated the fall of Voldemort, his followers were hunting down Little Harry. I myself had to fend off three separate attacks by Death Eaters who demanded to know where he was, and I am only thankful that none of them thought to come to Hogwars where he was being tended by the medical witch there. In desperation, I placed him with his mother’s sister, a non-magical woman and set up wards to hide his presence from anyone actively hunting him. Unfortunately, Petunia Dursley nee Evans had me swear a Magical Oath that none from the Magical world would interfere with her life in exchange for her keeping Harry in her home.”</p><p> A faint frown crossed Abel’s face as he realized just how much freedom such an oath would give Mrs. Dursley, yet he also realized that a desperate man would make what he felt was the best decision at the time. “Why have you not taken your suspicions to the police?”</p><p> “The non-magical police would require proof, of which I have none aside from suspicions,” Dumbledore stated. “And if I went to the Ministry of Magic, it would be magicals interfering with her life.” He smiled, looking the part of the benevolent and kind grandfather as he spread his hand towards them. “However, bringing the issue to you as you are not part of the magical government or world neatly bypasses that little part of the oath.”</p><p> Abel hummed, realizing that the older wizard was correct, and Abel would have the freedom to poke around the young duke’s home life. “And the second issue?”</p><p> “We believe that the self-proclaimed Dark Lord Voldemort was never truly killed,” Flamel stated,speaking for the first time. “Last summer, there was some<em> thing </em> trying to get through the wards around my home, and Perenelle suggested setting a trap for it. So, with Albus’ help, we made it seem as if our Philosopher’s Stone was first transferred to a high security vault at Gringotts and then to behind a series of traps designed to slow down the thief until they could be captured.”</p><p> “Such a trap would need constant monitoring, so I had an unused section of Hogwarts repurposed to contain the trap,” Dumbledore explained. “The students were warned away from the area, and those that didn’t listen to the warning were confronted by a very large and fierce looking Cerberus.” He paused and tilted his head. “I must remember to arrange for Fluffy to be returned to Greece soon.”</p><p> “What happened?” Inquired Abel, gently directing Dumbledore back to the topic of the conversation.</p><p> “Duke Potter and his two friends managed to get through the various puzzles protecting the stone, and His Grace went on ahead after Ronald Weasley was injured and Hermione Granger was sent back to tend their injured friend by His Grace,” explained Dumbledore, looking like his years were pressing down on top of him. “I managed to get down to them as quickly as I could with some of my more dependable teachers to find His Grace unconscious, the stone next to him where it had fallen out of his pocket, and the empty clothes of one of my other teachers.”</p><p> Refilling the various cups of tea, Abel knew that the wizard would finish his story in his own time, but he silently prayed to Lady Brigit for patience. The one thing he hated was someone who dragged out their explanation because they fancied themselves a storyteller.</p><p> “He told me how Quirinus Quirrell had been carrying the wrath of Voldemort on the back of his head and that he had collapsed due to pain in his scar,” stated Dumbledore, putting his cup down and folding his hands in his lap. “He has recovered from his ordeal, but all attempts at trying to convince the Ministry of Magic to begin an investigation has been stalled or dismissed by the Minister. Not even my position as Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot can get an investigation started with any earnest.”</p><p> Before Abel could ask any questions, Dumbledore reached into a pocket and pulled out a lapis lazuli carved into a small serpent, followed by Flamel. They held out the serpents to Catarina who took them with with slightly shaking fingers. “This must mean a great deal to you both if you are calling in these, gentlemen,” she stated, her voice not betraying her emotional state of mind at all. “A Favor Marker from an Ancient Family isn’t cashed in lightly.”</p><p> “If it will prevent a second Blood War, it will be worth it,” Flamel stated with a shake of his head. “Your agent will also have all my skills and knowledge at his disposal until Voldemort in whatever form and under whatever name is delivered to the Cailleach once and for all.”</p><p> “And I have a decade’s worth of apologies to make to young Harry,” murmured Dumbledore, his blue eyes reflecting his regret. He shook his head and focused on them again. “I pledge my skills, knowledge, and political power to help your agent in whatever he may require during this mission to help Harry James Potter and stop Voldemort once and for all.”</p><p> Caterina inclined her head in understanding before turning to Abel. “Father Nightroad, as you are my best agent, I would assign this mission to you if you are willing to accept it.”</p><p> Abel was silent as he turned everything over in his mind. There was no way this was going to be a short mission, even with just the investigation into Duke Potter’s home life and the fallout from that would take weeks if not months to calm down with someone putting out the little political brushfires that such an investigation would automatically generate. He prefered to avoid politics just to ensure he didn’t cause trouble for his adopted sister in the Empire, but this would throw him fully into the Magical World’s politics if only by being associated with Duke Potter. However it was an intriguing problem, both helping young Duke Potter and also ensuring the destruction of one who caused so much terror and destruction yet slipped through the Dark Mother’s domain.</p><p> “If I accept this mission, there is one thing I want,” he stated, putting his teacup aside to focus on the wizards. “Complete control of the mission from the moment you walk out of this door. I will take your advice under consideration when I make my decisions, but they will ultimately be my decisions. This is as much for your protection as it is mine.”</p><p> He honestly hoped it would be granted, but he kept his expression neutral as Dumbledore and Flamel exchanged looks before Dumbledore nodded. “Of course, my boy. I would only ask in exchange that you keep me informed on the Voldemort investigation. That way, I know where you are and will be better prepared to help in any way, even if it is only offering a suggestion in where to go.”</p><p> “Any and all information that you can give me regarding Voldemort will be greatly appreciated,” Abel remarked with a small dip of his head. “As well as the name of someone trustworthy in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement in case I need the Aurors.” He was <em> not </em> going to pull a mission like this without having at least one reliable contact in the DMLE, because if things went pear shaped, he wanted to be able to call on someone for help that he knew wouldn’t send a cutting curse to his back.</p><p> “Madam Amelia Bones, Regent of the Ancient and Noble House of Bones,” Flamel announced without hesitation. “Good woman and strong leader, but her hands are often tied by politics and those that don’t want a strong Auror force.” Dumbledore nodded in agreement, and Abel nodded in understanding even as he wondered how corrupt the Ministry of Magic was to want to cripple the police force.</p><p> Rising to his feet, Abel moved around behind Caterina’s desk to retrieve a pad of paper and a pen before he resumed his seat and crossed his legs. “Now, I have a few questions…”</p><p> The sun was low in the sky by the time Dumbledore and Flamel left, promising to send further information on Voldemort’s past activities, and Abel had filled up a notebook with the answers to his questions. Caterina had occasionally interposed a question, but she mostly allowed Abel to talk while refilling cups and keeping her own notes during the conversation.</p><p> “What do you plan to do for this mission, Abel?” Inquired Caterina after sending one of the sisters to fetch a platter of sandwiches for them to split as a late dinner. “The normal cover is to send you in as a visiting priest, but considering how many magicals feel about the church, you would be lucky to get any assistance from anyone.”</p><p> “I believe I will have to contact Seth to see if I can pose as an Imperial Noble who is looking to expand their business,” Abel mused, tapping the pen on his lips as he frowned at his notes. Most of the rumored Death Eaters had been among the upper echelons of the magical society, and if he wanted to investigate any of them, he needed to be able to move among them with ease instead of having doors slammed in his face.</p><p> He looked up as a telephone was slid across the table, and Abel chuckled as he lifted the receiver. “My apologies now for running up your phone bill,” he stated as he started to dial a specific phone number in the Empire.</p><p> “It can be written off as a business expense,” Caterina remarked with an airy wave of her hand. “How else am I supposed to talk to our ambassadors if I can’t call them?”</p><p> Chuckling, Abel settled in to wait for his sister to answer the phone, and he flipped through his notes as the line rang.</p><p> “Where do I need to pick up the bodies?” came the immediate question the second the phone was answered, and Abel thought Seth sounded far too cheerful at such a prospect.</p><p> “Nothing like that, Seth,” chuckled Abel before sobering. “I have a long term mission in Albion’s Magical Community that will require me to move among the upper crust. As I can’t go in as a priest of the Vatican, I was thinking perhaps of posing as a noble from the Empire.”</p><p> “As Empress Augusta Vradica, I can do you one better and offer you a position that I created just for you when I built my Empire,” remarked Seth, her voice serious, and Abel could almost imagine her behind her desk in the Imperial Palace, paperworks scattered across the surface as she sat sideways in her chair, one leg thrown over the arm as she played with the phone cord in one hand.</p><p> “And what position would that be?” He asked, curious to know what position she had in mind for him. When he had briefly gone to the Empire as an emissary of the Vatican, Seth hadn’t mentioned creating any position just for him, but then they hadn’t had much of a chance to talk in between stopping assassination attempts.</p><p> “Imperial Crown Prince.”</p><p> Abel huffed softly and shook his head. “And how will your people react to suddenly having someone claiming to be your crown Prince?”</p><p> “I’ve been spreading rumors for years that the Crown Prince has been helping the Empire in various capacities as well as occasionally having one of my Most Trustworthy with your build making an occasional appearance in a veil so no one would question the sudden appearance of a Crown Prince.” Seth sounded quite smug about the entire thing, and he knew that she had out maneuvered him on this particular topic. Not that he honestly wanted to fight her on this since instead of having to seek out the Pureblood families, they’d come flocking to him in an effort to win his favor and his ear.</p><p> “Alright, I accept,” Abel said, shaking his head and rolling his pale blue eyes at Caterina’s curious look. She gave a soft chuckle before returning her attention to her paperwork. “How soon can you get me what I need?”</p><p> “I can get the various trappings and wardrobe to Sofitel St. James Hotel,” Seth stated, and Abel blinked in surprise at the name of one of the most prestigious hotels in Londinium. “I’ll have one of the Royal Suites booked for you and two others. Who is going to be your backup on this mission?”</p><p> “I hadn’t quite gotten that far yet, but I do plan on having at least two people from the Vatican as backup,” Abel promised, his voice earnest as he remembered their promise to each other after one too many missions that went pear shaped, and they were left without any backup. “I’m also going to contact someone trustworthy in the DMLE for magical backup as well.”</p><p> “Good. I’d hate to raize Albion’s Magical Community because something happened to you.”</p><p> If it was anyone else, Abel would have laughed at the joke, but this was Seth Nightlord, the Empress Augusta Vradica. She had the power and the ability to do such a thing if she put her mind to it. A warmth filled him at the thought of his adopted sister destroying a community on his behalf. “I will send you letters at least once a week, and if I get in trouble, you’ll be the second to know. The first will be my backup.”</p><p> Seth’s laughter echoed over the line and a few minutes later, Abel hung up. He huffed in surprise and looked at Caterina, feeling a bit dazed. “She’s making me the Imperial Crown Prince, and if anything happens to me, Albion’s magical community will pay.”</p><p> Caterina laughed and shook her head. “Only you would find yourself a Crown Prince without trying,” she teased. “From priest to prince. That’s quite a promotion.”</p><p> “That will definitely make my job easier and a bit more difficult,” sighed Abel with a mournful look. “Wearing a veil all the time can’t be easy.”</p><p> Laughter rang out through the office, and Abel chuckled, feeling like his job was done now that Caterina was laughing. He pushed the phone back across her desk to its former position before he turned to face her. “Now, let’s figure out who is going to be my backup…”</p>
