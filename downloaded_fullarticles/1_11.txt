  <em>All damn night, I was here waiting</em>
  <br/>
  <em> I know you were with her, I know that you kissed her</em>
  <br/>
  <em> You came home late when I was so mad</em>
  <br/>
  <em> Had my break up speech ready</em>
  <br/>
  <em> Then you kissed my face; it's the way you persuade me</em>
</p><hr/><p>Severus has been waiting for James for hours. <em>Why did I even bother, </em>he thought by himself.<em> He won't show up. Not today, anyway.</em></p><p> He sat down on a chair in the long-forgotten classroom they were meeting in every night.</p><p> "How could I be stupid enough to believe he would hold his word? Why should he come here tonight, when he has her?" Severus mumbled angrily to himself.</p><p> The quiet in the room seemed to mock him. Like it said: No one's here, who are you kidding. He's not coming. Who would come here for you? </p><p> There had been nights James hasn't come to see Severus. There had been nights he's waited and waited for James to see him. And there'd been mornings in which James had apologised, poorly. With a quick peck on the lips or a quick fuck, but never an explanation. There'd be an "I'll make it up to you", and then he'd do whatever he had in mind and Severus would let him because it was James.</p><p> Today, James's been in Hogsmeade with Lily. He was probably kissing or sleeping with her in the Gryffindor tower. In a warm, soft bed. Not in some dark classroom where no teacher or student ever expected someone to be. Where what occurred could be kept a secret. He suddenly felt ill.</p><p> Severus had been thinking about ending things with James. Loads of times. After all, they didn't have a future together insight.</p><p> He often pictured James and Lily on their wedding, them having a baby. After all, they were the "perfect couple" of the school. Yes. They were perfect. And Severus was just the third wheel.</p><p> <em>I'm going to end everything with James tonight. I'm ending it once he's here. </em></p><p>He had this list in his head, the list of what arguments to use and what to say. James was cheating on him. They could never have a future together, and if, they would never be anything more than an affair. He doesn't want to be James dirty little secret, and on top of that, he doesn't want to betray Lily like that (though he already has, but cannot do it anymore).</p><p> <em>Tonight, I'll speak my mind. I won't choose between Lily and James. She's my best friend, my first love</em>.</p><p> He couldn't pin-point what James was for him. He knew it hurt him that James was with the girl he always admired and loved. James used him as a toy.</p><p> Severus heard the door open, and his heart cracked in a million pieces when he turned around and saw James standing there. His hair was even more uneven than usual. Severus could see the lipstick from where he was standing. Merlin knows what they got up to apart from kissing.</p><p> Severus was about to say something when James smiled slightly, quickly walked towards Severus and kissed him.</p><hr/><p align="center">
  <em>You're dirty, disgusting</em>
  <br/>
  <em>But I can't get enough of your loving</em>
  <br/>
  <em>Boy, I hate you, really hate you</em>
  <br/>
  <em>My momma said I shouldn't date you</em>
</p><hr/><p> The memory of this afternoon fought its way to the front of Severus' mind. James has mocked him, with his stupid friends and his silly laugh and stupid spells that made him look like a looser. He felt disgust wash through him like a wave crashing into the rocks by the sea.</p><p> He had to admit to himself that it felt good - to lie in James' arms and feel his lips moving hungrily against his. It made him feel like he counted to James somehow. Like he was the only one who could make him want that he wasn't just a warm body at James' disposal.</p><p> But at the same time, he knew that he was supposed to hate James - and hated him. He did - for taking Lily, for making him love him unconditionally and for treating him like trash when his friends were around.</p><p> The memory his mother, pushing some strands of his hair behind his ear, looking at him almost lovingly often invaded his mind. That day she had explained to him that Gryffindors couldn't be trusted and that they always went in head-first. Back then, he had come home from his first year at Hogwarts. Immediately, he told her that Lily was in Gryffindor.</p><p>He couldn't send an owl. His father didn't allow any of those "awfully ridiculous letter pigeon-owls" in his house. After he had tried to protest "no, no, mother, Lily's my friend!" she had then added that it was dangerous to like someone so headstrong and different from yourself. Only now, he realised that maybe his mother had meant his father.</p><hr/><p align="center">
  <em>I wanna say, Shoo, shoo</em>
  <br/>
  <em>I wanna say, Screw you</em>
  <br/>
  <em>I practice my lies in the mirror</em>
  <br/>
  <em>Then you smile, that's my killer</em>
  <br/>
  <em>So I say, Love you</em>
  <br/>
  <em>And, Baby, I need you</em>
  <br/>
  <em>Cause you're drop-dead gorgeous</em>
  <br/>
  <em>And Cupid ain't coming to warn us</em>
</p><hr/><p> He lay awake most nights, finding words and ways to tell James that he didn't want this to go on, but he couldn't.</p><p> Because he loved James because even though he'd never admit it, James was amazingly beautiful. His stupid smile, the crinkles he got around his eyes when he laughed (even when he was laughing at him).</p><p> No matter how much he disgusted himself, James was like air to him. If he let him go, what would he do without the time they spent together? Surely James wouldn't stop mocking him, and the teasing might get worse.</p><p> In two years, it would all be over anyway. They would have graduated from Hogwarts.</p><hr/><p align="center">
  <em>You're cheatin', you're lyin'</em>
  <br/>
  <em>But, boy, right before I say that it's the end</em>
  <br/>
  <em>You sweet talk me again, yo</em>
  <br/>
  <em>I don't wanna be friends, no</em>
  <br/>
  <em>Why am I such a fool when it comes to you?</em>
</p><hr/><p> <em>That's right, James is cheating and lying and an awful stuck-up, filthy rich wizard.</em></p><p> He couldn't decide which part of his brain was louder -  then James pushed his shirt up. Severus tried to hold onto James' long fingers, to stop him perhaps. But James was already pushing his body against his, kept pushing. James moved his mouth close to Severus' ear, and Severus could already guess the alluring words before he heard them.</p><p> Instead of moving his head away, he listened to James, whispering that he loved him and that he's sorry for spending so much time with Lily. If he could, he'd always be with Severus.</p><p> Severus let the words affect him and melted under James' hands.</p><p> He didn't try to stop James when he started to get rid of their clothes.</p><hr/><p align="center">
  <em>I wish you were dead 'til you take me to bed</em>
  <br/>
  <em>You're so good, so good, you lead on, my love</em>
  <br/>
  <em>Oh, them brown eyes and that body</em>
</p><hr/><p>They put on clothes again, a little too breathless. Severus inspected a particular huge love-bite, too huge to hide in the showers, as James leaned towards him and kissed him.</p><p> The kiss was chaste, but James has not kissed him often after sex. He had started to only recently.</p><p> "In two years, when we graduate," James said slowly, "will we still ... be like this?"</p><p> Severus studied James' face, looked for mocking, for that sly glance in his eyes. He looked serious.</p><p> Severe enough to mean it.</p><p> "I don't know," Severus finally said.</p><p> "Do you hope so?"</p><p> Severus said nothing.</p><p> "I do," James said.</p><p> Severus glanced up at him suspiciously. James smiled, and Severus' heart jumped.</p><p> Like every night, James left the classroom first. </p>
