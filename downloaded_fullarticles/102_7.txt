  <em>April 1995</em>
</p><p align="justify">“There was a mole,” she said quietly, her eyes trained to the floor. “They divulged the nature of Severus’ role in the Order to You-Know-Who. There was no warning, no indication that he had been compromised; he just vanished.” She wrapped her arms tightly about her middle and squeezed her eyes shut. With a quivering voice, she said, “When You-Know-Who’s lackeys were sent to gloat, we knew all was lost.”</p><p align="justify">The room was deadly silent; her breathing felt unbearably loud to her own ears. Hermione swiped a palm over her cheek, wiping away an offending tear. “We knew they would come for me next. Severus hadn’t broken under their <em>ministrations</em>,” she spat hatefully, “and the Death Eaters believed I would loosen his tongue. We thought ourselves prepared because we expected them.” She laughed humourlessly. “How naïve we were.”</p><p align="justify">Alastor Moody scoffed loudly. “Why would Snape betray the Order for the likes of you, eh, Granger?”</p><p align="justify">“As his wife, I was considered prime leverage.”</p><p align="justify">Professor Snape pushed back violently from the table; the screech of the wood against tile set Hermione’s teeth on edge. “Enough! I will not allow you to humiliate me any longer! Is this a game to you, Miss Granger? Did Potter and Weasley put you up to an elaborate prank to torment your greasy Professor?”</p><p align="justify">She shrank away from him as he advanced towards her. “No, please…”</p><p align="justify">“Severus,” Professor Dumbledore said firmly, “sit down, please. When Miss Granger is finished, we will address your concerns. Until then, however…”</p><p align="justify">With ill grace, the Potions Master returned to his chair and crossed his arms, a look of barely concealed rage on his face.</p><p align="justify">At the Headmaster’s prompting, Hermione continued, “He didn’t break, of course; he was too strong for that.” She waved her hand in front of her face, cancelling the glamour she wore, and cringed at the audible gasps from those about her. She caught Snape’s wince just before he looked away and felt her heart clench. “No, it was me. I was weak.”</p><p align="justify">Hand over heart, Professor McGonagall gasped, “Miss Granger, what did they do to you?”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t remember everything, which I suppose I ought to be grateful for. What memories I do have, have blended together now, rather like one continuous beating.” She spoke in a detached, clinical voice, as if she were reciting a phonebook. “I know they expected me to fall apart immediately and, as such, were remarkably restrained in doling out torture at first. It grew progressively more sadistic as they tired of me, however. Rowle and Yaxley were especially passionate.</p><p align="justify">“Finally, they lost their patience and changed tactics. They,” she swallowed thickly, “would make me watch as they tortured Severus.” She dropped her head to her hands and rocked herself back and forth, her voice rising in pitch. “I tried to keep it together, but I couldn’t… couldn’t watch. I tried to keep everyone safe, but…” she trailed off. She startled when a hand came to rest on her shoulder and she shrieked in surprise, curling into herself.</p><p align="justify">“There now, dear,” Molly Weasley shushed the young woman gently, “you’re all right. Carry on best you can.”</p><p align="justify">“Sorry,” Hermione whispered. “Rowle was especially keen to keep me abreast of all the Order members they had captured and killed. From what I understand, their deaths were a lot faster and more humane than the ones Severus and I were sentenced to. If nothing else, I was grateful for that.</p><p align="justify">“It wasn’t enough for them, though; despite their best efforts, they couldn’t find Ron and Harry. Given that Severus and I took the brunt of their frustrations, I knew immediately that they would kill us, and without mercy.” When Molly’s arms tightened about her shoulders, Hermione crumpled and wept, wracking sobs jostling her so hard that she could barely breathe. In between the wave of tears, she stammered, “I had all but resigned m-myself to my death when a house-elf breached the wards and r-rescued me.”</p><p align="justify">“What of Severus?” Professor Dumbledore inquired in a grave tone.</p><p align="justify">Hermione looked away and croaked, “He was not long for death; he had served his purpose by then.” She took a deep breath. “The elf, Tully I think her name was, said that your portrait had sent her to get me. I didn’t think it safe; You-Know-Who had infiltrated the school with several of his Death Eaters and sympathisers. Augustus Rookwood was liberated from Azkaban shortly after the fall of Hogwarts and was appointed to the position of Headmaster.</p><p align="justify">“Nevertheless, I was assured that we would not be disturbed; at your portrait’s request, the elves had drugged his meal and he would have been unlikely to wake for several hours.”</p><p align="justify">Professor McGonagall raised an eyebrow. “I was unaware that the elves obeyed orders from portraits.”</p><p align="justify">The younger woman shrugged. “They don’t typically, I suppose; however, Tully said that the house-elves, and Hogwarts itself, did not recognise the Death Eaters as legitimate staff. They considered Professor Dumbledore the official Head and, as such, obeyed whatever he asked of them. As consequence, I suspect the portraits will not reside in the Headmaster’s study for much longer; I was told they were particularly riotous with the new appointment.”</p><p align="justify">“What had Albus wanted?” Professor McGonagall spoke again.</p><p align="justify">Hermione hesitated and averted her eyes to the wall ahead of her. “He had been working on a prototype for a time-turner that would allow the user to travel back in year increments. It wasn’t perfect, and the time-jumps were haphazard at best, but he insisted that I was the only hope to change the future we were condemned to.” Her expression darkened. “He was blissfully unaware, I suppose, that I was the cause.”</p><p align="justify">Molly tutted and interrupted her, “Never mind that now. A healer ought to look at all of these wounds, dear.” She waved off the frightened protests and looked to Dumbledore for approval. “I don’t want to alarm anyone, but, though the Death Eaters didn’t manage to kill her, these injuries might. She needs help immediately.”</p><p align="justify">The Headmaster nodded sagely behind steepled fingers. “I agree. We can continue this avenue of conversation when you are healed, Miss Granger.”</p><p align="justify">“Just a second,” Moody growled, “but who do you suggest treat her? Granger is too recognisable, and news would travel fast, no doubt. It’s not safe to have anyone look at her.”</p><p align="justify">“I suggest we enlist Madam Pomfrey’s help in this regard,” Professor Dumbledore replied, ignoring Molly’s indignant disapproval. “After all, she treated Severus all these years without incident.”</p><p align="justify">“And what, precisely, do we tell her?”</p><p align="justify">“As little as possible,” Professor Snape spoke with a sneer. “For one, mention of impossible time-turners should be avoided at all costs. The lot of us will be carted off to the Janus Thickey ward if we are not careful. <em>If </em>she is to be believed, and that is a generous if, she has irrevocably changed our futures with this conversation alone; we need to be more careful. The rules of time-travel still apply, in spite of Miss Granger’s flagrant disregard of them.”</p><p align="justify">Hermione shrugged out of Molly’s grasp. “And it <em>should </em>be changed! That future, if it could so be called, is not one we will survive!”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, like you said, because of you.”</p><p align="justify">“Severus!” Professor McGonagall’s shrill voice rang through the room. “How dare you talk to her like that!”</p><p align="justify">“How dare I? How dare I be the only rational one in this room?” He swivelled his head in Hermione’s direction. “Listen to yourself! Time-turners that can jump <em>years </em>in the past that just conveniently came into your possession? A daring rescue by way of a house-elf? Us, <em>married</em>? As I understand it, Little Miss Granger could not stand being the less important, less interesting member of the Golden Trio and fabricated this little tale so that she would not feel left out.”</p><p align="justify">Hermione reared back as though she had been slapped. “How can you be this hateful?” She gestured to the wounds over her body. “Do you honestly think I went through this much trouble just to seek attention?”</p><p align="justify">“Only you can know yourself, Miss Granger.”</p><p align="justify">Incensed, Hermione snarled, “That’s Mistress-fucking-Snape to you, Severus. I will not allow you to talk to me like that!”</p><p align="justify">“Address me like that again, <em>Miss Granger</em>, and I will make your life exceedingly difficult.”</p><p align="justify">With a feigned sense of bravado, she snorted. “You don’t frighten me, Severus."  Suddenly looking decades too old, Hermione sighed tiredly and said, “Look, I can understand your hesitation to trust me, or anyone. Under normal circumstances, I might even have encouraged it; however, it is imperative that you trust me now. I can’t do this without you.” After a pause, “Just… use <em>Legilimency</em>. We both know you won’t be satisfied until you’ve tried.”</p><p align="justify">“Absolutely not!” Professor McGonagall interrupted firmly. “This girl needs a healer and I will not have you manhandling her like some big oaf, Severus.”</p><p align="justify">“I beg your–”</p><p align="justify">“Haud yer wheesht!”</p><p align="justify">Stunned, Snape’s mouth snapped shut with an audible clack.</p><p align="justify">“Albus,” the older woman turned to the Headmaster, “are we to take Miss Granger to Poppy directly or have her come here?”</p><p align="justify">“If we want to keep Miss Granger contained to the five of us, it would not be in our best interests to keep her here. The risk of other Order members finding her would be too high.” The Headmaster tapped a finger against his chin and nodded towards the Potions Master. “Severus, I suspect it a very small likelihood that she would be discovered in your accommodations. Would you be willing to house Miss Granger until we find another alternative? Once she is healed, of course.”</p><p align="justify">“Really now, Albus,” the Transfiguration Professor started, “surely I can–”</p><p align="justify">“Your rooms see far too much traffic, Minerva, making it a risk I am unwilling to entertain. Severus, what say you?”</p><p align="justify">To all present, it was glaringly obvious that it took everything in Professor Snape’s power not to assault the Headmaster in some fashion. Through gritted teeth, he relented, “As my leader commands me.”</p><p align="justify">Professor Dumbledore clapped his hands together once. “Splendid! Well, Minerva, if you would be so kind as to Floo Poppy.”</p><p align="justify">“Certainly, Albus.” The older woman placed a hand on Hermione’s shoulder as she walked by and squeezed lightly. “You’ll be all right now, Miss Granger.”</p><p align="justify">Hermione gave her a watery smile in return before addressing the Headmaster. “I know how difficult this is to believe but thank you.”</p><p align="justify">“Do you know,” he said thoughtfully, ushering the young woman towards the Floo, “I saw your younger self not a few minutes before you arrived. Though you are an undoubtedly talented and powerful witch, Miss Granger, such a change in appearance was rather drastic. Pray, what is your age?”</p><p align="justify">“I’m twenty-two, sir.”</p><p align="justify">“Ah, a six-year time leap? I must wonder after your choice to go so far back in time.”</p><p align="justify">Hermione ducked her head in embarrassment. “It was an accident, sir. I panicked and toggled the time-turner before I was certain of the distance it would take me.” At Snape’s snort, Hermione’s cheeks burned brightly, and she scrubbed her hands over her face. Determined to ignore him, she muttered, “A world without goodness is no world at all, Headmaster. If I have to break every time-travel rule in existence to avoid such a fate, I will.”</p><p align="justify">“I agree, Miss Granger. I believe you.”</p><p align="justify">“Albus!” Professor McGonagall called, gesturing for the pair to join her. “Poppy is ready. She has locked and warded the hospital wing, so Miss Granger is safe to come through.”</p><p align="justify">Professor Dumbledore tapped Hermione on the shoulder, urging her forward. “Well, you heard her. Come along.”</p><hr/><p align="justify">“Good gracious! What on earth have you done to yourself?” a shrill voice bounced off the walls of the hospital wing. The school matron hurried over, all but dragging Hermione to one of the cots. “Sit,” she instructed tersely and began a series of complicated diagnostic charms. As she worked, the frown between her brows deepened and she pulled away with a decidedly pinched look on her face.</p><p align="justify">“You should have come to see me immediately! Amongst the worst injuries are a severe concussion, fractured clavicle, torn tendon at the elbow, two broken ribs, a punctured lung,” here she tutted disapprovingly, “bruised liver, fractured femur, torn ACL tendon, four fractured toes, and severe malnutrition. It’s little wonder you’re even able to speak! Do you realise, Miss Granger, that a number of these injuries could have killed you!”</p><p align="justify">“It’s not as though I could help it,” Hermione muttered petulantly.</p><p align="justify">Ignoring her, the mediwitch disappeared to rummage through the storage room, the sound of clinking bottles following in her wake. When she returned, several beakers drifting behind her, she addressed the young woman in a no-nonsense tone, “Right, you’ll need a few doses of Skele-Gro, bruise paste, Murtlap Essence for those cuts, something to clear that wound over there,” she waved her hand over Hermione’s chest, “and a sleeping draught.”</p><p align="justify">Upon administering some truly vile potions, Madam Pomfrey cast a <em>Ferula </em>spell, binding and splinting Hermione’s limbs tightly. One by one, each wound was sanitised and closed until the mediwitch gave a satisfied nod. With a final flick of her wand, the empty beakers and used supplies vanished from sight. “I’m going to give you a dose of Dreamless Sleep to knock you out while the Skele-Gro does its work. Your body needs time to heal, so you are not to leave that bed until I give you the go-ahead. Do you understand?”</p><p align="justify">Hermione nodded and squeaked out a pathetic ‘<em>yes</em>.’ She swallowed the last potion with a grimace and lay back on the pillows, waiting for sleep to claim her.</p><p align="justify">“Thank you, Poppy,” Dumbledore spoke at last, taking his spectacles from his nose and cleaning them on his robes. “As always, we are indebted to you.”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, well,” she sniffed and wiped her palms over her apron. “When you have a moment, Albus, I require an explanation.”</p><p align="justify">He dipped his head. “Of course, Poppy.”</p><p align="justify">“Right! The rest of you need to leave; I don’t want anyone harassing my patient. Severus, that includes you, too. Out!”</p><p align="justify">When all but two remained, the Headmaster motioned for Madam Pomfrey to follow him and they, too, left Hermione to sleep. In the darkness, the silence was deafening. Hermione stared at the ceiling, unseeing, as flickers of memories danced behind her eyes. Though her body felt heavy and sluggish, she fought the impending slumber; she felt ill prepared to confront the demons that emerged as she slept.</p><p align="justify">“How weak it is to be so affected by dreams,” she whispered aloud, feeling foolish.</p><p align="justify">It was true that nightmares had plagued her in the past, each changing – evolving – into something more terrifying than the last; however, she had always known that they were <em>not real</em>. But, as time dragged on, doubts emerged; the wisps of dreams were becoming tangible, almost indistinguishable from her waking hours. <em>“You know, you really should learn to tell the difference between dreams and reality…”</em></p><p align="justify">A sudden feeling of foreboding gripped her, and the hair on the back of her neck stood on end. Something was watching her, waiting. With great difficulty, she manoeuvred herself upright, her heart slamming in her chest.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>There, outside.</em>
</p><p align="justify">Without thinking, she swung her legs out of bed and hobbled to the front doors of the infirmary. The corridor ahead was shrouded in a darkness that seemed to creep towards her. Closer, closer, it quietly consumed all that it touched. As it bore down on her, she was struck with a horrifying thought – <em>it was coming for her</em>. Her mind screamed at her to run, but her legs were rooted to the ground as if weighted by concrete. Her breaths were now coming in short, shallow bursts and prickles of light danced in her vision. She could feel them on her now – the eyes – and it made her skin crawl in fear.</p><p align="justify"><em>Move Hermione</em>, her mind pleaded, <em>move!</em></p><p align="justify">The darkness swirled around her legs and inched up her skin, searing her flesh as it went. It twisted about her chest and squeezed, forcing the air from her lungs. It was becoming too dark to see, and she shut her eyes, desperately hoping for the end. Slowly, a welcome numbness washed over her extremities, dousing the raging fire that burned beneath her skin.</p><p align="justify">The blackness could sense her weaken and knew, of course, that she was resigning herself to the inevitable. The sound of her pulse slowed in her ears, and she breathed a small sigh of relief; it would all be over soon.</p><hr/><p align="justify">A bloodcurdling scream rang through the hospital wing, shocking Hermione awake. The screams were becoming louder, more insistent, and it took her far too long to realise that they were her own. Her heart thundered in her chest and she shot out of bed, confused and panicked.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Darkness.</em>
</p><p align="justify">“Miss Granger! Get back into that bed, immediately!”</p><p align="justify"><em>Pain</em>.</p><p align="justify">“Stupid girl, do as you are told.”</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Fear.</em>
</p><p align="justify">“Where is it!” she shrieked, looking around frantically. “I know it’s here! I can still feel it.”</p><p align="justify">Two hands clamped down on her shoulders and spun her around. “Miss Granger, we need you to calm down and get back into that bed.” Near black eyes bore into her own. “If you do not comply, I will drag you back and gladly knock you out myself. Do you understand?"</p><p align="justify">She gave a weak nod and allowed herself to be steered back to her cot. In a daze, Hermione looked about her, shocked by the sunlight streaming through the infirmary windows. <em>Was it really daytime already?</em></p><p align="justify">“B-But…” she stammered.</p><p align="justify">“What is it, Miss Granger?” asked Professor Dumbledore.</p><p align="justify">“It’s nothing,” she mumbled, brow crinkling, “my mistake.”</p><p align="justify">He peered at her over his half-moon spectacles. “How are you feeling this morning?”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t know,” she answered honestly.</p><p align="justify">“Last night, I convened with Severus and we discussed your offer to have <em>Legilimency </em>performed on you. Both he and I are of the opinion that it would be the least traumatic way for you to relay information. Would you be up to Severus performing the spell? If not, I would be happy to assist you instead.”</p><p align="justify">She shook her head and swallowed thickly before speaking, “No. I’d prefer it if Severus did it.”</p><p align="justify">Professor Snape raised his eyebrow. “Very well.” He walked to Hermione’s side, pulling a chair behind him. “I assume you know how this works, Miss Granger?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes.”</p><p align="justify">He raised his wand towards her, frowning as she flinched, and cast the nonverbal <em>Legilimens</em>.</p>
