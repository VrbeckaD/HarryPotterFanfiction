    <p>James knocked on his brothers bedroom door, feeling nervous. James rarely got nervous. James was the one who was always casual, always able to remain cool and collected even in the most nerve wracking situations, (like the time Gryffindor was just 10 points away from winning the cup in his seventh year; or the time where he was about to lose his virginity to one of the hottest girls at hogwarts) but this was different. Even thinking about having this type of conversation with his brother scared him; he was about to enter into completely foreign territory. One that involved strong arms, flat, hard chests, and cock (something that intrigued James just as much as it terrified him). </p>
<p>“Yeah?” Came albus’ voice from his bedroom. James pushed open the door. <br/>Albus was lounging on his bed, reading a muggle book that Scorpius must have given him years ago for Christmas. It was the summer after his seventh and final year of school. </p>
<p>James sat in his brothers desk chair after turning it around to face him. Before albus could say anything, James took a deep breath and blurted out what he had to say before he could delay it any longer. </p>
<p>“I think I might be bi,” he said firmly. Albus raised his eyebrows at once and then grinned. </p>
<p>“Are you joking?” He said, smiling. </p>
<p>James shook his head, a little embarrassed. Albus had sat up now, after putting his book down. In this moment their personalities were reversed; James was sat on the chair looking flushed and embarrassed while Albus was as calm as ever, now on the verge of prodding James for more details. </p>
<p>“This is brilliant-“ said albus mischievously. “How long have you known- do you have a boyfriend?” </p>
<p>“No,” James said smiling a little. “And I don’t know- a couple months?” </p>
<p>“Shit- how did you figure it out?” </p>
<p>“I don’t know...I guess I just realized I was attracted to guys?” Said James. </p>
<p>Albus gave him a look that said that that wasn’t a good enough answer. </p>
<p>“I don’t know!” Said James. “I guess it’s always been there. To be honest I don’t know how I didn’t figure it out earlier- when I was still at school.” </p>
<p>“What makes you say that?” </p>
<p>“I don’t really want to say,” James joked, but there was a hint of seriousness in his voice. </p>
<p>Albus adopted a more serious tone after that. </p>
<p>“Hey- you can tell me anything you know? But if you don’t want to give me the details that’s okay,” said al. “Sorry I realize I was being kind of a prat there.” </p>
<p>“No- it’s okay,” said James, reassuring his brother. “It’s just- are you sure you want to know?” His smirk indicated it might be too much information. </p>
<p>“I told you about losing my virginity a half hour after it happened, James. I think we’re close enough.” </p>
<p>“Okay,” James laughed, not sure where to begin. </p>
<p>“Well- I don’t know. I think the reason I didn’t realize it sooner was because I always knew that I liked girls. I had a crush on a girl in first year and I never stopped thinking about them. I knew I was romantically attracted to them and I definitely knew I was sexually attracted to them- especially when I had sex for the first time,” he was a little red at this point. “So I always just assumed I was straight. Honestly I didn’t even think about my sexuality until you told me that Scorpius is bisexual and...I kind of realized it.” He hesitated at the next part. “I remember at school my dorm mates would always like, wank together- we played soggy biscuit a couple of times and it turned me on- like more so than when I was alone. I didn’t really question it- the first couple times it happened. I thought I was just really excited at hanging out with my friends- or something stupid. And I would always get hard in the showers after quidditch practice. I just assumed it was because I was anticipating wanking rather than the fact that there were 2 fit, attractive, naked blokes in the stalls on either side of me.” He laughed. </p>
<p>“Wow,” said albus. “I just always assumed you were like- the straightest person I knew.” </p>
<p>James blushed furiously, now as red as a tomato. </p>
<p>“So- have you ever done anything with a guy?” Albus inquired. </p>
<p>James shook his head. “Well- sometimes we would wank each other off in the dorms- but in like a ‘no homo’ way. We just figured out that it felt bloody good to have a hand on your cock that wasn’t your own.” </p>
<p>“Do you want to hook up with a guy?” Albus asked, ignoring what James said. </p>
<p>“I don’t know...” </p>
<p>“Oh come on James- you have to. I’m sure we can find someone- maybe go to one of those clubs in muggle London- I’m assuming you wouldn’t want to risk a wizard leaking anything to the prophet- and find some fit bloke for you.” </p>
<p>“I want to,” James said honestly. “It’s just- new to me. I’m almost twenty one and I’m like a virgin when it comes to guys...” </p>
<p>“That’s okay!” Albus reassured him. “There are so many blokes your age that are inexperienced. Besides, you can start with other stuff first. What would you be comfortable with?” </p>
<p>“I don’t know...” said James. “What ‘other stuff’ are you implying?”</p>
<p>“Honestly you should just start with kissing and see how that goes. You don’t have to do anything if you’re not comfortable. Just feel him up or rub him through his trousers or something and if you want to take his dick out.” </p>
<p>James was surprised at how explicit his younger brother was being. </p>
<p>“Trust me, Jamie, getting off with a bloke is so much better. You’ll love it.”</p>
<p>“Like you have anything to compare it to,” James laughed. “You’ve never been with a girl,” he pointed out. </p>
<p>“That’s because girls are gross. They don’t have cocks- well most of them don’t - would you ever want to get fucked, by the way?” </p>
<p>“Albus!” </p>
<p>“What? Sorry I’m just excited that you’re not straight. “But would you?” </p>
<p>“Maybe...not right away though,” admitted James. </p>
<p>“It’s unbelievable,” Albus said with a dreamy look on his face. “It’s so, so good...” </p>
<p>“Alright that’s enough Albus.” </p>
<p>“Would you ever want to suck off another bloke?” </p>
<p>“Err- I know I’d want to get sucked off by a bloke but I don’t know if I would want to be the one doing the sucking...” </p>
<p>“Some like it more than others,” albus shrugged. “It makes Scorpius go absolutely crazy when I do it to him. And I love him- so I don’t know if I would ever want to suck off other guys- even if Scorpius and I weren’t together.” </p>
<p>James felt overwhelmed. He put his head in his hands. </p>
<p>“Hey- just take it slow. You probably won’t like everything and thats fine,” said albus. “But would you want to come to a club? I could ask Scorpius and the two of us could be like you’re wingmen.” </p>
<p>“You don’t have to-“ James began. </p>
<p>“I want to,” said Albus. sincerely. “I want you to...experiment.“ I’ll ask Scorpius- he’s off from the hospital tomorrow night. Does that work for you?” </p>
<p>“Sounds good.”</p>
