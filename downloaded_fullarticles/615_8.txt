    <p>“Black, Cassiopeia.” </p><p>As I made my way to the front of the hall, I had to look both my brothers in the face. I had to sit on a stool and make eye contact with the boy that had been there since womb, and the one that had practically walked me through life. </p><p>I was split between two houses, trying to decide which I hated the thought of less. Parts of me wanted to forget them both and beg my way to Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff. As Professor McGonagall set that hat on my head, blocking out the interrogating gazes of my brothers, I cleared my head. I wanted to be sorted into the house that I truly deserved, not the one that I asked for because I couldn’t see any other destination. </p><p>“Another Black. Interesting...,” the hat sneered into my head. “I suppose you’d want to be in Slytherin, where your entire family has been. Unless… you’re like the other one. A Gryffindor, ay?. But your brain’s big enough for Ravenclaw and your strong will is enough for Hufflepuff. But I can see that your heart is saying Gryffindor, so I suppose I’ll have to say,”</p><p>The hat’s stopped speaking for a second or less before shouting out for the whole hall to hear, “Gryffindor!”</p><p>I felt my stomach twist as light filled my eyes and Regulus’ cold gaze froze my heart to stone. I stepped past him on my way to the Gryffindor table, but he refused to make eye contact with me. I was no longer a member of my own family.</p><p>As I looked down the Gryffindor table for Sirius, the wind was taken out of my lungs with the force of a human running directly into me. Sirius wrapped his arms around me. </p><p>“I guess our reign of being the Black family outcasts isn’t ending, yet,” he said.</p><p>“Wouldn’t have it any other way.”</p><p>He shook his head, still dumbfounded.</p><p>“I cannot believe you, Cassie. I cannot believe you.”</p><p>Our celebration was halted as Professor McGonagall called out, “Black, Regulus!” </p><p>Sirius and I turned towards the front of the hall to see Regulus sitting on the stool with force, his arms crossed. He’d never looked so angry. I could see that in that moment, I was losing my twin to the wrath of house division and cold blood.</p><p>“Slytherin!” the hat called within a second.</p><p>Regulus stared Sirius and I down as he marched towards the table of silver and green. </p><p>Sirius held my arm, pulling me down the table to where him and his friends were sat. I recognized them all from pictures hanging in Sirius’ room. </p><p>“Cassie Black, everyone. Everyone, Cassie,” said Sirius. “Welcome her, enjoy her presents even when she makes you want to shove a spoon into your eyes, and most importantly, respect my baby sister, no matter how much it pains you.” </p><p>I pressed a hand to my heart in mock appreciation, “You’re so sweet.”</p><p>A boy with destroyed black hair and glasses reached a hand across the table, “James Potter, pleasures all mine.”</p><p>I grinned at him, shaking his hand, “I’ve heard a lot about you, James.”</p><p>He looked towards the girl three places down with fiery red hair, “See, Lily, I can be a gentleman… if I try hard enough.”</p><p>I nodded, looking back at Sirius, “Yup, I’ve heard a lot about you.”</p><p>The boy on my left smiled, “Remus, uh. Lupin. Remus Lupin.” </p><p>His face burned red as he stumbled through his words. </p><p>“Chocolate?” </p><p>He held out a block of chocolate wrapped in silver paper. I smiled, taking a piece of chocolate from him. </p><p> “Lupin’s a little… awkward,” Sirius chuckled.</p><p>“Peter’s worse though. Isn't that right Pete?” said James, slapping the short, warty kid on the back.</p><p>The warty kid forced a half smile.</p><p>“I'm Peter Pettigrew, welcome to Gryffindor…” his attention flickered to the sorting ceremony, seeking to find how many kids were left to be sorted. “Is the feast starting soon?”</p><p>James cleaned his glasses on his robe, shaking his head, “Last two people, Peter.”</p><p>As the last two first years were sorted into Slytherin and Hufflepuff, Professor Dumbledore stood before us, “A new year brings new food. Eat!”</p><p>And with that the feast began.</p><p>“He's always strange like that?” I asked, stacking fruit onto my plate.</p><p>“Always,” said the boys.</p><p> Sirius looked at my plate and grimaced.</p><p>“Don’t look at me like that,“ I told him.</p><p>He grabbed another plate, dropped an entire steak onto it, “Eat it.”</p><p>“Are you insane?” I snorted a laugh before pushing it towards Peter, who had been eyeing the steak since the beginning of the feast.</p><p>My brother began shaking me by the shoulders, “You can’t live on fruits for the rest of your life!”</p><p>“Fine,” I began to make myself a small salad. “How about some vegetables?”</p><p>Sirius scowled and started shoving potatoes into his mouth.</p><p>“I’d say it’s a lost cause, mate,” Remus told him. “Not everyone’s a big meat eater.”</p><p>“You’re one to talk,” James chuckled. “You are the king of only eating extra extra rare steaks.”</p><p>I looked down at the massive steak the thin boy was eating, “Are you sure that’s been cooked? I think it’s still bleeding.”</p><p>Remus’ face turned a light shade of pink, “It’s better like this.”</p><p>Sirius’ friends seemed to accept me easily. They joked around with me like I was one of them and often made comments on how Sirius and I were very alike.</p><p>“Did you hear that Slughorn got chewed out by the ministry for how awful our class did on our final exams last year?” said James.</p><p>Remus rolled his eyes at this. He’d obviously not been surprised by this news. </p><p>“James, we had to be evacuated from the dungeons because you were trying to impress Lily during final exams. You almost killed me, not to mention everyone around us. No one got a chance to finish Slughorn’s exam.”</p><p>James went red in the face. He dropped the subject after that comment, not wanting to take the blame for the second year having to redo most of their first year potions in the upcoming term.</p><p>“I’ve been studying fifth year Potions and Transfiguration over the summer,” I said. “Only up to third year with Defense Against the Dark Arts and Charms though.”</p><p>“Only up to third year,” Sirius scoffed, stuffing a roll into his mouth and continuing to mock me through the bread.</p><p>James grinned at me, “Let me guess, you’ve already practically finished Astronomy and Herbology? Taken flying lessons, started Arithmancy, mastered the art of taming unicorns, and talk to all the dead people that you learned to channel in your time studying Divination.” </p><p>“Herbology is a waste of my time, I’ve been flying since I was three, Arithmancy is something that can be learned in Muggle books if you read between the lines, Divination is a scam, and taming unicorns is practically impossible. They’re one of the more gentle creatures on the Earth, there’s no need to tame them.”</p><p>“Guess we’ve got two walking textbooks now,” said James as he looked at Remus, a stupid looking smile on his face.</p><p>Remus rolled his eyes, “Glad I’m no longer the only one with a brain. I’ll be forever in your debt, Ms. Black. But, just so you’re aware, Arithmancy is a practice-”</p><p>“Of Divination? Yes, it’s used to accurately predict the future. It’s based on facts while the actual practice of Divination is based around fantasy. It’s predicting the future by pulling it out of thin air. I don’t believe in delusional guessing. I believe in facts.”</p><p>“It’s funny, my mom used to say something similar about magic,” Remus retorted. </p><p>“Even in a world like ours, you have to be able to draw the line of reality somewhere.”</p><p>I made small talk with the boys as the feast continued. James began bothering Lily Evans and I was informed that he did that a lot. Although I felt quite bad for Lily as she obviously didn’t have an ounce of compassion for James or his antics, it was sweet that he cared so much for her.</p><p>When desert started, I picked the strawberry toppings off Sirius’ cake.</p><p>“Not one for sweets either?” Remus asked me.</p><p>I shrugged and looked down at his piles of ice cream, pies, and cakes, “How does someone eat so much yet look like they haven’t eaten in days.”</p><p>Remus blushed again.</p><p>“I guess I work it off chasing after those two all the time,” he said with a shrug.</p><p>“I get that. My brother is a bit of a handful. Him and James together must be a nightmare.”</p><p>Remus rubbed his temples, “Just thinking about all the trouble they cause is giving me a headache.”</p><p>“Remus here is a prefect in the making,” Sirius told me. </p><p>“I am not!” Remus argued. “I was in detention with you guy six times last year!”</p><p>James chuckled, “Six out of the thirty eight times?”</p><p>My eyes widened and I looked to my brother, “Thirty eight times? How could you get yourself in trouble thirty eight times?”</p><p>“I’m acting out for the attention mum never gave me,” he said sarcastically.</p><p>“Awe, poor Sirius,” I sneered, yanking at a chunk of his hair. “Do you know how much hell I go through when you’re getting yourself into trouble? Mum goes absolutely mental when she finds out that you’ve done something else to disgrace the family name.”</p><p>Sirius pulled at my hair, “She doesn’t give you hell because of me. She gives you hell because you’re constantly disappearing and then coming back when the Daily Prophet has some sort of insane story with an unknown cause on the front page.”</p><p>I elbowed him in the stomach, “The fact that you were in a house filled with Muggleborns and Half Bloods was enough to drive her mad, and you know that.”</p><p>He pinched my neck, “Says the girl who’s been writing in her diary about wanting to be just like me for months.”</p><p>I pushed him off the bench, and we continued to argue.</p><p>“This makes me glad I’m an only child,” said Peter. </p><p>“This makes me wish I had siblings,” said James blissfully.</p><p>I rubbed my neck where he had pinched me, “It’s like you sharpen your nails just to attack me with them. You’re not a cat, Sirius.”</p><p>He slumped back into his seat, “No, you’re right. If I remember correctly, I was named after the dog star. You, on the other hand, mum was drunk when she picked your name.”</p><p>I flicked him on the nose, “Being named Cassiopeia Black is the least of my problems.”</p><p>“Yeah, I guess you’re right,” said Sirius, finally calling a truce to our attacks. “Andromeda and Edward are going to have a kid soon. They’re naming her Nymphadora Tonks.”</p><p>“Our family’s got problems with choosing names that won’t humiliate their children,” I said.</p><p>“I’m perfectly okay with my name,” Sirius told me.</p><p>“Probably because you are a dog.”</p><p>He gave me a lopsided grin.</p><p>“So I know you must remember me saying that you’d be a Gryffindor.”</p><p>I grimaced, “I don’t remember anything.”</p><p>“A galleon a paper.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Please?”</p><p>I latched my hand onto the back of his hair and pulled him backwards, “I’m not doing your work for you. You’re smart, you can do it yourself.”</p><p>“I won the bet!”</p><p>“There was no bet!” </p><p>He gaped at me, “Don’t you- I said you’d be a Gryffindor and I was right. A galleon a paper! Come on, it’s basically like being paid for doing something you love!”</p><p>“There was no bet! I would never agree to letting you cheat your way to school. We’ve got the same genes. We’re both smart, you just need to apply yourself.”</p><p>Sirius covered my mouth with his hand, “No! Don’t use the apply yourself thing that mum and dad use. I’m nowhere as smart as you are. I am not. I need help, Cassie. All of my professors hate me because I don’t ‘apply myself’ and I need you to be the one to change their minds.” </p><p>“Sirius,” I whined.</p><p>“Cassie,” he mimicked.</p><p>I took a moment, calculating my options, “Two papers a week, three galleons a paper.” </p><p>His jaw dropped, “That’s so unfair. We agreed on one galleon for every paper.”</p><p>“Two galleons, and half of the papers you get in a week or the deals off.”</p><p>Sirius smiled, holding his hand out for me to shake, “You got yourself a deal, Ms. Black.” </p><p>Remus looked over me, half a chicken wing in his mouth.</p><p>“Can I get in on the other half of those?” he mumbled through the food.</p><p>“Am I contributing to your book fund?” asked Sirius.</p><p>“Any money I get is contributing to my book fund,” said Remus, as though it was a stupid question.</p><p>“Fine. Cassie gets Monday, Tuesday, and half of Wednesday. Remus gets the other half of Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. You each get two galleons a paper. I can’t believe that I just sold all of my work for the entire year.”</p><p>Remus and I smirked at each other, a competition already brewing between us. </p><p>“Damn Sirius, you must have gotten the short end of the stick when it came to brains in your family,” James teased. </p><p>“He got the short of the stick when it comes to everything in our family. I got the brains, the personality, and the looks.”</p><p>Sirius scoffed, “The looks. That’s rich. Have you seen me? I’m the definition of a male sex symbol.”</p><p>“You’ve got the body of a prepubescent girl. I have better abs that you do.” </p><p>James and Remus burst into laughter, pointing to the dumbfounded expression on Sirius’ face. He shoved me into Remus and crossed his arms. </p><p>“I disown you.”</p><p>I pushed him back, “You can’t disown me!”</p><p> </p><p>This was going to be a year ending in many detentions shared with my stupid older brother. </p><p>I had never been so excited.</p>
