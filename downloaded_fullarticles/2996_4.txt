    <p>Cassy was with her brother at one of the potterhead´s convention for her 11st birthday.<br/>
She was the only kid who was in there; because she was surrounded by 20-30 yr olds who still believe in magic.<br/>
Cassy: this is boring; I wanna go to the mlp convention.<br/>
Eldain: don’t worry, you´re 11 yrs old, I think the owl has surprise for you.<br/>
Cassy: what.<br/>
Then an owl appeared with a card, it dropped the card to cassy´s hands.<br/>
Cassy: look brother!, I was selected for Hogwarts!.<br/>
Suddenly, all the grown up potterheads looked at her with jealousness.<br/>
Potterhead 1: what the hell, how about us?!, I was waiting for my Hogwarts card since 1997!, this is unfair!<br/>
Potterhead 2: oh shut up!, I was waiting for this since 2001!.<br/>
Potterhead 3: no one asked you!, moviewatcher.<br/>
Potter head 4: hey guys, chill out, we have the wizarding world of harry potter.<br/>
Potterhead: do you think that money comes from the sky!?,  I have wasted my money for a wand replica.<br/>
Potterhead 2: lucky girl, I hate elves, they have felix felicis instead of blood.<br/>
Eldain: let’s get out of there before they would say ``avada kedabra´´ with their toy wands.<br/>
After they go out, cassy looked at the letter.<br/>
Cassy: did you go to Hogwarts?,like dad?<br/>
Eldain: yes, of course.<br/>
Cassy: but, mom told me that…<br/>
Eldain: nevermind, is just momma faun things,well i´ll be with you buying those stuff.<br/>
Cassy: but first, I´ll talk about this to our parents.<br/>
Eldain: oh I almost forgot, have this.<br/>
Eldain gave to cassy his known best seller: how to deal with doctors who had an evil alter ego who is gonna ruin your life.<br/>
In the title of the book there was eldain wearing the white knight armor holding a sword.<br/>
Cassy: why did you gave me that,there´s no trolls in Hogwarts.<br/>
Eldain: just  in case.</p>
