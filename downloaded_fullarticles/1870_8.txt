    <p>&lt;<em>You’re a Horcrux, Harry.&gt;</em></p><p>Harry’s breath caught in his throat as the fateful sentence echoed in his mind. No… it couldn’t be. Clue… the voice in his head, the not-so-imaginary friend of his childhood-- was Voldemort? No, was a <em>piece</em> of Voldemort, a chunk of the evil man’s soul stuck inside Harry’s skull, Oh Merlin, get it out get it out GET IT OUT--!</p><p><em>&lt;</em><em>STOP IT!</em><em>&gt;</em> Clue yelled, his voice in Harry’s head so loud Harry clapped his hands over his ears in reflex, nearly cracking himself in the skull with the pommel of Griffindor’s sword. &lt;Calm down Harry! Even if you could get me out, clawing the scalp off your own skull isn't the way to do it. So stop hurting yourself.&gt; The stern voice waited for several moments while Harry got his breathing back under control. &lt;Good. Now, before we go any further, let’s get one thing straight: I AM NOT, NOR AM I A PART OR EXTENSION OF, LORD VOLDEMORT.&gt;</p><p>“You’re-- you’re a piece of his soul, you told me yourself,” Harry said.</p><p>&lt;Yes.&gt;Harry got the mental impression of someone resisting the urge to gag. &lt;But I am absolutely, positively NOT HIM. I am NOT.&gt; The revulsion was visceral. It gave Harry pause.</p><p>“But you’re part of his soul--”</p><p>&lt;Your finger is part of you. If you sever a finger and stick it in a jar, is it still alive? Is it still ‘you’?&gt;</p><p>“Well….no,” said Harry, reluctantly.</p><p>&lt;Of course not. I quit being even a part of Tom Riddle, or Voldemort, or whatever he’s calling himself today, the moment he cut me loose. And I’d like to hope that after all these years I’ve shown I’m nothing like him.&gt;</p><p>Harry swallowed and nodded. It was true. He was nothing like the cold, ruthless thing that Harry had confronted growing out of Quirrel's head, or the vicious and arrogant spectre that had inhabited the diary. The voice in his head he’d long ago dubbed “Clue” had been a constant companion, and had shown himself to be of good conscience and a loyal friend… if a bit obnoxious and snarky. Well, VERY obnoxious and snarky-- and rude. And opinionated…</p><p>&lt;I can hear you thinking, kid,&gt; Clue said sarcastically. &lt;If you wanna insult me, turn down the volume.&gt;</p><p>“Sorry.” Harry mumbled. “But you really are different from, well, HIM.” He shifted his stance. “...Why?”</p><p>Clue chuckled. &lt;Because Voldemort didn’t just make Horcruxes,&gt; he said. &lt;He refined the technique into a <em>self-improvement method.&gt;</em></p><p>Harry scowled in puzzlement. &lt;Think about it, lad, think about it!&gt; Clue said. his voice in Harry’s head was high and urgent, the way it always sounded when he was imparting something extremely vital. &lt;Put yourself in Riddle’s shoes. You’re an evil wizard. You’re willing to do anything to make yourself more powerful, more indestructible. You’ve decided you’re going to make yourself immortal by tearing out pieces of your soul. <em>What parts of your soul are you going to want to tear out first?</em><em>&gt;</em></p><p>Realization stole over Harry. &lt;Ah, the light dawns, does it?&gt; Clue said, his dry tones returning to normal. &lt;That’s right. Since you’re cutting out chunks of yourself anyway, <em>you’re going to want to get rid of any weaknesses. </em>Or anything you <em><strong>see</strong></em> as weak. Things like--&gt;</p><p>“Compassion,” Harry said, his throat thick. “Mercy.”</p><p>&lt;...Honesty, decency, charity, temperance, so on and so forth,&gt; Clue finished for him. &lt;Oh, and things like doubt, fear, sadness...&gt; at Harry’s mental noise of query he clarified. &lt;We have a word for people who don’t feel any fear, never have any doubt, don’t feel sadness, Harry. They’re called <em>sociopaths. </em>The so-called ‘negative’ emotions, the ones everybody today runs around trying to never let themselves feel, those are as important to your mental health, to your moral conscience as the so-called ‘positive’ feelings. Never being afraid sounds good till you realize you’re not afraid of anything, not even making the wrong decisions. Never feeling sad means never feeling sorry for your actions.&gt;</p><p>“Never feeling angry?” Harry prompted.</p><p>&lt;Means you’re angry at nothing, not even injustice,&gt; Clue said. &lt;Though old Riddle-boy seemed fine with holding onto wrath<em>. </em>Indiscriminate rage is one of the more pleasurable vices.<em>&gt;</em></p><p>“So what you’re saying is, you were his… his conscience?” Harry ventured.</p><p>&lt;Something like that,&gt; Clue said. &lt;“Or maybe I was the part of him that made him able to <em>have</em> a conscience.&gt;</p><p>It occurred to Harry to wonder what part of Riddle’s conscience Voldemort would have wanted to tear out last. “So what part were you? His honesty? His compassion?”</p><p>&lt;It’s not that simple, kid,&gt; the soul-scrap replied. &lt;Morals and virtues aren’t stuck in your head in tidy little boxes. They’re all interconnected, mish-mashed together. You can’t get one without getting little bits of the others.&gt;He gave the equivalent of a mental shrug. &lt;Whenever old Tommy boy decided to make a new Horcrux, he basically reached into his own head, felt around for whatever parts of himself gave him feelings he didn’t like, and yanked out a fistful to stick in one of his geegaws.&gt;</p><p>Harry winced at the mental imagery; it was anything but pleasant. “Wait… does that mean the other Horcruxes are--” he hesitated to say ‘alive’-- “Like you too?”</p><p>&lt;Doubtful,&gt; Clue snorted. &lt;In fact, let’s say ‘no way in hell.’ They’re just preserved, amputated bits. No more real life and awareness in them than a fingernail. They can seem lifelike, like a toy robot or a talking doll, but there’s nothing really<em> there.</em> That diary of his would have been in for one hell of a disappointment, so to speak, if it had taken over the Weasley girl’s body… a piece of a soul can’t vivify a body properly any more than you could reanimate Frankenstein with just a couple of scoops of random brain. It would have ended up a particularly talkative Inferi, shambling around and mumbling nonsense and not doing much else.&gt;</p><p>“So how are you different?” Harry challenged. "WHY are you different?"</p><p>There was a long silence. &lt;I don’t know,&gt; Clue confessed. &lt;I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about that-- I do mean A LOT of time-- and I only have guesses. I do know that I’m different. I can remember, I can learn, I can feel and think for myself, and cognito ergo sum, am I right? All I can guess is, from what little muddled memory I have of when I was created… Voldemort botched the job.&gt;</p><p>&lt;There he is, about to kill you and make his final get-out-of-Death-free charm. He reaches in, grabs that last little wriggling bit of his conscience with one hand, and hits you with the Avada Kedavra from the other… and it all blows up in his face. And that yanked-loose scrap of himself, instead of going into whatever talisman he’d picked out, goes and gets stuck in your head like a piece of Riddle-shrapnel… along with a lot of stuff he didn’t intend. Like a lifetime’s worth of memories and knowledge.&gt;</p><p>&lt;In one way I was like that Diary: when he made it, Voldemort included a full copy of his memories up to that age.&gt;Another mental shrug. &lt;It was his first try, after all. Maybe he wanted it as a backup for if he returned without his memory, who can say. Well, if you’ve done it once, it’s easier to do twice… &gt;</p><p>&lt;So at least I THINK, what got put into you through that scar,&gt; here there came an imaginary tap on Harry’s forehead, &lt;had little bits of everything. And back here in one corner in a little pocket, surrounded by a healthy, whole mind and soul, it… germinated. Till it healed and grew and became… me.&gt;</p><p>&lt;That’s why you were nearly five years old before you heard from me,&gt;Clue said. &lt;Before that point there wasn’t enough of a ‘me’ to speak up. I wasn’t sure I even WAS a ‘me.’ &gt; His dry, sarcastic voice in Harry’s head got somber. &lt;Figuring out what happened, sorting out what was really ‘me’ and was you and what were the garbled, mixed up pile of memories and information that came in with me--&gt; Clue’s voice was suddenly thick with loathing. &lt;Separating myself out from the horror story that was Riddle’s past, even as I was re-filing it and putting it all in proper order and locking it away--&gt; Harry felt him shudder. &lt;Oh, THAT was a load of fun.&gt;</p><p>Harry remembered that inaugural day; the day a stubborn, sarcastic, authoritative voice had begun faintly speaking up in little Harry Potter’s head, telling him how to pick the lock on his cupboard from the inside... “Is it… that bad in there?” Harry said.</p><p>&lt;Like being the curator at a Holocaust museum,&gt; Clue said. &lt;Be thankful I’ve locked and filed those memories away inside myself, kid. If you’d been able to access them, to re-live them as if they were your own, you would have spent your first years of life screaming. Then it would have gotten worse.&gt;</p><p>“Worse??”</p><p>&lt;You would have <em>stopped</em>.&gt;</p><p>Harry felt like ice water had been poured into his gut and through all his veins. A baby, growing up reliving the horror show that was Tom Marvolo Riddle’s memories… the <em>best</em> result would have been a broken mind. The worst… a child with Voldemort’s knowledge and all human feeling burned out of it. He hastily tried to move the topic of conversation along before he got the staring horrors.</p><p>“So you grew into a whole new soul,” Harry ventured. Stuck in someone else’s body, Harry thought. A helpless passenger unable to do anything unless Harry let him. What a horrible existence.</p><p>Clue gave a negatory grunt. &lt;I… don’t know. I don’t know WHAT I am, for certain. Whether I qualify as a whole person or just a fragment of human decency or even just a really active figment of imagination. But whatever I am, I decided pretty much immediately that we were stuck in this mess together, so I might as well make the best of it. You were my responsibility-- and anyway I wouldn’t have been able to live with myself if I’d let some kid suffer...&gt;he trailed off.</p><p>Harry felt a surge of warm affection for the voice in his head, the friend, mentor and adviser that had been looking out for him so long. “Maybe we can fix this,” he said suddenly. “Riddle… Voldemort… He figured out how to stick pieces of a soul into things. Maybe we can find a way to put you into a body of your own. A magical portrait, maybe, or a magical suit of armor… Dumbledore could help--”</p><p>&lt;NO! No, not him,&gt; Clue shouted inside his head so loudly Harry winced. &lt;Not him, not ever him, Harry. <em>We can’t trust him.&gt;</em></p><p>Harry huffed. This was far from the first time the recalcitrant mental voice had expressed mistrust of the venerable Headmaster. At first Harry had just taken Clue at his word, but it was growing tiresome. “What? Why not?” Harry protested. “He’s Dumbledore---”</p><p>&lt;Yes, he’s Dumbledore. And Dumbledore has an agenda for you. And I don’t think it’s for your good, either.&gt;</p><p>That stopped Harry cold. Till now, Clue had been cryptic, almost as cryptic as Dumbledore himself, about what made him mistrust the man. “What do you mean?”</p><p>&lt;Harry, pretty much every rotten bit of your life can be traced back to Dumbledore’s interference,&gt; Clue said. &lt;Right from the moment he played Ding Dong Ditch with you as a baby. And some of old Tommy boy’s memories tell me the old codger isn’t as benevolent as he lets on.&gt;</p><p>“Old Tommy Boy might not be the best judge of character,” Harry growled, annoyed.</p><p>&lt;Fine. Let’s review the little adventure we just went through, then. Let’s forget all the living portraits in the castle, and the ghosts, and the house elves, and the animated suits of armor, and all the OTHER pairs of eyes he’s got in Hogwarts that this giant sixty foot snake somehow avoided. Tommy Junior suspected the Castle’s defenses were blind to it thanks to Slytherin making the thing a part of the castle’s defenses, but still. Anyway, more important question: how likely is it that a hundred year old wizard-- the most powerful and knowledgeable wizard of the current age-- <em>would fail to recognize the effects of a Basilisk attack? </em><em>Something a schoolgirl found out in a library book?&gt;</em></p><p>Harry’s mouth opened and closed. &lt;Uh huh. Here’s some more to chew on. Why did he never evacuate the school? Not close it-- evacuate it. Call in the Unspeakables and scour the castle from top to bottom while the children are all someplace safe. The last time the Chamber opened, a girl DIED, Harry. Yet instead of leaving, he decided to act like a white chick in a cheap horror movie.&gt;</p><p>&lt;Let’s make it more personal. Isn’t it interesting that the “traps”&gt;--Harry could almost see the fingers etching quotation marks in the air-- &lt;protecting the Stone last year weren’t just weak enough for an eleven year old firstie to get past, but were all but tailor made for you, AND the ones in your circle of friends most likely to accompany you on a little misadventure? The Devils’ Snare for Neville. The flying keys for you. The chessboard for Ron. The logic puzzle for Hermione...&gt;</p><p>“The troll for all three of us,” Harry murmured.</p><p>&lt;--And the cerberus for anyone with a book knowledge of the legend of Orpheus,&gt; Clue went on. &lt;Hermione again… even if she wasn’t a bookworm with a classical name like that she was a shoo in to know it... or for that matter, anyone who held a conversation with Hagrid for more than five minutes&gt; Clue added snarkily...&lt; And of course a way to play a little bit of music. Like, say, someone with a wooden flute they got for Christmas?&gt;</p><p>The wooden flute was in the pocket of Harry’s robe; he carried it with him everywhere, one of his favorite mementos. It suddenly seemed to weigh ten stone.</p><p>&lt;And consider who he has working for him even now,&gt; Clue added as an aside.</p><p>Harry seethed a bit at the reminder. <em>Snape. </em>Courtesy of Clue Harry had known for years that the poisonous potions master had once been a Death Eater, and had been the one most directly responsible for fingering his parents for death. He had spent the last year choking down that knowledge, chastised over and over again by Dumbledore’s words on the matter. “Dumbledore said he’d reformed, that he’d turned against--”</p><p>Clue’s snort was as loud as it was derisive. &lt;By their fruits shall ye judge them,&gt; he misquoted. &lt;Spending every year since his ‘reform’ terrifying children? Tormenting the orphaned son of the woman he claimed to ‘love?’ Does that sound like a reformed man to you? No, Harry, Dumbledore doesn’t keep Severus around because the greasy git has seen the Light, he keeps him around because he’s <em>useful. </em>Just like he sees YOU as <em>useful.</em><em>&gt;</em></p><p><em>&lt;</em><em>You’re a </em><em>H</em><em>orcrux, Harry. A weapon to use against Lord Voldemort.</em> The Old Coot’s scared to death the bad tempered little animated fart will find a way to get a body and return to life. If he had an inkling of an idea that I was in here, talking to you, guiding you, ‘influencing’ you-- he’d think I was taking you over like the diary nearly took over Ginny and he’d kill me in an instant, and kill <em>you</em> to do it. And then cry big crocodile tears over our lifeless corpse about how tragic it was but that it was for the Greater Good...&gt; the sarcasm in Clue’s voice could have etched glass. It almost covered the fear.</p><p>That more than anything convinced Harry that Clue was telling the truth. “So what do we do?” He leaned against a nearby wall, the Sword of Griffindor still heavy in his hand.</p><p>&lt;For now, we keep mum, like always,&gt; Clue said seriously. &lt;And we work on getting some allies. Preferably ones with skills… connections... and most importantly the sort neither the Old Coot nor Moldy Shorts would ever suspect.&gt; His mental voice grew thoughtful, brooding.</p><p>“Like who?” Harry said irritably.</p><p>&lt;Like a certain House Elf who’s going to owe us one hell of a favor,&gt; Clue said suddenly.&lt;Look.&gt; Harry looked up; Just ahead, where the hallway intersected another, he saw Lucius Malfoy striding imperiously through, a very familiar gnomish figure scurrying along at his heels. &lt;Quick, pull off your sock and get that diary out. We’re about to pull a fast one on old Luscious...&gt;</p><p> </p>
