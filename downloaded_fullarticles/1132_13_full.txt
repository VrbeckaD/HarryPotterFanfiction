  <b>Lily Evans and the Decidedly Dreadful Day</b>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <b>Chapter 1: Cheerful Cherubs and Valentine Nightmares</b>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Lily Evans wakes up on February 19<sup>th</sup>, 1977, she sees red. Quite literally. Red everywhere. Her entire bed is surrounded by a red cocoon of velvety fabric. This is not the sight she usually wakes up to. It actually takes her a few seconds to realize what she is seeing, with one eye open – the other one being firmly set on her going back to sleep – before the strangeness of the red mystery makes her half-begrudgingly decide to open the other one. She knows what is happening now, with both eyes open, this makes a bit more sense. Or as much sense as this peculiar situation can make.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">So, this is what little information Lily has gathered so far about this <em>situation</em> she’s finding herself stuck in: her bed's crimson red curtains are drawn, which she does not remember doing when she got to bed last night. And that’s about it. And<em> that</em>, of all things, does not make sense, not all. She never draws the curtains. Never. She's both too tired and too lazy to care about that, comes bed time. And it's not like she needs to close them, anyway, she's not bothered by the morning light that pours in from the small windows of the tower and the curtains are really heavy and she doesn't want to have to struggle trying to find her wand to open them to prevent pulling her arm’s muscles trying to open it without magic. She's thought about this a lot, actually. There really aren’t that many advantages to drawing the curtains. And so she doesn’t. It’s actually a thing. A quirk. A characteristic. Her dorm mates know that about her. It is the sort of detail that people notice. So. This is quite strange. Unheard of, even. None of her friends would have drawn them in her sleep. That wouldn’t make sense.</p><p align="justify">Was it a mistake? It must have been, Lily thinks. Maybe a well-intentioned house elf sneaked in last night and drew them? But they’d never done it before, she thinks.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lily is quite puzzled by the event.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Therefore, she decides to stare at the thick red fabric for a while, rubbing her eyes and yawning a couple of times, trying to find the meaning of this decidedly strange turn of events. This is surely a sign. She’s decided as much, in the five minutes that have passed since she first started staring at the crimson velvet. She’s laying on her right side, her right hand extended in a way that allows her to stroke her index finger on the foreign object in front of her. She’s examining it carefully, as if it might start telling her the meaning of its presence.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She’s half-decided that the curtains are an omen of death – or war, or love, what’s with the abundance of meaning for red, anyway? – before she realizes that something – or rather someone – is making noises right outside the confinement of her bed. But the voices she hears are not those of her dorm mates. They’re too shrill and mechanical to be human. And that simply does not make sense.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">This is definitely not a normal way to begin her day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">So, Lily Evans sits up on folded knees, grabs the knitted cardigan that lays at the bottom of her bed – Merlin isn't it cold in here without the warmth of her blanket – puts it on and grasps at the bed's curtains.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She delicately tugs at them, both curious of what's out there and afraid of what she might see. She only has one eye to look out, but Merlin if she doesn't see more than she had ever thought possible from here.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And Merlin's bloody underpants if she doesn't wish she had just stayed under that warm blanket of hers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her dorm is a bloody red mess of rose petals and floating cherubs. She's never seen it like this. Not in her six years at Hogwarts, not once. And she'd thought she'd seen it all. Jane had once entirely decorated their dorm for Halloween, when they were thirteen and still giddy at the idea of monsters and scary stories told in the dark.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It's not even Valentine's day any more!” Lily hears Dorcas complain, one human voice in the midst of mechanical shrillness. Lily can make out some sort of rhythmic music playing softly. “Who the hell did this?” Dorcas continues.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lily tries to get a good look at Dorcas, but it's very hard to do so, from where she's sitting, and with one eye to boot, so she pulls the curtains a bit further apart, so that her whole face can stick out of it, the fabric tickling her earlobes. But that doesn’t help either.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">All she can see from here is Dahlia Fletcher’s bed, who is another one of her dorm mates and a close friend, both of their bedside tables, and what looks like Dorcas Meadowe’s at the foot of Dahlia’s bed. Oh, and about a dozen Cheerful Cherubs, which are one of the worst things Lily has ever had to face in her entire life. They have been everywhere in the past few weeks. People have been ordering them by the boxes. They are basically the trendiest product Hogwarts has ever seen in the six years Lily has attended the school. All they do is sing a song you’ve told them to sing, float around and throw whatever item you’ve given them to throw. Be it marbles, confetti, glitter, dungbombs… Lily has seen it all and has had to confiscate quite a number of those floating, bloated creatures. They’re horrid-looking, their spells seem to last forever and they never sing on-tune. She hates them. Every bloody single one of them and their bloody lacy collars and their tiny bloated hands and pink puffy faces.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Me!” someone says. It sounds like Dahlia, and it most certainly is. There is a small pause. “Oh don’t look at me like that! He asked me to! I said I would do it, he looked so happy! I couldn't say no to him! She's going to be so thrilled!” Dahlia continues, and even though she’s out of sight from this angle, Lily gathers that she’s facing Dorcas.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lily wonders what the bloody hell she's talking about. Who's the “he”? Who's the “she”? This is a really weird way to start her day. And to say that all she wanted to do today was get up, get dressed, go downstairs to have breakfast, head to Hogsmeade for a short trip – she is just going to go get a Butterbeer in Hogsmeade, then grab some candy from Honeydukes and a few more quills from Scrivenshaft’s – and then head right back to the Common Room, read a book, play with Sir Lancelot (the kitten her mum had gifted her for Christmas) and watch the fireplace from her spot on <em>her</em> couch. It was hers, and only hers, after all, ever since James Potter had bestowed it upon her last May. See, the thing was that she – Lily, that is – had been having a terribly lousy day and her feet had terribly <em>lousingly </em>hurt and those damn friends of his had organized a party in the common room. And she’d whined to James about how tired she had been for a while, and he’d managed to convince her to go to the party by bribing her with a couch for herself. And sure, she hadn’t actually had that much time to sit on that couch, but still… That thing about ‘it’s the thought that counts’? Completely and absolutely true. It is <em>her</em> couch now. Unofficially. But also very very official when she says it with her strong Prefect-y voice, the one she uses to get the Second Years to listen to her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They’re fine, James and her, they’re friends, she muses, forgetting about the curtains and the cherubs for a moment. Well, not <em>friends</em>, per se, but friendly acquaintances, at the very least. Friendly. That’s what they are. James and her. Friendly acquaintances. They chat idly when they cross paths, she says ‘hello’ to him at breakfast, and she’s quite happy to cheer him on during his Quidditch matches – she’s happy to say he hasn’t lost one all season. But of course he hasn’t. It seems inconceivable to her, somehow, that James Potter could lose at anything. He’s better than her in most of their classes, and it sometimes feels very unfair of him to be that good at everything all the time. She’d enjoyed her flying lessons, in her first year here, but she’d never been very good at it. Although she has to admit that it had been so very discouraging to watch him thrive on his first try. But he’d been offered his first broom when he was three years old, she’d come to learn this essential bit of information since then. It would have done wonders for her ego had she known about that five years ago. He had also told her, a few months ago, half blushing, that his father was a genius potion-brewer who had taught him all the essentials when he was barely old enough to know what he was doing. “I was so small,” he had then told her. “That I couldn’t see what the inside of the cauldron looked like.” “That’s why you’re so good at potions without even trying! How unfair!” Lily had laughed as she’d watched his face turn a tiny bit pinker.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But James’ success isn’t just due to the fact he has had the privilege of being born in a wizarding family. No, far from that. Lily has known that for years. He really is just <em>that</em> talented from birth. It’s just like him, to be good at everything without looking like he tries very hard, Lily ponders. But she actually sees him in the Library sometimes, at one of the tables near the windows, the light shining on his skin and into his eyes, making him squint at his books or unfolded parchments, he is always either deep in thoughts or reading intensely. She never manages to meet his gaze to wave and smile at him. He’s been very quiet, actually, this year. They sometimes can go for almost a week without a single prank disturbing the Common Room’s noisiness. It’s almost too quiet for Lily’s taste. Everything is a bit too quiet, too easy, too simple these days. It feels unnatural, somehow. Wrong, even. She likes the noisy, messy laughter and the ecstatic looks on James’ and his friends’ faces after they have executed their misdeeds and she has to pretend to frown and scorn.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lily’s thoughts are abruptly interrupted when, what strangely resembles a shrunken goblin head dressed in pinkish frills and lace, floats close enough to her to sprinkle her with a tiny, pink and puffy fistful of heart-shaped glittery confetti. And bloody hell if it’s not the itchiest thing on the planet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yeah well, someone better wake her up, so that this mess can vanish out the window!” Dorcas groans, as Lily tries – and clearly fails – to shake the tiny hearts off her face. They’re sticking to her skin like microscopic leaches and Lily has half a mind to set her face on fire to get rid of the tickling sensation.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And it is at this very precise moment that Dorcas turns around and sees Lily – or rather, the only bit of Lily poking out of the curtains, which unfortunately happens to be her head and one of her hands. Which wouldn’t be that much of a fright if Lily weren’t rabidly half-slapping the one with the other to try and get rid of confetti. Quite a sight. Which might be why she gasps lightly when she sees Lily.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Oh, well! She’s awake now, Dali!” Dorcas calls out, seemingly recovered from the sheer shock of having to look at Lily’s face. She’s smirking. Of course she is.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“What’s going on?” Lily dares to ask out loud. “What the hell is this on my face?” It’s been nearly ten minutes since she has first opened her eyes now, and her mind still hasn’t really caught on with reality yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“You tell me,” Dorcas sighs, putting her hands on her hips. “I woke up to this entire ordeal. I think he’s about to propose to you or something.”</p><p align="justify">“Who?” Lily questions, feeling suddenly very overwhelmed. Her voice is barely more than a whisper.</p><p align="justify">“Who do you think?” Mary answers, Lily hadn’t even seen her yet, from her little hideaway spot in the confines of her bed.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lily decides it’s time she let go of the curtains. She actually gets out of her bed, never letting her eyes stray away from the windowed wall’s side of the room, grabs her wand from her bedside table and opens the curtains with a quick flick and then vanishes the confetti off her face. Sweet, sweet relief. The itching is gone, now, and she is left with the fullness of dread filling her stomach.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lily knows who they’re all talking about. She’s just not sure she wants to turn around and see this whole ordeal. It seems surreal. Surely he wouldn’t do that. He wouldn’t.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It’s not like they have been dating for that long, either. He hadn’t done anything like that for her birthday, a few weeks ago. Why would he do something like this today, of all days? Especially since they… Oh, she realizes, he’s apologizing. That’s what this is. He’s apologizing for the fight they had on Valentine's day. They haven’t talked since then. Of course he’s trying to apologize now. Of course he’s making a show of this. Of bloody fucking course.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She turns around, very slowly. Merlin if she’s not the biggest coward on Earth, right now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Truth is, she’s not ready to forgive him, not at all, not in the slightest. <em>He</em> had crossed a line, last Valentine's day. This was not her fault.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">As relationships went, theirs had been a fairly simple, straightforward one, up until now. This has been their first fight since they had first started dating, as a matter of fact. And that was three months ago, now.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It had all begun at Slughorn’s Christmas party. Well, at the Slug club’s last meeting before the Christmas party, if she were to be thorough in her retelling of the events. Dirk Cresswell – because <em>he</em> had to have a name, after all, even if Lily wasn’t so keen on mentioning it these days – a gawky boy with grey robes, mousy blonde hair, pale blue eyes and a pinkish complexion, had gingerly sat down next to her, shyly asking for her permission, and she’d smiled warmly at him. It had seemed apparent to Lily that this was his first meeting. She had never even seen him there, actually. And so she told him so.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Is this your first time here?”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He had sighed nervously and had nodded before he’d opened his mouth a couple of times, looking as if he was looking for the right answer and then at last he had begun talking to her, his eyes darting around the room, never quite stopping in one spot for too long.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Yes, I don’t know what to expect,” he’d started, looking at her for a few seconds before looking away once more. “He said it was just dinner and a nice little chat with like-minded fellows, I don’t know what that means. I practically don’t know anyone here. My name’s Dirk, by the way. Dirk Cresswell,” he had said very rapidly, before extending his hand to her. She’d smiled in return and had shaken his warm and slightly clammy hands, trying to catch his gaze, before Slughorn’s arrival made them both turn their heads. Dirk had nearly whimpered right on the spot when the professor had begun talking.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Don’t worry, he won’t bite, neither will I,” Lily had whispered to him reassuringly as Slughorn greeted the students around the room.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Dirk had smiled shyly in answer, and they’d spent the rest of the evening whispering to each other discreetly, as Lily tried to make him laugh so that he’d feel more comfortable. Professor Slughorn had waited for everyone to get here to introduce Dirk to the rest of the “club” and Dirk had stood up and had waved limply and vaguely in greeting.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Hi, erm… My name’s Cresswell. Dirk... Dirk Cresswell, that’s my name. I’m a Ravenclaw, fifth year here at Hogwarts. Some of you might know me from Ravenclaw’s chess club? I made it to the final round last year. Anyway, nice to meet all of you… Well. That’s about it, I guess.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They had eaten and chatted and listened to Slughorn talk about his famous acquaintances and funny little stories. And Lily had spent most of the evening trying to make Dirk feel more at ease. And then Slughorn had announced that he had set a date for his Christmas party right before they were all set to leave.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And Dirk had grabbed her hand right as she’d said goodbye to him and had begun leaving.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Would you come with me to the party?” he had asked, looking very hopeful. And she couldn’t have said no. She had planned on going either alone or with Dahlia, at first, that was what she had done the year before.</p><p align="justify">“You know you can bring anyone with you, right? It doesn’t have to be someone from the Slug Club.”</p><p align="justify">“I know,” he’d said with a slight smile. “But I think I’d rather go with you than anyone else in this school. You’re probably the nicest person I’ve met in a long time.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And Lily Evans really, <em>really</em> couldn’t have said no to that. Not that she had even wanted to. Not when he had looked so hopeful and not when he had said such nice things to her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And thus, Lily Evans and Dirk Cresswell had gone to Slughorn’s party together. She had sworn to her entire dormitory that this was <em>not</em> a date, not at all, not in any way, shape or form. No. She was simply helping him mingle with a new crowd he didn’t know at all. And she had not been lying, not really. She had meant it, when she had said it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It just turned out that the evening had gone in a different direction than she had originally intended it to. Which was no big deal. Really, it hadn’t been a big deal at all.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They had had fun, lots of it, even. They had even danced and laughed and they had talked a lot. And when the party was nearing to an end, he had grabbed her hand, pulled her to a corner of the room, where no one would glance twice, and he had kissed her. And she had kissed him. And then they had laughed and had some more fun and had had to say goodbye, and she had been the one who kissed him that time, and when she had turned around to get back to her dorm, she had done so with a smile on her face.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And that had been the beginning of Lily Evans’ relationship with Dirk Cresswell. A Christmas fairytale, is what Mary MacDonald had called it, when Lily had been sat down on the floor in the middle of the dormitory, and had shared the events of the previous evening with her dorm mates.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They’d been thrilled, every single one of them. Lily hadn’t exactly been the kind of girl who dated, but it wasn’t her fault, not really. She just had had the worst of luck when it came to the sort of boys who fancied her. Mainly because she thought them all arrogant berks.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">But Dirk Cresswell was quite the opposite of that. He was shy, and kind, and sweet, and always had something nice to say about everyone else.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And yet, here they were.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The Christmas fairytale foretold by Mary MacDonald had turned into a Valentine’s day nightmare right before her eyes five days ago.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Not that Lily wanted a reminder of the event, no thank you.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Lily? Are you alright?” Dahlia asks her.</p><p align="justify">“Why in Merlin's name would you agree to… This!” she exclaims rather dramatically, using her hands to showcase the room.</p><p align="justify">“But he looked so sad, Lily! I couldn’t say no! And then he looked so happy!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That was the issue with Dirk Cresswell. He just looked so damn miserable in his natural state that no witch in their right mind would have the audacity or the guts to refuse him anything. Not when his eyes screamed despair and sorrow, not when his pinkish cheeks still had the plumpness of youth, and his mouth could display such a nice set of teeth when he grinned that you always felt you were cheating life itself by denying it the beauty of his smile.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Merlin, Dirk Cresswell and his smile were something else alright, when he wasn’t so hell-bent on ruining their relationship by telling her he didn’t think she cared about him like he did for her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Well, you’ve done your deed, now. You can vanish this and we can all go on with our days, I’ll just pretend nothing happened,” Lily huffs, opening the trunk at the end of her bed to pick up the first pair of jeans and the first sweater she sees. Today is definitely not a day for wizard clothes.</p><p align="justify">“Oh, you can’t do that! He’ll be devastated! He was really hoping that this would mend things up between the two of you!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lily stills for a second before turning around, slightly exasperated by this whole ordeal.</p><p align="justify">“I really don’t see how recreating the nauseating interior décor of everyone’s bloody favourite shop of all, Hogmeade’s one and only Madam Puddifoot’s, is going to help with anything!”</p><p align="justify">“Well he didn’t specify anything regarding the… you know, the specifics of it all. He just said to hang that banner over there and to make it look romantic! I did what I could, really, I did. I also have a letter to give to you, and I’m sorry for the curtains, I know you hate having them closed. But you almost woke up an hour ago, so I had to close them and put a Silencing Charm on it.</p><p align="justify">“That was you? I thought I did it and forgot about it. Oh and what about that banner of his? I haven’t seen it. Actually, I don’t know if I even <em>want</em> to see it!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The situation keeps worsening. A bloody banner. Who the hell asks their girlfriend’s friend to hang apology banners in their dorm? She’s going to get grey hairs from this alone. She’s going to go to Hogsmeade looking like Dumbledore, she just knows it.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“It’s over there,” Dahlia tells her before grabbing her by the hand to show her the frilliest, pinkest, most heart-strewn banner Lily has ever seen. It’s a wonder in its own right. Lily is certain that Dahlia has added her ‘touch’ to it. Dirk would never even have dared putting that much pink and frills on a banner. She’s also quite sure that beneath all those hearts she can read what seems to be the blandest apology message in the entire history of mankind. “I’m sorry Lily. Love, Dirk.”</p><p align="justify">“We really need to ban those mushy romance novels from the dorm, I think they’re getting to your brain,” Lily just says flatly to Dahlia, ignoring the lacklustre message in its entirety. She would much rather focus on the details instead.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Now, this is not the first time that Dirk has told her he loves her. Valentine's day wasn’t the first time he’d done so either. He had first done that a month and a half ago, as a matter of fact. But it was alright, and even if Lily wasn’t quite sure what <em>Love</em> meant, or what it was, for that matter, she’d told him she loved him back.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She does not know if it was the right thing to do. She has no idea, because she’s not quite sure she loves him at all, actually. Or rather, she’s not sure if she doesn’t love him. It’s not the same thing. Really, it isn’t. There’s a world of difference between not knowing whether you love someone or whether you do not love someone. And Lily just doesn’t know if she doesn’t love him. And so, she’d told him she did. But, the thing is, she really does like him, of that she is quite certain. And she also really really likes kissing him, she’s quite sure of that, too, and it’s sort of alright to have someone who goes with her to stuff like Slughorn’s party or to have someone who will wait for her at lunch to eat with her, or with whom she can go and study in near silence in the Library. It’s quite nice, actually, to hold his hand and to know that he isn’t going to turn evil. Because, that’s the thing about Dirk Cresswell, he is quite incapable of being evil. Of that, too, Lily is quite certain. He is possibly the least threatening boy Lily has ever known. He wouldn’t hurt a fly. He simply wouldn’t. And therefore, he would never hurt her.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Or rather, he hadn’t until Valentine's day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">That’s the thing about seemingly perfect boys who won’t ever hurt you. Sometimes, they do. They might not even mean it, they might not even have done it on purpose, they might even be really really sorry to have hurt you. But they’ve done it anyway. And if maybe, maybe, you’ve just been dating them for the safety of it all, well, maybe you’re just a little bit off-put by the realisation that you’re perhaps not as safe as you’d thought.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It’s not that Lily doesn’t love Dirk. Because that would be ridiculous. Girls always fall in love with the nice boys who give them gifts and tell them they’re deeply in love with them. Especially when they hold your hand in public, want to spend time with you in the Library and will go on strolls with you around the school’s grounds. Plus, Dirk Cresswell is a nice and proper boy who is also polite, has neatly coiffed hair, and a pleasant, slightly above-average face. The kind her mum and her mum’s friends would praise when looking at pictures of each other’s children. Lily has heard it so many times before. “Oh, look at that handsome young man!” she’d say. “How he’s grown! Lily, come look at him, very charming, we should introduce two of them, don’t you think, Margaret? Oh, how lovely that would be!” And that was how you knew someone was the right kind of boy to be dating, when you knew, just by looking at him that your mum would describe him as a ‘handsome young man’. That was as much of a universal truth as the sky being blue. And all of that was just about as much information as she had gathered about the subject of <em>Love</em> – capital letter and all – from films, books, friends and various dating advice articles in Dahlia Fletcher’s Witch Weekly magazine.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">So, Lily is obviously quite enamoured with Dirk. Really, she is. She definitely is. It’s just that Dirk Cresswell doesn’t think that she is. But that’s not her fault, now, is it? She’s quite certain she loves him, now that she’s thinking about it. It’s just logical.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Here,” Dahlia tells her, handing her Dirk’s letter and snapping her out of her reverie.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lily sighs, hesitates, ponders, debates, dithers for an eternity, and finally sighs and takes a step forward to grab the folded yellow parchment off Dahlia’s plump little fingers.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">She doesn’t want to read it. She does not want to read a single word off of it. He’s said enough, already, she doesn’t want to know what else he has to say.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Alright, now, vanish this whole mess away so we can go back to our daily lives. I really want to go buy a Butterbeer right now,” she tells her friends, taking a step back to sit on the trunk at the foot of her bed, and setting down the letter next to her.</p><p align="justify">“It’s not even 8 in the morning right now,” Mary tells her.</p><p align="justify">“I didn’t say it had to be the alcoholic kind. Although, now that I’m seventeen… This is looking very tempting. Oh this is what I’m going to do this afternoon, I can definitely tell you that! Ha! And to say I wanted to come back here and play with Sir Lancelot… Has anyone seen him, by the way?”</p><p align="justify">“He was sleeping on my bed when I woke up,” Mary says and shrugs. “He’s probably gone back downstairs to play with Marlene’s cat again.”</p><p align="justify">“It’s completely unfair! I want to get drunk in a pub too!” Dorcas whines, talking over Mary. Dorcas doesn’t care much for kitten talk.</p><p align="justify">“You will next month!” Dahlia cheers her on.</p><p align="justify">“We’re definitely sneaking out of the castle tonight, I don’t care how but we’re getting to Hogsmeade, I need to celebrate,” Dorcas declares very solemnly.</p><p align="justify">“I could technically buy the drinks today and then sneak them out to you, you know. No need to sneak out tonight,” Lily points out, raising a shoulder and her eyebrows for emphasis.</p><p align="justify">“You would do that? Oh Merlin you’re a lifesaver. Let’s turn this into a thing, this afternoon. You’ll wallow in the sorrows of young love, or whatever, and I’ll celebrate in advance.”</p><p align="justify">“Count me in,” Dahlia interjects. “I’m bored and it’s better than watching yet another snowball fight. It gets so boring after a while, I don’t think I can bear the sight of another snowball.”</p><p align="justify">“Same,” adds Mary, who’s gone to sit on her bed to brush her hair. “Where are we going, though? The Three Broomsticks or the Hog’s Head?”</p><p align="justify">“I’m not setting a foot inside the Hog’s Head ever again,” Dorcas answers with a disgusted look on her face.</p><p align="justify">“Me either!” Lily hears Jane scream from what seems to be the bathroom. “It’s disgusting in there! I’m never walking in goat dung again!”</p><p align="justify">“Did you hear everything?” Lily screams back at her, surprised by her friend’s ability to overhear conversations from another room.</p><p align="justify">“YES!” Jane yells, before barging in with a towel wrapped around her torso and another one around her head. “You’re talking way louder than you think, you know. Also, I forgot my bra, move out the way so that I can get to my trunk. Hey Lily, hey Mary, you’re finally up!”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">For anyone who might have known Jane and Mary last year, this very simple interaction might be a thing of mystery. Because, and quite miraculously so, after months and months of petty name callings and various types of abuses, Jane and Mary have stopped fighting. Which, to Lily is a huge improvement. They’re better off this way, Mary and Jane, somewhat. Not friends, no, not really. But since they don’t really talk, they don’t really fight any more. Jane is better at this game than Mary. But Mary has been making some efforts as of late. And everyone can agree that that’s an improvement. So what if they’re not best mates like they used to be. Jane has grown closer to Lily and Dorcas and Mary to Dahlia and Marlene, who may not share their dorm because she’s older than them, but is still the greatest to have around. Lily is going to miss her terribly come September, when Marlene will have graduated like the proper adult that she is and Lily will still be attending Hogwarts. It’s incredibly unfair. That’s the thing about birthdays, she thinks, they’re terribly unfair little buggers who want to ruin her friendships with barely older mates.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“We should ask Marlene if she wants to come,” Lily suggests, suddenly missing her friend.</p><p align="justify">“Oooh! Good idea! I’ll go ask her!” Dahlia says before nearly running out of the room.</p><p align="justify">“Are you not going to read Dirk’s letter?” Mary asks Lily, nodding towards the folded parchment.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t think there’s anything in here that might make it better. It’s not my fault he’s an idiot.”</p><p align="justify">“What has he said to you? Why won’t you tell us anything? Is it that bad? Has he insulted you? Did he try to hurt you? Oh, Lily please tell me he didn’t!” Mary looks like she’s spiralling out of control, a frantic look creasing her forehead.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Fine, fine!” Lily sighs, conceding. “He said, and mind you, I’m just quoting this: ‘I don’t think you love me at all. You don’t act like you love me, you don’t even look at me like you love me’ right in the middle of the argument we were having. I’m not talking to him any more.”</p><p align="justify">“What? Are you hearing this?” Mary shrieks in answer, looking at the rest of her dorm mates, trying to gauge their reactions. “Do you?”</p><p align="justify">“Do I what?”</p><p align="justify">“Not love him, Lily! Do you not love him?”</p><p align="justify">“Of course I love him! What kind of question is that?”</p><p align="justify">“But why would he think you don’t love him, though? Have you done anything that might… I don’t know – don’t look at me like that!”</p><p align="justify">“I haven’t done anything that might suggest anything! Nothing!” Lily takes a dramatic pause to sigh, opens her mouth to speak up again but changes her mind and, sighing, she concludes, “I’m going to go take a shower.”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, Lily, come on, don’t be cross!” Mary whines, just as Dorcas’ voice echoes the same sentiment. “Lily, don’t be like that!”</p><p align="justify">“I’m not!” Lily huffs, hastily grabbing her clothes and heading toward the bathroom.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The door bangs shut behind her. And, alright, maybe she can admit to this now that she’s alone, she is somewhat mad at Mary and even more so at Dirk bloody Cresswell.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And maybe, maybe she is angrier than she ought to be because she has this feeling, deep, very very deep in her guts that tells her that… That maybe he’s not so far off, now, is he?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And maybe that’s what she’s angry about. But she’s not ready to admit to that yet. She’s definitely not.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">So, she disrobes and gets in the shower and rubs angrily at her hair and her skin. And she thinks, bloody well damn thinks, like a fool, that she can get a moment all to herself to relax when someone bangs on the door.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“LILY! LILY! I read it! I read the letter! He wants to go on a date with you at lunch!” Mary shouts, seemingly indifferent to Lily’s woes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And Lily bloody well damn groans.</p>
