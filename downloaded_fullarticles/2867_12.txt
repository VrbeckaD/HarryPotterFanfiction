</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Reggie-kins</strong> (9:01): Are you available? I need to talk.</p><p><br/>Sirius Black was always available. That was what happened when one was rich beyond their means at such a young age. His Uncle Alphard had left him a hefty inheritance which he lived off while doing whatever it was that fancied him.<br/><br/>Currently, Sirius was into writing. Mostly fanfiction, but did that matter? The written word was his fascination, and he managed to get his roommate in on it as a beta. Not that Sirius needed a roommate, but Remus Lupin had been a friend since their school days and desperately needed a place to stay once they graduated University. And Sirius hated the idea of living alone.<br/><br/>Plus, Remus was easy on the eyes and Sirius did enjoy beautiful things.<br/><br/>He narrowed his eyes on the ominous message sent by his younger brother. He and Regulus often communicated through memes, gifs, and emoticons. With the occasional dick joke thrown in for good measure. <br/><br/>Sirius took in a breath to prepare himself before picking up his phone and dialing his brother.</p><hr/><p>It was dark by the time Remus got home from work. The winter days shorter and the nights longer, the sunset occurred in the early evening. What was surprising was how dark the condo was when he stepped inside. Sirius often told him where he was going, no matter what. They had a good dynamic, a bit domestic but it worked for them.<br/><br/>"Sirius?" Remus called out while placing his satchel down and taking off his coat. He had a full three weeks of vacation now that his students were out for the semester. He had just finished inputting the last of his grades and was hoping that Sirius would be up to celebrating.<br/><br/>"In here," Sirius' voice was a disjointed croak that immediately set Remus on edge.<br/><br/>He toed off his shoes and turned on the lights on his way towards their moderate sized kitchen. Well, it was honestly Sirius'. He was left it by Alphard, but the two had done a decent job gutting the place and personalizing it to be their own. Remus was only half-worried what would happen when Sirius found someone special. Remus half hoped that Sirius would open his eyes and realize that it was him.<br/><br/>"Why are you sitting in the dark?" Remus questioned as he turned on the lights and set the kettle to boil. It was cold outside, and cocoa sounded like a good idea.<br/><br/>Sirius had his head down in his arms on the table. It came out muffled when he responded, "I talked to Regulus this morning."<br/><br/>"Oh?" Remus reached for the mugs. Trying his best to remain calm and casual, the atmosphere too heavy to do otherwise. Remus was good at braving the storms, and he had a feeling that this was going to be one of them. "How is he?"<br/><br/>Sirius nodded before lifting his head up, eyes red-rimmed and damp, but there were no tear tracks down his angular cheeks or jaw. He sniffed once and began to fiddle with the friendship bracelet on his wrist that Harry had made him two weeks ago.<br/><br/>"He," Sirius wet his lips and rubbed his face, "fuck. He was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer and has decided to not receive treatment."<br/><br/>"Shit," Remus breathed as the kettle whistled shrilly. He quickly turned it off and made his way to Sirius' side, kneeling beside him and taking his hand. "Is there anything we can do for him?"<br/><br/>Sirius gave him a weak smile. It was always "we" with the two of them. They hadn't been individuals in years, going as far as to give joint gifts to their friends and family.<br/><br/>Swallowing, Sirius nodded, eyes focused on their linked hands. "He wants me home for the holidays."<br/><br/>Remus inhaled sharply. Both realizing that Sirius had not seen his mother, Walburga since his Uncle Alphard's funeral six years prior. The woman had paid no mind to them, Sirius had attended the funeral with James, Peter, and Remus in tow. Until the solicitor had read Alphard's will the next day and Walburga realized that she would not receive a penny of her brother's millions. Twenty-six-year-old Sirius had become a multimillionaire overnight, and his mother had attempted to take him to court over the money, but the will had been written so precisely that no one else had access to the funds.<br/><br/>Remus could remember himself, twenty-five and furious. Walburga making a scene in the solicitor's office, Sirius cowering under his mother's rage. She was the only person to make Sirius that way. To make turn him into the human equivalent of a beaten dog. Remus had held Sirius' hand tightly, James on the other side with a jutted jaw and Peter frozen with wide eyes.<br/><br/>And when Walburga had begun to attack Sirius personally, Remus saw red. He couldn't remember what words were exchanged but he knew James told Peter to drag him outside. He waited in the car park chain-smoking cigarettes and pacing furiously.<br/><br/>Six years away from the horrid woman was nowhere near enough.<br/><br/>"I have to get a plane ticket soon, Christmas is in less than a week," Sirius tightened his grip on Remus' hands.<br/><br/>"And a car rental." Remus interjected, "we need to pack too."<br/><br/>"We?" Sirius' eyes glittered as he tried to blink away tears. "Rem, you don't have to—"<br/><br/>Remus scoffed, "don't start. You know I do."<br/><br/>"I'll pay for it," Sirius told their hands. "I just—"<br/><br/>Remus leaned forward and brushed a kiss to Sirius' temple sweetly. "Let's enjoy some cocoa, order some takeaway, and get our laptops out. We'll figure this out."<br/><br/>"I don't know what I'd do without you," Sirius told him with wide gray eyes.<br/><br/>Remus clucked his tongue, "probably have starved to death, or wound up in jail."</p><hr/><p><strong>Remus</strong> (17:50): Hey, I'm going to email you our flight information.<br/><br/><strong>Regulus</strong> (17:55): I'm happy you're coming too.<br/><br/><strong>Remus</strong> (18:09): Of course, I'll be coming too. I'm not going to stay at home as Penelope did for Odysseus.<br/><br/><strong>Regulus</strong> (18:10): So, you admit that you're his wife?<br/><br/><strong>Remus</strong> (18:11): Hardy har.<br/><br/><strong>Regulus</strong> (18:13): How is he?<br/><br/><strong>Remus</strong> (18:15): Sirius? Really? Don't worry about him, I'll take care of him. How are YOU?<br/><br/><strong>Regulus</strong> (18:16): Well I've had several weeks to adjust to the news. I've been getting my affairs in order.<br/><br/><strong>Regulus</strong> (18:17): I can't wait to see you two.<br/><br/><strong>Remus</strong> (18:18): We can't wait to see you either. Does your mother know we're coming for Christmas?<br/><br/><strong>Regulus</strong> (18:20): Yes. She's fine with it. Don't worry about her.<br/><br/><strong>Remus</strong> (18:22): Sirius is whining for attention. We'll talk later.<br/><br/><strong>Regulus</strong> (18:23): Of course.</p><hr/><p>Sirius woke up to the sticky fingers of an eight-year-old tugging on his hair and giggling all the while. Harry's bright green eyes were focused on the braid he was making. The boy had become infatuated with braiding ever since Lily taught him. Thus, the friendship bracelet Sirius wore and now his hair being knotted together by clumsy fingers.<br/><br/>"'arry," Sirius groaned, sleep still clinging to him. "Why?"<br/><br/>"I was told to wake you," Harry stated simply. "It's nearly ten. You talk in your sleep."<br/><br/>"So, I've been told," Sirius grouched as he gently removed his Godson's fingers from his locks, carefully detangling the lopsided braid. "Where are your parents?"<br/><br/>"Dad's the kitchen with Moony," Harry responded. He had already lost interest in his Godfather and was roaming around Sirius' bedroom. Trying on the leather cuff bracelet that was on the dresser and the aviator sunglasses that were beside them. He was a curious child, and entirely too serious to be a byproduct of James. Harry was the spitting image of his father though. Except for his eyes.<br/><br/>Sirius forced himself out of bed as Harry strutted out of the room doing his best Sirius Black ™ impersonation. It took several minutes for Sirius to mosey into his attached bathroom to wash his face and brush his teeth. Make himself presentable in a fresh shirt and jeans.<br/><br/>To his surprise, it wasn't just James, but also Peter, in the kitchen drinking tea. Harry seated beside his father, playing a game on his phone while munching on a biscuit. Sirius knew what his friends had been discussing before he even sat down.<br/><br/>"Right," Sirius stretched lazily. "What're you lot doing in my house?"<br/><br/>"Since when can we not visit you unannounced?" James asked with a faux haughty expression on his face. He dipped his biscuit into his tea almost viciously but equally dramatically.<br/><br/>"Dad," Harry gently reprimanded.<br/><br/>Peter chuckled, "just like Lily, hm?"<br/><br/>"Like you wouldn't believe," James sighed. "Harry, why don't you go play that in the living room? We need to have grown up talk."<br/><br/>"May I take my cocoa with me?" Harry asked.<br/><br/>"Of course," Sirius smiled at him. "Feel free to turn on the game console if you want to play that. I think FIFA is still in there."<br/><br/>Harry did as he was told and walked off.<br/><br/>"So," Sirius drawled out, but he gave Remus a grateful look when his roommate handed him a mug of coffee.<br/><br/>"We want to come with," James interjected.<br/><br/>Remus scoffed from where he was in the kitchen making toast. "And leave your families behind for the holidays?"<br/><br/>"He's got a point," Sirius nodded in agreement. He was only mildly surprised when the plate of jammed toast was placed before him.<br/><br/>"I'd like to see Regulus," Peter said, the honesty in his voice hurt to hear. "Maybe we can arrange a visit to see him after the holidays? Mum won't be pleased if Mary and I miss Christmas with her. But maybe after the New Year?"<br/><br/>"That sounds nice," Remus told Peter as he sat down beside Sirius. His eyes warm. He was close enough to Sirius that their shoulders brushed.<br/><br/>"Why is Remus going then?" James asked instead, head tilted and brown eyes darting between the two.<br/><br/>Peter hid a knowing smile in his teacup as he took a sip, his own gaze averted from the two.<br/><br/>Remus' face became an interesting shade of pink and he stared down at the kitchen table as if it held all the answers.<br/><br/>"Moral support," Sirius stated. "Don't be jealous."<br/><br/>"James," Remus interrupted before a squabble could break out, "I've no family. It only makes sense."<br/><br/>James and Peter exchanged a look.<br/><br/>"You know that your family thinks that you two are shagging, yeah?" Peter couldn't help but ask with a mischievous curl on his lips.<br/><br/>"What?" Sirius spluttered.<br/><br/>Remus rolled his eyes, "for fuck's sake, Pete."<br/><br/>For a moment it felt as it did back when the quartet was in school. Telling dirty jokes and planning horrific pranks on unsuspecting victims. Quickly working on half-assed essays that were due the next class and having a difficult time managing to keep their ties in place.<br/><br/>Sirius could ignore the lump that had been in his throat since the day before. He could breathe a little easier. Remus' shoulder brushing against his own warmth and pillar that he needed to lean on.</p><hr/><p><strong>Prongs</strong> (15:23): Let me know if I need to fly out there, okay?<br/><br/><strong>Remus</strong> (15:25): I will.<br/><br/><strong>Prongs</strong> (15:26): I'm glad that you're going too.<br/><br/><strong>Remus</strong> (15:27): Why wouldn't I go? I go wherever he goes, and vice versa.<br/><br/><strong>Prongs</strong> (15:32): Why aren't you two shagging yet?<br/><br/><strong>Remus</strong> (15:33): Stfu.<br/><br/><strong>Prongs</strong> (15:34): Honestly! It's painful to watch you two. All the eye fucking.<br/><br/><strong>Remus</strong> (15:35): I'm going to block you now :)<br/><br/><strong>Prongs</strong> (15:36): Remus, Remus.<br/><br/><strong>Remus</strong> (15:38): What James?<br/><br/><strong>Prongs</strong> (15:39): Eating sugar?<br/><br/><strong>Remus</strong> (15:40): Ffs. How old are you again?<br/><br/><strong>Prongs</strong> (15:42): Telling lies?<br/><br/><strong>Remus</strong> (15:45): Istg James.<br/><br/><strong>Prongs</strong> (15:50): Give Reg a tight hug for me. Take lots of pics of him. Vids. The works.<br/><br/><strong>Remus</strong> (15:51): Of course.</p><hr/><p><strong>Jamie</strong> (15:50): You know that I love you.<br/><br/><strong>Sirius</strong> (15:51): I know you're so gay for me.<br/><br/><strong>Jamie</strong> (15:52): My heart will forever be hard for you.<br/><br/><strong>Sirius</strong> (15:53): Oh Prongs, you know how to sweet talk me.<br/><br/><strong>Jamie</strong> (15:54): Let me know how it goes.<br/><br/><strong>Jamie</strong> (15:55): Call me every night if need be.<br/><br/><strong>Sirius</strong> (15:56): It's just my family. It'll be okay. I'm going for Reg.<br/><br/><strong>Sirius</strong> (15:57): Besides, I'll have Remus with me.<br/><br/><strong>Jamie</strong> (15:59): Your knight! As the fair damsel, you obviously should reward his hellish quest with a kiss.<br/><br/><strong>Jamie</strong> (16:00): Or your virginity.<br/><br/><strong>Sirius</strong> (16:03): Fuck off.<br/><br/><strong>Jamie</strong> (16:04): ILY!</p><hr/><p><strong>Sirius</strong> (16:30): Who's going to be there this year?<br/><br/><strong>Regulus</strong> (16:33): For Christmas dinner?<br/><br/><strong>Sirius</strong> (16:34): Yes.<br/><br/><strong>Regulus</strong> (16:35): Grandfather Pollux, Grandfather Arcturus, Grandmother Melania, Uncle Cygnus, Bella, Rodolpho, Andy, Ted, Dora, Cissy, Lucius, Draco, mother, me, you, Remus.<br/><br/><strong>Sirius</strong> (16:38): …You invited everyone???<br/><br/><strong>Regulus</strong> (16:40): Only immediate. I almost invited Great-Aunt Dorea and that would have included the Potters. But I felt that was pushing it.<br/><br/><strong>Sirius</strong> (16:45): You think? Does mother know you invited Andy?<br/><br/><strong>Regulus</strong> (16:50): Mother is aware that I may not be here next holiday season. Yes, she knows all about this and has no objections.<br/><br/>Sirius stared at his phone and felt the lump in his throat seem to expand. He swallowed helplessly around it. He sat at the edge of his bed, breathing uselessly. His grip on his phone tight and it took all his willpower to not toss it across his bedroom. He was thirty-one, not eleven, he had a better grip on his temper as an adult than he did in childhood.<br/><br/>Years away from the Black Family aided in correcting a lot of the negative behavior.<br/><br/>He peered up at the ceiling for a moment. Counted slowly to twenty. Swallowed around the lump once more. And finally responded to his brother's text.<br/><br/><strong>Sirius</strong> (17:05): Okay.</p><hr/><p>Sirius inhaled his cigarette deeply, watching the smoke float in the freezing late-night air, intermingling with his breath. There was frost on the ground, and the sky was bright in a way it only ever was in winter. The moon hung heavily overhead.<br/><br/>His spot on the fire escape had a perfect view of woods and a nearby stream. Godric's Hollow was a peaceful place, more of a town than a village, not quite a city yet.<br/><br/>He wasn't sure how he felt. His stomach twisted in knots, his hands trembled, and his breathing shallow. He felt barely kept together and it wasn't fair. Regulus was the one who was going through this, the one who was sick, the one who needed his support. Sirius inhaled once more.<br/><br/>He was so fucking selfish.<br/><br/>His baby brother was dying.<br/><br/>"It's fucking freezing out here," Remus' voice cut through his thoughts and Sirius peered up at him.<br/><br/>Remus was in a jean Sherpa jacket and fleece joggers. Fluffy slippers on his feet. He was not dressed warm enough for the below-freezing temperatures. "Pass it."<br/><br/>Sirius did as he was told. He watched as Remus puffed, the low light washing him in silvers and grays. He wished he could kiss him. Wished he could break the space between the two, there was always too much space between them.<br/><br/>They sat side by side, thighs pressed intimately against each other and not a word exchanged as they shared two more cigarettes after the first one.<br/>Sirius wasn't sure what time it was. So, lost in thought that he hadn't realized Remus had stood up until the other man was gently petting his hair.<br/><br/>"Let's go to bed," Remus murmured gently.<br/><br/>Sirius nodded, following behind him. They had a flight to catch tomorrow.</p><hr/><p>The flight was short with limited turbulence and only one crying baby. Sirius felt bad for the infant, obviously, the pressure was too much for it. Its mother cooed and whispered trying to appease the baby but to no avail.<br/><br/>"I wish I could help her," Remus whispered directly into his ear. "Or maybe it'd be better if it were you."<br/><br/>There was no secret among their friends that Sirius seemed to be the baby-whisperer. Small children were drawn to him, and he was damn good at handling them.<br/><br/>The rental car only took an hour and before Sirius realized he was behind the wheel, hands so tight that his knuckles turned white. When Remus gently touched his wrist, Sirius let out a large exhale, body instantly relaxing.<br/><br/>He hadn't seen his mother in six fucking years. The last time had been horrendous, and he was sure she would not be pleased to see Remus again. Not with the way he had spoken to her. Remus Lupin was typically a timid man until someone hurt Sirius. It was something Sirius oftentimes thought about, in the quiet moments he rarely allowed himself to have. Something that came to mind whenever he caught Remus staring at him.<br/><br/>The drive to the estate was calming. Remus sang softly to the Christmas music on the radio, roads clear of ice, but the hills were covered in crisp snow.<br/><br/>The estate began miles before the actual manor came into view. Black gates with the family crest ‘Toujour Pur' engraved delicately on it.<br/><br/>There were other cars already there. Christmas was two days away, but he knew his family was trickling in and everyone should be in the house by Christmas Eve.<br/><br/>Sirius took a moment to breathe. The manor was just as grand and beautiful and daunting as it had always been. Brick face with vines, black pitched roof, and massive white columns. Nerves settled in his stomach. His family was in there, and it had been years.<br/><br/>Remus' birdlike touch caused him to focus on the man next to him. On warm brown eyes, freckles, tawny curls that needed a bit of a cut. A thin scar across the bridge of a long nose. Perfection.<br/><br/>"Alright?" Remus asked softly.<br/><br/>Sirius nodded and then opened the driver's side door.<br/><br/>They held their bags in the cold for a few minutes as they waited for the front door to open. The elderly man who answered was a head shorter than Sirius, wrinkled face in a permanent frown.<br/><br/>"Master Sirius," He nodded cordially as he moved aside to allow the two men in.<br/><br/>"Kreacher," Sirius nodded. Half surprised to find the man still alive and working for his mother. He shouldn't have been too shocked, Kreacher was loyal to Walburga – though God only knew why. He treated Regulus well too, ever since they were children. He had an issue with Sirius his entire life and with Orion. When Sirius was younger, he believed that Regulus was Kreacher's son, but quickly dropped it because it really didn't matter either way.<br/><br/>"Mr. Lupin," Kreacher greeted Remus as well.<br/><br/>"Hello," Remus gave Kreacher an awkward smile. This was the politest he had ever been to any of Sirius' friends. Regulus must have had some words with the elderly man before their arrival.<br/><br/>"Shall I show you two to your room?" Kreacher asked.<br/><br/>The foyer of the house was exactly how Sirius remembered it. White marble floors and rich green walls. A single black ornate table in the middle with a glass face of white roses. To the left were double doors kept shut, which was the drawing room. The right opened to the living room, formal dining room, casual dining room, library, sitting room, living room, and office. Before him, behind the table, were the stairs which led to all the bedrooms, and a hallway next to it where the servants' quarters were. It all looped to the kitchen. Every room was connected somehow, and Sirius recalled hours of easily hiding with Regulus in the farthest corners until Kreacher summoned them for food.<br/><br/>He could faintly hear voices murmuring from deeper into the house.<br/><br/>"No," Sirius knew where his own room was. "Inform my mother that we're here. We'll be down to see her shortly."<br/><br/>"Of course, sir." Kreacher responded before leaving the two be.<br/><br/>"Weird," Remus whispered.<br/><br/>Sirius bit back a chuckle before leading the way up the stairs until they reached the third landing. He had chosen the highest bedroom as a child because it felt as if it were his own personal hiding spot. As a teenager, he enjoyed it because he could easily climb out of the window and smoke pilfered cigarettes on the roof.<br/><br/>His Uncle Alphard's bedroom was on the third floor as well. Sirius remembered being a late teenager, smoking and talking to James on the phone at night. His uncle opening his bedroom window with his own cigarette, reprimanding Sirius halfheartedly.<br/><br/>It had been six years and he still missed Alphard.<br/><br/>The hallways were as ornate as the rest of the house. Velvet tapestries, oil paintings, portraits of dead relatives whom Sirius had never met.<br/><br/>The third floor only had four bedrooms, each with its own bathroom attached.<br/><br/>"Here we go, I warn you that there's only one bed. But if you don't want to share, you're more than welcome to take the room across the hall," Sirius told Remus as he opened his door.<br/><br/>It was strange. He hadn't been in this house in nearly a decade. Yet the walls still held vintage band posters in black frames and the shelves had car models, books, and CDs. The walls were a ruby red, the floor a plush carpet that Sirius knew his feet could easily sink into when barefoot.<br/><br/>The furniture was all dark wood, intricately carved and heavy. The four-post bed had black velvet hangings from the top, draping down like a canopy. <br/><br/>"I don't mind sharing," Remus shrugged, "I'll probably sleep better with you there since this place is unfamiliar."<br/><br/>Sirius ignored how he could feel his face heating up. He placed his bag down by the wardrobe and motioned for Remus to do the same. Neither of them packed much, just essentials and something nice for Christmas Dinner.<br/><br/>He went into the bathroom to use it and splash water on his face to help calm his nerves. Remus was perusing the bookcase when he came out. Brown eyes swiveled back to him once Sirius cleared his throat.<br/><br/>"She's going to want to see us in the drawing room," Sirius wiped his hands on his jeans. "She's going to expect that."<br/><br/>There was no question as to whom this ‘she' was. Walburga Black was a formidable woman.<br/><br/>"I'll be with you," Remus informed him while approaching. He laced their fingers together and squeezed.<br/><br/>Sirius peered at him, his free hand coming up and cupping Remus' jaw before resting his forehead against his. "I know."<br/><br/>They stood that way for several moments. Sirius knew how easy it would be to shift just so and kiss him. But kissing Remus Lupin was not something Sirius could give time to now, because he knew once he started, he would not be able to stop.<br/><br/>Their eyes were on each other when they broke apart, still connected by their fingers.<br/><br/>Sirius brought Remus' knuckles up and brushed them gently against his mouth. "Thank you."<br/><br/>"You're welcome," Remus breathed.<br/><br/>When they finally let go of one another, Sirius offered Remus a bright smile. "Just don't go starting fights with her this time, yeah?"<br/><br/>"Oh God," Remus groaned.</p>
