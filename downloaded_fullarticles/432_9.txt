    <p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It began as a tremor Hermione couldn't seem to shake as she grasped her wand or held the kettle handle, but it didn't bother her so very much. She hardly needed to see a healer over such a silly little thing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It became a weakness, in that cursed arm scarred with memories. Holding anything in that hand was becoming arduous. Hermione saw a few healers and they all said the same - nerve damage, irreversible, and since she had no pain they couldn't help her. She thanked Merlin she didn't have pain, just the tingling, numb appendage.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But the pain did come, and it came without mercy.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hours spent curled in bed, writhing in agony as she screamed her throat dry, useless arm twisted from spasms. She'd only been trying to pick up a potion vial. A bloody useless pain potion.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Nothing seemed to work. No tincture or potion, no narcotic or opioid, and because they didn't work, Hermione didn't work. She'd used every sick day and leave of absence she could and now she was on sabbatical from her research department, with a promise to her superiors that she'd have a new book for them at the end of it. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was either that or get sacked. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Her on again off again relationship with Ron became off again and stayed that way. Her friendships fizzled and penpals stayed un-answered. When all Hermione could manage was to roll out of bed, take her dozen medications then murmur to a Dict-o-quill before the pain came rushing back like a tsunami, socializing didn't rank high on her priority list. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But then months turned into a year. The world was changing without Hermione Granger.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The worst day that year hadn't been when she'd been stuck in the tub and couldn't lift herself out for hours. It wasn't when she needed to fill her prescription for Vicodin and couldn't lace her goddamn boots. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It had been Harry's birthday. The invitation had come by owl months before, and Hermione had sent an RSVP instantly. She'd mail ordered him a custom wand holster; something he'd need in his job on the Auror force. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The night of his birthday bash arrived and found Hermione screaming and beating her own arm as it lay useless on the bed next to her. She was mostly naked and the arm had quit on her just as she'd reached for the first bra she'd planned to wear in months. The whole day it seemed fine, but now! Now it was useless, she was useless. In her rage, Hermione took far too large a dose of her pain potion and ended up hallucinating on the bedroom carpet for hours. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A curt thank you note from Ginny the next week was all the response she got about her gift to Harry. She didn't hear from anyone else after that for a good long while.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione wanted to die. Ideation of that kind was hard to shake when you hardly had anything to live for, Hermione found. </span>
</p><p class="p2">

</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In the paper one morning, Hermione saw an advertisement that so surprised her she couldn't help but read it over twice. Famed Potion Master Severus Snape creates new, non-habit forming pain potion...! To Hermione, a new drug was as good a reason as any to attempt leaving the house, but she simply couldn't. She couldn't use her wand at all any longer, and for a moment Hermione truly thought she'd have no way to get her hands on the brew. Thankfully, she knew just the apothecary she could call, her former place of employ, a place she'd insisted on installing a phone line so she could she could call Harry... back when he was welcoming of her friendship. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione ordered the legal maximum of NervEase you could by phone and waited patiently in agony for a fortnight. When the case of clinking vials came, Hermione couldn't wait to try the magenta liquid within. The pain in her arm was so severe that day, it had moved into her shoulder. She could only manage to shrug a bathrobe over one arm before giving up in tears. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione took Snape's potion and waited the recommended fifteen minutes before attempting to use her arm at all. When she hesitantly reached for her cup of tea and somehow grasped the handle with just hardly enough strength to lift it, it went crashing to the floor. Hermione began to cry in earnest, clutching her atrophied but painless arm and sobbed manically.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was in this startled and half-dazed moment that Hermione crawled over to her shabby desk, pulled out one of her nicest pieces of stationary and </span>
  <span class="s2">very</span>
  <span class="s1"> shakily wrote a letter. To whom may it concern? Why, the god like man who created the wonder potion she now clutched in her left hand. After months of struggling, of sobbing into her useless hand and cursing an unjust world, that one potion was now everything and the man who created it had to know. He had to know just how much it meant to her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione used up the last bits of energy her body had to send the letter out by owl before collapsing into bed, falling into a dreamless sleep completely undisturbed by pain. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Relief was the best sleep aid one could ever find.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Severus Snape did not receive mail. Not by conviction or design, but simply because he did not maintain the types of relationships that facilitated the exchange of letters. He had few in his life he could tolerate, even fewer he could stomach to consider friends, and those he did were either so brash or so conniving as to realize forewarning Severus of their visits would be a horrid mistake. Severus had a penchant for being busy or sick when people needed or wanted to pop by. He preferred solitude and was loathe to part from it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So when a pale grey owl tapped on his window early Sunday morning, Severus stood from his chair in the kitchen, hastily drawing his wand lest the thing carry an explosive, arsenic, or gods forbid a </span>
  <em>
    <span class="s2">fan letter</span>
  </em>
  <span class="s1">. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Thankfully, after a bit of checking, it seemed above board. He hesitantly opened the half crumpled piece of card to find a strange scrawl blotted and distorted by drips of water. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And Severus soon realized they must have been from tears. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <em>
    <span class="s1">"</span>
    <span class="s2">Professor Snape - I must tell you how much - how thankful I am for you and your lovely brain at this moment! Your potion, my god, your potion! I have been in pain for so long, I could barely live with how little functionality I had. How much pain --- I'm sure you would not appreciate a long winded letter, so I will be brief - thank god for you, thank you thank you thank you. I could kiss you I am so relieved! </span>
  </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span class="s2">- Hermione Granger"</span>
  </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He'd needed to read it numerous times to understand it quite right, and more to actually believe the words on the card. Hermione Granger had written him and in quite a state. That little girl who had dragged him from the Shack and carried him to the triage area of the castle was now, he supposed, a girl no longer, and clearly going through... something. His heart, cold and useless but nonetheless still present, felt a twinge at the thought of that once bright and promising girl being in so much pain that she could - he held up the card again - 'barely function'. Disability was nothing to treat lightly, and he wouldn't wish it on his enemies.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Severus was then, he realized, moved by her thanks, and set down to his writing desk for the first time in two decades. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <em>
    <span class="s2">"Miss Granger,</span>
  </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <em>
    <span class="s2">It does me well to know a potion I have crafted has gone to good use. Instead of thanking god, you should perhaps thank yourself, as you are perhaps the only reason I remain on this earth.</span>
  </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <em>
    <span class="s2">As for your comments about assaulting my person, I suggest you refrain. </span>
  </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span class="s2">- SS"</span>
  </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He sent the small reply off on the wings of his charcoal owl, content that was that. If Miss Granger was receiving comfort from his potion, then all he could hope was that she exercised restraint and kept strictly to the dosage instructions on the bottle. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In the days following, Severus felt an ache of anxious regret for replying at all. The shackles of his socially awkward youth demanded he think over his actions in every imaginable way. It sickened him to feel like... like such a ninny. What he wrote hadn't mattered, who he wrote hadn't mattered either. He resolved not to consider the situation any longer. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That proved impossible when exactly fifteen days later, he stood in his garden examining his Gordolobo plant for possible insect damage when the weakest pop of apparition sounded near the rear of his property. Severus dusted off his hands on a cloth, prepared to scold Narcissa Malfoy for not appearing in his parlor as she ought to when he came face to face with a bedraggled fluff of hair tied upon an equally bedraggled and mournful face. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Although, upon seeing him, Miss Hermione Granger lit up considerably and strode to his side, invading his personal space. "Professor!" </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I beg your pardon?" Snape growled. "What the devil are you doing trespassing in my garden?" </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Her face fell at that. "I... did you not receive my letter?" </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"No, I did not receive any such..." he began to sneer, but just then that same pale owl came floating down into the garden as well, perching on a fence post and extending its leg to Severus. He snatched the post and opened it, rolling his eyes at the content. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Could she pop by for tea? Un-bloody-likely. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Bloody useless owl!" Hermione frowned. "I'll need to have a word with you when I arrive home. Now shoo!" She waved away the bird with a weak hand. "Well, now you've had my note. Tea then?" The chit was already shrugging out of her coat as she moved towards the back door of his house, her movements shaky and ineffectual without employing the use of her right arm at all. She was chattering on about something she'd read, on and on as he followed her into his own house, darting from one topic to another as she still wrestled with her coat. She was almost desperate to unload her thoughts, Severus realized.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It seemed that after his ill thought out reply to her missive, Hermione Granger had latched onto him like a socially deprived leech. A leech who couldn't take her own damn coat off. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Here," Severus offered brusquely, reaching out and tugging off the offending garment. He hung it on a peg by the kitchen door then turned to see her dragging his kettle over to the sink, again with the use of only one hand. Starkly, by her side dangled her right arm, useless and limp in appearance. The musculature seemed quite thin compared to the other arm, the one which was busying itself filling and setting the kettle to boil. With the keen eyes of someone who regularly diagnosed people to pass the time, Severus noted the blue coloration beneath her nails and the way the skin of her upper arm seemed pinched and puckered. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Where do you keep your box of tea, Professor?" Hermione asked breezily, still busying herself around his kitchen. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Why are you here, Miss Granger?" he inquired in reply. Was she here for more potion? What could she possibly want from him? </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"For tea, silly," she responded casually, opening cabinet after cabinet in search of the tea. "Really sir, do try and keep up." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In two long strides, Severus was at her side and holding her limp arm, pinning her with his eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What happened to your arm? What would cause this?" He indicated with a nod to the disfigurement. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"A..." she gulped down air, anxiously looking away from him. "A steroid injection for the pain. Nothing to worry about." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"So tell me, is this arm why you are in my kitchen?" he pressed her, her arm in his hands feeling bony and almost lifeless. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"No, sir, not at all." The kettle began to whistle, startling the girl. "I'll get that?" she asked, but he did not release her. Severus was not processing having someone in his home very easily. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Explain yourself," he demanded, holding her hostage as the kettle filled the small kitchen with a wail. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I..." She bit her lip, an anxious habit to be sure, before her eyes seemed to glass over with resigned tears. "I needed some company today. It's been months since I've seen anyone and I... " </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Ah, loneliness. How very feeble of her, but he supposed it could be expected. She had been a very social girl at school and would not take well to the isolation that came with chronic debilitation. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Severus Snape huffed out a breath, resigned.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"My teas are stored in that drawer," he indicated with a wave of his hand, releasing Miss Granger as to pull the screaming kettle from the stove. The immediate quiet was a relief, and in it he could hear the girl next to him audibly sigh. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This was going to be a very strange afternoon tea if ever there was one.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They spent the greater part of the afternoon sipping stout and earthy Pu'er as the Professor grilled Hermione on her illness. How long had she been experiencing symptoms? Had she seen Healer Ramsey at St. Mungos? Had she done any research on muggle physical therapy or acupuncture? The answers all came from Hermione's lips like spilt milk, desperate to escape her but it brought an almost overwhelming amount of shame to speak on any of it. She was an independent woman by nature, and she hated feeling frail, but here she was. Atrophied arm limp in her lap as the Professor assessed her. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Once he had exhausted his barrage of inquiry, Hermione felt herself slip suddenly as she blurted - "I think, with all that's been going on with me, my friends rather hate me." She regretted it the moment it was out in the air, but Snape quickly snatched it up before she could change the topic. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Your obnoxiously heroic friends? It seems unlikely they would abandon you in your time of... </span>
  <em>
    <span class="s2">need</span>
  </em>
  <span class="s1">." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Well that's just it," Hermione sighed, slumping back in her chair. "I've rather abandoned them. I cancel plans and deny floo entry so often that I'm sure they all feel put out." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Put out?" Snape set his cup down with a sharp clatter. "You are an imbecile." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Sir!" Hermione replied, shocked. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"No, truly." The Professor sat forward. "No one could possibly expect that much from you, girl. You are chronically ill and from what you've told me, you're dealing with this alone. It's intolerable that anyone would expect anything more of you. That includes yourself, Miss Granger." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I..." Hermione sniffed, feeling tears well in her eyes. Was Professor Snape right? Was she being too hard on herself? If that were the case then... "I can't blame them," she murmured, wiping her tears on her sleeve before giving in to the desire to cry. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Then don't. You are far too magnanimous for it, I'm sure, but I shall blame them. Potter and Weasley and their lot will run headfirst and blind into danger but are absent when you're not around to wipe their arses, and I cannot pretend I'm surprised," he sniped, rolling his eyes. Hermione felt a giggle burble out of her at that. Wipe their arses? That did describe their school careers fairly accurately, if not crassly. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">With her good hand, Hermione reached out and placed it on the Professor's arm. "Thank you, sir. For tea and the conversation." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">His face seemed to flush then, and he glanced down at her hand like it was a foreign object. "Yes, well..." he muttered in reply, standing suddenly. "You really should be off, shouldn't you?" </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He was sending her away, but Hermione couldn't let it get her down. Coming to see him made her feel lighter than she'd been in months. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Yes, sir."</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">After Miss Granger had gone, Severus sat in his chair for quite a while staring at the dirty tea ware in bemusement. He hadn't had company in some time, and it had felt, dare he admit it, quite nice to share a cup with someone well spoken and intelligent. Not only that, but someone who had no expectations of him. Minerva wanted him to come out of retirement, Narcissa wanted him to send messages to Lucius for her, and likewise, Lucius wanted him to pass along messages to his former wife. Hermione hadn't wanted anything other than company and a good cup of tea, which hadn't exactly been an imposition to provide. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Before he realized it, Severus was returning to his writing desk, setting himself down to pen a note inviting Hermione Granger to return. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Severus only hoped it wouldn't be a mistake to invite her into his life. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She returned to his home before his owl could have possibly brought her the missive. He found her bouncing on her toes happily on his front steps, holding a white box of confections and smiling broadly. Severus was pained to realize he found her expression... attractive, and her presence appealing. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Gods forbid she realized that, however. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Why are you here?" he asked, intentionally rude. Her smile wavered but she was not deterred. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione held the white box aloft. "I brought pastries," she explained. "Will you invite me in?" </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Severus sighed and slumped his shoulders theatrically, opening the door wide enough for her to enter. "If I must." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">All afternoon<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>they discussed an article he'd written for Potions Quarterly and debated the ethics of ingredient harvesting. Severus found himself feeling a bit dower once she'd gone. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Was he... did he fancy Miss Granger? Surely not.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">She continued to pop by like that for quite some time. Every two or three days he would find her at his doorstep looking for a cup of tea and conversation, usually carrying a box of nibbles for them to share. Unconsciously, Severus was taking extra care with his appearance on those days, making sure he had plenty of exceptional teas to choose from if she were feeling adventurous. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He was becoming attached to her. Reliant on her company. It was unusual, but not undesirable. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That afternoon she had appeared again, with a little bag of croissants and a desire to sample his assortment of Japanese greens. He'd brewed it this time, and they settled into what he was becoming to think of as 'their' chairs for a lengthy discussion on Hermione's book.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It was then he really let himself look at her. Look past her wild hair and frantic, one armed gesturing and see her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You appear in good spirits today," he commented, looking her over. It wasn't wrong to say, she did look brighter, more awake, and possibly a kilo or two heavier in a healthy sort of way. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I do feel good lately, sir," she replied cheerily, taking another bite of croissant. "All thanks to you, no doubt." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Severus looked up from his tea cup at that, eyes wide. Was she claiming his... company was helping her? "I... well," he murmured ridiculously. Was he stammering? </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I've had so much more energy since taking your potion. Without the pain, I can work around my muscle weakness and actually get some things done. The book I've been working on is almost through editing!" she beamed. "You can't imagine how good that feels, to finally get it done." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I see." Severus hated that he felt disappointed. Bah, who was he to feel that way? He had no right. They barely knew each other. Of course it was the potion. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It always seemed to be that way. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I feel so good that I really..." Hermione paused to sip her tea. "I really think I should get back to work, get back to socializing with my friends. I've felt so useless for so long and I just..." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I understand," Severus replied earnestly. "After waking in St. Mungo's I had a similar experience. I couldn't speak, barely ate, and sat uselessly in a hospital bed for six months. Once I was released, I felt I had the motivation to do things I hadn't previously cared about much." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Exactly!" Hermione sat up. "I've heard that Luna is hosting a brunch for all our old school mates and I find myself wanting to go. It's not something I would particularly enjoy, but I miss... I dunno, just being myself around people," she explained. "It's tomorrow." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Ah," was all he could think to say. His potion had helped her heal, so well that she wouldn't need him any longer. She would return to her job and her friends and have no need for long winded conversations in a drafty old house with her likely least favorite former professor. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He let the silence drag out. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Well, I..." Hermione stood, a little wobbly. "I won't keep you." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Severus stood as well. "I'll get your coat," he offered tersely. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Thank you," she whispered as they reached the doorway. "Truly." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He wanted to push her out the door. Severus did not invite people into his life just for them to walk out, but in this instance it felt as if he did not have a choice. He wouldn't let it get him moody either; this is just how it was. Could one continue to 'grow up' even at forty-six years of age? </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Severus helped her into her coat, sensible and flattering green wool that had felt warm in his arms. "Any time, Miss Granger. Any time." And she left. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The answer, Severus supposed, must be a yes, for he felt ages older once she'd vanished. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">With more energy than she'd felt in months, Hermione dressed carefully for the ladies brunch. She experimented with left handed wand movements and managed to secure her hair with a sticking charm after some trial and error. With a spring in her step, she picked up a quiche from her favorite local bakery and apparated to Lovegood House, both parts anxious and excited to see her friends again. Through the large oak doors and into the foyer she went, and through the stone walls she could hear the din of chatter and laugher coming from the kitchen. Hermione spotted Luna standing with Ginny, both of them a breath of fresh air to her socially starved brain. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And then she heard them. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Is that every one?" Ginny asked Luna, taking a sip from her mimosa. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Not every one. Hermione said she would be coming," Luna's bell like voice carried through the house, her brows scrunched together in concern. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Hermione is such a flake these days, she may not even come," Ginny said offhand. There was no malice in her tone, no intent to injure, and yet it did. Hermione felt dizzy.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"She's been a bit sick lately," Luna replied softly. "But I do wish she would make more of an effort. She's always saying she'll come and yet never does."</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I know!" Ginny exclaimed, the volume making Hermione shake. "She didn't even come to Harry's birthday. It was such an upset to him, getting that gift from a post owl. She didn't even say why she didn't come."</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione could not stop to listen any longer. The conversation became a lone buzz in her ears, and as their words set in it got louder and louder. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">In a state, Hermione apparated straight from the entryway of Luna's house to the one place she felt safe. She turned in on herself and with a crack, landed next to Severus' coffee table, the man himself sitting down with a book. He took one look at her over his tome and she couldn't help but burst into tears, throwing herself into the nearest chair. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And then the dam broke.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Why?" Hermione cried into her hands repeatedly. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Good god," Severus stood from his seat and came over to her. "Whatever is the matter? What happened?" </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"N-nothing happened, I couldn't face them, they... they..."</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Severus swiped an anxious hand over his face before scowling. "Then you are physically alright? Gods, woman, I was worried you'd gone and splinched yourself."</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"No, no..." A pause as Severus handed her a clean white hanky. Hermione held it in her hand uselessly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"What did they do to upset you so?" Severus sat down next to her, his nearness a now familiar and strong grounding force.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"They..." a brief streak of anger coursed through her. "Apparently I'm a </span>
  <em>
    <span class="s2">little</span>
  </em>
  <span class="s1"> sick, apparently I'm a </span>
  <em>
    <span class="s2">flake</span>
  </em>
  <span class="s1">. God forbid I can't move from the pain on my best mate's birthday. I should have had someone levitate me there!" </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Do I need to fetch you a calming draught?" Severus asked simply, a quirk to his brow.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This seemed to bring back her tears. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I just don't understand," Hermione sobbed morosely. She was at the end of her rope. Why did it seem like no one cared at all? Did they all despise her that much?</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"You must not let this bother you," he said solemnly. "Pretend as if you've never known them, or convince yourself you despise them, but do not dwell. It was chatter, nothing more." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Is that how </span>
  <span class="s2">you</span>
  <span class="s1"> deal with gossip? Isolation?" Hermione asked him, a pathetic wobble to her voice. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"It is how you must to maintain any level of sanity!" he replied shortly. "People are untrustworthy, unreliable. It is best to avoid them at all costs."</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"But..." Hermione's voice was thick with distress. "But I wanted, I needed to see my friends."</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"A personality flaw, I assure you. You can grow out of it," Severus replied sardonically. "I did. The closer you become to people, the more you trust them, the more painful and lasting the wound when they inevitably hurt you." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"But I..." Trust you, Hermione wanted to say, but she dare not speak it lest his words of caution become a self-fulfilling prophesy. The thought pained her more, and without thought Hermione launched herself into his chest with a whimper. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He huffed a surprised breath into her hair. "Well..." almost hesitantly, his arms came around her, a soothing hand patting her back softly. "There there. It's not worth getting upset over, is is?"</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"I..." Hermione sniffled, her useable fingers gently stroking the folded cotton sleeve of his shirt. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Is it?" he asked again, though his question was more like a demand, his deep voice brokering no argument. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"No," Hermione snuffled back her tears, the beginning of mortification coming over her. Gods, she'd acted so foolishly all day! "No, sir." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"That's a girl," he murmured into her hair, and the praise had her stomach twisting pleasantly. "Now, is that a box of quiche you dropped on the floor?" </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hermione let out a surprised and watery giggle, sitting back and looking up at her former professor and current friend. "Yes, yes it is." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Well," he smirked down at her. "We shouldn't let it go to waste." </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p>
