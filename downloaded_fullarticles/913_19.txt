    <p align="left">The sound of a cry pierced the quiet night. For a few moments, no one in the house stirred. And it certainly was a full house being somewhere in the middle of the night before Christmas Day. The cry grew louder and was soon joined by another.</p>
<p align="left">Oliver Wood stirred in his sleep, not wanting to wake up but at the same time, being unable to ignore the cries any longer.</p>
<p align="left">“Red… you should go,” he mumbled, reaching over to pat his sleeping wife next to him, still keeping his eyes closed. He wasn’t sure if she was awake.</p>
<p align="left">“No… I was up a few hours ago,” she groaned, rolling over and pulling the comforter over her head. “Let the children take care of it.”</p>
<p align="left">“We don’t know who it is,” Oliver mumbled again.</p>
<p align="left">“I don’t care… need sleep,” Iris replied, though Oliver could barely make out her voice under the comforter and now pillow. “You go check.”</p>
<p align="left">Sighing, Oliver finally peeled his eyes open and struggled to push himself up in the bed, having to sit on the edge of the bed a few moments to get his bearings. It felt like he had just fallen asleep, but one look at the clock told him that he had been out for at least three hours.</p>
<p align="left">“Oliver, hurry… before everyone else wakes up,” Iris mumbled.</p>
<p align="left">Another cry started up.</p>
<p align="left">Iris groaned in frustration as she threw the comforter off and sat up.</p>
<p align="left">“Both might as well go,” she said, slipping into her slippers. “Seems this is going to take more than one person.”</p>
<p align="left">“We’re too old for this,” Oliver said, still sitting. “This was not what I had in mind…”</p>
<p align="left">“That’s what I said,” Iris retorted sleepily as she stood and walked over to her robe. She then turned, noticing that Oliver was still sitting at the side of the bed, his head lulling forward. “Oliver!”</p>
<p align="left">He started before jumping up and walking over to his robe.</p>
<p align="left">“I’m awake,” he said. Iris chuckled.</p>
<p align="left">“You fell asleep again,” she replied.</p>
<p align="left">“Can you blame me? It’s a wonder anyone is getting any sleep tonight with everyone in the house,” he grumbled, starting to shuffle to the door.</p>
<p align="left">“It’s Christmas,” Iris said with a sigh, following him. “I’ll see to the little ones. You go start on bottles. Probably going to need a whole load.”</p>
<p align="left">“Sure, Red,” Oliver said with a yawn as they both made their way to the door. “Merlin… how did we end up here?”</p>

  <em>Oliver Wood<br/></em>
  <em>March 18, 2029</em>
</p>
<p align="left">I knew something was up. I knew it from the moment Wills and Daisy walked in the door.</p>
<p align="left">It was our usual monthly family lunch at the country house. Even with everyone married - er well, almost married as Alan and Bridget had been engaged nearly a year but still hadn’t set a date - and Remus and Laura now with a toddler, they still showed up like clockwork on Sunday every month. Granted never at the same time. Though this time rather than Remus and Laura being late because they were trying to wrangle wee Gavin, Pix and Wills had rushed in last, both apologizing profusely for making everyone wait.</p>
<p align="left">Pix kept shooting Wills glares. Which meant they had either had a fight or there was something she didn’t want him to tell us. I wasn’t happy with either option.</p>
<p align="left"><em>“Red?” </em>I thought, raising an eyebrow in her direction as she filled her plate.</p>
<p align="left"><em>“Whatever it is, she’s blocking me,” </em>she replied. I rolled my eyes.</p>
<p align="left"><em>“Then look into Wills,” </em>I replied, the snark evident even in my thoughts. She just shot me a scowl and continued on filling her plate, seeming quite content not to know whatever it was that was going on. I turned my attention back to our children and their spouses. Fine. Wills could barely keep a secret to save his life. By the end of lunch, he’d give it up. I probably wouldn’t even need to goad him on it.</p>
<p align="left">“How’s Quidditch Monthly?” I asked, directing the question to Jamie’s wife Lila.</p>
<p align="left">“Keeping me busy,” she said. “I was at three matches this week, not including Puddlemere’s yesterday.”</p>
<p align="left">“They still giving you Jamie’s matches off?” I asked before taking a bite.</p>
<p align="left">“Seems it is a bit of a conflict of interest, seeing as I am married to the star keeper,” she replied lightly. I glanced over at Jamie, who was fidgeting in his chair. That was odd. Jamie only got like that when he was nervous. And he was rarely nervous nowadays. What the blazes could be going on?</p>
<p align="left">“Yea, yea, Jamie the star keeper. Seems he’s a star in other ways,” Remus remarked with a grin. Alan laughed as Jamie glared at him. Seemed even at nearly 28, the triplets were still taking the mickey out of each other. Though whatever for, I had no idea.</p>
<p align="left">“Ehm, right… how’s St. Mungo’s, Bridget?” I asked, looking at Alan’s fiance, thanking Merlin and all the stars that I was being spared yet another wedding with Hans. I lucked out with Remus. Laura had found out she was pregnant a few months after Pix’s wedding, so the two had a quick and simple ceremony before Gavin came along. Alan on the other hand seemed too lazy for a wedding as the couple were taking their own sweet time planning it.</p>
<p align="left">“Good. Busy, though,” she said, smiling at me. “Thankfully I don’t see any of this lot that often. Though did see you and Wills leaving on Wednesday, Daisy. Tried to catch up to you, but you were walking too quickly…”</p>
<p align="left">“You were at St. Mungo’s, Pix?” I asked, turning my attention to my daughter. Her face started turning slightly red as Wills began literally bouncing in his chair.</p>
<p align="left">“Spot of flu, is all,” she said quickly before stomping her foot on Wills’. He gave out a short yelp but managed to stop bouncing as he shoved food in his mouth.</p>
<p align="left">“Must be going around. Didn’t I overhear that you were feeling under the weather this week as well, Lila?” Remus asked, looking over at her. Lila froze, her fork halfway to her mouth as Jamie scowled at his brother. He started laughing, which only set off Gavin, who giggled from his high chair as he started throwing his spoon around. Alan just smiled as Bridget rolled her eyes and sighed, shaking her head.</p>
<p align="left">“Remus, you’re getting him all worked up,” Laura chided as she grabbed the spoon and attempted to wipe down the babe’s face. I glanced over at Red. The look on her face read that something was clearly going on with our children. I looked back at the other end of the table, taking in Jamie and then Wills.</p>
<p align="left">It was only a matter of who would spill first.</p>
<p align="left">Taking a deep breath, I put my fork down and put on my best coach face. Perhaps I could scare it out of them. Jamie already looked as though he was going to be sick. Wills kept shoving food in his mouth, likely to keep from talking.</p>
<p align="left">“Right, well… something is obviously going on here,” I said calmly. “Now-”</p>
<p align="left">“LILA’S PREGNANT!”</p>
<p align="left">“WE’RE HAVING A BABY!”</p>
<p align="left">I felt my heart stop slightly as Jamie and Wills stared at each other and Daisy dropped her head into her hands. Lila just blinked as silence fell over the table. And just as suddenly, the room was full of chaos. Iris leapt from her seat and ran first to Jamie and Lila, hugging both, then over to Daisy and Wills. Remus slapped Wills on the back as the ruddy idiot just sat there and grinned, his front covered in the food he had spit out when he shouted. Laura and Bridget were congratulating Lila, excitedly asking about how she was feeling.</p>
<p align="left">And I… I just sat there, unable to speak.</p>
<p align="left">“Think you broke Da,” Alan said with a chuckle as they all looked at me, suddenly realizing I hadn’t said a word.</p>
<p align="left">“I resent that. He didn’t do that when Laura and I were expecting,” Remus said.</p>
<p align="left">“We were both ecstatic for you, Remus,” Iris said. “Beyond thrilled. Gavin is our first grandchild, after all.” She bent over and kissed the tot on the head, cooing at him as he giggled.</p>
<p align="left">“Pretty sure it’s because of Pix. Not Jamie,” Alan replied. “He always goes mental when Pix is involved.”</p>
<p align="left">“Dad?”</p>
<p align="left">I looked over, seeing Daisy starting towards me, a worried look on her face. In a flash, I saw her as a wee thing again. I shook my head. Pix was a grown woman - nearly 26. She had been married for nearly two years. And now she was having a baby.</p>
<p align="left">My little Pix was about to have a baby.</p>
<p align="left">“I’m fine,” I croaked, quickly reaching for a napkin and wiping my face with it. I did not want anyone to see the sheen of tears that were likely in my eyes.</p>
<p align="left">“You’d think he didn’t already have a grandchild,” Remus huffed.</p>
<p align="left">“Gavin’s my first and will always be special,” I said, frowning at him. “Just… wasn’t expecting two at once…”</p>
<p align="left">“Sure that’s it,” Alan replied. I shot him a look. I was not upset. Just in shock.</p>
<p align="left">“Well… this is not exactly how we wanted to tell you,” Daisy said. “I’m only about six weeks. We were planning to wait a bit longer.”</p>
<p align="left">“Due in November?” Lila asked.</p>
<p align="left">“Yea,” Daisy replied.</p>
<p align="left">“So are we,” Lila said, smiling.</p>
<p align="left">“They’ll be in the same year at Hogwarts!” Wills exclaimed.</p>
<p align="left">Bloody hell.</p>
<p align="left">“You hear that, Gavin, you’re going to have cousins,” Laura crooned to the tot, lifting him out of the chair and into her lap. Remus leaned over and tickled him, causing the baby to giggle.</p>
<p align="left">“This is just… wonderful,” Iris said, already crying. “Oh, Oliver. Go grab that bottle of the 30-year you’ve been holding on to.” I nodded and stood, walking into the library. I needed a few moments to myself just to wrap my head around everything. Jamie and Lila were going to have a baby. Daisy and Wills were going to have a baby. I was going to have a total of three grandchildren by November.</p>
<p align="left">Immediately, I had the image of a tiny ginger tot with curly hair running up to me, begging to go for a broom ride. Merlin, I hoped it looked like Daisy. And took after her. Not sure I could stand to have a mini Wills running around.</p>
<p align="left">I returned to the dining room with the bottle and glasses, a smile now on my face as I felt the giddiness start to build up. I was going to have more grandchildren. By Merlin, we’d have our quidditch team yet. Setting it all down on the table, I walked over and hugged Pix, kissing the top of her head.</p>
<p align="left">“Are you really okay?” she asked, looking up at me.</p>
<p align="left">“‘Course I am, Pix,” I said. It was all I could manage to get out, feeling the tears start up again.</p>
<p align="left">“You’re not crying, are you?” she asked.</p>
<p align="left">“No,” I replied, wiping at my face again.</p>
<p align="left">“He cried when you told us about Gavin,” Red said. “Though only after you all left.”</p>
<p align="left">“Did not!” I shouted as the kids started laughing. I huffed as Wills stood, grinning at me. Before I could say anything, he pulled me into a bone-shattering hug.</p>
<p align="left">“Leggo, Wills!” I shouted.</p>
<p align="left">“I’m going to be a dad!” he said. “What do you think it’s going to be, Grandad?”</p>
<p align="left">“How much you wanna bet one of them has triplets,” Remus said.</p>
<p align="left">“Merlin, I should hope not,” Lila said, her eyes wide.</p>
<p align="left">“Same. Three babies at once? No, thanks,” Daisy said, looking down at her flat stomach. “I’d never get my form back.”</p>
<p align="left">“I told you, Daisy. You’ll be beautiful no matter what,” Wills said, kissing her cheek.</p>
<p align="left">“How did you tell?” Laura asked, looking back at the three women.</p>
<p align="left">“Wills found out by accident,” Daisy said, shooting him a frown.</p>
<p align="left">“Jamie walked in while I was doing the charm,” Lila said, glancing at him. “Though we too had agreed we’d wait a bit longer before saying anything.”</p>
<p align="left">“How did your first exams go?” Iris asked.</p>
<p align="left">“Everything is fine and Little Pix is growing well,” Wills said brightly as he patted Daisy’s stomach.</p>
<p align="left">“Little Pix?” I asked.</p>
<p align="left">“He’s convinced it’s a girl,” she replied.</p>
<p align="left">“Jamie’s already got a bevy of boy names picked out,” Lila said with a chuckle.</p>
<p align="left">“Does he randomly pat your stomach?” Daisy asked. “Or talk to it?”</p>
<p align="left">“All the time,” Lila said, rolling her eyes. I cleared my throat and moved back to the firewhiskey, busying myself with pouring it. I did not need to know the intricate details of my daughter and daughter-in-law’s pregnancies. Already been through that with Red and did not care to hear it all again.</p>
<p align="left"><em>“What are you thinking?” </em>I heard Red ask in my head.</p>
<p align="left">
  <em>“We’re going to need more expansion charms for Christmas…”</em>
</p>
<p align="center">~~~</p>
<p align="left">“Can you believe it?” Iris said as she fell into the chair next to mine on the upstairs porch. “We’re going to have two new grandchildren this year.” She looked over at me, still grinning. “I hope one of them is a girl. I do adore Gavin, but I’m dying to buy a load of frilly little dresses and bows.”</p>
<p align="left">I chuckled as I brought my glass to my lips and took a sip.</p>
<p align="left">“I just hope at least one of them is a quidditch player,” I said.</p>
<p align="left">“Of course that’s what you’d focus on,” she said, rolling her eyes slightly. “With our genes, I’m sure you’ll have at least two.”</p>
<p align="left">“Gavin already loves going for broom rides,” I said with a smile, thinking back to the afternoon. After the announcements and we finished eating, I took the tot outside for a few laps around the pitch - Laura shouting at me not to go too high. I bit my tongue before replying that I had done this before. The infant had giggled and squealed the entire time, squirming so much that I nearly lost my grip on him. He was going to be a handful when he got older, that was for sure. “How long before Alan and Bridget decide to have one, do you think?”</p>
<p align="left">“Oh, probably not too much longer. He never did like being left behind. Now that Remus, Jamie and Daisy are all having children, I’m sure they get started soon enough,” Iris said. She then breathed a happy sigh as she looked out over the countryside. “This is the part I was looking forward to… the house full of children again.”</p>
<p align="left">“And then sending them home with their parents,” I added. She chuckled.</p>
<p align="left">“Yes, that as well,” she said, taking a sip of her wine. “Nearly can’t believe it. It was real when Gavin came along, but… seems even more real now that Daisy is pregnant. Thought for sure they’d wait longer.” That was true. I thought so as well. She had said as much the last time we had talked about the upcoming World Cup and her brothers had started ribbing her about children.</p>
<p align="left">“It’s a shame I won’t have her for the Cup,” I said, causing Iris to laugh.</p>
<p align="left">“We both know Daisy. She’ll be up in the air over the next winter break and back on the pitch for the second half,” Iris said. “She’ll probably keep it a secret for another few months just so she can play in the playoffs.”</p>
<p align="left">“Is that smart?” I asked, looking over at her. Daisy was a bit reckless with her tricks. Would that be good for the baby?</p>
<p align="left">“She should be fine as long as she takes it back a few notches,” Iris responded. “Ashley played up until she was nearly four months - Daisy’s not even two.”</p>
<p align="left">“I did not want her on the pitch at all once she told us, all those the bludgers flying about. Though she had some sort of special padding for the belly. And she still showed up at the gym every day to train until a month or so before she gave birth. Both times,” I replied with a snort. “Knowing Pix, Nilsson’s gonna have himself a handful. Do not envy him that.”</p>
<p align="left">“Daisy will be fine,” Iris said, smiling at me as she reached over and patted my hand. I nodded, setting my glass down. I then stood and walked over, pulling Iris up from her chair. “Oliver! What are you doing?”</p>
<p align="left">I didn’t answer as I leaned down and kissed her then lifted her up in my arms, causing her to laugh.</p>
<p align="left">“Figure we should enjoy what little time alone we have left. All the grandkids coming, the sleepovers at Gran and Grandad’s will start up soon,” I said before kissing her again.</p>
<p align="left">“Oh, well then… continue,” she said, her eyes flashing.</p>
<p align="left">Merlin, I loved this woman.</p>
