    <p>Lee lay on the bed with his head hanging off the side and his arms spread out beside him, his dreadlocks fell over the side dangling just a few inches above the floor. He got off work about an hour ago, usually he worked till late covering news stories and checking in on sources but his heart just wasn't in it today and it showed. So his boss sent him home and told him to get some rest.</p><p>"<em>You work too much. And really it's a wonder you're holding out so well despite being around those ... monsters for so long."</em></p><p>Monsters.</p><p>Lee sighed. A few months ago he used to think of them in very much the same way.</p><p>He thought they were monsters, evil vile creatures that don't deserve the air they breathe and he sincerely hoped that they would rot in hell.</p><p>But again that was months ago, six months to be exact and in that time Lee has come to realize his own faults. To realize just how misguided he was.</p><p>To realize just how easy it is to hate something because of the pure and simple fact that he didn't understand it.</p><p>Without even realizing it Lee lifted his hand up to his lips and touched them, wondering briefly when it happened that he longed for that simple touch, a touch that he never got to have, not really any way.</p><p>He's kissed them before, both of them and Lee can admit that he'd enjoyed both times on some level even if he hadn't done it for the same reasons. With one it was simply an impulse, like it was just the right thing to do at the time. He didn't feel anything for the older man nothing romantic, at least not really. He was more like an older brother. An older brother he'd gladly shag if given the chance but still, it was never about romance with him.</p><p>Lee remembers it clearly although some parts of his brain wished he didn't since it wasn't entirely pleasant although it wasn't completely horrible either but that wasn't <em>his </em>fault. It felt good, warm and passionate unfortunately his mouth didn't taste too pleasant. His lips were chapped, his mouth tasted dirty and a little slimy and the smell coming from the older man had Lee quickly pulling away in order to catch his breath. His beard was untamed and therefore incredibly scratchy while his hair was long but tangled and greasy so Lee didn't waste much time running his hands through it.</p><p>All in all it wasn't a nice kiss, but it was still a good kiss if that makes sense.</p><p>With the other brother it was a moment of instinct as well but this time Lee couldn't deny that he felt something deeper for him, something that was far stronger than brotherly affection something he wanted more of as well.</p><p>His kiss had its negatives, his hair was just as messy and unkempt as his brother's only less greasy and he'd been allowed to shave and wash up a bit so Lee didn't get the same scratchy moldy experience although it was still a bit stinky. But it was still some kind if perfect. He remembers the moan that reached his ears after their lips made contact, the ghost of a phantom touch on the side of his face and back of his neck and he's sure the older man would have grabbed his dreadlocks an yanked hard if he'd only been allowed to touch and it's that thought that caused Lee to let out a soft whimper of want before he pulled away.</p><p>The first time happened months ago, after that he'd been too terrified to attempt it too often for fear of being caught and the repercussions that may follow because of it but he gave into temptation eventually and he hasn't been able to stop himself since.</p><p>The boy sighed as he let his arm drop down onto his bed all over again. Merlin he's a mess. Not even Fred and George have ever gotten him this deep into trouble before and their pranks were legendary. What's worse is the fact that Lee can't tell his best friends about his problem. What he wouldn't do to just have someone to talk to about all this. But he can't</p><p>If someone were to find out, if anyone found out...</p><p>Lee doesn't even want to think about what would happen then.</p><p>Lee glanced over towards the watch hanging over the nightstand near the window, briefly catching sight of the crescent moon in the velvet sky. It's late; if he isn't going to do something productive he might as well sleep right?</p><p>Letting out a deep breath Lee slowly sat up and got off the bed heading over to the bathroom. To get ready to sleep when he suddenly heard his fireplace roar with flames announcing a fire call before a voice suddenly gave a shout.</p><p>"Jordan! Jordan where the hell are you, we have a crisis on our hands." Lee frowned as he quickly ran into the living room where he could hear his boss, Abbey Lockwood's voice screeching excitedly "Jordan!"</p><p>Lee stuck his head into the bright flames, "I'm right here. Really I heard you the first time-"</p><p>"Where the hell have you been and exactly why aren't you dressed? This is the biggest news story we've had since the Triwizard tournament and you're lying about at home?"</p><p>Lee rolled his eyes, "You're the one who told me to go home remember?"</p><p>"Never mind that I need you down here right now, we have breaking news and I want all of my best journalists and anchors working on it."</p><p>Lee frowned, "What's going on?"</p><p>"Prison break at Azkaban." The woman said not even bothering to mask the excitement in her voice, as if a bunch if murderous criminals getting out to wreak havoc on society was a good thing, "Rumor has it he-who-must-not-be-named went in to go get his followers. Aurors are in an absolute tizzy about the affair demanding to know how anyone managed to get passed the dementors. Anyway I need you down here for the news broadcast and..."</p><p>Lee was barely paying attention and his eyes were blown wide. He quickly spoke, interrupting the woman's ramblings, "Exactly who got out?"</p><p>"His followers from what we understand. Avery, Wilkes and a few others although we haven't gotten the full report yet. That's why I need you here; you've had more time around Azkaban than any of the others, I need you to start digging for answers."</p><p>Lee swallowed hard but still nodded, "Right I'm on my way."</p><p>The fire died away and Lee all but ran to his bedroom, hazardously tossing his clothes to the floor as he looked for something to wear all while his heart raced and his breaths came out on quick pants. He felt like he was panicking but it wasn't panic that the dark teen felt, it was excitement, fear and maybe just a little bit of hope.</p><p>Lee had just tugged on his jacket and slipped his wand in its holster when he suddenly heard a noise.</p><p>Loud tapping against his bedroom window. Lee might have ignored it and thought it to just be a bird or some sort of tree branch if it weren't for the fact that he lived in the middle of the city far away from any trees of any sort. In the muggle world at home Lee would have thought it to be a coincidence. In the wizard world however there's no such thing as a coincidence.</p><p>Pausing for a moment Lee approached the window, seeing nothing but the clear night sky on the other side of the glass frame he might have ignored it if it weren't for the tapping he heard all over again. With all the Gryffindor courage he could muster Lee quickly reached out and opened the window, a gust of cool night air hit him in the face and Lee frowned since he couldn't see anything. He leaned out of the window and tried to find the source of the noise only to gasp in surprise when he was suddenly grabbed, yanked out through the window and hauled up into the air. The teen let out a brief scream of surprise when he was dragged up into the air before scrapping to get a tight grasp on the body whose arms were wrapped around his waist.</p><p>"Holy shit!" Lee cursed as he looked down at the street much further down below only for a warm chuckle to break his terrified thoughts and bring him back to the figure that snatched him. "What-... Rabastan?"</p><p>The older man gave him a grin and Lee could do nothing more than stare in shock before he stuttered out, "What-how..."</p><p>"I said I'd have you remember?"</p><p>Lee does remember, but that's hardly the point here.</p><p>"No I mean-" the teen was cut off when a pair I lips suddenly met his own, claiming his mouth in a possessive kiss that left the teen feeling breathless by the time the older man pulled back. Lee gasped and his hands clenched in Rabastan's robes. It felt so much better than it did a while back. Rabastan smelled heavenly like fresh cut grass and oak, he was shaved clean and Lee couldn't help but moan since he could actually feel Rabastan kiss him <em>back</em> this time, completely unhindered by Azkaban security magic that made every touch feel like a whisper of air. Lee was lost in these thoughts when the older man spoke and brought him back to reality.</p><p>"You're coming with us."</p><p>Lee sighed and shook his head. "No."</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"You mean besides the fact that I'm a muggleborn?" Lee looked away, "You know why, I-I care about both of you a lot. But I don't agree with what you're doing."</p><p>"You know, we could just take you by force. Lock you up in the manor and claim you as a war prisoner-"</p><p>"You could," The boy started holding the older man's gaze, "But you won't."</p><p>Rabastan said nothing for a moment before his face broke out in a grin, "Fine. Roddy said you'd refuse bloody Gryffindor morals. Alright then, I suppose we only have a few hours."</p><p>"What do you mean by...wait Roddy?"</p><p>At that Rabastan's grin grew wider and he suddenly let go of the teen quickly reminding Lee of the fact that they were still hovering in midair. He'd forgotten to wonder exactly how they were doing that and loosened his grip on the older man causing him to plummet the moment Rabastan let go and he screamed before he was suddenly caught all over again. And he was left gasping wide eyed in shock as he was hauled onto some sort of pole just before his lips were claimed in another kiss. This one just a little less intense than the first but it was enough to bring Lee back to his senses and he found himself on a broom facing Rodolphus Lestrange.</p><p>The older man smirked and Lee huffed out a growl as he tried to catch his breath. "You two are insane."</p><p>"I thought that was obvious." Rodolphus said and Lee could hear Rabastan laughing somewhere in the distance. "So a night on the town is it?"</p><p>"I have work." Lee bit his bottom lip, "I can't... I shouldn't-"</p><p>"But you will." Rodolphus said smoothly as he brushed back a dread lock that had fallen over Lee's face and the boy just noticed how different he looked. His appearance still looked a bit haggard considering the fact that he's spent the past couple of years in Azkaban that should be expected but he was still quite handsome. His beard was trimmed shorter, his hair was clean although it was still a tangled mess and he thankfully didn't smell of death the way he did before.</p><p>Just like his brother, they tasted clean but felt like sin.</p><p>Lee took in the man's features and lifted a hand to touch his cheek and jaw like the first time and he spoke before he could stop himself.</p><p>"What about Bellatrix, where's she?"</p><p>Rodolphus didn't even bat an eye at the mention of his wife's name as he leaned in to kiss Lee on the lips. "Don't be naïve. We both know where she is."</p><p>Lee said nothing when Rabastan was suddenly at his side with that grin still in place. "It's as good a diversion as any."</p><p>Lee didn't say anything to that or rather he didn't get the chance to as the broom he was on took a sudden dip before shooting up into the sky and he gasped as he wrapped his arms around the older Lestrange since he just noticed that he was seated with his back turned towards the front of the broom. Rodolphus chuckled and Lee could hear Rabastan cackle loudly somewhere nearby and he couldn't help but smile.</p><p>It's funny how much things can change in six months.</p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>Six months.</p><p>How interesting it is when things change.</p><p>"Harry… Harry are you awake?"</p><p>The boy that lived looked up at the door to find his cousin peeking around the side as he squinted through the darkness in the room.</p><p>He was awake, sitting on his bed near the window as he used the moonlight to read the book that Draco gave him a few months ago on his sixteenth birthday. It was an ancient relic, written in parseltongue and given to the Malfoy's as a gift a long time ago. Draco found it in the family library and gave it to Harry since he thought it would be of more interest to the ex-Gryffindor since he could actually speak parseltongue.</p><p>Harry wasn't so sure, he wasn't even sure that he'd be able to read the book when Draco gave it to him so he was more than just a little surprised when the words swirled and he suddenly realized that the swirls were starting to make sense.</p><p>It was fascinating.</p><p>There were hundreds of spells and potions detailed in the book, some dark and some not. Recently Harry found a spell that's left him absolutely absorbed, absolutely absorbed since he was trying desperately to find its counter spell.</p><p>When Harry got back to Privet drive for the Easter holidays he got straight to work to try and find it so he spent most of his time in his room and managed to lose track of time. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia rarely ever bothered with him these days; it seemed Dudley's sudden changes had caused a change in the muggle couple a change that left them empty. Mere shells of their former selves.</p><p>But Harry didn't really mind Dudley's change, he was different, very different but in a good way Harry thought.</p><p>He's always thought that things between him and his cousin might have started out differently if his Aunt and Uncle had just treated him a bit better from the start. If they'd treated him like a human being, he and Dudley might have been childhood friends instead of enemies the way they started out if they'd only been a bit kinder. Now things are different and Dudley isn't so much an enemy as an awkward cousin who can't seem to make eye contact with him for too long.</p><p>"Yeah, I'm up." Harry turned towards the entrance and shut his book to give the teen a small smile, Dudley looked away and his hand clenched on the door before he quickly slipped inside and shut the door behind him as he made his way over to the bed.</p><p>"You got some letters today." Dudley said as he sat on the bed and Harry just noticed the letters in the taller teen's hand. "I grabbed them before Dad could burn them the way he usually does."</p><p>"Thanks." Harry said as Dudley handed him a stack of letters and briefly flipped through them. There were a few from Draco and a few other house mates; Theo, Neville, Luna and Pansy. Harry barely suppressed a shiver, what on earth could she be on about now?</p><p>There was a letter from Ron, the twins, a separate letter from Arthur, Remus and Tonks most likely about Sirius. Harry barely spared the letters from Ginny and Hermione a glance as he tossed them aside. After everything that happened he couldn't understand how they could still believe that he'd ever want anything to do with either of them. Harry paused to just stare at the last letter written with smooth cursive letters made by short precise strokes and smiled. There was no name on the letter other than his own, but that didn't stop Harry from instantly knowing who it was from.</p><p>He really needs to get back to work on that counter spell.</p><p>"I-…" Harry looked up at the other teen and found Dudley sitting with a letter of his own on his lap. He'd lost a lot of weight over the course of the last year, grew out his hair and stopped dressing in those atrocious tacky clothes that he used to wear. He dressed less like a muggle, changed the way he walked and talked, became a completely different person. But as Harry watched his cousin he suddenly remembered that while Dudley might have changed from the ignorant little terror he used to be before the year began he was still just a little bit selfish. If he'd really just saved Harry's letters he would have saved them till the next morning or just given them to Harry when he got them. Instead he waited till midnight, when his mother and father would be fast asleep.</p><p>No, if Dudley waited for this long it was because he wanted someone to talk to. Away from Durmstrang the only person that he could count on to listen was Harry. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were ashamed of him and of themselves. After years of treating Harry like dirt and labeling him as a freak, their son, their flesh and blood started doing magic right there in their house. He got a letter from Durmstrang just a few days after that. Uncle Vernon tried burning the letters, throwing them away and even just locking out the owls that arrived and Aunt Petunia did all she could to stop her son from turning into a freak but it was all to no use.</p><p>A week later professors from Durmstrang arrived and took Dudley away, kicking and screaming as it is wizard law for any muggleborn children that discover their abilities at a late age be sent to Durmstrang since they'd be more equipped to deal with such children. From what Harry understood the treatments Dudley underwent were drastic and somewhat traumatic, resulting in the quiet, more reserved somewhat… dare he say it, sweeter Dudley sitting beside him. Although Dudley's change wasn't all of Durmstrang's doing another part of it was due to-</p><p>"Viktor sent me a gift today, along with a letter." Dudley said brushing his hair back behind his ears with a small smile, "He got some time away from the team and went to Paris with his parents, but he says that he'd like to take me with him next time. Show me how to fly on a broom properly instead of just falling about the way I have been." Dudley finished off with a chuckle and Harry couldn't help but let his smile grow bit more at the sight.</p><p>"That's great Dudley, I'm glad you're getting on so well."</p><p>"Thanks." Dudley looked up at Harry with a sigh as he just looked away, "But, he wants… He wants me to go home with him for the summer to meet his parents."</p><p>"Really?" Harry shifted a bit in his seat as he let out a soft snort, "Moving a bit quickly aren't you? Next he'll be asking you to marry him."</p><p>The raven haired wizard finished off with a laugh only for Dudley to stare back at him as a light blush spread across his cheeks and Harry gaped.</p><p>"Merlin… How-what did you say?"</p><p>"I said yes." The older teen said quietly and Harry's eyes went wide.</p><p>"Do Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon know?"</p><p>"I'm eighteen; technically they don't need to know."</p><p>"Dudley-"</p><p>"Harry I love him."</p><p>"It hasn't even been a year-"</p><p>"Do you love Raymond?" Dudley suddenly asked and Harry froze as his cousin got up off the bed and started pacing, "Then I can be in love with Viktor."</p><p>Raymond isn't is real name, but a while back after he and Harry got involved with one another, they thought it would just be safer if no one else knew about their relationship. The only reason Dudley knew about him was because he'd found one of the letters that he sent to Harry and the older teen asked who it was. Harry made up a name and so far Dudley seemed convinced.</p><p>Harry sighed raking a hand through his hair, "It's different with me and Raymond, we've known each other for years. You only realized you were a wizard a few months ago."</p><p>"And?"</p><p>"And I know how Viktor's been helping you over the past few months. He's been helping you fit in and giving you all this attention. Tutoring you and buying you all sorts of gifts. What if you're confusing infatuation with love?" Harry asked and Dudley paused for a brief moment before shaking his head, "I don't care. Viktor makes me happy and I'm happier there than here."</p><p>Harry looked down at the bed for a moment, "I still think you should tell your parents."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Dudley, you can't just disappear they should at least know-"</p><p>"They won't let me marry Viktor if they find out, even if I'm technically legal according to muggle law, they'll just try to stop me." Dudley said and Harry gave another sigh, "You can't just leave. They still love you, you know."</p><p>The taller teen shook his head with a bitter laugh, "My mother hates me for the same reason she hates you, the same reason she hated Aunt Lily. She was jealous of her you know? She's still jealous, last time my grades from Durmstrang came in do you know what the first thing is she asked me? She asked me what you got and if I did better than you."</p><p>"What did you say?" Harry cringed as Dudley kept moving, "I lied and said the marks don't work the same way. She didn't even care about how well I was doing. She went to her room and locked the door when I tried to show her some of the spells I learned to do. Harry I can't let them meet him. They're so… Viktor is so proud of his magic and his family. He says that squibs are a result of over-concentrated wizard blood. That muggleborn children are necessary to keep bloodlines fresh. He's convinced that since I'm muggle born we're guaranteed to have magical children for generations. My clean blood to preserve his pureblood. He can't meet them Harry, my parents won't even accept the fact that I'm a wizard, how do you think they'll react to me marrying another man? Having a child-"</p><p>Dudley cut himself off with a heavy sigh and Harry just watched him for a moment before he spoke, "Is having a child something that you want to do?"</p><p>"Viktor's always wanted a big family and-"</p><p>"This isn't about Viktor Dudley it's about you. Is that, getting married now and having a child what <em>you </em>want?"</p><p>Dudley paused, "I want to be happy and Viktor makes me happy and even if I didn't want to stay with Viktor. I already know that I'm gay Harry and one day I do want to have kids, but here with… muggles don't understand."</p><p>"You know you were a muggle a few months ago." Harry sighed, "Your parents are muggles."</p><p>"Exactly." Dudley said as if Harry proved his point and the green eyed teen just watched as his cousin started moving again. "I remember what I was like and I'm really sorry for the way I treated you-"</p><p>"You already apologized-"</p><p>"If it hadn't been for the accident, if I hadn't suddenly tapped into my magical core, I'd probably be in jail by now. I was such a complete and total utter prick. But now, I feel good Harry. I feel like I have a purpose like there's really something I could make of myself. But I can't do that as long as I stay here, we both know that."</p><p>Yes he does. Harry shifted on the bed a bit more as he spoke, "What are you going to do?"</p><p>"I don't know," Dudley said raking his hair in frustration, "I don't know. This would all be so much easier if I was a pureblood you know."</p><p>"Would Viktor still want you then?"</p><p>The taller teen froze and gave Harry a look close to complete and total utter horror, "I-I, of course he would… wouldn't he?"</p><p>It was then that they both heard the sounds of loud tapping against the window.</p><p>"What was that?" Dudley asked as Harry got up from the bed and walked up to the window only for a beaming smile to spread over the wizards face as he opened it and looked through the bars out into the open night air to see a seemingly horseless carriage hovering just outside his window while Fred and George were practically hanging from the door.</p><p>"Bars again?"</p><p>"You'd think he'd learnt his lesson-"</p><p>"After the last time."</p><p>Harry just smiled, glancing at the three thestrals at the front of the carriage. They were pitch black as their large wings flapped rhythmically in place as he asked, "What are you guys doing here and where did you get that?"</p><p>The twins shrugged, "The in-laws are visiting-"</p><p>"And since Ronniekins has been so miserable without you around-"</p><p>"And lady Zabini said she'd let us borrow her horses of death-"</p><p>"We decided to pop out and come get you." George finished with a grin and Harry started to frown, "Lady Zabini?"</p><p>Just then Harry saw a figure appear seemingly out of nowhere, or rather his head appear hovering above the thestral at the front, dark skin and an arrogant smirk.</p><p>"Evening Harry."</p><p>"Blaise… I always forget you have one of those."</p><p>"Not as good as yours though." Blaise admitted and Harry gave a snort, "I'm surprised they didn't bully you into letting them drive."</p><p>At that Blaise's smirk just got wider as Fred spoke. "We tried-"</p><p>"They neighed-"</p><p>"And growled-"</p><p>"And hissed-"</p><p>"They don't like us." George finished off with a glare aimed at the general direction of the front and one of the thestrals seemed to huff at him shaking its head before facing straight ahead.</p><p>"Balthazar, Castiel and Uriel wouldn't let them." The dark skinned wizard said before nodding towards the carriage, "Get your things, I promised my fiancé I'd bring him back a Potter and I plan on delivering."</p><p>"Alright-"</p><p>"That was-"</p><p>"Our line!"</p><p>Harry turned back towards the room and immediately headed towards his trunk underneath the bed. He never unpacked it whenever he went back to the Dursley's, past experience has taught him that his possessions were much safer in his trunk which was protected by spells and wards. Although Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon barely bothered with him these days, its better safe than sorry.</p><p>Harry quickly grabbed his wand and snatched the book of spells from the bed when he suddenly remembered that he wasn't alone. Dudley stood awkwardly by the wall and for a moment the green eyed wizard wasn't sure what to do or say.</p><p>Dudley gave him a small smile, "Its O.K I won't tell."</p><p>"Dudley-" and suddenly there was a loud explosion as the bars on the windows were blasted apart and Dudley's eyes went wide as he rushed forward. "We both know Dad heard that. Hurry up." The taller teen pulled out his wand</p><p>Twelve and a half inch willow with a dragon string core.</p><p>Harry remembers the first time he saw Dudley's wand watching him heal a cut he'd gotten on his arm in the kitchen. It was deep and bleeding heavily, Harry never found out how that happened</p><p>The taller teen cast a shrinking spell along with a feather light spell on his trunk before picking it up and giving it to his cousin. At the expression on Harry's face Dudley only rolled his eyes.</p><p>"I already came of age remember? You haven't."</p><p>"Right."</p><p>"Harry, time to go." Fred called and Harry could hear his uncle give a shout as he stumbled out of bed down the hall.</p><p>In a split second Harry suddenly wondered about that cut Dudley got, about exactly how much his Aunt and Uncle have changed over the past few months. Yes, they used to hurt Harry in the past but hey wouldn't hurt their own son would they?</p><p>Somehow Harry wasn't willing to leave the idea to chance.</p><p>"C'mon." Harry said taking Dudley's hand only for the taller teen to resist him with a frown, "What?"</p><p>"I'm not leaving you here with them. It was different when you were a muggle, now-"</p><p>"BOY!"</p><p>"Harry get moving!"</p><p>"Not without Dudley."</p><p>The twins shared a look and Blaise just let out a sigh, "Fine just get out of there."</p><p>"Uh, Blaise-"</p><p>"Molly won't be a problem, he can stay at the manor, Mother's been looking for a new project anyway."</p><p>"Dudley… Dudley!"</p><p>"Damn it Potter, get in the carriage right now!"</p><p>Suddenly there were thundering footsteps headed straight for the door, Harry yanked his cousin along with him and they quickly climbed into the carriage, Dudley gave the house one more worried glance just as Harry's door flew open and he saw his father's face filled with rage. It didn't take much convincing after that as the teen quickly scrambled into the carriage, Blaise immediately pulled on the reins and the thestrals took off.</p><p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>It was a quiet night, well about as quiet as the Burrow could be on any other evening.</p><p>The Burrow was filled with noise. Laughter and talking came from the home that had only grown after Harry arrived with Blaise and the twins a few hours ago, surrounded by the sounds of surrounding nature. Faintly Molly could hear the sounds of running water coming from the pond a bit away from the house, crickets and cicadas serenating the night away nearby, the chickens soft coos from the coop, Pig and Icarus hooting softly from their perch. And yet somehow, Molly's never felt more isolated and alone.</p><p>She was perched up on the roof, seated on one of the mats that she'd set out to dry on the roof the day before as she stared up at the night sky wondering how on earth her world managed to get flipped upside down in a matter of months.</p><p>This isn't the way that things are meant to be, this isn't what was meant to happen at all. Everything was going wrong despite the fact that Albus promised, he told her-</p><p>Molly sighed.</p><p>Things are not going the way they're meant to, but-</p><p>But the kids seem so, they look so happy especially Ron and Molly-</p><p>The redhead cut the thought off, lying on her back deep and thought.</p><p>Ginny's been… problematic as of late, she's been acting out, arguing with her siblings, arguing with her father. Molly's about the only one she's been able to have a civil conversation with, but even those conversations were strained at best.</p><p>It's her fault of course, Molly knows she's the one that made her daughter the way she is now. She made her promises, made sure her darling daughter followed the path she was meant to follow and never strayed. Convinced her that the Thomas boy just wasn't good enough for her and insisted that she start noticing Harry. She transferred her obsession with the greater good over to her daughter and now Molly feels-</p><p>She feels…</p><p>Molly doesn't know what she feels.</p><p>Her children are different now, not vastly different but they're better and just so happy so by all rights Molly should be happy because they're happy, but-</p><p>"Things aren't supposed to go this way."</p><p>Molly said quietly with another sigh when another voice suddenly spoke and she gasped in surprise.</p><p>"That's not necessarily a bad thing."</p><p>Molly's head snapped to the side and she found someone walking over towards her, stepping awkwardly along the uneven roof as she clutched a bottle of whiskey and a glass in one hand. She had dark mocha skin and brown eyes, long black hair in curls going down to her shoulders and wearing a black dress that went up just above her knee and clung to her curves. Molly placed her hand on her chest as she caught her breath. The brown eyed woman let out a frustrated sigh when her heel slipped and her ankle twisted to an awkward angle so she paused to slip her shoes off and held them in her free hand as she made her way over.</p><p>"Alexis." Molly said under her breath with a roll of her eyes before speaking a little louder, "Zabini."</p><p>"Weasley." The woman said once she'd made her way over taking a moment to frown at her surroundings before slipping her wand from a holster strapped to her arm and transfigured one of the other mats into a cushion before she carefully sat down and arranged herself while Molly just watched as she somehow managed to effortlessly look like she was posing for one of those muggle magazines as she flipped her hair over her shoulder and crossed one leg over the other to set her shoes down.</p><p>"How on earth did you manage to get up here?"</p><p>Alexis gave her a bored look as she tried to get more comfortable, "The same way you did. I used magic."</p><p>"I didn't use magic I went up through the attic." Molly said gesturing towards the closed window beside her and Alexis barely spared it a glance as she spoke uncorking the whiskey bottle and balancing the glass on her knees.</p><p>"I should have known, really if it weren't for the magic in this house I might have thought that you were a squib in hiding." Molly glared at the other woman who simply ignored her as she poured out a full glass of the bright amber liquid into the glass before handing it to the redhead.</p><p>Molly just blinked at the glass and stared at it while Alexis rolled her eyes, "Honestly Weasley if I wanted to poison you I wouldn't be so obvious about it. Besides, Ronald already made me promise that I wouldn't touch you so you really have nothing to be worried about. At least not where I'm concerned."</p><p>Molly let out another sigh at the mention of her son's name before taking the glass just as the woman continued, "I'd be more worried about your tailor, clearly whoever's making your clothes is hoping to ruin your life by destroying your already damaged reputation."</p><p>Molly glared at the woman, "I made this dress myself."</p><p>Alexis paused to look the woman over with a cringe, "Oh that explains so much."</p><p>Blue eyes went wide before they quickly narrowed, Molly's glare got deadly and her cheeks flushed in embarrassment and she opened her mouth to give the woman a piece of her mind when.</p><p>"I'm taking Ronald shopping with me tomorrow," Alexis started as she lifted the bottle of whiskey to take a sip "He needs a few more clothing options. You should come with us and maybe I could show you what the inside of a proper clothing shop looks like."</p><p>Molly paused and just turned away to stare down at her glass, somehow the insult didn't cut as deeply as it should have.</p><p>"I don't think so."</p><p>"Why not?" Alexis asked with a frown before giving a shrug, "If you're worried about money don't bother as long as I can fix the offence your daily eyesores cause me then I am happy to foot the bill."</p><p>"I don't need any of your bloody money <em>Lady</em> Zabini."</p><p>"Then what-"</p><p>"I don't think Ron…" Molly sighed, shaking her head to look away and Alexis gave a snort, "Oh please, as if he's the problem here."</p><p>"What-"</p><p>"Come off it Weasley." The dark woman said with a roll of her eyes while Molly just stared at her in confusion as she continued, "Ron's been begging for your attention since the holidays started. You're the one that keeps avoiding him."</p><p>Molly didn't say a word as she just looked back up to the sky, "And I know that you haven't been answering any of his letters since he was resorted. You know, just because he lives at the manor now doesn't mean you can't come see him. Arthur came for a visit just the other day after the holidays started. Percy came to see him the next day."</p><p>Molly couldn't help but turn to look at the woman, "You saw Percy?"</p><p>Alexis glanced at her before giving a shrug, "He came to see Ron. He's a very bright young man, very level headed. Such a shame what happened at the ministry. He could do such great things if he only had the right guidance."</p><p>Molly looked away again and Alexis gave a heavy sigh, "Then again a loving mother might be what he needs most at this point."</p><p>"Excuse me?! What gives you the right to-"</p><p>"When was the last time you spoke to him?" Zabini asked as she stared right into Molly's eyes and the redheaded woman took a shallow breath, "When he abandoned this family-"</p><p>"Abandoned?" Alexis stared at her incredulously, "You say that like he just threw a tantrum and left without taking a second look back."</p><p>"We warned him about the ministry." Molly said as she shot up from her spot and glared at the other, "We told him, begged him to reconsider going back but he ignored us-"</p><p>"My God woman, exactly what did you expect him to do? Just give up a job and a career he's worked so hard for because of the unconfirmed suspicions of his family?" Alexis said looking offended by the mere thought, "I'm not sure if you've noticed Weasley, but this isn't some muggle fairytale world where all ends well as long as you believe in happy thoughts or whatever it is. The boy had a choice to make and he made it, hating him for making it isn't fair to him."</p><p>Molly's eyes widened, "I don't hate him-"</p><p>"Well you have a funny way of showing it." Alexis said as she took a swig of whiskey letting out a soft hiss before she spoke with a slight croak to her voice due to the alcohol's burn, but Molly couldn't enjoy the sight of lady Zabini sounding so undignified at that moment. "That boy works so hard, to not only build a life for himself but to make you proud as well. He wants to build a legacy for the Weasley family, help it gain the respect he thinks you all deserve."</p><p>Molly shrank back down as Alexis continued, "You know I overheard him talking to Ron at the manor on his visit. Percy said he envied him, he wishes he'd had the chance to be resorted; so he could have ended up in Ravenclaw or maybe Slytherin instead of Gryffindor. From what I understand he was never happy in that house, but he held out because he knew the fact that he was sorted into Gryffindor made you happy and if he'd been sorted into Slytherin it might have broken your heart." Alexis glanced down at Molly again as she finished, "He sacrificed his childhood for you, it's not fair of any of you to ask him to sacrifice his future."</p><p>"What would you have done?" Molly asked accusingly as she glared at the dark woman, "What would you have done if your child decided to take a path that you knew wouldn't end well."</p><p>Alexis sighed, "It's not our place to try and control our children's lives Weasley. All you can do is try to help, give him some advice, let him make his mistakes and if they do lead to failure be there to help him pick up the pieces when his world falls apart. When Blaise told me about Ron, I was ready to revoke his inheritance right there and then but then I remembered what an absolutely brilliant, handsome and talent wizard I have for a son. I remembered that I wouldn't be able to stand having him away from me and so I accepted his mistake. Because it happened and there's nothing left to do but to move forward. If you love Percy, you'll be there for him no matter what. You've already warned him and like I said before he's a bright young man he heard your warnings, you're his family how could he not? If things go badly for him, then your job is to be there for him when he asks for help."</p><p>Molly sighed as she stared at the glass filled with amber liquid in her hands, "He never came to Bill and Fleur's engagement party."</p><p>Alexis gave a snort, "What did you think would have happened if he had? I've seen tempers flare up in this poor excuse for a barn enough times to be sure that it wouldn't have gone well. I mean, think about it; would you go to a family gathering thinking that everyone that was there probably hated you?"</p><p>"I was hoping that we could have worked things out, on such a happy occasion-"</p><p>"Bullshit," Alexis said quite inelegantly as she took another swig of whiskey, but Molly could tell that she wasn't even remotely drunk just incredibly annoyed. "You were hoping you could convince Percy to quit. His presence here would have just started another argument; I don't blame him from staying away."</p><p>Molly's jaw tensed and Alexis just leaned back a little more in her seat, "Percy will come back eventually and when he does, you need to reign in that temper of yours and actually listen to him and what he wants. You need to let go of your children Molly, let them live their lives the way they want. Things may be working out differently than what you'd hoped but, isn't that a small price to pay for their happiness?"</p><p>The redheaded woman looked up at the other as she stared up with a lost look at the sky, "Had Blaise ended up in Gryffindor, I wouldn't have thought any different of him. Why is it that you can't do the same for Ron? Not all Slytherin are evil. It might surprise you to know that not all Gryffindor are good either… There's something very strange about Albus Dumbledore, I'd be careful around him if I were you."</p><p>Molly almost gaped, since that comment almost seemed to come out of nowhere but still somehow struck a nerve.</p><p>"What are you talking about?"</p><p>Alexis didn't answer the question, instead just taking another swig of whiskey before she spoke, "So will you be joining us tomorrow? I should probably find you something appropriate to wear though, can't have myself seen in the outside world with you looking like… this."</p><p>Molly let out a heavy sigh as she lifted the glass to take a gulp and hissed quietly as the alcohol burned down her throat. She's going to strangle this woman at some point.</p><p>Merlin, give her strength.</p><p>"I suppose, it would be nice to get out for a bit." Molly said as she looked down at the glass, "But I'm not wearing anything you get me, my clothes are perfectly fine thank you very much."</p><p>Alexis rolled her eyes, "Merlin, give me strength."</p><p>Molly let out a soft snort at that when there was a sudden crack that rang loudly through the air. It sounded like someone apparating onto the land somewhere nearby but at the same time something about it sounded wrong. It was much too loud for a simple apparition spell, the echo that followed carried on for too long and Molly could have sworn that she caught the scent of burning ash in the air.</p><p>"What on earth was that?" Alexis asked as she immediately set the bottle of whiskey down and carefully started to stand up while Molly did the same, "I don't know."</p><p>The redheaded witch leaned over the side of the roof to look down below only for a scream to catch her attention on the other side of the house.</p><p>"HELP!"</p><p>Alexis immediately pulled the wand from her holster and grabbed a hold of Molly's arm before the other could protest, moving faster than Molly would have thought that she was capable considering the amount of alcohol that she's had. Only to hold her breath when she suddenly felt the pull of apparition before popped back out just as quickly to the front of the house. Molly blinked her eyes repeatedly only to gasp when she saw Lee Jordan on the ground in front of the house, struggling to hold up the bodies of two men on each of his shoulders, with the remains of what looked like a broom scattered around him.</p><p>"Lee?!"</p><p>The woman asked as she quickly approached while Alexis followed and Lee stopped form where he'd had his mouth open to scream for help again and looked up at the two women. His face was streaked with tears running over a deep bleeding wound slashed over his cheek and bleeding down to his jaw. The boy looked incredibly disheveled and the two that he was trying to hold up looked worse for wear. They looked like dead weight just hanging off of the boy and Molly could see blood on their clothes.</p><p>Lee collapsed on his knees with the two men as the women approached and he sobbed, "I'm sorry Molly, I'm so sorry but I didn't know where else to go and-"</p><p>"Lee what happened?" Molly interrupted as she crouched down in front of the boy and moved one of the men off of his shoulder, "We were attacked, I don't know how they found us but-"</p><p>Molly suddenly let out a sharp gasp and she dropped the body in her arms the moment she recognized the man. Alexis' eyes went wide.</p><p>"Rodolphus?!" Alexis moved the shaggy hair covering the face of the man still on Lee's shoulder, "Rabastan… what on earth… they're supposed to be in Azkaban-how… Oh dear."</p><p>"Lee…" Molly couldn't finish her sentence, not even sure what she would say if she could as her mind malfunctioned completely at the fact that there were two deranged death eaters at her door step.</p><p>"They're hurt badly, please Molly I don't know where else to go. If I take them to Saint Mungos…" Lee cut himself off as his voice cracked before he grabbed a hold of the woman's arm and begged as the tears continued to fall, "I'm begging you, please help me. I'll explain everything later I swear."</p><p>"Lee they're death eaters! They've killed and hurt so many people-"</p><p>"I'm in love with them!" The boy suddenly blurted out and Molly's eyes went wide, "I know that they've done some horrible things but please just help them for me. I'll do anything."</p><p>Molly stared into the boy's eyes at a complete loss for what to do when Alexis spoke, "I have the best healing spells outside of anyone from Saint Mungos, I could heal them enough to recover. It's up to you Molly."</p><p>Molly considered the woman's words, considered the conversation they had just a few moments ago. But accepting the fact that your son is pregnant with the child of someone you don't approve of and helping known murderers as a favor your sons' best friend seemed like just a bit of a leap.</p><p>"Molly please." Lee said again as his voice broke into a sob. Suddenly the front door opened just a few feet away and the twins appeared in the door.</p><p>"What's going on out here?" Fred asked as he stepped out onto the door step only for both to blink in shock before George spoke, "Lee, what-"</p><p>The twins stepped closer only to freeze when they recognized the unconscious men lying beside their best friend and mother.</p><p>"Holy Shit!"</p><p>Both said at the same time which seemed to snap Molly out of her thoughts as she immediately made a decision. The redhead swallowed hard before she spoke, "Get them into the house, put them in your old room."</p><p>Lee sighed in relief but the tears didn't stop falling, "Thank you Molly."</p><p>The twins all but gaped, "Mum-"</p><p>"Just do as I say." Molly said as she grabbed a hold of Rodolphus again, Alexis moved to his other side as she lifted his arm around her shoulders and leaned his weight on her only to let out a groan at the blood that slipped down her shoulder and onto her dress. "This was made from fairy silk."</p><p>George and Fred moved closer albeit a bit hesitantly.</p><p>Fred helped Alexis carry Rodolphus while George helped Lee with Rabastan as he hissed, "You are telling us <em>everything</em> later."</p><p>"Sweet Merlin Lee, Death eaters?! Really? And two of them at that?!" Fred hissed out as they carried the two to the house and Lee took a shuddering breath when Alexis spoke, "There'll be plenty of time for questions later, we need to get them upstairs."</p><p>Molly stood up straight and immediately pulled out her wand, "Tell your father, Bill, Fleur and Charlie to come out we need to put up new wards."</p><p>The twins nodded and Molly started walking towards the edge of the Burrow, ignoring the shocked screams and gasps of protests she heard from the house mere moments later. Before she heard Arthur running out to catch up with her along with Bill, Charlie and Fleur.</p><p>"Molly. Molly! What in Merlin's name-"</p><p>"There's no time to explain. We need to protect the Burrow." Molly said quickly just knowing that if she tried to explain she'd find a way to talk herself out of the absolutely insane decision she decided to make on a whim.</p><p>Damn Alexis for corrupting her so easily!</p><p>They set up the new wards working as quickly as possible while still managing to make them strong enough to keep any unwanted guests at bay in case any more Death eaters decided to show up on their doorstep.</p><p>In a move that admittedly surprised even Molly herself, she agreed to Arthur's suggestion that the wards keep out any and all intruders, whether they were light or dark. Including Albus Dumbledore, she wasn't sure why, but she knew that Albus couldn't find out about this, not if they were all going to stay at least moderately safe.</p><p>On the way back to the house both Arthur and Bill drilled her on what was going on and why the Lestrange brothers were taking up residence in their house. Molly just sighed and said that she couldn't turn Lee away. Surprisingly enough Arthur smiled and they quickly made their way back to try and get some answers from Lee instead.</p><p>Only when they got back the house was quiet, with nothing more than Lee's sobs filling the otherwise silent house. As they made their way up the stairs towards the attic where the twins used to sleep they found various members of their family standing around the door with shocked expressions.</p><p>Arthur frowned as he paused beside Fred to ask, "What's wrong?"</p><p>Shockingly enough the twin was rendered speechless as George just pointed into the room. Ron stood by the door with Blaise standing beside the teen with his arms around the redhead and they both just stared at the two on the floor in the center of the room.</p><p>Harry was on his knees, with a strange looking book lying open beside him as he let out heavy panting breaths. Lee was on the ground with him. He had his arms wrapped tight around the younger man's neck as he cried and sobbed into his neck.</p><p>"Thank you Harry, thank you so much."</p><p>"What's going on?" Molly asked as she entered the room giving Ron and Blaise a glance causing the redhead to look away before she let out a soft sigh and looked over towards the beds. Rodolphus lay on the one to the right and Rabastan on the left.</p><p>Dudley seemed to be at Rabastan's side, healing his many cuts and bruises while Alexis stood leaning over Rodolphus as she inspected his left arm carefully.</p><p>"Incredible." The woman said in wonder as she dropped the man's hand and rushed over to Rabastan to inspect his arm as well, causing Dudley to pause as he just watched her.</p><p>Molly's frown deepened, "Zabini what-"</p><p>"The marks… they're gone." Lady Zabini said softly before she stood up straight to turn towards the others. "Harry got rid of them… he removed the dark marks."</p><p>Molly's eyes went wide.</p><p>So much can change in six months.</p><p>But what changes isn't what's important.</p><p>What's important is how it starts. One event leads to another which leads to another and so forth and so forth.</p><p>A chain reaction of unforeseeable events</p><p>This chain in particular started with a simple ride on a broom.</p><p>"Relax."</p><p>Ron blushed at the deep sultry voice that spoke against his ear, silently praying that the Slytherin standing right behind him couldn't see the red that was slowly spreading over his face.</p><p>The redhead took a deep breath of the cool night air and wrapped his hands around the broom he stood over as he cursed himself for agreeing to do this in the first place. He bit back a squeak as two arms went around him from behind while a hard chest pressed against his back to hold the front of the broom.</p><p>Ron tried to ignore the heat of the other body that was slowly seeping through his clothes and into his skin while warm breath brushed up against his neck, making the redhead curse himself some more for agreeing to get on a broom with Blaise Zabini of all people.</p><p>"Tell me again why it is that I have to sit on the front." Ron growled in annoyance when Blaise suddenly moved forward and spoke right against his ear, resulting in an involuntary shiver to go speeding down his spine.</p><p>"Because I drive better from behind."</p><p>Ron's blush instantly darkened at that and he was about to tell Zabini off when the Slytherin suddenly kicked off the ground and they went shooting up into the sky.</p><p>The night was not going the way he'd planned at all.</p><p>He was just going to go outside the castle, get some fresh air and clear his head. That's all.</p><p>How on earth did things get so screwed up?!</p>
