</p>
<p><em>Sitting in a big white room alone</em><br/> <em> Tilt my head back, feel the tears fall down</em><br/> <em> Close my eyes to see in the dark</em><br/> <em> I feel young, broken, so, so scared</em><br/> <em> I don't wanna be here anymore</em><br/> <em> I wanna be somewhere else</em><br/> <em> Normal and free, like I used to be</em><br/> <em> But I have to stay in this big white room</em><br/> <em> With little old me</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry gathered his royal blue formal robes around him, and sat down, wishing he was anywhere but here. No, that wasn’t true. There was really only one place he wished to be. He was so sick of these damn Ministry functions. They had been better when they’d been held at Hogwarts directly after the Final Battle. At least there it was easy to get lost. Harry looked around the stark white walls of the Ministry waiting room. At least he’d found a quiet place to hide for a few minutes, even if the sterile walls reminded him of another place. He leaned his head back, and closed his eyes against the blinding starkness. Memories from that other place filled him. The hideous <em> thing </em> half hidden beneath a bench, Dumbledore, dead over a year, speaking to him of choices, the knowledge that he wouldn’t be joining his parents that day. Then coming back, only to face the reality of more deaths that were not his own. And now, they wished to celebrate.</p>
<p>To celebrate that gruesome day when all Harry wanted was to go. To hide. To once more be the innocent child walking through the doors of the Great Hall, listening to his future friend explain about magical ceilings. To once again feel the joys of soaring through the sky on his broom, chasing after the snitch, not fleeing for his life. But those days were gone. Now his days were spent in rooms like these: white, stark, sterile. But this was not the room he wished to be in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>I'm going crazy</em><br/> <em> I'm losing my mind</em><br/> <em> I'm going crazy</em><br/> <em> In this big white room of mine</em><br/> <em> I'm going crazy</em><br/> <em> I'm losing my mind</em><br/> <em> I'm going crazy</em><br/> <em> In this big white room of mine</em></p>

<p>Sometimes he wondered if he <em> was </em> as barmy as Ron accused him of being. What kind of person spent night after night sitting by the bedside of a comatose man that had hated them? What insanity drew him to visit that private room in St. Mungo’s? What kind of delusions kept him hoping for a different outcome every time he stepped through that wooden door?  It had been over a year since they’d pulled the bleeding body from the shack, and still, Harry wished, hoped, waited for Snape to wake up. To explain. To yell. To tell Harry he was an idiot. To… anything. To just do <em> something </em> . Harry scoffed. Did he seriously, foolishly expect Snape to throw his arms around Harry and thank Merlin he was safe? To admit he’d never really hated Harry? Perhaps Harry <em> was </em>a bit unhinged.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Sitting in a big white room alone</em><br/> <em> Close the door</em><br/> <em> Don't want the pain to come in</em><br/> <em> I clench my fist</em><br/> <em> And try to stay strong</em><br/> <em> I cry, feel sick</em><br/> <em> My heart is beating out of control</em><br/> <em> Can I run run faster than you</em><br/> <em> I wanna feel my body again</em><br/> <em> Feel the wind in my hair</em><br/> <em> But I have to stay in this big white room</em><br/> <em> 'Cause no one else cares, no</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>His eyes fluttered open to reveal awful, white walls. The effect blinding him, and shooting needle-like pain through his head. This wasn’t the only pain, he realized. His throat felt rough and scratchy, his neck was stiff, every muscle on his left side cried out with even the thought of movement. Severus tried to sit up, but his body was too weak. He knew immediately he must be at St. Mungo’s, but what did that mean? Had they won? Had the Dark Lord won, and, in a moment of charity, sent Severus to the Healers? He clenched his right fist and fought against the pain, trying to clear his head. Trying to remember. He remembered the sure knowledge that the Dark Lord was on his way to the school. His desperate search for Potter. Fear pounded through him. Had he ever gotten to Potter? He remembered the summons from the Dark Lord, Lucius frantic to get him to ‘their master.’ He remembered something about the man’s wand, but he hadn’t been concentrating. All he could think of was getting to Potter. To escape this mad man’s rantings and run. Run as fast as he could to save the only person that mattered. In the end, <em> had </em> it even mattered? Had Potter lived? Had Potter faced down the mad man that had haunted him almost nearly from the day of his birth? Severus stared at the white walls of his room, but no answers came to him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>I'm going crazy</em><br/> <em> I'm losing my mind</em><br/> <em> I'm going crazy</em><br/> <em> In this big white room of mine</em><br/> <em> I'm going crazy</em><br/> <em> I'm losing my mind</em><br/> <em> I'm going crazy</em><br/> <em> In this big white room of mine</em></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>He woke again some time later. An hour, five hours, mere minutes. He had no way of knowing in this white-washed prison. He could easily go crazy with nothing to do but stare at these insufferable walls. A memory tugged at him, and he reached for it, jumped into the deep recesses of his convoluted mind and grasped with mental hands to drag it forward. Green eyes staring at him warily, frantic words, whispered demands. His memories. He’d given memories to Potter. But what memories? Had the boy finally understood about his deep friendship with Lily? Had he understood the desperate insanity Snape had gone through when he’d realized what the prophecy meant? Did Potter see the crippling paranoia with which he’d approached Dumbledore all those years ago? Did he understand at all the madness that Severus’s life had been for so, so long? What other memories might he have forced on the boy? He’d been weak, delirious, unable to completely control the spell that freed his memories. Did Potter see more than Severus had meant for him to? Did he now know Severus’s foolish secret? The disturbing depravity he had held close to his heart for over two years? Perhaps he was as moonstruck as Lupin, but he hugged his preposterous hope that all would be well close to his heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Everybody's looking at me</em><br/> <em> Everybody's staring at me</em><br/> <em> What do I do now</em><br/> <em> Smile, yeah</em><br/> <em> Everybody's looking at me</em><br/> <em> Everybody's staring at me</em><br/> <em> What do I do now</em><br/> <em> Smile, yeah</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry?” Harry opened his eyes, and looked up at the bright face of his friend, almost highlighted by the stark white of the walls. “It’s time.”</p>
<p>Harry gave a nod, and stood. He stepped out into the hallway, and made his way down the corridor, the only sound the echo of their dragonhide boots on the marble floor. Ron pushed the door to the large Ministry ballroom opened, and Harry stepped through. Immediately, all eyes were on him. His breath caught in a moment of panic as he forgot his lines.</p>
<p>“Just smile politely,” Hermione’s soft voice whispered in his ear, and he nodded.</p>
<p>He smiled thankfully at his friend and turned to face the room.<br/> He smiled politely at the crowd as he made his way forward.<br/> He smiled thinly at the line of reporters as he passed.<br/> He smiled graciously at the Minister as Kingsley welcomed him to the stage.<br/> He smiled nervously as he stood in front of the podium and looked out at the crowd.<br/> He smiled softly as he proclaimed of the bravery of the man they were here to honor.<br/> He smiled wistfully as he disclosed of a lost love and second chances.<br/> He smiled ironically as he conceded to house loyalties and prejudices.<br/> He smiled pleadingly as he begged for understanding, not acceptance.<br/> He smiled fiercely as he proclaimed innocence and rewards for a life almost lost.<br/> He beamed as the crowd clapped their approval.<br/> He smiled sadly as Kingsley handed him the large medallion so like his own save the name.<br/> Finally, he smiled in relief as he stepped from the podium and was able to make his way to a back table to relax.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>I'm going crazy</em><br/> <em> I'm losing my mind</em><br/> <em> I'm going crazy</em><br/> <em> In this big white room of mine</em><br/> <em> I'm going crazy</em><br/> <em> I'm losing my mind</em><br/> <em> I'm going crazy</em><br/> <em> In this big white room of mine</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Watching the crowd mingle around the room he wondered how long he could sit here before going stir-crazy. How long until he was itching under his skin to get away from all these people? It was illogical, he knew, to prefer the quiet bedside of a pale, sleeping figure to these people he (mostly) called friends. There was no sane excuse for whatever absurd need drove him to stare at the over-large nose, stroke the long, potion stained fingers, or wish to press his lips to the pale, sallow cheek. Utter madness, stark raving lunacy, to have fallen in love with a man he barely understood, and who most likely hated him. He tucked the unbelievable nonsense deep into his heart, and caught sight of Neville and Luna as they danced across the floor. Harry snorted, and wondered if maybe they shouldn’t be calling him Loony.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>I'm going crazy</em><br/> <em> I'm losing my mind</em><br/> <em> I'm going crazy</em><br/> <em> In this big white room of mine</em><br/> <em> I'm going crazy</em><br/> <em> I'm losing my mind</em><br/> <em> I'm going crazy</em><br/> <em> In this big white room of mine</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>No answers. He could have been lying here for days, hours, or minutes. It didn’t matter. He still had no answers. Staring at the opalescent sheen of the door did not produce a Healer no matter how much he wished it. Glaring at the chalky white of the walls did not create a window no matter how much he needed to know if it was night or day. Very little sound came through the doors, so he concluded it must be night, as he had no doubt the halls would be filled with that certain sort of hysteria that only a hospital corridor could if it were daytime. He wondered, not for the first time and certainly fruitlessly, what time it was. How long would he have to sit here with only his chaotic thoughts for company before someone came to check on him? Did they still check on him? He could have been out for years for all he knew, a long forgotten memento of an era best forgotten. The pawn of two madmen. Who would wish him to rejoin the living? He gave a sigh, and pressed his head back against his pillow. It was insanity to continue this line of thinking. He needed to do something productive. Try to move his body, work his throat, anything to pass the time. There was a soft sound and his head jerked up as the door finally, slowly opened. He waited expectantly for someone in green robes to step through and tell him what was going on, but as the door opened and the figure stepped through, all he saw was blue.</p>
