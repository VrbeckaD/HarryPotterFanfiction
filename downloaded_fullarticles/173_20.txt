    <p>“Ice-skating!?" Nymphadora Tonks gaped over the newest issue of the Daily Prophet, before her expressive dark eyes narrowed in suspicion. "This better not be a set up for another prank, because I won't go easy on you this time."</p><p>In the basement kitchen of number twelve, Grimmauld place, Remus Lupin chuckled and drew out a chair to sit next to her.</p><p>“If you consider having one's own clothes singing ABBA's greatest hits at inopportune moments as <em>easy</em>, I'm honestly terrified of what else is brewing in that mind of yours."</p><p>His expression was relaxed, as if he had planned such a reaction, staged it as an opening to chat about mischief both of them so excitedly participated in lately. Her response was, after all, one he should have anticipated. Like anyone would take a casual invite to go ice-skating with a lonely, aging werewolf seriously. He tried not to feel the pang of it too acutely. Diverting into easy joking was safe territory. He could start over from there.</p><p>"C'mon, it wasn't that bad," she laid her paper down on the table top and turned in her chair to face him with a smirk.</p><p>He caught her so completely off guard when he walked in with his burning gaze and that outrageous proposition, he may have as well fired a stunner straight at her chest. She struggled to collect herself. Joking her way out of emotionally confusing situations was her forte, she could handle it from here.</p><p>"You were adorable, like a musical greeting card. Everyone thought it was great fun."</p><p>"Of course they did, especially when we thought it was finally over and then it started crooning <em>Chiquitita</em> during Alastor's retelling on how he lost his leg."</p><p>She laughed, loudly and heartily, her head thrown back in mirth, and his pulse quickened. Evoking the memory of that evening, he could almost see the challenging glint in her eye as she innocently supplied (misleading) suggestions, as to what useful little spell might just do the trick and undo the jinx. He had known, of course, that she was behind it as soon as it started. Not only that she knew of the profound hatred he had of this particular muggle band (Sirius had nearly wet himself with laughter as his outfit for the day suddenly broke into <em>Waterloo</em> just as Arthur got up to pour another round of brandy for the few people that had lingered after the meeting), but she was, strictly speaking, getting him back for a number he'd pulled on her a few weeks before. Which he did in response to her substituting his supply of chocolate with boxes of raisins. And honestly, he couldn't remember anymore what he had done to deserve that or when did this prank war between them even start, but he couldn't deny that the Marauder in him thoroughly appreciated every second of it.</p><p>"Should've tried taking them off," sat across from them, his elbows resting on the table, Sirius Black was listening in unabashedly, his grey eyes flitting between the pair. He looked perfectly at ease, as if this was what he usually did with his afternoons. "Bet that would've done the trick, eh Tonksy?"</p><p>Tonks tensed, embarrassed simultaneously by Sirius' jibe and at having forgotten his presence in the room in the first place.</p><p>"I must admit I prefer a more intellectual approach to problem solving," she braved a glare at him, trying to project confidence she didn't feel. Mercifully, Sirius didn't continue the same line of thought, but he did smirk in a way that rattled her, as if he could see exactly what's been going through her mind. "At least everyone got to enjoy the disco classics while you figured it out, that lock you set for my lunchbox wailed like a banshee the second I tried to open it without solving the puzzle first," she tried to continue levelly, desperate to paddle back into familiar waters, "The Auror Headquarters probably has a warrant on the mysterious perpetrator, you know, you had most of the office screaming bloody murder. Kingsley nearly blasted my entire lunch to smithereens."</p><p>Remus smiled and some of the tension eased off. She'd be mortified if he realised her flush was not due to her cousin's tactless remarks as much as a burning, hidden desire for Remus to do just what Sirius suggested. Minus the additional audience, of course. That would definitely cement her as an immature, frivolous <em>girl</em> in his eyes. Not that playing pranks was a much better way of making him see her the way she wanted him to see her, she thought wryly.</p><p>"You should've known better than to stand between a girl and her lunch," she continued with such conviction, forcefully morphing her blush away, as if her relationship to whatever she had had to eat that day was the only thing that mattered in her life.</p><p>Though angry at himself for being so distracted by her delightful presence not to control his words and tone more carefully when in company (as if anyone needed an image of him stripping naked in front of them; the mere thought had him burn with shame), Remus, like a complete idiot, stumbled into the same trap the second her eyes met his again.</p><p>"Obviously I had no idea what I was getting myself into," he blurted through a grin that was too powerful to rein in and Tonks blossomed with happiness.</p><p>"Obviously you still don't," Sirius quirked an amused eyebrow, and pulled Tonks' abandoned Prophet towards him, making a show of spreading the paper in front of him and settling back into his seat.</p><p>Though he appeared unperturbed and managed a seemingly annoyed eye roll in Sirius' direction, Remus' eyes didn't meet Tonks' again as he cleared his throat and continued.</p><p>"Basically, the children are going back to Hogwarts in a few days and I've agreed to take Ginny and Hermione ice-skating while they are still on their break."</p><p>Tonks' gaze dropped. She should have guessed this was somehow connected to the Order. She was being foolish in letting her mind wander, feeding into her hope for something more. Luckily, this time Sirius saved her from having to react before managing to hide her disappointment.</p><p>“And you want her to go? Knowing Tonks, she probably already holds the world record in ice-<em>falling</em>.”</p><p>“I beg your pardon, the proper term would be <em>arse</em>-skating,” Tonks shot him a mock-indignant glare and he rewarded her with a bark of laughter before she dared to face Remus again. “He’s right, though. I manage to trip over thin air on dry land. Imagine what disaster I’d be on slippery territory.”</p><p>There were at least a hundred normal things he could have said. This was Tonks, for Merlin's sake, a simple promise of fun would have probably swayed her. Instead, he let his stupid mouth run unsupervised.</p><p>“Well, since we partnered successfully on so many missions, I guess I was hoping you'd be willing to have my back on this one as well, however slippery."</p><p>He cringed as soon as the words rolled off his tongue and Tonks' eyes widened. He caught Sirius' eye - he was looking on with rapt attention, both eyebrows up, and the smirk that stretched across his gaunt face suggested he will never let him hear the end of it. For all the easy camaraderie he'd established with Tonks from the earliest moments of their acquaintance and despite having by now shared with each other much more personal experiences (Sirius' embarrassing taunts included), this time he could distinctly feel the warm flush of mortification creeping up his neck. He was way past denying to himself that what he felt for her went far beyond just friendship, but while he indulged in their playful antics with delighted exuberance, he usually maintained at least some dignity, even while his socks and jumper sang a duet about a bloke named Fernando. What a pathetic old fool he must seem now, so greedily grabbing for every second of her time and attention. Had she finally realised how seriously lost he was in her? Was there any way to salvage this before she became utterly creeped out?</p><p>But in an instant, Tonks' confusion melted away and she beamed, so bright and warm, a ray of light shining through this dismal house, and his mind went blank.</p><p>"Remus, I'm genuinely honoured you'd trust me to have your back even while I'm pirouetting across the ice rink on my bum," her luminous eyes danced as she pressed one hand to her chest and briefly touched his forearm with the other. Even under a layer of clothing, his skin blazed, as if sunburnt. "Though I'm worried I'd more likely drag you down that slippery road with me."</p><p>"Where's the fun in ice-skating if you don't get to fall every once in a while,” he rasped, unable to resist, even though falling was not an appropriate metaphor anymore, not by a long shot. It felt more like being swept away by an avalanche.</p><p>Suddenly self-conscious, he propped his elbows on his knees, trying to appear nonchalant, but the shy duck of his head betrayed his true nature. He looked like a teenager, his expression so adorably boyish as he peeked expectantly at her from under floppy fringe. Accustomed to seeing him immaculately poised, clean shaven and neatly combed, this slight dishevel in his appearance spread tingling warmth across Tonks' cheeks as she felt her fingers suddenly itch to run through his hair and down his neck to sneak under the collar of his shirt where those top two buttons were tantalisingly left unbuttoned. Emboldened by the implications of his last statement, she struggled not to show too much enthusiasm (that would be reading into it too much, it was bloody ice-skating not a marriage proposal), but at the same time, if she played it <em>too</em> casually, it might ruin any chance of him making any kind of a move. If a move is something he was going for? <em>Bloody hell</em>, men were not usually that difficult to read! Why was she so absolutely clueless when it came to him!?</p><p>“How is it that you manage to talk me into anything you want?” she breathed, aiming for coy, but her voice coming out a bit sultrier than she'd intended. Was it just her imagination, or was he leaning a bit closer to her than before?</p><p>“Oooh, can I make a guess?!” Sirius piped from somewhere behind her.</p><p>This time, they both jumped at the interruption, neither noticing he had left his place at the table. His expression was smug as he rifled through the cupboards Molly Weasley had stocked with leftovers of the New Year’s dinner. Remus straightened in his chair and ran both hands through his hair, while Tonks rose from hers abruptly, cheeks matching the vivid pink of her jaunty coif.</p><p>However, she somehow managed to tangle her feet with the chair legs and tripped forwards, barely balancing herself by grabbing at Remus' shoulders, his hands instinctively reaching for her waist. Sirius howled with laughter, nearly dropping the chunk of roasted pork loin he'd dug out.</p><p>Tonks looked as flustered as Remus felt. He quickly removed his hands from her as soon as she steadied, then rose and stuffed them in his trouser pockets.</p><p>“I hope you have a good pair of gloves, it's a bit nippy outside.”</p><p>There was a muffled thump as Sirius banged his forehead against the side of the cupboard with an exaggerated sigh.</p><p>“Oh, right," discomposed by the shift in his conduct, she glanced at him bashfully from under long, dark lashes and valiantly added. "I hope you'll at least try to keep me from falling too often.”</p><p>With a furtive glance towards Sirius, still hidden behind the cupboard, Remus chanced a smile. His hands burned from where he briefly held her. She was standing too close to him for such a casual conversation. He was surprised no one could hear how loudly everything inside of him thrummed. Everything about her was in such sharp focus, so bright and colourful, and everything else was complete darkness.</p><p>“I solemnly swear.”</p><p>Something sparked in her eyes at that and he gripped the back of a chair to physically restrain himself from touching her, from impulsively leaning to kiss those very soft looking lips curved in the loveliest little smile. Could anyone's gaze hold such power over someone? Then she moved gently past him to ready herself for the outside and the lights faded back to grey.</p><p>"Merlin knows I'm rooting for you, Moony," Sirius grunted as soon as her footfalls faded from earshot. "But this <em>must</em> be the most excruciating bloody courtship in the history of mankind. And I was at the frontlines of Prongs' seven-year-long pursuit of Evans."</p><p>"Bugger off, Padfoot," Remus grumbled reflexively, then added more softly: "I don't even know where you get these ideas from."</p><p>Too late, Sirius was already grinning madly, the cavernous hollows of his haggard face lit with the ghost of handsomeness of his youth. A part of Remus was pleased that his old friend was in a good mood, since it was getting increasingly sour the nearer Harry's return to Hogwarts drew, but he was none the less nettled that it had to be over something he wished to keep as private as possible.</p><p>"Tonksy is a rare bird. Looks <em>and</em> brains. Great fun to have around. A sort of character that could handle even your melodramatics," continued Sirius, undeterred, as if Remus hadn't even spoken. "But you're going to have to step up at some point. She's not going to put up with you being all wishy-washy forever."</p><p>Remus bristled and pushed past him to look for a thermos, stubbornly refusing to acknowledge him.</p><p>"Ignore me all you want, I know you know what I'm talking about," Sirius slumped in the chair Tonks vacated and spread his armful of food on the table top, then frowned suddenly. "You <em>do</em> realise she's interested as well, don't you?"</p><p>"Nobody is interested in anybody," Remus hissed, tapping the kettle with his wand sharply until it let out a piercing whistle, spraying boiling water and coughing up steam. "Especially not her in me. That's probably the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard."</p><p>"Well, if you hadn't noticed, you're more dense than I thought."</p><p>Remus gritted his teeth, determined not to raise to the bait, and dunked the teabags impatiently into the thermos, willing the tea to steep faster. He was in enough turmoil from the moment he worked up the nerve for this (by the looks of it, completely disastrous) invitation. He really didn't need his oldest friend goading him on. His past experience with Sirius should have taught him by now that this usually ended up with him doing something completely imprudent, against his own better judgement.</p><p>"You know what, I just remembered I won a bet I had with Prongs, a long, long time ago," continued Sirius, his tone still light, but suddenly wistful. Remus glanced carefully at him over his shoulder. "He thought you'd eventually settle with a quiet, mousy bird. You know, one of those librarian types, terribly sweet, but probably a bit of a bore. <em>I</em>, on the other hand, always had a feeling you'd appreciate a woman with a bit more substance."</p><p>"I can't believe you're using James to blackmail me into buying into your nonsense," Remus clipped back, but without much conviction.</p><p>"I'm trying to help you, mate," retorted Sirius, less humour in his eyes and voice. "One day you'll see for yourself I was right, but then it may be too late."</p><p>Sloshing hot tea from the hastily closed thermos, Remus exited without another word.</p><p>"You'll see," Sirius shook his head muttering into the now empty kitchen and bit into the roast.</p>
