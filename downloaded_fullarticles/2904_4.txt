    <p>Credence sat in his chair as he contemplated Nagini’s last words to him. “He knows where you're from, not who you are!” He took a deep breath. Nagini is someone from his past, a past he must forget to move on to his new future. Yet, deep down, Credence was still aware of the complex concoction of emotions bustling inside him.</p><p>Nagini sat in the bed Theseus had let her stay in as she reflected upon the past few days. All her life she had been lonely with no one to talk to and to share her feelings with. Finally she met Credence, a friend who understood what it was like to be treated as a misfit, a freak, an animal. She thought the good times would be endless but as every good thing that ever happened to her, things would not last and Credence left her to join the dark wizard and his regime. She recalled how devastated she was when Credence stepped into the flame, the way her heart cracked as she watched Credence leave her side. She even considered ending it all at the mausoleum, after all, who would want a monster like her to live anyway? She slowly let a tear slip as her mind flashed with the parting moments between her and Credence. He body slowly shifted and convulsed as she closed her eyes and curled up in a spiral as any serpent would.</p><p>Grindelwald watched as he noticed the conflict within the Dumbledore boy. "He’s troubled," Grindelwald noted.</p><p>“It must be the Maledictus.” He decided he must end this conflict for this conflict will lead to a disturbance in the mission.</p><p>“Aurelius, listen, I know you still think linger about your past, but you must let go, you must cut off the loose ends, old ties…” Grindelwald said as he gave a little tap on Credence’s wand.</p><p>“You know what to do, don’t let me down.” Grindelwald said as he left Credence all to himself.</p><p>“No, no, no” as he realized what he had to do, no, he wouldn’t, he couldn’t kill Nagini, he can’t. Credence held his head in unease. He needed to find her, he needed to warn her.</p><p>Nagini and Tina walked around the castle and its many gardens when Tina noticed a figure in the distance walking towards them. Nagini frowned as she looked closer to the figure.</p><p>“Credence?” Her face lit up as she saw her dear friend.</p><p>“Credence!” she exclaimed as she moved as quickly as her legs would allow to her friend.</p><p>“Credence, I thought I would never see you again, did he hurt you?” Her dear concerns were met with a stern look from Credence.</p><p>“My name is not Credence, it's Dumbledore, Aurelius Dumbledore.” he stated in a forceful tone. Nagini, slightly puzzled at the sudden hostility in her friend’s tone, backed up.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“He gave me a name, a wand, and a purpose, it’s more then anything you’ve ever given me.”</p><p>“Wh-what do you mean?” Nagini asked worried at her friend suddenly becoming so harsh.</p><p>“I’m talking about you, monster, do you think I really care about you? All I needed was someone to help me find my parents. Now that I know who I am, I don’t need you anymore. You’re nothing, you were always nothing to me.”</p><p>“Credence, I-” Nagini tried to talk but she choked on her words as tears began to flow down her cheeks.</p><p>“I couldn’t care less about you, I wish the flames had engulfed you that night, no one would care if you died, snake woman.” Credence wished as soon as he said those words that he could take them back but it was too late, he had crossed the line.</p><p>Nagini could hardly hold back her tears. She burst into sobs as her heart completely shattered.</p><p>Credence hated himself for being so cruel, he wished he could apologize to her right then, for everything, but he couldn't. She had to be as far as she could from him.</p>
