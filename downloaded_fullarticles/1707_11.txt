    <p>”Are you coming, or what?” Albus held up the covers and looked at Scorpius expectantly.</p><p>---</p><p>It had become somewhat of a tradition for Al and Scorpius to share a bed on the first night of Scorpius’ holiday visit. The very first time he visited the Potter house was in the summer after their first year at Hogwarts. The Potter household was extremely different from what he was used to. It was crowded and loud, filled with Albus’ siblings and cousins whose favourite activities seemed to be to tease anyone younger than themselves. It was unnerving to sit next to the saviour of the wizarding world at the dinner table, as well. Scorpius could hardly eat at all that first dinner, all flustered and bothered by all the attention from the numerous redheads surrounding him, although he wasn't sure the whole experience was a bad one.</p><p>What had felt new and exciting in the daytime, however, felt more eerie as the evening progressed. He would never have admitted it, of course, but he felt a bit anxious as bedtime approached and they were settling in for the night. Lying in the spare bed in Albus' room, watching shadows play in the ceiling, he longed for the quiet halls of the manor, and his dad sitting down at his bedside to wish him a good night. Sometimes his dad would even tell him a bedtime story, though he was of course way too old for that at twelve, so that secret would follow him to his grave.</p><p>After what felt like hours he finally managed to drift off, and then he of course had a terrible nightmare, involving dementors and hags. The next thing he knew, he woke from the gentle nudges of Albus, who was crouching next to the bed, a worried crease between his brows. Scorpius' heart was racing, and he could still feel the dread of the dream as a cold weight in his stomach.</p><p>“Are you homesick? Do you miss your mum and dad?” Albus asked, and when Scorpius nodded, not daring to speak lest he would unleash the knot in his throat and the tears burning behind his eyes, Albus lifted the covers and crept into bed next to Scorpius.<br/> “Lie on my arm for a bit”, Albus had said, snuggling his left arm under Scorpius' neck, and Scorpius did. Then Albus started talking to him about safe, fun subjects, such as quidditch, what positions would be available at the start of the new term and who would probably make the team, (though he avoided mentioning their own impending try-outs) and the results of the recent matches of the British quidditch league, and what he was hoping to get for his twelfth birthday and how that would compare to Scorpius’ gifts, and before he knew it, Scorpius was asleep, feeling completely safe resting on Albus' arm.</p><p> </p><p>That was the first time.</p>
