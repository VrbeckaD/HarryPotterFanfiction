    <p>
  <span>"You've been drinking, Moony." Sirius tries to keep his voice even as he peels Remus' fingers out of the front of his shirt and makes a move to turn around.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"'m not drunk." He's only managed to get one of Remus' hands free and is about to resort to tickling when he feels breath and then warm lips against his neck. Predictably, he freezes and Remus has him held tight against his chest again. Sirius counts to five, willing his heart to calm then puts all his strength into wrenching free.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"You're drunk enough to have forgotten we don't play this game anymore." Remus meets Sirius' stern look with his bottom lip between his teeth and gives his hands a tug, testing the strength of Sirius' hold, before leaning in close.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Maybe I miss it." </span>
  <em>
    <span>Kill me now</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Sirius takes a step forward and then another and is grateful that Remus is allowing himself to be herded toward the couch. "Maybe I want to play it again." </span>
  <em>
    <span>Where the fuck is James</span>
  </em>
  <span>? Three more steps, two, one, then the careful dance of pushing Remus into the seat without being pulled down by him in the effort. It's not like Sirius hasn't also been drinking, although he's wishing right about now that he'd had less, or much more, because this is one of those moments you want to either have your full facilities about you, or know for sure you won’t remember any of this tomorrow.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"You only miss the first part, Moony. Trust me." </span>
  <em>
    <span>Honestly, James, the one time I'm looking for you</span>
  </em>
  <span>. "Evans! Lily! Can you get James for me? Yeah, no, he's okay, I just need a bit of help." It's a second before he realises Remus has used his distraction to pull himself forward on the couch and has his legs locked behind his ankles, knees pressed into the sides of his legs. "Come on, love, you need to cut that out, James is coming."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Ooh, not James!" Remus' attempt at humour falls flat in the face of Sirius' frustration, not that he notices. He's too busy trying to wriggle his hands free to care that everything around them has just gotten very tense.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"What's this, Padfoot? Lily said you needed help?" James is looking very pointedly between Sirius' face and the way Remus is determinedly working to wrap more of himself around Sirius' lower half. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Fucking typical</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Sirius thinks, as he sees James eyeing him up for an explanation. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Remus is the one who's drunk off his ass and trying to grope me, but somehow this is my fault?</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"I just need you to take him up to bed, James." Remus has his cheek pressed into Sirius' thigh as he talks, and Sirius is just grateful he seems happy to stay there. </span>
  <em>
    <span>If he turned his head…</span>
  </em>
  <span> "He's not himself right now, and I don't want him to get hurt. Please."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James leans down just a little to meet Remus' eye and then, seeming satisfied, crosses his arms over his chest and rises back up to face Sirius. "We talked about this."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Yes, I remember," he gets out, just as Remus seems to figure out exactly how close his face is to Sirius' crotch. "No! Stop it!" It's a bit of a hop and a tenuous second when he thinks he might fall, but eventually Remus is back on the couch and Sirius is, thankfully? regrettably? undefiled.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"But I want to play it again," Remus whines into the temporary silence.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Well I don't." He hopes his tone is stronger than he feels, because god damnit, it isn't that he doesn't want this. "Please James, just take him to bed."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Fine. But you'll fix this." James steps forward and reaches down to hook Remus under the arms. "Let's go to bed, Moony. Come on, I'll get you all tucked in."</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>"Me? I'll fix this?" Sirius takes a gasping breath, now that he can, now that Remus isn't burrowing into him, threatening the resolve he's barely holding. "I'm not the one who got drunk and tried to maul someone." </span>
  <em>
    <span>He should be giving me an award for restraint. Does he not know what it takes to say no to this?</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James has Remus turned toward the stairs, one arm around his back to steady him. "This time."</span>
