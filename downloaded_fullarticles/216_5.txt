          <div class="userstuff"><p>Hermione struggled to get back to her feet, shaken from the sudden impact of the cave-in. The battle was raging on around them throughout the castle, and Hermione had just become trapped in the library with the least likely of company. And worst yet, her wand had been lost in the impact, crushed somewhere in the rubble blocking the only exit. Her chest heaved with her growing anxiety. There was no way out.</p><p>“You stupid bitch,” the accusatory voice of Draco Malfoy came sharply from behind her, startling her. She stumbled, nearly tripping over a fallen stack of tomes. She turned to face the furious young death eater, and immediately upon laying eyes on him was filled with fear. “You broke my wand!” He was approaching her quickly, and she trembled under his murderous glare. </p><p>“I didn’t mean to!” Of course she meant to, he was trying to kill her. She had to do something. It’d all happened so fast. As quickly as she’d sent the heavy book flying at him, he’d properly disarmed her, sending her wand flying behind her, right into the crumbling walls. At first she’d thought it was him who caused it, the cave in, but the book that she’d sent hurtling towards him had hit his wand, shattering it. She’d barely jumped out of the way in time to not be crushed by a falling mass of masonry, hurting her ankle in the process.</p><p>Hermione limped back a few steps until she hit one of the remaining solid walls, but there was little point. She’d never be able to outrun him. There was nowhere to go, and she couldn’t actually run. Not like this. He was upon her in a moment, one large hand closing around her throat. She gasped and whimpered. She hadn’t feared him while they dueled, feeling confident in her ability with a wand, but she was no match for his physical strength. Still, she wouldn’t let that take the fight out of her. She struggled against him, her small hands pulling at his wrist, trying to free herself.</p><p>“I could choke the life out of you right now,” Draco told her, shaking with rage. The castle was practically crumbling all around them, and thanks to her, he was powerless to get them out. </p><p>“You disarmed me too,” Hermione reminded him, struggling to get the words out as his hand tightened his grip on her. She was beginning to feel lightheaded. </p><p>Draco’s molten silver eyes bore down on the petite girl. He was genuinely considering ending her then and there. He’d always hated her. She’d always been the source of disdain in his life, always one step ahead of him, academically. His father had punished him repeatedly for it. Add to that that she was Harry Potter’s best friend, and the brains behind his inexplicable continued survival. He could end her, and be celebrated for it. </p><p>Or he could just punish her, for all the times she’d surpassed him, for every time she one-upped him, and most importantly, for all the times she’d crept into his subconscious with her bloody short skirts and perky sweater clad tits. Yes, that seemed like a much better option. Why kill her when he could punish her instead?</p><p>His lips crashed down on hers, his hand loosing slightly, but still holding her firmly in place. Hermione’s eyes widened in shock as he forced his way into his mouth, using her gasp of surprise as an opportunity to penetrate with his tongue. It wasn’t nearly as much a kiss as an assault, a show of force, of dominance. It was just a different way of overpowering her.  </p><p>She didn’t hate it. Maybe if she played along, the scared, weak, vulnerable girl, and let him take out his frustrations on her… how far could he possibly take it? So she went along with it, kissing him back and allowing him the dominance he so desperately needed. She was relieved at first when he finally dropped his hand from her suredly bruised throat, but jumped in surprise when he moved it instead up her sweater. He groped her left breast, bra and all, before sliding inside of the cup to feel the soft smooth mound against his bare hand. Her nipple hardened at his touch, and she whimpered into his mouth.</p><p>He’d always imagined what it’d be like to silence her big mouth with his own. To touch her, and taste her, and to be inside of her. He’d never considered it to be a possibility. Today, with the walls literally closing in on them, battles raging all around, today he’d have her, whether she wanted it or not. And right this moment, he wanted to see her, all of her.</p><p>They weren’t going to be trapped forever. Someone would come looking for them, eventually. Could be hours, could be days, could be her side, could be his, but the fact remained that this was a temporary situation. Plus, chances were that upon being found one of them would likely be imprisoned or killed for their alliance in the war. If Voldemort won, which Draco was starting to think was going to be the case, Hermione wouldn’t make it past the threshold of this library alive. It’d be such a waste to not have her now, and satisfy so many of his daydreams.</p><p>He tugged her sweater, pulling it up over her head. Hermione broke her lips from his in protest. “What are you doing?” she questioned, feeling violated as the knit article was ripped from her and tossed aside. She tried to cover herself but Draco pried her arms away from her chest and pinned them to the wall over her head.  </p><p>“I’m so bloody sick and tired of you getting away with everything,” he said to her, looking at her flat stomach, and her breasts heaving inside of her satiny bra. “Perfect Hermione Granger,” he used his free hand to rip the thin strip of material holding the two cups together. Hermione gasped in surprise as the bra fell open and her breasts popped out. She didn’t know why she was letting him do these things. “Brightest witch of the generation,” he continued his rant, plucking the button on her jeans loose. “Potter’s little whore.” He tugged down the zipper.</p><p>Hermione realized that her situation had escalated quickly, too quickly. She’d underestimated his anger towards her. He wasn’t stopping.</p><p>“I’m not perfect!” Hermione snapped at him. Two could be angry here. She wasn’t just going to stand there and be his victim, not if this was his idea of revenge. “And I’m nobody’s whore, certainly not yours.” She tried to pull free, but he was using his full weight to keep her in place. </p><p>“I beg to differ,” Draco said to her, chuckling. Hermione had no idea what was so amusing, but then his lips were on her again. This time it was her breast he had in his mouth, sucking hard on as much of the flesh as he could fit in his mouth. He switched breasts after a minute or so, offering the same attention to it’s twin. </p><p>Hermione was so thrown by the sudden attention to her supple chest that she forgot to struggle against him. He dropped his hold on her wrists to free both his hands, her bra falling away from her in the process, and pulled her pants down her hips. “Oh God,” Hermione couldn’t make sense of what was happening. She was angry, and scared, and hot. When had it gotten so hot? She could feel his warm breath on her core through the lacy material covering it.</p><p>“Have you ever been properly fucked, Granger?” he asked, breathing in the scent of her most intimate body part. He brought one hand up and rubbed her between her legs. </p><p>Hermione’s body shook. “I… I’m not a prude, Malfoy,” she argued while he stood once more, not sure if she was convincing or not. She was not a virgin, hadn’t been for a while now. But she couldn’t say for sure that she’d been “properly” had, as Malfoy so crassly put it. </p><p>“Has anyone ever made you cum?” Draco whispered the question into her ear as his hand slid brazenly down the front of her knickers. He tisked her a few times as his fingers slid through a small patch of trimmed hair to the bare fleshy lips. “Well, you’re certainly prepared for someone to give it a go, aren’t you?” He rubbed her between those lips this time, spreading the moisture that he found gathering just inside of her.</p><p>Hermione was almost grateful that he hadn’t allowed her to answer his question, because she didn’t know how. She wasn’t sure she’d ever experienced an orgasm. She’d had sex, she’d found it enjoyable, more or less, but whether she’d actually reached that mark she couldn’t be sure. What she was sure of, in that moment, was that his fingers were teasing her, and her resolve to fight him on it was dwindling by the second. </p><p>“While we’re here, I’m going to do you a favor, Granger,” Draco said to her silence. “I’m going to make you cum.” He forced two fingers into her wetness. She gasped, which he found greatly satisfying. His fingers began to move in her, pumping into her novice body skillfully.</p><p>The stretching sensation was something Hermione was not yet accustomed to, even if it was just a couple of fingers. She closed her eyes to avoid looking at the smug look on Malfoy’s face as he worked her into a fit state. The witch was determined not to make a sound, not to give him the satisfaction of hearing the effect he was having on her. It wasn’t as if it mattered, he could feel it anyway, feel the flow of juices dripping down his fingers, and her already so tight walls clamping down on the digits on their instinctual mission to milk him.</p><p>It wasn’t easy for Hermione to block him out and to pretend that he wasn’t there, especially when he kissed her again, just as harshly as he had the first time. He was causing a stirring within her body the likes of which it’d never known. It was a complete violation, and she would always resent him for it. The pressure in her core was building, she was panting not, and she was lightheaded once more. She didn’t know what to make of it. She felt as though she was going to explode. Just when she thought she could take no more of the curved fingers plundering her insides, they were gone.</p><p>Hermione’s eyes snapped open as a distressed whimper escaped her. Draco’s eyes bore into hers as he brought his fingers to his lips and sucked them clean, tasting her. Hermione shuddered at the sight of such a lude act. </p><p>“I-” She panted out a breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding. “That’s it?”</p><p>A wicked grin spread across Malfoy’s pale pink lips. “I’m not even close to being finished with you, my filthy mudblood whore.” </p><p>The possessive wording struck Hermione more intensely than his hand around her throat had. There in that library, a place Hermione had always found to be a sanctuary of sorts, Draco had the upper hand for once. “I’m not your whore!” Hermione repeated, trying to sound stronger than she felt. </p><p>Draco laughed, the sound giving the brunette chills. “Wrong,” he stated plainly. He leaned one forearm against the wall, the tips of his fingers playing with the hair on the crown of her head. The other explored her body to eventually land where her jaw met her neck, cupping her face firmly. He could feel her pulse under his touch. It was frantic, racing with the adrenaline coursing through her body. His was the same way. “You feel this? This energy? That’s seven years of pent up aggression. Let's not play games and pretend that this isn’t something we both want, like we haven’t been gifted this opportunity.” He was so close to her that she could feel his lips brush against hers every so lightly as he spoke. </p><p>When his lips crashed down on hers this time, Hermione didn’t bother to fight him. He was stubborn, and determined, and most importantly of all, he was dangerous. Besides, what was the harm, really? Having nothing to lose, she succumbed to him, matching his energy. Their tongues battled for dominance, and he bit her bottom lip in his excitement. She squeaked in surprise, and Draco chuckled. She could feel the hardening in his pants now. </p><p>“You see?” Draco asked, and turned her around, pressing her into the wall and kicking her feet apart as far as the pants hugging her knees would allow. His hand went between her legs once more, this time from behind, plunging into her as he’d done before. The fingers moved quickly, and Hermione forgot to contain her response. She moaned and whimpered at his rough treatment of such a fragile part of her. It was then that she heard the unmistakable sound of a belt being loosed. “You want this too.” He freed himself from his trousers.</p><p>His fingers were gone from her again, and Hermione could feel the smooth shaft head pressing against her entrance, teasing the hole while it coated itself in her nectar. Her mind screamed at her to put a stop to this. To turn away, to kick him, to fight him with every bit of strength she had, but her body didn’t listen. It was all she could do to brace herself against the wall and wait. He didn’t ease his way inside like her past lovers had, filling her inch by inch and allowing her body to adjust to the intrusion. He entered her all at once, causing her to cry out in surprise and pain as he tore the walls that his fingers alone were not long enough to prepare.</p><p>Draco groaned as he penetrated her. It’d been years since he’d been inside someone so tight. Maybe she was a virgin after all? Or maybe she’d just had so little sex that her body was not yet used to taking the toll of such girth. He didn’t care much either way, all he cared about was fulfilling his longtime dream of having his way with her. He bucked upwards into her harshly, his rhythm fast and steady.</p><p>Hermione gasped and moaned with each of his aggressive thrusts, trying pointlessly to hold onto the wall in front of her. She could feel her breasts scraping against the rough stone each time he moved within her. She thought she might cry, the moral conflict eating away at her. On one hand, she was absolutely disgusted with herself. How could she even think about letting him touch her, much less have her wholly? On the other, she was an adult, a single woman, and if she wanted to have a completely meaningless, passionate, hate fueled fling with her greatest rival while war and death raged on all around them, well then that was her prerogative. Besides, she had a feeling that if she wasn’t going along with it, he might have taken her anyway, whether she liked it or not. Wasn’t it better, in the long run, if she just embraced it? Maybe she could even enjoy it. And Merlin, she was really starting to enjoy it.</p><p>Draco was relentless, taking her with zero regard for anything but his own pleasure. She felt as good as he’d always imagined she would, maybe better. He wanted to make this last forever. After several long, passionate minutes, Draco moved away from her, and slapped her arse hard for good measure, causing her to jolt with the surprise. The firm mound jiggled for a moment before stilling again, a hand-shaped welt all that remained of his assault. “You’ve got a lovely little pussy,” Draco informed her. “I’d like to watch myself fuck it this time.”</p><p>Hermione shook when the loss of his body meant she was greeted by the cool air of the library against her sweaty skin. She turned around to face him, relaxing her back against the wall this time. She felt horribly awkward and vulnerable standing there. Luckily, she wasn’t there long before he pulled her to the nearest study table. She’d never admit that she was grateful for it, because she didn’t think she could think for herself in that moment. He sat her on the edge of it, and when her feet dangled off of the floor, he was able to remove her pants completely, the removal of her shoes and socks a necessity in the process.</p><p>“Oh God,” Hermione cried out when he bent her legs back, knees towards her chest, and entered her again. She fell back against the cold wood table and reached behind her, gripping onto the table ledge as he drove into her with a force he hadn’t been able to use in their prior standing position. The table shook with the force of it, and she was quickly aware of how that lightheaded feeling she’d experienced while he fingered her had returned. Her body was screaming, pressure building. Each time the hard tip of his dick slammed into her, she could feel herself being pushed closer and closer to insanity.</p><p>Draco held her thighs in place as he moved inside of her dripping wet cunt, staring at the juicy opening as his cock slid in and out, in and out. It was a magnificent sight to behold. He moved one of his hands down her leg, closer to her sloppy wet entrance, stretched his thumb out, and rubbed it hard against her swollen clit. She might not have realized that she was about to cum, but he knew the signs all too well.</p><p>Hermione nearly screamed when she felt the thumb on her sensitive nub. “Oh god, oh god,” she chanted over and over again, each time increasing in intensity before finally she made no sound at all, her mouth open in a silent scream. </p><p>“That’s it!” Draco encouraged her, rubbing furiously still, pounding into her hard enough that the table legs shifted slightly with each hit. “There it is, Granger. Cum all over my pureblood cock, you dirty girl.”</p><p>Hermione ignored the hate in his words, but gained understanding from them. This was an orgasm. Bloody hell, it was maddening. She thought for sure she was going to black out from the intensity of it. She felt as though she was in the ocean, his brutal force hitting her like wave after power wave, keeping her from breaking the surface and finding air. Before she realized what she was doing, she kicked him, pushing him away from her in a desperate act of self preservation.</p><p>Draco was as surprised as she was after taking her foot to the abdomen. He would have been mad, if it wasn’t entirely hilarious. She’d been so overwhelmed by the force of her own orgasm that she had to physically push him away to make it stop. “Bloody hell, Granger,” he laughed as she sat up, shock and nervousness on her face. She probably thought he was going to punish her for that. “You’ve made a complete mess of my trousers,” he said for the sole purpose of humiliating her, noting that the groin area was now completely soaked in her juices. He stepped out of the pants at last, and pulled his shirt over his head for good measure. </p><p>Hermione was relieved that he hadn’t chosen to take offense to her kick. She didn’t remember choosing to do it, it was an instinct more than anything. But he wasn’t finished with her, she knew, because he was removing what was left of his clothes. All she could do was watch as he became as naked as she was, and then he was on top of her again. He flipped her over and penetrated her for the third time. Hermione gasped and groaned, balancing on her toes while her thighs slammed into the edge of the table. </p><p>It was only a minute or two later when Draco, too, had reached a climax. He pulled out of her and stroked himself roughly, before spilling several long milky streams onto her bare backside, shamelessly grunting his pleasure. </p><p>Hermione felt the warm liquid splash onto her arse, and it was humiliating. When she felt no more, she turned around and faced him, to find he was already getting back into his underwear. She crossed her legs and her arms over her chest, refusing to give him the satisfaction of viewing her nakedness any longer. </p><p>“You, er, want some help with that?” Draco asked, picking up her knickers while offering to wipe up the mess he’d left on her. She gave him a stern look, and he shrugged. “Suit yourself.” He tossed the small lacy garment to her. </p><p>“You’re disgusting,” Hermione said while she turned her back to him, attempting to wipe the semen from her buttock without destroying any dignity she had left.</p><p>“And you’re delicious,” Draco replied without missing a beat, smirking that playful smirk she hated so much. He didn’t bother to put the rest of his clothes back on. His pants were too wet, and he would have looked stupid wearing his underwear with his shirt. </p><p>After gathering her clothes, she realized she’d have to go commando. Her bra was trashed and her favorite panties would now need to be burned. She did pull on her jeans and sweater as quickly as she could, before walking towards another table and taking a seat. She grabbed a book off of the table at random and began to read it. At least she wouldn’t have to be bored while she was stranded there with him. She found it impossible though, after a few minutes, because she could feel his eyes on her.</p><p>“What?” Hermione snapped, turning to him with a glare. What he said in response made Hermione’s face turn a new shade of red.</p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p></div>
