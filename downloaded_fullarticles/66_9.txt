    <p>For the most part, Neville didn’t know what to think about the Weasley’s.</p><p>He was spending a couple of nights at their house at Ron’s invitation, an invitation which had arrived unexpectedly a few days after Neville returned home from Hogwarts.</p><p>The first thing Neville noticed was how beautiful their house was. It was a bit run down, but it reminded him a lot of his own family house, with full gardens and beautiful views. He spent a bit of time upon arrival looking at all the plants they had and identifying them.</p><p>The family was great company too. Mr. Weasley was quaint and, frankly, obsessed with Muggles and their way of doing things without magic. Neville already knew Fred and George, famous for their Quidditch playing and legendary pranks. Ginny was a bit shy, but altogether incredibly funny. Although he had some qualms with Ron, he wasn’t the worst; he was kind enough to send an invitation to his home.</p><p>He was having a great time overall, glad to get away from Longbottom Hill for a bit. The only thing that made him feel uneasy was –</p><p>“Neville!” exclaimed Mrs. Weasley from the kitchen. “Good morning! Breakfast is ready!”</p><p>Neville woke up quite a bit later than Harry and Ron, with whom he was rooming during this little trip to the Burrow. The entire Weasley family (minus Bill and Charlie, Ron’s oldest brothers), Harry, Sirius, and Lupin, were all sitting around the crowded dinner table as Neville walked down the stairs.</p><p>Mrs. Weasley was the only one not sitting; she was making herself busy with the food and dishes and making sure everyone was taken care of.</p><p>It wasn’t that Neville thought <em>bad</em> of Mrs. Weasley for her motherly instincts. It was just that Neville was just <em>incredibly</em> uncomfortable with her smothering.</p><p>As Neville got to the last stair, Mrs. Weasley was already putting her hands onto Neville’s shoulders, guiding him to one of the two remaining open chairs next to Sirius.</p><p>The whole debacle with Peter Pettigrew the month before was still lingering over all their heads. Neville smiled awkwardly at Sirius, and Sirius smiled right back. The man seemed so much younger than Neville had seen him last. He guessed it was good for a man to be out of Azkaban for the first time in twelve years.</p><p>A plate of food was placed in front of him. Neville smiled and gently thanked Mrs. Weasley.</p><p>The thing was, he wouldn’t ever get <em>visibly</em> frustrated at Mrs. Weasley for being the way she was.  Inside, though was a different story. He just couldn’t get over the feeling of being <em>cared for. </em>Neville tried his hardest to keep his frustration under wraps, although he wasn’t too sure his facial expressions weren’t giving away his true feelings.</p><p>“’ey,” said Ron, mouth still full of food. He swallowed before continuing. “Wanna play some Quidditch when we’re done?”</p><p>A chorus of agreements sounded out across the table. As soon as each of them had finished eating, Ron, Harry, Fred, George, and Ginny all ran outside. Neville lagged behind, choosing to sit and watch at a picnic table at the edge of the yard.</p><p>The door to the Burrow opened behind Neville. He turned to see Sirius walking outside to join him in watching the other kids play.</p><p>Neville and Sirius sat in somewhat awkward silence with the noise of the others in the background. Neville decided to break the silence.</p><p>“So…” he started, not knowing what exactly to say. “How have things been?”</p><p>“Better,” Sirius sighed, “much better.”</p><p>“After this, Harry’s going to be living with you and Lupin, correct?”</p><p>“Yeah…” said Sirius almost dreamily. “I can’t wait.”</p><p>They sat in silence once more. Neville had something weighing on his chest, though. He was beyond scared to ask, but he desperately wanted to know what Sirius had experienced of <em>them</em> in Azkaban. For some reason he couldn’t quite understand, he wanted to know everything he could about the people who put his parents in the hospital.</p><p>Neville grew more restless as he stared absently at the other kids playing the game, until finally –</p><p>“You want to know about them, right?” asked Sirius.</p><p>Neville was practically bouncing at this point, and only just noticed how anxious his behavior was.</p><p>“Umm…”</p><p>“I know…” said Sirius. “I get it. You know, I was pretty good friends with your parents… We were all part of the Order of the Phoenix.”</p><p>Neville couldn’t tell if Sirius knew exactly who he wanted to know more about. He had heard plenty about his parents from his grandmother.</p><p>He processed what Sirius had just said and forced himself to respond. “What was the Order of the Phoenix?”</p><p>“It was an organization put together by Dumbledore,” Sirius explained, “in order to help fight against Voldemort when he was in his prime… Me, Lupin, your parents, Harry’s parents, they were all part of it…”</p><p>Sirius looked lost, staring blankly in front of him. Neville gave him space to think, not wanting to interrupt.</p><p>“Well,” said Sirius, finally seeming to bring himself out of his thoughts, “that was a long time ago. If we’re lucky, we won’t have to reform, but Dumbledore seems to think differently…”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“He seems to think Voldemort is closer to rising than anyone else is guessing. Frankly, most people think the man is gone for good… but not Dumbledore. There’s been a recent disappearance… Bertha Jorkins, I knew her in school. Most people think she got herself lost, she’s known for not being the brightest, but Dumbledore thinks different…”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Oh, yeah. That’s how it started last time, too… when he came to power, mysterious disappearances, and Dumbledore thinks this might just be the start, same as last time…”</p><p>Neville thought about it as the other kids continued to play.</p><p>
  <em>Harry did tell us about that premonition made by Professor Trelawney…</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Late that night, when Ron had already gone to sleep, Harry and Neville were in the middle of a game of wizard chess in the Weasley’s living room.</p><p>“Guess what Sirius told me earlier?” said Neville as casually as possible while Harry thought about his next move.</p><p>“Are you trying to distract me?”</p><p>“No!” <em>Maybe…</em></p><p>Harry thought for a moment more, and finally made his move.</p><p>“What did Sirius tell you?” asked Harry.</p><p>Neville stared at the board for a moment, unsure what to do. He thought for a moment.</p><p>
  <em> If I move the knight… but then he can get to my queen…</em>
</p><p>He thought a few moments more and made his move. One of the pawns forward.</p><p>“Well, he told me about this organization called the Order of the Phoenix… apparently your parents and my parents were part of it, along with Sirius and Lupin. It was created by Dumbledore to fight You- Know-Who.”</p><p>“Really?” said Harry. The boy had been startled out of his thoughts at the mention of his parents. “Wow…”</p><p>Harry moved. It was Neville’s turn.</p><p>Neville decided his only choice was to move his knight.</p><p>Harry moved his queen in front of Neville’s king.</p><p>“Checkmate.”</p><p>“Agh!” said Neville. “How are you so good at that?”</p><p>Harry shrugged. “Did Sirius tell you anything else?”</p><p>Neville didn’t know if it was a good idea to tell Harry about Dumbledore’s theory on Voldemort’s return. He decided to tell him anyways though.</p><p>“Hmm…” said Harry after Neville explained. “I just hope it isn’t soon…”</p><p> </p><p>Neville sat in the incredibly soft chair in the Weasley’s living room and stared at the turning disc in awe and wonder for several minutes.</p><p>A voice came suddenly from beside him.</p><p>“<em>Fascinating</em> machine, isn’t it?”</p><p>Neville jumped and turned to see who had spoken. It was Mr. Weasley, who was now staring at the machine with the same awe Neville had felt just moments ago.</p><p>He returned his attention to the device. The machine seemed to be the source of a slow jazz song sounding out across the living room. Neville thought it might be sung by a Muggle …</p><p>
  <em>It’s quarter to three</em>
</p><p>
  <em>There’s no one in the place</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Except you and me…</em>
</p><p>The woman singing had a wavy, beautiful voice. Neville felt like he could be put in a trance.</p><p>“I’ve been trying to figure out how it works for <em>ages</em>,” said Mr. Weasley. “Of all the Muggle inventions I’ve pulled apart and researched, the phonograph is the one that continues to perplex me most…”</p><p>Neville didn’t blame him. From the looks of it, there were tiny grooves in the black plate that spun around and around. There was a needle that went in the grooves…</p><p>But how did little grooves turn into such calming music?</p><p>
  <em>You’d never know it</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But buddy, I’m a kind of a poet</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And I’ve got a lot of things to say</em>
</p><p>Mr. Weasley sat down in the chair next to Neville. They sat there for a while, listening to the music drone on, never taking their eyes off the phonograph…</p><p>
  <em>Well, that’s how it goes</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And Joe I know you’re gettin’ anxious to close</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So, thanks for the cheer</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I hope you didn’t mind my bending your ear</em>
</p><p>“Are you excited to get back to school, Neville?”</p><p>Neville nodded a bit. “Yeah. I’m sad, though, that Professor Lupin won’t be teaching us…”</p><p>“Sure, from what Ron’s told us, he was a great professor,” said Mr. Weasley. “But I happen to know you’re getting a right treat this upcoming year, Dumbledore just selected Lupin’s replacement.”</p><p>Neville looked away from the record in surprise.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Oh, yeah!” said Mr. Weasley. “You’re being taught by none other than Alastor “Mad-Eye” Moody.”</p><p>“Oh,” said Neville, “yeah I’ve heard about him from my Gran.”</p><p>“As I understand it, he was Head of the Department of Aurors right around the time your parents joined the force.”</p><p>Neville didn’t respond. He returned his attention to the record player.</p><p>
  <em>Make it one for my baby</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And one more for the road</em>
</p><p>
  <em>That long, long road…</em>
</p><p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>Screams rang out in the house… A high-pitched cackle mixed in…</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I have an idea,” said a gruff voice.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Muttering above the crying. And then the same high-pitched laugh once more.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Imperio!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The sound of someone being kicked repeatedly, and crying.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Neville began to cry.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Stupid child!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The sound of someone approaching the door…</em>
</p><p>Neville awoke with a start, breathing hard. He sat up and put his face in his hands, letting himself just breathe for a moment. For some odd reason, he didn’t feel like crying.</p><p>Neville had been having these dreams ever since the night they had proven Sirius’s innocence. He still couldn’t believe what he had seen when the dementors came near…</p><p>
  <em>How come I didn’t see this the first two times the dementors came near? Was it hidden in my memory?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Was I really in the house when it happened?</em>
</p><p>An agitation had begun to fill him as he sat still in the bed. It was almost overwhelming; an odd clenching in his chest that he couldn’t get rid of.</p><p>He couldn’t resist the urge to move. He had to get up and do something. As quietly as possible, he got out of the bed and snuck to the door.</p><p>Stepping lightly down the stairs, Neville looked around and listened hard for any movement around the house. He wasn’t sure of the time; anyone could be awake. As he passed Fred and George’s room, he heard quiet talking behind their door.</p><p>
  <em>Scheming, probably.</em>
</p><p>Neville continued down the steps, stopping every few to make sure he wasn’t waking anyone up.</p><p>Finally, he reached the ground floor, where no one had a bedroom and he could a little less cautious. He scoured through the cabinets looking for a glass. When he finally found one (with flowers painted on it), he went to the sink and poured himself some water.</p><p>In the process of going downstairs and getting water, he managed to forget for a moment why he was even awake in the first place. It threatened to return, but Neville forcefully shoved it to a dark corner in his mind, to be avoided. He looked around the kitchen, welcoming any kind of distraction.</p><p>“Neville?” came a soft, kind voice near the stairs.</p><p>He jumped, spilling water all over his shirt. How Neville managed to not hear someone coming down the stairs was beyond him. He turned his head toward the stairs to find Mrs. Weasley standing at the bottom.</p><p>“Hey, Mrs. Weasley,” he said meekly. “Sorry if I woke you, I just came down for some water.”</p><p>“No problem at all, I was already awake,” said Mrs. Weasley.</p><p>She moved closer to him and grabbed her own glass to fill. She turned to him.</p><p>“I’m sorry if Ron woke you, he’s a bit of a snorer,” she said.</p><p>“Not at all, Mrs. Weasley,” Neville replied. “I just couldn’t sleep…”</p><p>“I understand,” she said sympathetically. “After having seven children, it practically becomes habit to wake up at three in the morning.”</p><p>“Is that the time?” asked Neville, surprised.</p><p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley.</p><p>There was a pause, during which they both took sips of water.</p><p>“Anything bothering you, dear?” said Mrs. Weasley gently.</p><p>“Ah, no,” said Neville.</p><p>Mrs. Weasley looked at him for a long moment.</p><p>“Alright, dear, if you say so,” she said finally. “Better drink that up and get to bed.”</p><p>She patted him on the shoulder and moved to climb back up the stairs. Neville watched after her. He supposed Mrs. Weasley wasn’t so bad after all.</p><p>He quickly tried to finish his water; he was, in fact, getting tired.</p><p>When he reached Ron’s room, he tried very hard to be as silent as possible. He believed he had managed it right up until he heard a quiet whisper in the room.</p><p>“Neville?”</p><p>Now sat up in his bed and about to lay down, Neville froze.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>Neville assumed it was Harry, as Ron’s snores continued to fill the room.</p><p>“Yeah, just went to get some water.”</p><p>“Alright…” said Harry. “Good night, I guess.”</p><p>“Yeah,” said Neville. “Good night.”</p>
