    <p>Harry stretched his arms up leisurely, slipping a little further down the sofa as he did so. Ginny smiled across at him as he yawned widely and rubbed his eyes, knocking his glasses askew. It was late, but the sun was only just setting; one of the joys of early August. He felt a nudge in his side, and he looked across to the space next to him where his beautiful wife was sat, wand behind her ear, reading the latest issue of The Quibbler. </p>

<p></p><div>
  <p>"If you're tired, go to bed, you're meant to be going up to Hogwarts tomorrow," Ginny said gently. She knew he was still unsure whether he'd made the right decision. "You'll only be grumpy tomorrow if you don't sleep now." She added with a smile.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>He sighed and sat up straight. He gave another stretch, another yawn, and nodded. "You're right, as usual," he added, in a false-grumpy tone, "I'll see you when you come up." He gave her a quick kiss on the cheek and went up to bed.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Today had been his last day as an auror. Tomorrow, he was going to travel up to Scotland, to Hogwarts. He had applied for a job as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, when the last person who had held the post (for 21 years), had retired. He'd been invited for an interview, and was surprised to see how little Professor McGonagall appeared to have aged. Perhaps there was a clause in the Headteacher's contract that stated you weren't allowed to get older at a normal pace.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Still, he had had the interview, and had been offered the job a week later. After countless hours of discussing it with Ginny, he'd accepted a few days after that. She was going to be on tour with the Holyhead Harpies for the next year anyway, as their manager, and come September, all three of their children would be at Hogwarts.  Lily Luna would be starting in just a month...the thought gave Harry a wild mix of emotions. He couldn't believe how much his life had changed in 20 years. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>His mind was still racing as he checked on the kids one last time, giving them all a light kiss on the forehead, then tucked himself into bed. He threw his glasses carelessly onto the bedside cabinet, as he did every night, and willed his mind to stop whirring. He lay awake contemplating his decision, until Ginny came up to join him half an hour later. She delicately kissed the old lightning bolt scar, and his mind quietened. His breath deepened, and moments later he sank into blissful slumber. </p>
</div><hr/>
<p>"DAD WAKE UP YOU HAVE TO MAKE US BREAKFAST BEFORE YOU GO!" Yelled three voices in an imperfect harmony, inches away from his ear. He sat bolt upright, wand snatched from beneath his pillow, immediately wide awake. Ginny came barging through the door with a blazing look in her eyes. </p>

<p></p><div>
  <p>"What have I told you about waking up your dad like that?" She said in a tone, and volume, her mother would have been proud of. "Get back downstairs, right now." She gave them all a hard stare and the three of them scuttled out the room without another sound, all looking rather sheepish. As soon as they disappeared Ginny's manner changed completely. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Are you alright?" She asked quietly, perching on the bed and covering his hand, still gripping his wand, now on the covers, with her own. Harry could feel his heart still racing. He loved all his children dearly but sometimes they were quite a handful. He dreaded to think what it would be like teaching them next year. He realised Ginny was still waiting for an answer, and he flashed her a tight smile.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yeah, no, I'm ok. No flashback this time, and no hexes," he muttered drily. Ginny gave a soft snort of laughter.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Always looking on the bright side," she ruffled his constantly messy hair and stood up. "They're right though, you did promise them pancakes, and you know they hate mine." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry groaned and reached for his glasses. They weren't easily reachable so he accio-d them, and they poked him in the eye. Ginny gave another snort and told him she'd wait downstairs, to try and keep the monsters entertained. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>He slid his feet into slippers and tried to calm his still racing heart. He was just grateful he hadn't accidentally hexed someone like he had last time they'd woken him up suddenly. Fighting a war, then doing 21 years of auror work left one a little twitchy, to say the least. With a stretch and a yawn, Harry stood up and trudged towards the bedroom door. He knew they were young and didn't understand the consequences of their actions, and he had already forgiven them, but their mix of genetics was always going to make them a handful.</p>
</div><hr/>
<p>Rucksack safely strapped to his back, small trunk already sent ahead, Harry kissed Ginny goodbye, and told the children to behave. They rolled their eyes and ran off into the garden, yelling goodbyes over their shoulders. </p>

<p></p><div>
  <p>"I'll be back in a couple of days, I just need to get the classroom sorted," he promised, with one last kiss. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Tell Peeves hi from the Weasleys, if you see him," Ginny requested as Harry took a handful of floo-powder. With a laugh, Harry agreed to do just that, and stepped into the roaring green flames.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"The Three Broomsticks!" He said, carefully and clearly. The floor dropped from below him, and he was gone, spinning like a top past hundreds of other fireplaces all linked to the network. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>A few moments later and he landed hard at the pub. He cleared his throat and wiped some soot off his sleeves. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Morning," he greeted the bar tender. He got a nod in reply as he headed for the door. Before he reached it however, a figure moved to block his path. A rush of adrenaline shot through him and he reached for his wand, before he recognised the man in front of him. Adrenaline was washed away by relief and a sense of right-ness.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Neville!" He cried, embracing his old friend. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Hiya, Harry," he said with a wide smile. "How are you?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Not bad, think I've finally decided I've made the right decision."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You weren't sure?" Neville queried, one eyebrow raised. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"It doesn't matter, I am now." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Neville beamed at him, and it struck Harry how little he'd changed in 21 years, too. "Then let's go." Neville held the pub's door open for him, and together they headed up to the castle. They struck up an easy conversation as they walked. It had been at least a year since they'd had the chance to see each other, and there was plenty to catch up on. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Neville's only child, a daughter they'd adopted a few years ago, would be starting school this year, the same time as Lily. He and Hannah were settled in Hogsmeade, and Hannah had an apothecary in the village that was doing very well for itself. They walked companionably up the winding path in the morning sun. It was promising to be a nice day ahead of them. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"How did you know I was coming in today?" Harry asked as they approached the wrought iron gates that guarded the grounds. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Ahh, a Professor knows everything, young Mr Potter," Neville said, tapping the side of his nose. Harry laughed, and tapped the gates with his wand. They swung open to let them pass. "McGonagall mentioned were due in at ten, so I thought I'd come meet you, just in case you'd forgotten your way back up here." That seems the more plausible, Harry thought, grinning at his old friend. He took a moment to admire the knitted jumper he wore, wondering if knitting was a hobby of Hannah's, or maybe his. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>A sense of relief spread through Harry at the same time the shadow of the castle hit him. He looked up at the once-familiar towers and turrets, and a pang of nostalgia tugged at his insides. Neville fell silent at the look on Harry's face, and gave a soft smile. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I had the same reaction when I saw it all restored and finished."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry's insides twisted painfully. After all those years it still hurt to think about the amount of damage the ancient building had taken on his behalf. He'd helped with the clearing, but the magic needed to repair the place had been beyond the talents of a 17 year old who had left school after 6 years. He had seen parts of it when he'd come for the interview, of course, but it was different knowing this time he was back for good. If he had to describe it, he wouldn't have been able to find the words. It was the best feeling in the world. He loved his family, and his home with them, but Hogwarts would always be the first place he found acceptance. He was finally home again. </p>
