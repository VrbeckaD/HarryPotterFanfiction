They were full of amusement and admiration. <br/>“It is entirely your fault that I must tell you how ardently I admire and love you.” His partner smirked and raised an eyebrow, a gesture he learned from his husband quite a while ago. </p><p>He slowly stalked over to where the other was sitting in his chair by the fireplace, brooding over a novel that he now recognised as Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. <br/>“I always thought of you as a Mr. Darcy you know?”, he started, “When I first came to this school I had only seen a few select bits of the old television programme. <br/>I still thought that Mr. Darcy was the tall, proud one who had wronged his childhood friend whom he was supposed to love like a brother. I was deceived, clearly, just as Elizabeth was.” </p><p>The man in the armchair slowly closed his book and laid it face down on the table next to him.<br/>Slowly he reached out towards his husband and pulled him down to him, so he was sitting astride his lap with both his legs dangling over the left armrest.</p><p>“Is that so?” He asked. Voice deep and sultry. “And pray tell, how exactly did you feel when you found out that Mr. Darcy, while proud, really was the noble one?” </p><p>The younger man sitting in his lap smiled, remembering his 6th year of education. “Do you remember how my potion grades went up significantly during 6th year?”, he asked.</p><p>“Yes, I do. And thanks to whom I wonder.”, came the reply, sounding both proud and admonishing at once. The other looked at him sheepishly. “Right, thanks for that by the way.” <br/>An eyebrow was raised, but no further comment made and so he went on with his tale. “Well, I might have gotten a little bit attached to the Half Blood Prince. <br/>Some would have, and actually did, call me obsessed and in a desperate attempt to get me to loosen this bond I was forming with a book, Hermione begged me to read. And so I did. <br/>During the day it was novels and at night, when the curtains were drawn I would return to reading your comments on how idiotic the author of Potions Advanced was.” He grinned. </p><p>“So, while you were discovering that I had a personality you could find agreeable, Granger pushed you to read Jane Austen?” </p><p>“Yes, that is exactly what happened. I found out Mr. Darcy was the good guy all along, right as I was falling in love with you for the first time.”</p></div>
