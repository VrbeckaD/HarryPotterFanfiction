    <p>Harry grinned, he knew it was one that he was going to have to work hard at hiding. He was down in the Chamber of Secrets, hiding as usual, from his so-called friends. He reread the spell. It was perfect but first, he needed to take care of a few things and he had the summer holidays to do it.</p><p>__________________________________________________________________</p><p>"I don't know what is wrong with him, Albus. All I can tell you is that his magic is gone. He doesn't even show up as a squib." Harry was pretending to be asleep as he was listening to the two of them discuss what was wrong. "He is still showing signs of abuse which you promised wouldn't happen."</p><p>"We can deal with that aspect later. Right now, we need to figure out what is wrong with Harry." Dumbledore declared.</p><p>"You mean besides the broken bones, bruises, and the list of other problems?" Poppy snapped at Dumbledore.</p><p>"What is she speaking about Albus?" Harry recognized that voice.</p><p>"I am speaking about the repeated abuse by Potter's relatives. Albus seems determined to ignore it again." Harry could hear the rustle of parchment. "I have been telling him for years and now I believe Potter's magic has finally given out."</p><p>"You're telling me because Albus has kept returning Potter to his abusive relatives, who have treated so badly, that the boy's magic is gone because he used it all up to keep himself alive?" Severus Snape's voice was that deadly calm before a storm tone. "What have you done, Albus?"</p><p>"I am sure we can find a remedy. He is needed after all."</p><p>"Albus, of all the hairbrained ideas you have ever had. Where in the world did you come up with the idea of returning a severely abused child to his abuser?"</p><p>"It wouldn't be his first or second time." Severus bitterness was clear. "After all, he did with the Dark Lord and me. However, neither of us has suffered to the extent that Potter clearly has."</p><p>"If he doesn't have any magic, he can't stay." A voice, one he knew and hoped would make an appearance, Lucius Malfoy announced from the doorway.</p><p>"Lucius, I wasn't aware you were here." Dumbledore greeted Lucius. "It's only a temporary problem. I am sure we can have it sorted out in no time."</p><p>"I'm sure. In order to expedite the matter, I will have some healers arrive from St. Mungos and that way no one can claim that we haven't done our very best for Mr. Potter."</p><p>Harry smirked. Yes, he loved a good plan. Now to kick it up a notch. "No, please, Uncle, no..no..." He felt a potion hit his stomach, a dreamless sleep.</p><p>____________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Harry woke up, seeing Snape sitting by his bed, reading. "So?"</p><p>"They bought it. I am to escort you to your lovely relatives. For some reason, Albus has the idea that you will obey me."</p><p>"When?"</p><p>"I believe as soon as Poppy releases you."</p><p>"Lucius?"</p><p>"Did his job."</p><p>Harry wanted to ask more but he saw Snape straighten up and put his book down. As the book was laid on the table Poppy followed by Dumbledore entered the ward. "Harry, my boy, I am sure you are anxious to leave and return to your classes. However, due to the issue with your magic, it has been determined that you need to return to your relatives. I do need your wand."</p><p>Harry looked at his wand on the table next to Snape's book. "My wand?"</p><p>"Yes, since you have been found to be without magic, you won't need your wand any longer."</p><p>"You're going to take my wand?" Harry thought he deserved an award for this performance. He knew his so-called friends hadn't visited him and had made arrangments with Dobby to make sure no one got his possessions.</p><p>"I am sorry, my boy, but you don't have any magic." Dumbledore snatched up the wand from the table. "Poppy, if you could."</p><p>Poppy huffed but pulled out her wand. "Physically he is healthy, his magic signature is still there." She was very against what the Headmaster planned on doing.</p><p>"Good, good, Professor Snape is going to escort you back to your relatives. Since it's Saturday and you can't use the Hogwarts Express, I have arranged for Professor Snape to apparite you as close to your relatives' house as possible and he will escort you to their door."</p><p>Harry glared at the man, as Snape rose. "Get dressed, Potter."</p><p>_____________________________________________________________________</p><p>Snape apparated them to a Manor outside of Cardiff. "Everyone is already here."</p><p>"Good. I just need to reverse this spell and get my wand out. I am so thankful that he bought that was my real wand." Harry sent a grin to Snape as they headed toward the Manor.</p><p>"He plans on giving it to Longbottom. He wants to present him as the true Savior."</p><p>Harry started laughing. "How did he arrive at that?"</p><p>"He originally tried to get Weasley but Molly tossed a fit in the Order meeting."</p><p>"Oh, I want to see that memory."</p><p>"Kreacher was the one to inform us of it. It seems he hasn't realized what you have done as of yet."</p><p>"He won't, the notices will go out with the bank statements as the goblins believed seeing their negative balances on their own vaults balances and Dumbledore seeing that the Potter and Black vaults are zeroed out will have an interesting effect on the old fart."</p><p>"I will make sure to show you the memory when they learn the truth."</p>
