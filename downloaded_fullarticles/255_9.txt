    <p>“I can help you there.”</p>
<p>Malfoy offered his hand with a smirk. Harry looked up at him and saw Dudley, recruiting his mindlessly faithful followers. The same followers who had taunted Harry for years. He thought of Malfoy’s dismissal of Ron and his family and decided there and then that he didn’t want to be a part of that. He batted Malfoy’s hand away.</p>
<p>“I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.”</p>
<p>Surprise, offense, and bitterness flashed across Malfoy’s face in quick succession, and he pulled back the outstretched hand as though the brief touch had somehow stung him. His expression quickly shifted into disdain. “Have it your way, Potter.” The crowd of new students parted for him as he strutted to the back of the room, silently followed by Crabbe and Goyle. Harry glanced at Ron, who was staring at him in a way that could only be described as fish-like. Before he could say anything, McGonagall reappeared at the front of the room. He shrugged helplessly at Ron and followed her into the Great Hall.</p>
<p>As soon as they entered the Hall, Harry’s altercation with Malfoy was pushed from his mind by the sheer magic of the place. Candles filled in the air, casting a bright glow across the room. Golden plates lay on the four long tables, glittering under the lights. Briefly, Harry wondered why they were empty if the students were to eat, but he was far too distracted by the rest of the room to dwell on it. Ghosts were floating among the tables – and Harry was surprised only by how unsurprised he was – and at the far end of the Hall on a slightly raised platform was a grander table where the teachers sat. He only glanced over them, however, before his gaze was dragged back upwards to the sky.<br/>
The night sky overhead was dotted with stars, obscured only in places by dark clouds. The crescent moon shone brightly, a faint glow around the edges, and it seemed to have started raining despite not a drop landing on them as they sailed to the school. His questions were soon answered by the haughty girl they had met on the train. Even if it wasn’t real, it was magic, and that was pretty damn cool. By the look on his face, Ron was equally impressed, even if it didn’t come from a place of wonder. He had mentioned earlier that he cam from a family of wizards, but clearly all of this was more extravagant than the average wizarding home.</p>
<p>The crowd of first years stopped pushing and walking and started craning up to get a look at the front of the room. Harry tried to stand on his tiptoes to look, but he had been so distracted that he got pushed to the middle of the group, and he had never been tall. The heads in front of him blocked his view, and the whispering was so loud that he couldn’t hear the words to what sounded like a song. Sighing, he gave up and waited for the crowd to thin out.</p>
<p>An eternal minute later, the crowd had thinned enough that he caught a glimpse of a worn, brown old hat with a rip in its seam. McGonagall was standing next to the hat, reading from a long scroll.</p>
<p>“Malfoy, Draco.” </p>
<p>Harry watched as Malfoy swaggered to the front of the crowd, the candlelight shimmering on his smooth, platinum blond hair. Aside from the glint in his grey eyes, Malfoy seemed thoroughly bored by the magic Hall.</p>
<p>“The Malfoys worked for You-Know-Who,” Ron whispered. “Slytherins, the lot of them. Rich tossers, too” Harry nodded, watching the ceremony. Malfoy sat down on the stool and McGonagall lowered the hat onto his head. It had barely touched his head before-</p>
<p>“SLYTHERIN!”</p>
<p>Harry nearly jumped out of his skin a second time as the table on the far side of the hall erupted into cheers.</p>
<p>“What did I tell you?” Ron said as the ruckus died down.</p>
<p>“We get sorted by a hat,” Harry grinned, mainly to himself. “I love magic.”</p>
<p>The sorting went quiet again, aside from a few more “well-known” names, as Ron said. There were a few more names before she reached the “P”s – “Parkinson, Pansy” went straight to Slytherin and sat across from Malfoy, “Patil” and “Patil”, both in different houses, “Perks, Sally-Ann” was sorted into Gryffindor, then –</p>
<p>“Potter, Harry.”</p>
<p>The whispering came back in full force. Harry felt like he was falling out of his body as he walked robotically towards to stool upon which the hat sat. Thousands of eyes were trained on him, and he was dimly aware of the fact that his breathing had sped up. He forced himself to the stool, his mouth dry. He took a moment to thank god that his dark skin hid, at least a bit, how warm his face suddenly felt. Before he knew it, the hat was on his head, and the dizziness was alleviated, the sick feeling dulled.</p>
<p>“Harry Potter.” The Sorting Hat whispered in his ear. “You’d do well in many houses. Oh, but that’s interesting… not entirely unexpected, considering the circumstances though…”</p>
<p>“Excuse me, sorry, what are you talking about?” Harry thought politely.</p>
<p>“Nothing, nothing. Just something I saw in your mind. Let’s see… bravery, yes, of course there would have to be. I doubt you’d survive without. Not a bad mind, either… loyalty and determination… my, that’s quite the ambition. Only to be expected, of course…”</p>
<p>“Where are you going to put me?”</p>
<p>“Be patient, although that’s not your forte, is it? Perhaps not Hufflepuff, then. You desperately want to prove yourself; I can see that… there’s an overwhelming amount of Slytherin here, in more ways than once, but you could do well in Gryffindor.”</p>
<p>Harry remembered Malfoy sitting down at Slytherin. “Not Slytherin.”</p>
<p>The Sorting Hat laughed. “Funny, that reasoning. This will be interesting to watch play out. I can see your point. After all, the two houses are more similar than most people think. Perhaps more so than the other houses. You know, you could find what you’re looking for in Slytherin.”</p>
<p>“Not Slytherin.”</p>
<p>“Oh well, if you’re sure. Better be – GRYFFINDOR!” The Sorting Hat shouted this aloud to the Great Hall, and the raucous applause of the hall thumped in Harry’s ears as he walked over to the table decorated in red. He sat next to one of the Weasley twins from the train platform, which put him across from the train girl, who introduced herself as Hermione Granger. The Hall eventually settled down, and Harry tried to make himself look as small as possible as, one by one, the rest of the year got sorted.</p>
<p>~ </p>
<p>“Of course Potter gets the loudest applause. I bet he loved that.” Draco stabbed at the Yorkshire pudding which had appeared on his plate after the ceremony was over.</p>
<p>“Sure you’re not just projecting?” Pansy smirked. Draco glared.</p>
<p>“I am not dramatic!”</p>
<p>“I never said you were. It’s interesting that that’s the first thing you jumped to, though.”</p>
<p>“It was heavily implied,” he snapped.</p>
<p>“I think you’re just bitter that he rejected your offer. Who knows, if you hadn’t been such an arse, he could have been in Slytherin with us,” Blaise piped up through a mouthful of potatoes.</p>
<p>“What do I care?” He stabbed the Pudding again to prove that he definitely didn’t care. “Besides, he’s ‘Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived’ and all that nonsense. Of course he’d go to the House of the Foolhardy.”</p>
<p>Pansy smirked. “Okay, Draco.” There was a knowing glint in her eyes that he knew all too well, having known her since they were babies. He didn’t like it one bit.</p>
<p>“I mean it. The only difference it makes is that it would have been good publicity to have him in our house.” He wasn’t wrong, after all. The name of the Boy Who Lived was powerful, it was just too bad that he was an annoying, clueless idiot, who was currently stuffing his face with treacle tart.</p>
<p>“Sure. Anyway, what do you think’s up with the third floor?” She kept smiling for the rest of the feast, which Draco found personally offensive.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Dad says that mine’s a fellytone. It’s muggle technology,” Ron said proudly, looking at his ankle. He had been sorted into Gryffindor, to nobody’s surprise but his own.</p>
<p>“Maybe your soulmate’s a muggle,” suggested Dean, lounging across the windowsill. </p>
<p>Harry entered and sat on his bed. “What’s this about phones and muggles?”</p>
<p>“It’s my soulmark!” Ron grinned, showing him. </p>
<p>“So what’s everyone else got?” Dean said, sliding off the windowsill and landing with a thump on the floor. “I just have a painting, no surprise there.”</p>
<p>“I have a leaf,” said Neville, squinting in the dark. “I wonder what plant it’s from. It didn’t match anything in any muggle or magic books I found.”</p>
<p>“What about you, then Harry?” Ron said.</p>
<p>“That’s a thing? I thought I was the only one.”</p>
<p>“Nah, mate, it’s a wizard thing.” Seamus swung his leg over the side of the bed to show a tattoo of a red mushroom cloud. “And wizard’s soulmates, you get it when you’re two. Dad got in trouble once for having an illegal tattoo, police wouldn’t believe his parents when they said it just appeared. And Dean’s got it wrong. The mark shows your own personality. Ron just has a telephone because he’s as much as a nut for muggle technology as his dad, going by our conversations today.”</p>
<p>“Soulmarks are also how the government tracks muggleborns,” Ron added. “So, what’s yours?”</p>
<p>“Hang on.” Harry sat on his bed. His aunt and uncle always kept it covered with a bandage, saying that what was under it was “uglier than that horrible scar.” Still, he’d had a look sometimes, in the darkness and safety of his cupboard. He’d gotten a proper look after being moved to Dudley’s old room, and now he knew what to expect when he took the bandage off. The other Gryffindors raised an eyebrow and glanced at each other.</p>
<p>Harry’s soulmark was the caduceus, except the winged staff was replaced with a wand. The two snakes which curled around it were different colours – one red, the other a faded grey. All soulmarks shone, but Harry’s seemed to be even brighter in the dark. Nobody said a word, unsure of how they should feel about snakes on the ankle of The Boy Who Lived. Then, Ron spoke up.</p>
<p>“Of course Harry gets the coolest soulmark,” he rolled his eyes, “whoever his soulmate is, they’re going to hate him for putting bloody snakes on their skin.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Snakes are Slytherins, and a symbol of—”</p>
<p>“When you first make skin contact with your soulmate,” Dean intervened, “Their soulmark appears randomly on your skin, faintly at first. Never on the face though, that hardly ever happens. Also, any ink on your skin will be transferred to theirs. It’s a way to help soulmates find each other. See, Seamus, I do know these things.” He threw a pillow at Seamus, who dodged and stuck out his tongue.</p>
<p>“How come it’s faint at first?”</p>
<p>“As two soulmates fall in love, the soulmarks become brighter and vivid, until they glow with the same brightness as the wizard’s own mark. In the rare case that two soulmates fall in love before touching, the mark will appear just as bright when it first appears. The presence of a mark is merely a sign of compatibility, and it is possible to live a good life with someone other than one’s soulmate, or indeed, alone. However, there are other ways in which it is beneficial to find one’s soulmate.” Neville quoted. He looked as everyone’s faces turned towards him. “What? Gran made me learn as much as I could about magic before school, I learned some of this by wrote.”</p>
<p>“Right. Well, yeah, that’s pretty much it. It’s basically an ink-based link between soulmates which allowed you to write to them once you’ve made contact.” Seamus summed up. “How come your Gran made you learn all this by heart? It only came up as a matter of interest with my family.”</p>
<p>And so, the conversation turned from soulmarks to families. Harry lay back on his bed, choosing not to take part in the conversation. Ignoring the sympathetic glances from Neville and Dean, he closed his eyes. It made a lot of sense, he thought, that the Dursleys had tried to hide the mark from him. A scar could be explained away. Such a complex tattoo was less simple. He was surprised they hadn’t just cut his leg off, although that would have looked altogether too suspicious. Besides, not even the Dursleys would cut a two-year old’s leg off.</p>
<p>He wondered where his soulmate was, what she was doing. As he lay there, letting conversation wash over him, he felt a spike of adrenaline course through his veins. A month ago, he hadn’t even known that magic existed. Now, he was lying in a magic castle, breathing magic air and listening to magic kids talk about their magic families. It felt like a dream, and he soon drifted off into real dreams, ignoring the small pit of anticipation that had settled at the bottom of his stomach.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Draco lounged on his bed, his plain black robes folded neatly on the chair next to him. He had taken the bed nearest the window, which showed a view of the mountains. Being in the dungeons, there was no real view of the Hogwarts grounds, and Blaise had managed to get their window stuck on mountains. It wasn’t too bad, really. Rather cold, though.</p>
<p>“Finally at Hogwarts, then!” Pansy waltzed into the dorm, causing a half-naked Blaise to scream and hide behind his bed opposite Draco’s. She rolled her eyes. “It’s only me. I’ve seen you shirtless before, and I can’t say I was that impressed.” He stuck his tongue out at her as she fell into the green velvet chair next to Draco’s bed. He raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“How the hell did you get in here? Blaise tried to get into the girl’s dorms earlier and they threw him right out.”</p>
<p>“The girls’ dorms are charmed,” she said, “boys can’t get in. Didn’t you pay any attention to what your parents told you?”</p>
<p>“I daresay my father was too busy trying to convince me that muggles are scum, and my mother the opposite, to teach me that the girls’ dorm doesn’t let in boys,” he drawled.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t the boys’ dorms charmed as well?” said Blaise bitterly, emerging with a dressing gown. “We need protection against you, specifically.”</p>
<p>Pansy smirked. “Whatever could you mean? I’m just an innocent little girl.” Blaise threw a pillow at her as she laughed. “Both dorms are charmed. They let me in because I’m not interested in boys.” She wrinkled up her nose. </p>
<p>“Well that’s just rude,” Blaise pouted. Draco snorted from behind his potions book. “Why are you laughing? What if our soulmate’s a girl? How are we supposed to find her if we can’t go to the girls’ dorm?”</p>
<p>“I do hope you’re not implying that you planned to touch girls in their sleep until one of their soulmarks appeared on your skin,” said Pansy. “If that’s the case, then I thank Merlin that I slapped you when we were five. My skin is pure.” She caught another pillow and threw it back with deadly accuracy, only for Blaise to throw it back and miss, hitting Draco in the head. He gasped and dropped his book, raising a tentative hand to his hair, which now looked as bad as Potter’s. Pansy giggled.</p>
<p>“You’re so dead!” He shouted, jumping at Blaise with a pillow in his hands. Blaise and Pansy grabbed pillows to arm themselves. Vince and Greg watched on as their beds soon became bare, shrugged, and headed down to the Common Room to read.</p>
