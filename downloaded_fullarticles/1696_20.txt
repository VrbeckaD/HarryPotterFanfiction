    <p>He was two when he first one appeared. Playing innocently on the carpet in their home, with his older brother keeping eye on him. Theseus was in the middle of reading book about Hogwarts history, when his little brother fell almost lifeless onto the floor. ‘Mommy! Dad! Newton! Something’s wrong!’ he kneeled next to tiny baby and picked him up, looking around for his parents. Vivian Scamander ran into the room, her blonde hair pinned up and eyes filled with terror.</p><p> </p><p>‘Florian! Oh my baby! Florian!’ she took Newt from Theseus and cradled him to her chest. Florian Scamander appeared with wand in his hand, ready to attack. ‘Newton’ he whispered and fell onto his knees next to his wife and sons. They scanned little body for injuries, but nothing came out. Not until Theseus noticed that his little brother had weird marks on his neck. ‘Mommy, why Newt has this thing?’ Curious blue eyes were focused on Newt's neck. Vivian turned her younger one's head and gasped in surprise. </p><p> </p><p>Florian had similar reaction to his wife, but he already started to wake his son. ‘Must be shock. His mate has to be older, maybe even adult. Magic bond was so strong that it drained him.’ Vivian frowned and kissed her son's forehead, stroking his curls. ‘He's so small, how powerful his soulmate truly is and what happened to them?’</p><p> </p><p>Theseus watched his family and felt sudden overwhelming need of protecting his little brother from everything that would come across. And he swore that he would, even if that meant he would have to betray himself. ‘Theseus, darling. It's not your fault, sweetie it's amazing! Newton has someone who was born just for him, who is his perfect match.’ Vivian made her older son sit down next to them and smiled. ‘You'll meet your match when your magic will decide that it's a good time.’ She smiled brightly when Newt opened his eyes and gasped, seeing as his eyes changed color to green instead of hazel. </p><p> </p><p>‘Blue eyes, wizards and witches with blue eyes are born to do incredible things, sometimes wrong, but still incredible.’ Florian said, seeing his younger son look at them curiously. ‘You'll be happy Newton, I can feel it.’</p>
