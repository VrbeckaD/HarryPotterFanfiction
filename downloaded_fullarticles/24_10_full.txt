              <p>Where September marked the start of a new year at Hogwarts, June marks the end of one. Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, seen through the point of view of family and friends and sometimes themselves, navigate their final months at Hogwarts over their seven years of school and beyond. A sequel/companion piece to Better September.</p>

    <blockquote class="userstuff">
      <p>I had this idea a little while ago after I finished Better September and now it's finally happening! I picked a month, and then I started writing. I've changed up some of the characters who we follow each chapter, focused on different aspects of their lives and different things that Scorpius and Albus face, but the essence of the story is the same.</p><p>Much like Better September, this one will be EIGHT chapters and they'll be posted twice a week – I'm aiming for Wednesday and Sunday this time around (but Chapter 2 might be delayed until Monday since I don't land back home on Sunday after seeing CC until late). It's not necessary to have read Better September before reading this one but if you want a bit more of the backstory for their September, it will likely make the story better for you in the long run!</p><p>We're starting off the first chapter with a POV I didn't explore in Better September but one I've been dying to write – Astoria Malfoy. I have so much love for her and this chapter and her potential as a character so I really hope I did her justice in this first chapter! </p><p>Most of all, thank you very much for reading and I hope you're excited to see June over the years!</p>

  <strong> <em>Friday, 1 June 2018.</em> </strong>
</p><p>It was a strange, yet good, feeling, the one that in under a month Scorpius Malfoy would be living under her roof for the rest of the summer, back from Hogwarts <em> and </em>an entire year older. Astoria Malfoy had missed seeing her son every day, and she’d taken comfort in the fact that she still had Draco by her side and that soon enough, her boy would be home.</p><p>Draco was already in the drawing room, a cup of tea sitting beside him on the table and The Daily Prophet opened up in front of him, when Astoria entered. He was scowling at something on the page and Astoria had an inkling of an idea of what it was about. He never particularly liked or trusted the media, and that hadn’t changed, especially now that they had a son. He was more protective than ever, and he’d been trying to shield Astoria from the rumours for years, though some of them had managed to slip through the cracks, much to his dismay. He couldn’t keep everything from her.</p><p>Astoria took a seat on the sofa next to him, eyes scanning the paper, though he was holding it in such a way that she couldn’t properly read the words on it anyway – the sun from the large glass doors on the side of the house that led out into the garden was hitting the paper in exactly the right spot. Instead, she decided to watch him… for as long as he’d let her, anyway. He didn’t like being looked at, and he made exceptions sometimes, but still.</p><p>To her, and to many others, she suspected, Draco Malfoy had always been a particularly attractive wizard. When they had started dating she had often wondered how someone as handsome as him would want to date someone as plain as her. But Draco saw her as anything other than plain, and Astoria realised soon after that he was much more than handsome – he was smart, incredibly intelligent, loving, caring and most of all, exactly the man she had hoped he was when she’d started falling. They were each others entire world, until Scorpius came along. And then they shared the title.</p><p>As she watched him, she noticed the way his grey eyes flickered across the words, as if they weren’t <em> really </em>taking everything in. How his eyebrows would knot together ever so slightly when he read something he didn’t particularly like, how he’d purse his lips at the same time. It was endearing to her.</p><p>It wasn’t long after she’d begun to watch him, however, that he glanced away from the newspaper and at her, his previously unimpressed look turning into one of amusement, lips turning up into a smile and eyes lighting up with happiness as he looked at his wife, illuminated by the early morning sun. </p><p>“Are you all right there, staring?” He quirked an eyebrow.</p><p>Her smile grew and she nodded. “Perfectly.”</p><p>Carefully, he folded up the newspaper and threw it haphazardly on the coffee table in front of him, and Astoria shuffled closer to him so that she could lean against his side. He wrapped an arm around her shoulders as she did. </p><p>“We get our son back this month,” she spoke softly. “<em>And </em>it’s your birthday.”</p><p>He hummed. “We get him back for a little while.”</p><p>Astoria frowned and sat up. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>With a sigh, Draco rubbed his forehead. “I always dreaded coming home when the Hogwarts school year ended. Especially in those last few years. Because it meant spending the whole summer with my father, spending the whole time being groomed to become a Death Eater. I had friends at school, though I would never really call them that, but I never once saw anyone in any sort of friendly way throughout the summer,” he explained. “I would spend my summer waiting to go back to Hogwarts, hoping that my year would be better. Being jealous of Harry Potter… it got tiring quickly, but it was better than being at home. Anything was better than that.”</p><p>She turned to face him properly, propping one arm up on the back of the couch and resting her head on her hand. It hurt her to hear things like that from him, and the fact that it was something that clearly still bothered him to this day didn’t escape her notice.</p><p>“I have a feeling, that’s all. That soon enough, Scorpius will feel the same way about coming home – that he’ll dread coming home for the summer, but not for the same reasons as me,” he continued. “For the reason that his best friend isn’t here, he’s elsewhere.”</p><p>Her frown deepened as she moved a hand to stroke the back of Draco’s head – he hadn’t done anything with his hair yet this morning, and it was still out and long, perfect for Astoria to run her fingers through in an attempt to comfort him. </p><p>“Sweetheart,” she started softly. “Scorpius has a good home to come home to. He has us, and he loves us. He could never dread coming home to that. He’s excited to come home. He said so in his last letter. You read it yourself.”</p><p>Draco met his eyes. “But do you think he meant it?”</p><p>“Have you ever known our son to be a liar?”</p><p>He sighed and shook his head. </p><p>“Because he <em> isn’t, </em> Draco,” Astoria continued. “And it doesn’t matter, anyway, because Albus Potter will be visiting us during the summer. I’ve made my mind up on that fact already. I made it up on the day we got that letter declaring their friendship in September. He won’t have to dread coming home because he’ll have Albus visiting to look forward to <em> and </em>he’ll have spending time with his wonderful father to look forward to as well.”</p><p>She watched him as he took in her words and couldn’t help but notice the look on his face at the suggestion of Albus coming to stay over at their house during the summer, but Astoria was insistent.</p><p>“Does he have to come <em> here </em>? Can’t they go elsewhere?”</p><p>Astoria glared at him. “He’s coming here, Draco,” she said, rather forcefully. “You were lonely as a child. You didn’t see friends over the summer. I don’t want him to feel lonely and trapped here, away from his friend, just because you don’t like his friend’s father. He deserves better than that, Draco. I know you know that.”</p><p>She could see his disapproval crumbling when he looked at her, and it was hard not to smile at the simple fact that he crumbled so easily when she was so insistent. He shook his head and chuckled softly before pulling her closer for a kiss. </p><p>“You’ve got me wrapped around your finger, you know that?” He hummed.</p><p>“Oh, I know.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <em>Sunday, 3 June 2018. </em> </strong>
</p><p>Astoria thanked the woman who held the door open in front of her as she stepped into the coffee shop and out of the slightly warm June air. It wasn’t summer yet, but it was clear that it was creeping up quickly and Astoria regretted wearing a coat out of the house, even though she did get strangely cold in the hot weather sometimes.</p><p>She’d told Draco that she was meeting up with an old school friend to catch up and he had believed her. He’d seemed happy that she was getting out of the house, figured it was a sort of sign that she might be getting better, that her illness wasn’t getting the better of her, though she wasn’t so sure. She was known to fight through that sort of stuff. Still, she’d kept up the pretense to keep him hopeful and stop his worrying.</p><p>In the future, she would tell him what she was really doing.</p><p>Her smile grew as she spotted the familiar red hair of her friend in the corner of the coffee shop – they often chose to meet up at Muggle establishments simply because they were less likely to be spied on by nosy wizards there. </p><p>She shrugged off her coat as she reached the chair and Ginny Potter looked up at her, a smile on her face despite her slightly late arrival. Astoria had never imagined being able to call Ginny her friend. She’d seen her around at school and been in complete awe of the wonderful witch she was becoming, but friends had been out of the question. She, a Greengrass, could not befriend a Weasley, no matter how much she wanted to. She had their sons to thank for that development in their friendship, though. She had their sons to thank for a lot.</p><p>Hanging her coat on the back of her chair, Astoria took the seat opposite her.</p><p>“I’m sorry I’m late,” she explained. “I slept in a little this morning.”</p><p>Ginny waved her hand. “No need to apologise. I had to drop off Lily with mum anyway. If you were five minutes earlier <em> I </em>would have been the late one,” she admitted. “I ordered your usual. Is that all right?”</p><p>“Oh, that’s perfect,” Astoria thanked her gratefully.</p><p>This wasn’t the first time that the two women had met up. They’d started writing letters to each other not long after Albus and Scorpius had met on the Hogwarts Express, and their coffee dates had started a few weeks before Christmas. They tended to have them every few weeks, just to catch up on each others lives and to talk, mostly, about their sons. If Harry and Draco weren’t going to get over their differences and do it, then why shouldn’t they do it instead?</p><p>“I’m going to miss these over the summer,” Astoria admitted. “But I <em> was </em>just telling Draco the other day that I’m going to invite Albus over to spend time with Scorpius at our house this summer – if that’s alright with you, of course. I’m sure we can sneak in a catch up every now and then with those.”</p><p>Ginny nodded. “Absolutely. Albus would love that,” she agreed. “It’ll take Harry a little bit of getting used to, but I'll try to persuade him that it’s a good idea.” She flashed Astoria a grin.</p><p>They had decided early on that they wouldn’t meet up in the summer when all the kids were home, simply because there would be too many questions. James and Albus would likely be keeping Ginny busy, and Astoria intended to spend as much of the summer as she could with Scorpius, just on the chance her illness crept up on her. </p><p>She didn’t like to think about that, though.</p><p>“I bet you’re excited to have Scorpius home,” Ginny spoke, just as their drinks arrived. They both thanked the waitress and waited until she left to speak again.</p><p>“I am,” Astoria confirmed. “It’s quiet at home when Draco is at work, and the house feels bigger when it’s empty. I would say the same for you, but two boys coming home sounds like it’ll be a bit rowdier than my <em> one</em>.” She chuckled at the thought. </p><p>“It’ll certainly be a lot louder,” Ginny agreed with a laugh. “I’ve enjoyed these quieter few months with Lily. But even though James will be sure to cause as much chaos and noise as he can over the summer, it will be nice to have them both home. I think Lily is looking forward to seeing her brothers again. She doesn’t like being on her own very much.”</p><p>Astoria smiled at that. “You grew up in a large family too, so I suppose you passed that gene on. The gene of being absolutely surrounded by siblings and not having a quiet moment to yourself.”</p><p>“Oh, and brothers at that. In theory, it would have been nice to have given her a sister, but three is more than enough,” she explained. “We had our hands full with James.”</p><p>Astoria would have liked another child. Though she knew, even before she fell pregnant with Scorpius, that there would never be another. Just like she knew she would not grow old with Draco, no matter how much she wanted to. She could never give Scorpius a brother or a sister. And she knew she would always feel a little disappointed in herself and her curse for not being able to give him that.</p><p>But she could, luckily, live knowing that Draco would not be alone whenever she was gone, whenever that was. That would be a fact that would send her off content.</p><p>She liked hearing about Ginny’s family, though. While Astoria had never met the boys, nor had she met Lily, Ginny had shown her plenty of photos over the few months they’d been meeting up. Astoria had shared a few of Scorpius, too, but not too many. She found herself very protective of his childhood photos. </p><p>That, and if Draco found out she’d been sharing them around, even if it <em> was </em>only with Ginny, a woman she admired and trusted very much, he probably wouldn’t be thrilled.</p><p>Still, the coffee dates with Ginny made her happy. Sharing memories, sharing time with another woman – a <em> mother </em>who understood what she was feeling, and knowing that her Scorpius had a strong friendship with a boy that had a wonderful mother. It was everything to her, and she suspected it always would be.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <em>Tuesday, 5 June 2018.</em> </strong>
</p><p>Astoria entered Draco’s office with a letter addressed to him in one hand and a cupcake reading <em> Happy Birthday </em>in the other. It had been a long day and she’d barely seen her husband for a second of it – he’d been too busy reading over old files.</p><p>“I think it’s time you took a break, don’t you?” </p><p>He looked up from his desk and smiled as he saw her walking towards him.</p><p>“What’s that you’ve got there?” He inquired.</p><p>“Well, it <em> is </em> your birthday, and I made cupcakes.” She held the cupcake out to him and he chuckled as he took it from her. He wasn’t a very sweet-toothed person, but she knew he would eat it anyway. “<em>And </em>a letter arrived for you a few minutes ago. From Hogwarts.”</p><p>His eyes lit up even more as he took the letter.</p><p>“Will you be deathly offended if I open Scorpius’ letter before I eat your cake?” His lips quirked up into a smile as he looked at her, and she didn’t miss how he’d already turned the envelope over and started to fiddle with the seal. </p><p>She shook her head. “Read it, darling.”</p><p>He broke the seal, removed the letter from the envelope and started to read. Busying herself, Astoria moved to lean up against his desk and glanced down at the books and stacks of papers on his desk. </p><p>After a few moments, Draco smiled and folded up the letter, clearly happy and content with what their son had written. “Did you want to read it?” He held it up, and Astoria instantly shook her head.</p><p>“No, that’s yours. Whatever he wrote belongs to you.” </p><p>He seemed thankful at her words and stood up from the chair to press a kiss to her cheek. Then, he picked the cupcake up from the table. “How many of these have you already eaten downstairs, then?”</p><p>“Maybe… two.”</p><p>He snorted. “Of course you have… that means you owe me one more.”</p><p>And finally, for the first time all afternoon, Draco left his office, cupcake in one hand, holding Astoria’s hand with his other hand, and she led him down to the kitchen where the remaining cupcakes waited. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em> <strong>Thursday, 7 June 2018.</strong> </em>
</p><p>To Mum,</p><p>Hello! I’m <em> really </em>sorry that I haven’t written much lately. I feel really, really bad about it but I’ve been trying to study in all of my free time because I don’t want to fail my exams. I would feel really bad if I did fail them. But I’m giving up some time to study for Charms now to tell you that I am all right and that Hogwarts is doing really well. </p><p>I’m really enjoying all of my lessons and I can’t believe my first year is almost over.</p><p>There is one thing, though. But I don’t know how to really say it without sounding mean. Essentially, I am worried that Albus thinks I care more about my exams than I care about our friendship. And I <em> do </em>care about my exams a bit more. But I still care about Albus, too. And I’ve been sacrificing some of our friendship time to study but I don’t want him to feel bad. </p><p>This is a dilemma I’ve been worrying about for a little while now.</p><p>If you have any advice, mum, I would really like to hear it.</p><p>Love Scorpius.</p><p> </p><p>P.S. I really hope dad liked the letter I sent him and that he had a good birthday.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Scorpius,</p><p>Hello sweetheart. It’s lovely to hear from you. I’m glad you’re focusing on your studies but it’s nice to get a letter from you. I hope you’re studying hard and I feel certain you will pass your exams with flying colours.</p><p>Now, about this dilemma – don’t tell your father this, but I talked a little to Ginny Potter, Albus’ mum, about this, and she told me that you don’t need to worry. Albus wouldn’t think that. She said that Albus is just as worried about his exams as you are and that he doesn’t want to fail them and let his father down.</p><p>My suggestion would be that the two of you find some time to study together. That way, you can still talk to each other and be in each others company while also studying and getting ready for your exams together.</p><p>Let me know how that goes if you try it, sweetheart.</p><p>Your father and I are looking forward to seeing you again very soon.</p><p>Love Mum xx</p><p> </p><p>P.S. Your father loved the letter and had a good birthday. I baked cupcakes. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em> <strong>Monday, 11 June 2018.</strong> </em>
</p><p>Mum,</p><p>I’ve been feeling a bit homesick since your last letter so I pulled out all of your letters from the whole year and have been reading them before bed for the past few nights. It’s made me think a bit.</p><p>You said in your last letter that Ginny said Albus doesn’t want to let his father down.</p><p>Mum, I really don’t want to let my father down either. What happens if I come home and I fail my exams and he’s really disappointed with me?</p><p>Love Scorpius.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em> <strong>Thursday, 14 June 2018.</strong> </em>
</p><p>Draco placed the now clean dishes from dinner back into the cupboard and turned to look at Astoria, leant up against the kitchen island and sipping on a glass of water. They’d gotten used to cooking for two – it was going to be strange to have to get used to cooking for three when Scorpius returned home. For the first few weeks, they’d always ended up with leftovers the next day.</p><p>“Would you mind if we went and had a talk in the drawing room?” Astoria spoke suddenly. He looked a little surprised, which she’d intended. She knew that it was going to come as a surprise, what she was going to say to him, and while she didn’t want to break Scorpius’ trust, Draco needed to know how Scorpius was feeling. He was, after all, only eleven. </p><p>And if he was afraid of his father… Astoria didn’t like to think of that.</p><p>Draco nodded slowly and let her lead, following just beside her. He took a seat next to her on the sofa and looked at her, ready to listen to whatever she had to say. She took another sip of her water before speaking.</p><p>“When Scorpius gets home, no matter how he thinks he went in his exams or how well he actually did, don’t be too hard on him, and absolutely <em> don’t </em>ridicule him for being friends with a Potter. The time for being mad about that has passed.”</p><p>She watched as Draco furrowed his eyebrows and stared at her, clearly confused.</p><p>“I got a letter from Scorpius on Monday,” she continued to explain, deciding to break it to Draco as softly as she could. “He’s worried about letting you down if he doesn’t do well in his exams. He doesn’t want to come home and have you disappointed with him.”</p><p>Draco was lost for words and Astoria could see it. She watched him carefully as he took in her words and as he leant back on the couch and stared down at his hands. He shook his head in what she assumed was shock or disbelief, or a mix of both.</p><p>“Where has this come from?” He spoke, voice free of malice though not free of worry.</p><p>Astoria shrugged a shoulder. “I think that Albus feels the same about not wanting to disappoint his father. That’s probably something that Scorpius has started to feel, too, and understandably. Being the son of a Malfoy isn’t an easy job. You know that more than anyone.”</p><p>He let out a deep, shuddering breath and ran a hand through his hair – he’d taken it out of the ponytail when he’d gotten home from the Ministry a few hours ago. She could see that there were a million things running through his mind, though he wasn’t speaking about any of it. He was bottling it up. But she could read him better than he thought she could. Frowning, she shuffled towards him.</p><p>“Tell me what you’re thinking.”</p><p>“I don’t even <em> know </em> what I’m thinking,” he breathed harshly. “It feels like I’m a teenager again, a teenager who was so afraid of disappointing his parents and didn’t want to let them down for fear of something terrible happening. I felt the <em> exact </em>same way in my first year, and that faded over time but…” He squeezed his eyes shut and covered his face with his hands.</p><p>As soon as Astoria heard a noise that sounded vaguely like a sob, she jumped into action, wrapping her arms around him. He didn’t hesitate to hug her back, holding her close and burying his head in her shoulder. She wasn’t sure if he was crying or if he was just on the verge, trying to stop himself, perhaps, from shattering completely, but she held him anyway, not planning on letting go until he was ready.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <em> <strong>Tuesday, 19 June 2018.</strong> </em>
</p><p>Mum,</p><p>Hello! Exams started yesterday and I think they’re going really well so far. I haven’t been stumped by too many of the questions and I’ve left them all feeling really positive every time so far, so I’m hoping that means they’re going well and I’m not just secretly terrible at all of my subjects. I don’t know how Albus is doing, though. He won’t talk about how he’s doing and he seems to be a little unsure both before and after we sit them.</p><p>Maybe that’s something based on him not wanting to disappoint his dad.</p><p>I talked to him about that, about how I didn’t want to let my dad down, too. He seemed to appreciate that comfort so I’m hoping that he will talk to me about them when exams are finally finished.</p><p>I will write again soon. I hope things are going well at home.</p><p>Love Scorpius.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Scorpius,</p><p>I’m glad to hear your exams are going well. Your father is glad to hear it, too. I’m sure that Albus will talk about his exams when he’s ready, sweetheart. Until then, just keep making sure you’re there for him like I’m sure you already are. But make sure you’re giving your exams your all, too. I’m sure you’re acing them.</p><p>We’ll see you on Saturday.</p><p>Love Mum xx</p><p> </p><hr/><p>

  <em> <strong>Wednesday, 20 June 2018.</strong> </em>
</p><p>Astoria was moments away from switching off the bedroom lights with her wand when Draco, sitting beside her in bed, a book sitting closed on his lap, began to speak. It had nearly been a week since she told him about Scorpius’ letter and he seemed to still be dealing with what he’d heard. Astoria understood that, though Draco was stronger than he thought he was and as soon as Scorpius was home and things went back to normal, Draco would surely know that – she hoped, anyway. </p><p>“Sometimes I really wish things had never changed,” Draco spoke softly, as if he was worried that someone would overhear him even though Astoria was the only other person in the house. He spoke to her and her alone. “That we could have stayed in our own little family.”</p><p>She smiled sadly and reached across the sheets to take his hand in hers and give it a squeeze. “I feel the same way sometimes. When Scorpius first got on that train in September, I felt that way for weeks. And when he told us about the bullying.”</p><p>Draco looked up and met her eyes. “How did you deal with it? I never asked.”</p><p>“I thought about how happy he is,” she said simply. “Remember when he’d check the Daily Prophet every day at breakfast and let out this <em> massive </em>sigh of relief when the first page wasn’t announcing the destruction of Hogwarts? How happy he got when his letter came? How full of joy he was on the night before he left?”</p><p>He nodded, listening deeply.</p><p>“I think about that. About how he’s wanted to go to Hogwarts his <em> entire </em>life. How he’s wanted to make friends and learn everything he can about magic. And now he’s doing that. Now that’s he’s spending every day – at Hogwarts, the place he’s dreamed about his whole life, with his best friend, learning the magic he’s studied since he was a boy.”</p><p>Slowly, Draco started to smile. “That’s a nice way to look at it.”</p><p>She squeezed his hand again. “It is,” she agreed. “I could never regret him finding that happiness, no matter how much I sometimes miss what used to be. And if things had stayed the same, if we tried to make them that way again, it wouldn’t be for Scorpius. It would be for us. Things were always bound to change at some point, darling. And we’re going to have to change with them.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em> <strong>Friday, 22 June 2018.</strong> </em>
</p><p>Mum,</p><p>Hello! Exams are finished. We finished our last one this morning and I am exhausted. I hope I’ve done enough to pass them. Albus seems to think that I have done enough and I told him that he’s done enough, too, but I don’t think he believed me. I think he will when our results come in. I’m excited and nervous for mine and I hope that he’ll trust me enough to tell me if he did okay. </p><p>I’m really excited to be coming home tomorrow, but I will miss Hogwarts.</p><p>I will miss Albus, too. If it isn’t too much trouble, do you think that Albus could come over and stay for a bit during the summer? I think he’d really enjoy that, and that way he’ll get to see you and dad and I’d love for him to meet you.</p><p>Let me know, please, if you can.</p><p>Love Scorpius. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Dear Scorpius,</p><p>I’m glad to hear your exams are over and you’re confident in how you went. Your father and I are eagerly awaiting to hear your results, whatever they may be. We’re also very excited to see you again tomorrow. It’s been a long while without you and we’ll both be at Platform 9 ¾ to greet you. </p><p>I’ve already spoken to your father about Albus coming and staying over the summer and he certainly will be offered an invitation. I would love to meet him, too.</p><p>We’ll see you tomorrow, sweetheart.</p><p>Lots of love, Mum xx</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em> <strong>Saturday, 23 June 2018.</strong> </em>
</p><p>As they walked through King’s Cross Station, Draco protectively wrapped an arm around Astoria, despite the summer heat coursing through the station. It was clearly making many of the travellers antsy and Astoria could understand Draco’s worry – technically he didn’t even want her out of the house in such heat. He’d been keeping up with the Muggle news and a heatwave had been declared the day before, and he’d spoken to her the night before about his hesitance. That, and there were too many eyes, he said. </p><p>Still, she persisted and Draco had eventually been forced to relent and allow her to join him. She’d promised Scorpius that she would be there to greet him and she intended to follow through, even though she <em> was </em>feeling a little under the weather.</p><p>Draco need not know that, though.</p><p>Platform 9 ¾ was bustling with people when they crossed through the barrier. The train was nowhere in sight but the excitement was clear. Parents and siblings were everywhere, eagerly awaiting the return of the students, and Astoria couldn’t help but smile at the feeling and the fact that she was one of those very parents.</p><p>They walked to the opposite end of the platform to find a spare space that wasn’t so crowded. As they walked, Astoria spotted a flash of red hair and looked to see Ginny Potter alongside her husband, Harry, and her daughter, Lily. She’d entirely forgotten that they would obviously be at the station, too. Upon seeing Ginny, Astoria’s smile grew, and Ginny responded with a smile of her own. Though their smiles were discreet and subtle, there were many unspoken words shared between the two of them.</p><p>Briefly, Astoria imagined a day where she and Ginny could speak freely while waiting for their sons to arrive back home. A day where Draco and Harry would talk without argument. A day where they could all just <em> be </em>together. </p><p>She noticed Lily looking between the two of them and instinctively gave Lily a small wave. The smile on the younger girls face at the small action from Astoria was, perhaps, the sweetest thing she’d seen all morning. </p><p>“What are you smiling about?” Draco raised an eyebrow as they stopped walking.</p><p>“I’m just excited to finally have him home,” Astoria replied. Not <em> entirely </em>a lie, but not entirely the truth either. “Did you see Harry Potter and his family back there?”</p><p>Draco gave her a strange look and shook his head. “Regretfully.”</p><p>“<em>Draco,</em>” she chastised. “Your son is best friends with his son. You’re going to have to learn to live with each other at some point, you know? You can’t resent him forever.”</p><p>His smile turned into a smirk. “Is that a challenge?”</p><p>Before she could reply, the Hogwarts Express began to pull up to the platform and all conversation was forgotten by the both of them. Their son was on that train, and soon he would be back in their arms.</p><p>It was a few minutes before the train fully pulled up and students actually began stepping off the train, and as Astoria watched them running to their families or hugging goodbye to their friends, she was hit with a rush of memories from her time at Hogwarts in this very spot. Some of her favourite memories had come when her family had greeted her and Daphne as they got home for the summer, yet some of her other favourites had been when she and Daphne had left to go back to Hogwarts – the place she called her second home. She felt glad that her son now had a place to call his.</p><p>Scorpius saw them before they saw him and ran towards them almost immediately, barrelling fast and <em> hard </em>into Astoria and wrapping his arms tightly around her. She laughed as she hugged him back. Draco had a hand on her back to steady her.</p><p>“Easy there, son. Try not to bowl your mother over.” There was a hint of amusement in his town, but mostly concern – he knew how frail she was, and the last thing he wanted was her getting hurt on Platform 9 ¾ in the middle of a heatwave of all things. He did understand Scorpius’ excitement to see her, though. He often felt the same.</p><p>She rubbed his back softly as she held him. It had been too long.</p><p>“Hello, sweetheart,” she hummed.</p><p>She didn’t think she could remember a time where she’d been this happy all year.</p><p>He pulled away eventually and looked up at her. There were tears in his eyes and she felt her heart crumble and instantly wanted to pull him back into another hug and never let him go. But she’d save that other hug for later.</p><p>“I’m glad to see you, I’ve missed you. We both have,” she spoke truthfully, looking between Scorpius and Draco. They really were the mirror image of each other, though Scorpius had a softer side more visible than his fathers.</p><p>She watched, intrigued, as Scorpius stepped towards his father, and his hand twitched as if he were going to raise it for a handshake, but then it seemed Scorpius changed his mind and, much to both Astoria <em> and </em>Draco’s surprise, Scorpius hugged him, too.</p><p>“Hi Dad,” Scorpius murmured.</p><p>Draco smiled softly. “Hello, son.”</p><p>Smiling brighter than she’d ever seen him smile before, Scorpius stepped back away from them both and then glanced over to the side. “Can I introduce you to Albus? He really wants to meet you.”</p><p>Astoria nodded before Draco could protest and then Scorpius was grabbing her hand and tugging her away towards Albus without hesitation. Draco followed them, clearly a little wary. Though Astoria <em> was </em>grateful that he was at least coming with them.</p><p>When Scorpius stopped, Astoria found herself standing next to Ginny once more. They shared another smile before Scorpius began to speak. Next to him was a boy just a little shorter than him, with dark hair just like his father and the same bright brown eyes as his mother. <em> Albus. </em></p><p>“Mum, Dad,” Scorpius started, worry evident in his voice, “this is Albus.”</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Astoria was the first to greet him. She held out a hand and Albus took it and shook it, though she didn’t miss how he trembled a little as he did.</p><p>“It’s a pleasure to finally meet you, Albus. I’ve heard lots about you. Scorpius thinks of you very highly.” Albus turned to look at Scorpius and the two boys shared a smile. “I hope you didn’t mind the letter I sent you last September.”</p><p>He shook his head. “It was a surprise, but it was really nice. And it’s good to meet you, too. Scorpius talks about you <em> all </em> the time. Like… <em> all </em>the time.”</p><p>Scorpius froze. “<em>Albus!</em>”</p><p>Astoria smiled. “Well, that’s lovely to hear.”</p><p>There was a clear moment of hesitance in Albus before he extended a hand towards Draco. He ought to have heard a lot about Draco from his father, though the young boys they’d been then were far from the men they’d bloomed into, and she was glad to see Draco accept the handshake. </p><p>Ginny, still beside her, subtly nudged her arm and smiled warmly at her. Finally, after all this time, their families were meeting. They wouldn’t be meeting up for a friendly lunch any time soon, but they were, at least, meeting in some way. Astoria finally got to see the children Ginny talked about so lovingly, and Ginny got to finally meet Scorpius.</p><p>It was a lovely, full circle moment for them both.</p><p>The one thing that was better than all of that, though, was the contagious smile on Scorpius’ face. She’d never witnessed happiness of this level from him before, even though he had always been a rather happy and outgoing child. She’d never seen him around Albus before, so she supposed that was where all of this happiness was coming from. Draco, beside her, seemed just as in awe of the happiness on their son’s face as she was. She reached down and took one of his hands in hers and gave it a squeeze.</p><p>They’d definitely be discussing this moment later.</p><p>“If it would be all right with you,” Astoria looked between Harry and Ginny, “I’d like to formally offer an invitation for Albus to come and visit Scorpius at our home this summer.”</p><p>Scorpius’ face lit up even more, if that was even possible.</p><p>“Really?” Albus breathed, clearly a little surprised.</p><p>It was Ginny who replied, trying to hide her smile as she did. “What do you think, Albus? Your dad and I are okay with that.”</p><p>Albus shook his head, a little bewildered, and then nodded. “That’d be really nice, thank you, Mrs. Malfoy, Mr. Malfoy,” he looked between the both of them. </p><p>She smiled. “Just call me Astoria.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em> <strong>Wednesday, 27 June 2018.</strong> </em>
</p><p>Draco pressed a kiss to the top of Astoria’s head and affectionately ruffled up Scorpius’ blond mop before he left the bedroom and headed off to the Ministry. It had been a few days now since Scorpius had gotten home and Astoria and Draco had been surprised at how quickly they got used to having their son back around the house.</p><p>Sometimes, it was like he was never even gone at all.</p><p>This particular morning, Scorpius had surprised them both by creeping into their bed in the early hours of the morning and falling asleep between the both of them – something he hadn’t done since he was <em> very </em>young and something Astoria had missed immensely and assumed he would never do again, since he was growing so fast.</p><p>Much to her joy, Draco had taken the moment in stride. And even though he had a meeting at the Ministry, he’d made them all breakfast and delivered several books to the both of them before he did. When he left, Astoria and Scorpius stayed wrapped up in blankets with the remnants of breakfast sat in front of them, both itching to get into the books in front of them.</p><p>She’d missed moments like this with her son most of all.</p><p>“Did you mind me coming into bed with you and dad this morning? Did dad mind?”</p><p>Astoria shook her head. “Absolutely not,” she assured him. “You haven’t done that since you were little. You surprised the both of us, but it was a <em> lovely </em>way to wake up, sweetheart. We thought you were way too old for that.”</p><p>He shrugged a shoulder. “I missed you, and I’ll <em> never </em>be too old for hugs.”</p><p>“I’m glad to hear that.”</p><p>“Being home is… oh, it’s <em> so </em> weird,” he laughed. “Hogwarts is very different. But it’s just like you and dad said it was going to be… no, it’s <em> better, </em>actually. The castle is so big, and the classes are so interesting and the Professors are all so smart…”</p><p>“It’s better?” Astoria was surprised a little. She knew what Hogwarts could be like sometimes, and she wasn’t ignorant to the fact that there had been bouts of bullying, particularly at the very start of the year. Scorpius had chosen not to focus on that fact in his letters, but she knew that the bullying was still happening. She knew he was enjoying Hogwarts despite it, but the discovery that it was <em> better </em>than the stories? It was a pleasant, yet confusing, surprise. </p><p>Yet, Scorpius furiously nodded. “It’s <em> better, </em> ” he assured her. “You know… when I first got on that train and I saw everyone whispering – and they <em> were </em>whispering – I thought that I might get there and hate it after all. But then Albus walked into my compartment, and he found out about the rumour and he didn’t run away, scared. He sat there, and he shared some of my sweets and when we got to Hogwarts, he stayed with me then, too.”</p><p>The sense of wonder in his voice was one Astoria hoped would never leave.</p><p>“Was Hogwarts like that for you?” </p><p>Regretfully, she shook her head. “It wasn’t. I was the younger sister of the famous Greengrass family, and everyone <em> loved </em>Daphne. And I always felt a little pushed to the sidelines because of that. But I learnt not to mind. I learnt to live on the sidelines,” she shrugged. “I had some friends. But none that were as great as Albus is to you. I barely even knew your father that well. It was your Aunt Daphne who spoke to him more often since she was his age.” </p><p>“But he married you.”</p><p>Her heart fluttered. “He did.”</p><p>Scorpius met her eyes. “I don’t like hearing that Hogwarts wasn’t a very happy place for you. Do you feel bad hearing about how much I like it when you had trouble?”</p><p>“No, not at all, sweetheart,” she shook her head. “I <em> love </em> hearing about how much you like it there. It’s been your dream for <em> forever. </em>I want to hear about it all the time. These years… they’ll be the best years of your life. I can’t wait to hear all about them.”</p>
