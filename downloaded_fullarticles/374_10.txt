          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story starts near the Prewett household. Gideon has brought his boyfriend Edgar Bones over for dinner in order to meet his family.</p><p>They're currently standing just outside the house.</p><p>Gideon insisted, "Let's go."</p><p>Edgar muttered, "Wh-What if they don't like me, Gid?"</p><p>Gideon smirked. "Don't worry so much, they'll love you. Besides even if they don't, I'll make sure they're sorry."</p><p>Edgar said, "Ok, after you then."</p><p>Gideon led him into the house where they were greeted by his younger sister Molly.</p><p>Molly raised an eyebrow. "Hello, Giddy. Is this the famous Edgar then?"</p><p>Edgar turned scarlet, but Gideon merely grinned. "This is him, Mol. Edgar, this is my little sister Molly."</p><p>Molly gasped. "Little? I'm an adult!"</p><p>Gideon nodded and laughed. "Who still relies heavily on her parents."</p><p>Molly chose to ignore this and instead turned to Edgar asking, "How do you manage to put up with him?"</p><p>Edgar beamed, "It's not easy."</p><p>Gideon sighed. "Okay, that's enough of that. See you later, Molly."</p><p>He pulled Edgar along to the living room where his older brother Fabian was reading a book.</p><p>Edgar told him, "We can't interrupt a guy reading, Ed."</p><p>Gideon disagreed, "We can and will."</p><p>He tapped Fabian's shoulder.</p><p>Fabian scowled. "What is it, Gideon?"</p><p>Gideon breezily replied, "Oh, nothing. I just thought you might like to meet my boyfriend."</p><p>Fabian lowered his book and mumbled, "I didn't realise that was today."</p><p>Gideon responded, "Well, it is and here he is."</p><p>Fabian put his book down, held his hand out and smiled. "It's a pleasure to meet you, Edgar."</p><p>Edgar awkwardly shook his hand and muttered, "Likewise, Fabian."</p><p>Gideon sighed. "As nice as this has been, you still have my parents to meet. Come on, before dinner is ready."</p><p>He led Edgar towards the kitchen where his mother was keeping an eye on the vegetables chopping themselves and his father was watching the chicken cook.</p><p>Gideon cleared his throat.</p><p>Gideon's mother inquired, "Is that you home already, my dear Gideon?"</p><p>Gideon answered, "It is and with my special guest."</p><p>Gideon's parents stopped what they were both doing and turned around to face them.</p><p>Gideon's father said, "Ah, but of course. You must be our Gideon's Edgar?"</p><p>Edgar stated, "That's me."</p><p>Gideon's mother beamed, "Wonderful, you're just as handsome as he says you are."</p><p>This time Gideon turned as red as a tomato and groaned. "Mum!"</p><p>Edgar chuckled. "I'm glad you think so, Mrs Prewett."</p></div>
