    <p align="justify">                         </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">                    I ripped open the shower curtain, goosebumps instantly forming from the cold air hitting my skin. “Ack!” I screamed, “It’s freaking cold!” I scuttled to grab my towel and dried off. I got decent and triple checked my truck to make sure I had everything, I even packed some extra quills. For the past three years I've forgotten something, and I was not about to make that mistake again. I furrowed my eyebrows, "Shit," I said under my breath. " Mom! Have you seen my Quidditch gloves?!" She replied with a simple no as I scampered through my room to find them.Eventually I found them and tucked them away. Mother and I swung by Diagon Alley before making our depart for the platform. The streets were buzzing as we swayed in and out of the crowd. As we walked I noticed a few familiar red heads and made my way to greet them.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">"Oi! Red!" I called out. With that they all swiveled to look my way and I smiled. I jumped to hug them, " I missed you guys so much!"</p><p align="center">I broke from our group hug and turned to give Mrs. Weasley her own hug. "You're looking as beautiful as always, dear." I thanked her and she smiled, Then she turned to talk to my mother.</p><p align="center">" So," I poked, "What did you guys do this summer?"</p><p align="center">Gin sort of huffed, "You know, stayed home. Ron raved about Harry, and the twins... well they were the twins. Bill and Charlie we're home much, and Percy was huddled away per usual." She rolled her eyes and smiled.</p><p align="center">After their mention the twins grinned, " Yeah! Just pulled a few tricks or two-"</p><p align="center">"-Like charming a few of Ron's things," Fred started and George finished.</p><p align="center">I snorted, for a minute I could see a small grin on Ginny's face, but it soon faded. "You two.." I started but was cut off by Mrs. Weasley remembering that we needed to get to the platform. We split ways, and my mother and I walked on before going to the platform ourselves.</p><p> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">              I said my goodbyes to my mother, "Tell dad I said I love him! I really wish I'd gotten to see him before we left." I said with a sad smile. She obliged and I pushed my trolley through the pillar. I loaded my things onto the train then searched now the aisle for my "little" read-headed twins. They'd always been good buddies of mine. Being the muggle-born I am I've dealt with a bit of bullies in my time, particularly from those in Slytherin. The two of them had always been there through all of it, and they always knew how to get back at people when I truly needed it, after awhile they started to rub-off on me.</p><p align="justify">              Suddenly there was a familiar popping sound that jumped me out of my thoughts, soon after the twins come running from a compartment from the Slytherin section.</p><p align="center">"Run!" They said in unison and i quickly tailed behind, us slipping into an empty compartment before someone saw us. Minutes later a few <em>very </em>angry looking Slytherin's raced by our compartment and we settled. </p><p align="center">"What on Earth did you two do" I said between laughs, pinching the bridge of my nose. </p><p align="center">"Relax Short-Stuff, we were having some fun." </p><p align="center">We all ducked as the same very angry Slytherin's stormed by.</p><p align="center">"Fred, you know very well that I don't liked to be called that." I playfully warned, in return he cheekily grinned. </p><p align="center">"All the more reason to do it then." I huffed in response, then I pulled out a book and settle myself. </p><p align="center">A few moments passed before Lee joined us, "Lee!" I nearly shouted as we did our signature handshake.</p><p align="center">"You two are bloody gits" George said, "Only if it bugs you" I replied with a grin and Lee sat down. </p><p align="justify">                    We spent the next couple of hours chatting one another up, and occasionally teasing and picking at one another. We were all smiles and laughs. I napped for a little bit, but not too much. I didn't want the twins to get any "ideas." </p><p align="center"> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify">                    Smiling I made my way up the steps to the Gryffindor common room. The twins and Lee had gone off for something or another, no one ever knows with those gits. Ginny had caught up with me and we were talking about this years Quidditch season. Being as this was her first year at Hogwarts I told her all about our teams, and I told her how I hoped we could get better competition this year and we laughed. I wished her luck and ventured to my own dorm room. Angelina and Katie already seemed to have been there, I could hear them talking doors away, when I stepped in they screeched my name. We hugged it out and I joined in on their talking. We always seemed to have so much to talk about. It put a smile to my face. </p><p align="center">"Ladies," I started, "Do I have news for you!" </p><p align="center">"What is it!!" Angelina Screeched, "Tell us!" Katie chimed. </p><p align="center">“My dad is letting me go to the Quidditch World Cup next year!” I beamed and they showed me utter delight. </p><p align="center">“Maybe we can meet up when it comes around,” Katie purposed, “Yeah! But let’s not worry about it too much, we have a whole year to plan things out.” Angelina added.</p><p align="justify">         I agreed, I hadn’t even given much thought to this year if I’m honest. This years classes were sure to get better than last years, especially in transfiguration. Every bit of that class just scared me, I love all animals alike and it just scared me. Luckily I did a bit of reading on it over the holiday. Now potions and charms, I could nail any year. <br/><br/></p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">         When I woke the next morning I woke earlier than I expected. I dressed and made my way down to breakfast. I sat in my normal spot, I was usually with The twins and Lee, but I woke so early I didn’t expect them for a little bit. Luckily on half of the pair showed,</p><p align="center">”Heya Freddie,” He gave me a sleepy grin, “Where’s George and Lee?” I questioned as he sat down.</p><p align="center">He waved it off, “Those blokes are still asleep.” <br/><br/>“Of course they would be, I half expected you to still be sleeping” I teased. </p><p align="center">“Right then, any ‘master plan’ of yours just yet?” I puzzled as I stretched and yawned.</p><p align="center">Fred explained everything in great detail, we were so lost in conversation we hadn’t even notice the rest of our little entourage arrive. It wasn’t until George added to the conversation that we really noticed. </p><p align="center">“Oh! I didn’t even see you guys!” I chirped.</p><p align="center">George huffed, “ We wouldn’t want to interrupt you making googly eyes” he smirked.</p><p align="center">“We were not!” I huff giving him a grumpy face, Fred just laughed and brushed it off. </p><p align="center">“Anyway,” He looked my way, “You were telling her about our plans this year, hm?”</p><p align="center">“Yeah! And Short-One here has some pretty good ideas.” Fred said.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">I furrowed my eyebrows but smiled, “Instead of making Filch’s office smell horrendous, we should make literally every surface sticky. Except books. Protect those.” I went on but ended with a warning tone.</p><p align="center">George thought it over then nodded, “I think we could pull that off.” </p><p align="center"> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">“Potions.” Lee sighed. </p><p align="center">“What do you mean, ‘potions.’ Potions is the best!” I playfully mocked. </p><p align="center">“I knew you’d say that, it's alright if we didn’t have a snake for a teacher.” Fred said setting up his station.“I just like potions Fred, I never said I liked Snape. I don’t mind him every now and then.” I replied. </p><p align="center"> </p><p>         Fred, George, Lee, and myself spent the class time half paying attention, and half whispering and snickering to each other. At one point we got majorly scolded by Snape, and I was so so SO close to popping off on him. But I kept my temper, with help anyway. </p><p align="center">          On the way out I stretched. “Merlin, he keeps it so cold in there.” I rubbed my arms. </p><p align="center">“Eh, it wasn’t so bad.” Fred and George said in unison. Lee shook his head and I just blinked. </p><p align="center">“You guys do that so much.” I leaned against a pillar. </p><p align="center">“It’s almost like you’re not used to it by now” Fred teased. </p><p align="center">I rolled my eyes, “Come on stupid-heads, let’s get on with this. Do you guys have Transfiguration next?” </p><p align="center">“I do,” George said, “Those two have divination though.” Fred groaned</p><p align="center">”I am so not ready to deal with Trelawney just yet” Lee rubbed his eyes. </p><p align="center"> </p><p>                   I frowned and we split ways, George and I made small talk on the way. George was my gossip buddy, besides Katie and Angelina, of course. He’d been with me through everything, especially with that incident with the Ravenclaw boy just last year. Laurence was quite the asshole. He dumped me for one of my older friends, but it’s over now. I have better things to worry about! Like Quidditch! Which should be starting up again soon. </p><p> </p><p align="center">George poked me out of my thoughts, “I know that face, whatcha thinking about?”</p><p align="center">”Huh? Oh, it was nothing.” I replied with a smile.</p><p align="center">“Are you sure?” He pressed on, with a sort of childish tone.</p><p align="center">”Yes George! Bugger off will you?” I laughed.</p><p align="center">"Nope!" He said simply. "I was thinking about last year, and I just wonder how different it'll be this year." I answered. <br/>"I see." He blinked, "Worry you not, Kiddo. If anything we got your back if you need it. Especially Fred" He winked.</p><p align="justify">              I turned light pink as we entered Professor McGonagall's classroom. We sat in our normal spots and Professor started class. Our first assignment was a roll summarizing what we learned last year. George had a few whispers of protest, but I don't think it's too bad.  I talked a little bit about Fred to George, and I learned a few things that Fred himself would <em>never</em> tell me. Now I can use it against him if I need too!</p><p align="justify"> </p><hr/><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">                  Once class was over I needed food, my head was hurting! But my smile never faded. The feast went entirely well, the twins, Lee, and I made many jokes and I hurt from laughing. I even got to talking with Ginny some, I even met some of her friends. Through all of the talking I made eye-contact with Fred and we smiled. It was almost... endearing? I never gave Fred and I's friendship thought, it was your usual 'hey buddy what's up?' type friendship. It did, however, differ much from George and I's friendship. George was like a brother. I'd grown quite close to the Weasley's in these few years, and Mrs. Weasley was practically a second mother to me. I'd always be over during the holidays too, but this summer was different. My family and I were visiting my Nan for a little bit. Anyway, the Weasley's were amazing. I'd be a little lost without them. </p><p align="justify">                    We all talked on the back to the common room, lingering for a little while before we went to our actual dorm rooms. The girls and I shared little words before going to sleep, just our normal 'goodnight.' I laid awake for a good while, thinking. I have a lot of hope for this year.</p><p align="justify">                     I could tell this was going to be an interesting year.</p>
