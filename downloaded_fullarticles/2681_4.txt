    <p>Harry was shivering, it was snowing and he had forgotten his scarf. He made his way through the masses of people with enormous shopping bags while glancing into the displays of the shops. Harry was looking for a muggle bookstore, Hermione had convinced him to start reading muggle books. She claimed that reading a novel was a great way to relax before going to bed and that it would help him fall asleep. Harry couldn’t say anything against that, he <i>did</i> need to sleep better and Hermione knew it.</p><p>It was cold and Harry wanted to go home, even though home meant his grim flat with a noisy neighbor. At home, he had at least a warm cup of tea and a fireplace, and that was all he wanted at the moment. </p><p>Lost in sulky thoughts, Harry almost walked past a bookstore. Relieved, he went into the shop, mostly because he wanted to escape the cold.</p><p>The shop was quite small, which was probably why he almost walked past it. It was warm and it smelled like old books, which made sense. There were books everywhere Harry looked, left, right and straight ahead. In the middle of the shop stood a table with a sign that said <i>‘The best books of February’</i>. Somewhere in the left corner of the shop stood a counter. </p><p>Harry was lost, to say the least. He decided to just look around and pretend to search for a book, he didn’t want to seem awkward. However, he felt very uncomfortable. Harry simply didn’t know what to do in a muggle bookstore. He didn’t have a specific list of books, he had asked Hermione for one but she had said that it was completely up to him, that his taste might be very different from hers. He had no clue what to look for or what to buy. He heard Hermione’s words she said to him two days ago in his head: <i>“Ask one of the employees for recommendations, they know all the books, it’s their job.”</i> Harry argued that Hermione basically knew all the books too, but she protested and said that she didn’t even know all of the wizarding books. </p><p>And now he was alone, in a muggle bookstore. Harry figured that it would be best to check out who stood behind the counter <i>if</i> he were to ask for recommendations. He really preferred it when someone had a nice and kind aura. He still thought it was bizarre to ask someone, they would find out eventually that he never read a muggle book, which wasn’t exactly normal for a 26-year-old ‘muggle’.</p><p>Harry had made up his mind, he made a strategy of how to figure out who was behind the counter without drawing attention to himself. His strategy was to browse the bookstore on the left side. Eventually, he would reach a bookcase, that was standing across the left side of the store. It didn’t touch the left wall for about 30 inches, so there was still room to walk between the wall and the bookcase. Harry would stand next to the bookcase, so he couldn’t be seen by the person behind the counter. Harry would look at the books on the bookshelves in the wall, and when he’d grab a book from a bookshelf he would glance to his right to see who stood behind the counter. It was too bad that he didn’t become an Auror.</p><p>It was a perfect plan, everything went well except for one thing. When Harry glanced to his right, he looked right in the eyes of the person behind the counter. </p><p>Draco Malfoy. </p><p>Harry recognized him immediately, and let us be fair, how could he not? Draco wore a woollen turtleneck that was so dark blue, it lightened up his whole complexion. With that, he had paired gey slacks, the ones that had taken forever at the dry-cleaning place and which he was finally able to wear again. Draco knew he looked good, he always does. But in that exact moment when he locked eyes with the one person he thought he would never see again, he was damned glad he looked as good as he did. Not that he wanted to impress him or anything, just for confidence. At least, that’s what he told himself.</p><p>And being truthful as we are, Draco was wearing glasses, and Harry wasn’t sure how he was still a living man after looking at his long-forgotten arch-nemesis. His sleeves were rolled up, making the Dark Mark visible. It made Harry feel a little queasy, that he had recovered so well from the war and that he wasn’t scared to show it, it hadn’t been the same for Harry. After the war, he hadn’t been doing so well. He and Ginny broke up, and now that Voldemort was defeated he had lost his purpose. He was trying to live in the shadows, away from the press and the fame. </p><p>Anyhow, Harry had lived his life and had completely forgotten about Draco Malfoy until now. </p><p>Draco was the first to recover from the shock. He walked up to Harry and leaned casually against the bookcase, where Harry had been hiding behind, put one hand in his pocket and threw an intrigued look at Harry. Harry could swear he saw Draco’s eyes smirking. Those glasses didn’t make it any better.</p><p>“Fancy seeing you in here, Potter. What are you doing in a muggle bookstore?” Draco asked. Harry could definitely hear a smirk in his voice.</p><p>“I… er, I need a book. What are <i>you</i> doing here, Malfoy?” Harry faltered. He didn’t know why he was nervous or ashamed, but he was. </p><p>“I run this bookstore, if you hadn’t noticed that already. I’m hard to miss, after all.” He said with a mischievous glint in his eyes and tilted his head to the left, looking playfully at Harry. If they run into each other like this, he might as well enjoy it. An effortless target Harry was, as he gets flustered so easily. Some things never do change Draco thought to himself. </p><p>“Erm, no I hadn’t noticed you, actually,” Harry responded, feeling a bit embarrassed. He could only hope that Draco hadn’t noticed him before either. </p><p>“Well Potter, what are you looking for?”</p><p>“That’s the thing, you see, I err, well, I don’t know. Hermione sent me.”</p><p>“Ah, never read a muggle book then, I take it? I’ll grab a few classics which aren’t too hard to read. Just wait here.” And with that, Draco was off.  Harry watched Draco walking to the back of the store with so much grace, Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away. </p><p>Draco was back before Harry had a chance to calm down his nerves. Harry didn’t know where these nerves came from, but he supposed it was because of Draco. He didn’t know why he felt like this, but he didn’t have much time to ponder that question.</p><p>Draco came back holding a pile of books, resting his chin on the upper book to make sure they didn’t fall out of his hands. “I’ve got Jane Austen, to sooth the inner romantic,” Draco said with a wink, “The Cather in the Rye I would also recommend, though I must say you had quite a different life when you were seventeen. And then we’ve got Harper Lee and Fitzgerald, easy to begin with, that one, oh and we’ve got Dickens too before I forget. Ring a bell?”</p><p>“Er–“</p><p>“Right, well, I’ll just start easy then. I’ll give you The Catcher in the Rye and The Great Gatsby, and you can come back later and tell me if any of it was to your liking and I’d recommend you some more.” He lowered his voice, “well, at least I’d like you to come back.” Draco put up his prettiest smile that he knew was irresistible. Batting his eyelashes couldn’t hurt either. He did want Potter to come back after all, how could he not with those broad shoulders and that fine arse in denim jeans? Though Draco had to admit that it would look considerably better in trousers of fine fabric.</p><p>Harry had snapped out of his daze, and could finally think clearly. “Yes, those books sound good. If I like them I’ll come back for more. I’d like to pay now, please.” </p><p>“Oh no matter, they’re on the house. Beginners sale and all.”</p><p>“But…, it’s no problem really. I’ve got enough money. I can pay.”</p><p>“It’s quite alright, there you go,” and with that Draco handed the books over. “Enjoy your reading. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got to help other customers. I’m quite busy with running a shop and such.” And just for the sake of it, he added, “goodbye Harry. I hope to see you soon.” And with that he was off.<br/>
Harry was gobsmacked. Since when was Malfoy so nice? And did he just say ‘I hope to see you soon’?<br/>
Putting off his thoughts, Harry adjusted his coat and walked out of the shop, going home.</p>
