    <p>“Are you sure your dad won't mind me spending the summer at your house? I don't want to intrude.” </p>
<p>“He won't mind at all. And I already sorta asked him. If anything once he hears your story he will invite you to live with us or something rash like that.” </p>
<p>0o0o0</p>
<p>That was last week. He’d been at the Malfoy Manor for a week now, Draco's dad was on vacation and left him strict instructions not to contact him. Harry looked around the living room where he was stationed right now. Draco let him conjure up a telly and he had just gotten it working. The blond had taken off to Blaise’s for a couple of weeks. After hours of arguing Harry had finally convinced Draco that he would be fine alone untill him or his dad got back. So as of right now he was chilling in the living room watching TV, without a shirt, sprawled in an awkward position on the recliner. He was just about to fall asleep when he heard a gasp. He was up and in a defensive position with his wand drawn in 2 seconds flat. Severus put his hands up in surrender. </p>
<p>“Hello,” he said gently, “You must be Draco’s friend. We didn't expect you here so soon. I'm Severus, Draco's dad.” </p>
<p>“Wrong!” Harry started backing toward the other door, “Draco said his dad's name was Lucius.” Harry bumped into a warm solid surface. He jumped and would've gone sprawling forward if a strong arm hadn't wrapped itself around his waist. </p>
<p>“Easy there. Severus is also Draco's father but it is me he mentioned.” he plucked Harry's wand from his hand and turned him around his arms still wrapped around Harry's waist. “I'd appreciate it if you did not brandish a wand at my mate, thank you.” he looked to Severus whose eyes had gone wide staring at the boy's back. He held tight to the smaller boy thinking they might be in some danger, “What is it Sev?” he looked down at the boy's back and gasped. </p>
<p>“Keep ahold of him I want a look.”Severus stepped forward and took a good look at the scars littering Harry's back at this point Harry's eyes were wide, and his body was tense. Severus reached out and ran his fingers across a particularly bad one. This sent the boy into a frenzy. </p>
<p>“No no no! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to! I'm sorry!”  he scrambled to get away from the hands gliding across his scars. He clawed at Lucius's shirt, whimpering. </p>
<p>“Harry! Harry!” Lucius said,” Harry love, your fine, shhh!” he picked up the smaller boy holding him tightly. He sat down on the sofa, running his hands through the boy's soft hair rocking slightly, “Shh love we're not going to hurt you, Severus just wants to look, shh I've got you.” Lucius nodded at his other mate signaling him to keep going. </p>
<p>“I'm not going to hurt you Harry you're fine.” Severus ran his hands over their small mates back in a soothing motion. At first Harry tensed a bit but soon settled down. </p>
<p>Harry's eyes went wide again and he scrambled out of Lucius's arms and off his lap, “It's fine it's nothing! Doesn't matter!” he looked around for his shirt before he remembered he didn't have one. </p>
<p>Severus looked at the boy, “ I don't like it when people lie to me Harry.” </p>
<p>“I-I’m not.”</p>
<p>“Yes you are.” Severus said evenly. “ Now we can do this the easy way or the hard way.” Harry looked confused. “Come sit down or. I. Make. You.” </p>
<p>Harry for some odd reason felt the need to obey these men. He never wanted to obey! He was the trouble child, everyone knew that! Except for him now apparently. He walked back to Lucius. The blond pulled Harry back into his lap. “Relax, like we said it won't hurt. And if it does tell us and we'll stop.” He pulled the small boy so he was comfortably resting against his chest. </p>
<p>“Ok Sev it's all you.” the other man came forward and and continued his evaluation. Upon first touch Harry tensed and fisted Lucius’s shirt further ruffling it, but soon he relaxed. </p>
<p>“What happened?” </p>
<p>“My uncle doesn't like me very much.” Harry's voice was strong and reserved, “ that one you're touching now was a serrated kitchen knife, I made too much noise making dinner.” Severus looked at the ragged line running from one shoulder blade to another. The boys magic had done a good job on healing the boy but it obviously couldn't completely vanquish the marks marring his body. He moved his hands to the identical ones running from his hips down below the waist band in a V shape. “Pocket knife. I went to far in my morning run, I didn't make it back before they woke up, they found out I left the property and worse, without a shirt people could see my scars.” He touched the lighter ones criss crossing Harry's back in no specific pattern, “ belt. I couldn't even tell you why” he sighed, “most likely because he blamed me for something that wasn't my fault.” </p>
<p>“I will be right back.” Severus slipped out the door quickly. </p>
<p>Lucius rubbed Harry's back and rocked a bit, more for himself then for Harry. He was so heart broken that someone could do this to his poor Harry, he wanted to hide the green eyed boy away and go make the person who did this suffer. “You are so brave.” He whispered in Harry's ear. </p>
<p>“No,” he yawned, “just did what I had to do to survive. Just barely.” He yawned again, “Is Sev’rus going to be back soon, I'm tired.” He laid his head on Lucius's shoulder with his face tucked nicely into the blond's neck. </p>
<p>At this point Lucius knew that they had found there other mate, and the only reason Harry was so comfortable so fast, especially after the original freak out was because his magic was telling him to trust them. “It's ok just go to sleep, I've got you.” </p>
<p>“No I'm fine” Harry mumbled against Lucius's neck. </p>
<p>Lucius sighed, “ok,” He leaned his cheek against the boy's soft unruly hair and closed his eyes reveling in how good his magic felt. He couldn't help but think the only thing missing was Severus. But alas speak of the devil and he will come. Severus walked in holding a potion vial in one hand and a piece of cloth in the other. He stopped halfway to them and smiled. He then walked back out walking back in a minute later with a camera. *click*. He took a picture then walked up to his 2 mates. </p>
<p>“Harry?” </p>
<p>“Mmm yeah?” he asked without moving. </p>
<p>“I have a potion here that should finish healing most of these, it will get rid of alot of the scars and greatly fade the others. Would you like to give it a go?” </p>
<p>“ Do you think I should?” </p>
<p>“Without the scaring your range of motion will greatly increase, as well as your confidence I believe. So yes I would recommend it.” </p>
<p>“Ok. Will it hurt?” </p>
<p>“There might be an odd sensation or slight stinging but that's it.”</p>
<p>“Ok,” Harry sighed “I trust you” both Severus and Lucius couldn't help the huge grins that enveloped their faces. </p>
<p>“Ok then, here we go.” Severus wet the cloth and started to gently rub it on the small boys back. Under the older man's ministrations Harry soon feel asleep. As soon as his even breathing and soft snores filled the room the 2 older men spoke. “This is it Lucius! We’ve found him! Dear merlin he's so beautiful! </p>
<p>“Yes love I realise,” Lucius chuckled, “But you've also got to remember he’s only 16. A bit younger than Draco. How do you think Draco will take this? This was his friend he brought here to keep safe not give to his 2 fathers that just so happen to be his friends mate!” during his rant his grip on Harry gradually tightened. The dark haired boy squirmed a bit and wrapped his arms around Lucius’s neck as well as further nuzzling his face to the blond’s neck. The blond sighed, “He feels it I know he does but we have to talk to draco first. It would be unfair if we didn’t.”</p>
<p>“How do you think Harry will take it” Severus asked while wiping off his hands.</p>
<p>“I hope relatively well, Draco said non-creature mates are now in the Hogwarts curriculum so he should at least have knowledge of what has happened. His magic has already accepted it, now it just up to him.” Lucius looked down lovingly at his sleeping mate. “I suppose i could just stay like this for awhile and unpack later, would you like to join us love?” </p>
<p>Severus chuckled, “Knowing you, you will fall asleep, I’ll keep an eye on the time we have dinner reservations.” </p>
<p>“Hmm, ok. It seems as though Draco isn't here and i don't wanna leave Harry here alone so would you mind adding his to the reservations?” </p>
<p>“Of course hun,” Severus leaned down, kissed Lucius and then kissed the top of Harry’s head, “I'll get right to that. “</p>
<p>0o0o0</p>
<p>Lucius did indeed fall asleep and about an hour later Snape came in to wake him, “Luc, love it's time to wake up.” He shook his mate a bit. Silver eyes flew open. </p>
<p>“Touch him and i’ll kill you!” He snarled. “Oh.” He chuckled nervously, “Hey Sev.”</p>
<p>“Don't you ‘hey Sev’ me!”</p>
<p>“Hmmm whats going on?” Harry stirred.</p>
<p>“Oh nothing. Severus just scared me a bit.” Harry laughed, “Are you laughing at me? Sev i think he's laughing at me! Do you know what happens to people who laugh at me? Hmmm ? TICKLE ATTACK!!!!” Lucius declared as his dancing fingers rained down on the boys poor ribs.</p>
<p>Harry squealed and squirmed, “No! Gah! Im sorry Im sorry!” he laughed, “Sev help!”</p>
<p>“Got it!” Severus also started tickling him.</p>
<p>“Nooo! No!  Wrong help! Wrong help! “ Soon they were a pile of dancing fingers flailing limbs and loud laughs. </p>
<p>“I surrender! I surrender!” Harry yelped through his laugh. Severus and Lucius fell to either side of the boy. </p>
<p>“Now that we’ve lost 20 minutes to get ready we should probably hurry. No time to shower now.” Severus huffed. </p>
<p>“Oh” Harry said. “Where are you guys going?” </p>
<p>“We,” Lucius bumped Harry’s shoulder, “as in you, me, and Sev, are going out for dinner.”</p>
<p>“Oh! Is it nice?” </p>
<p>“It is a nice place yes, so dress slacks, a button up shirt and slacks would be preferable.” </p>
<p>“No robes?” </p>
<p>“Not this time. Now go get ready before I have to start tickling you again!” </p>
<p>“I'm going!” Harry jumped up and ran to his room. The 2 older men chuckled and went to do the same. </p>
<p>0o0o0</p>
<p>Harry was grateful Draco insisted on getting him a new wardrobe because what he had before simply wouldn't cut it. He slipped on his slacks. He always thought dress pants would be uncomfortable but these felt quite nice. And they looked good to! He pulled on his shirt and gapped his tie. He took one look at it and walked his ass down to Lucius and Severus room. “knock knock.” He said. </p>
<p>“Come on in Harry.” </p>
<p>He stepped into the room and looked around the room was rather large . In the middle sat a huge four bed bed with a nightstand on either side. The walls were a creme color and the floor a a forest green, not unlike his eyes he thought. All the furniture was a deep mahogany. It all made him feel so safe. He could feel the to older men's magic lingering on just about every surface. If magic was a smell this place would reek of it he thought. Theirs specifically. All of a sudden he felt the tie being pulled from his hand, he looked up to see Lucius smiling down at him. He watched the lithe fingers tie his tie. Harry quickly undid it, “Do it again.” Once again he watched at rapt attention, and again he undid it. “Again.” Once again Lucius complied when done Harry undid it a gun but this time Harry tried himself. Lucius watched him curious of the boy's behaviors. Harry attempted a couple more times before he said, “Just once more.” Lucius smiled and tied it once more a little slower picking up that Harry wanted to learn. Harry undid again and tried, once, twice, he got it on the third try. Lucius couldn't help but think about how proud Harry looked. “Thanks! I’ll be ready in a couple minutes!” he turned around and walked back to his room. Lucius looked back at Severus who was beaming. </p>
<p>“I'm not sure I've seen anything cuter than that!” </p>
<p>0o0o0 </p>
<p>When the 2 older men walked into the living room they were a fronted by the beautiful sight that was Harry. His slacks fit oh so nicely, his hair perfectly messed up, his tie tied, and his sleeves carefully rolled up giving him a nicely casual look. They both just had to stop and stare for a second, Harry smiled at them. </p>
<p>“Ready to go?” </p>
<p>“Yup.” Severus said. </p>
<p>“Where is it exactly we are going again?” Harry asked stepping forward taking the arm offered. </p>
<p>“ It is a restaurant in muggle London that caters to witches and wizards as well as muggles<br/> There is an apperating point near it though will will have to walk a bit. </p>
<p>“Perfect!” Severus side along apperated Harry to to the apparation site. Once they landed Harry stumbled forward before Severus caught him. “I can never get used to that. It's just so weird.” Harry babbled straightening himself out. Lucius popped up beside them making Harry jump and almost fall again. “Gah Severus caught the jittery boy once again. Him and Lucius chuckled. </p>
<p>“Well we've got reservations so we best be headed.” Lucius put a hand on the small of the boy's back and guided him toward the restaurant. </p>
<p>0o0o0</p>
<p>Dinner went as well as expected and they were soon headed back to the apperating spot. </p>
<p>“Ugh! I'm sooo full!I might just die.” Harry declared. He leaned into Severus while walking. </p>
<p>“ Oh yes, I'm sure!” Severus chuckled. When they got to the apperating point Harry grabbed his arm and they were off. When they popped up in the living room Harry went sprawling for again but this time no one caught him. </p>
<p>“Hey! You were supposed to catch me! Brat.” Harry mumbled. Severus laughed at his antics and offered a hand up. “Humph. Whatever.” Harry smiled. “It's a bit late I'm going to turn in for the night. “Good night Sev,”  he hugged Severus, “Night Luc.” He turned and hugged Lucius, then headed to his room.</p>
