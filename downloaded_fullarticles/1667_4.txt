    <p>Hello! Welcome to this new adventure of mine! It’s been a long time since I’ve written any fanfiction but I have decided to jump back into it thanks to some kind encouragement from very sweet people.</p><p>
  <u>
    <strong>Update:7/31/2019 - I have decided to rework some of the inconsistencies that I accidentally wrote into this story and will be taking down the chapters to fix such issues! Stay tuned this week for an actual update coming soon. I was finding it difficult to achieve the type of story that I wanted to write with the writing in the state it was in and felt that the best way to fix this was to completely start over. Sorry for anyone who finds this annoying but I only want to produce the best work that I can make and don't want to ignore story issues for the sake of uploads.</strong>
  </u>
</p><p>A few things to note from this story:</p><p> I might get rather dark at points due to the nature of the pairing and the points of time that are being covered. I <em>do not</em> give trigger warnings outside of my tagging so if you see anything in the tags that make you hesitate, <u>believe them</u>. For my Fanfiction readers I will have a list of them featured below so that you can quickly see. I have a general direction I think this story is going in, but it isn’t fully fleshed out at this point so I can’t be certain where there will be triggers and honestly it feels like I’m spoiling the content of the story if I put trigger warnings at the top of the chapter.</p><p><strong>Current Trigger Warnings in this Story: </strong>Graphic depictions of violence, Pychologic trauma, PTSD, Manipulation, World War II mentions, Child Abuse mentions, Smut, Depression, Mental Health issues, Recovery, Threats of Violence, Torture, etc.</p><p>A quick note, I’m a full time college student with a job on the side, updates will hopefully be regular but be warned, I may drop off the face of the planet when things become hectic. If you follow me on social media then I’ll answer questions and update on there but try to be patient with me.</p><p>I don’t believe in writing Hermione or Tom as perfect characters. They both have real issues and will make mistakes, they will make poor choices out of selfishness or trauma. I don’t like to write any character without their hiccups, but especially with these two, I have no doubt there will be times where you might become frustrated with them.</p><p>I will be writing Hermione more on her persona in the books, so vengeful, awkward at times, incredibly intelligent, and not without faults. I will also be writing Tom on the more… creepy side. He will still be ever charming and an evil genius, but I think Tom shows some very disturbing qualities even outside of him being a murderer and a blood supremacist.</p><p>There are going to be characters that are implied to exist due to their children existing but haven’t directly been named or given a family lineage in canon so I worked with what I could find and imply from the family trees. These character’s personalities and descriptions are going to be my own personal creation, but I don’t have a problem with sharing them if anyone wants to use them <strong>if</strong> they ask first.</p><p>Canonically, from what I have read and looked up, Hermione was reunited with her parents, but it wasn’t known if she ever found Crookshanks again, in my story her parent’s memories couldn’t be returned because of how extensive the Obliviate spell was that she cast, however I am reuniting her with Crookshanks. I do this because I always felt that it was a longshot that those memories could be returned, and since we know that muggles especially can have long-term damage due to magic, I wanted to integrate that into this story. It hurts me to do it to her, which is why Crookshanks has made his way back.</p><p>It is well accepted in the community to place Hermione’s “Mudblood” scar into existence, and while I love this touch in the movies, I am removing it for this story. In the books she is tortured with a knife and the Cruciatus Curse, and that will be the same path we follow for this story. My reasoning is simple, I find that it would be very difficult to follow the path I want for this story with that scar in place, due to the blatant awareness it brings to itself, but I didn’t want it to be hidden or damaged to hide its existence. However, I am keeping the idea that there are scars, just not ones that are so blatant to her blood status due to the blade being used.</p><p>We will also be seeing the curse from Antonin Dolohov reappearing in this story, it’s never explicitly explained if she was scarred from this attack in the Department of Mysteries but I like this touch in many fanfictions and from what I understand Dark Magic typically scars much like Harry’s “I must not tell lies” scar on the back of his hand. This attack nearly killed Hermione, so I take liberties with it because I think it was something that wasn’t really addressed as well as it could have been even though it was a very big deal.</p><p>I have a Pinterest Board for this story that will be mentioned in my profile, feel free to check it out if you want to put faces to names and ideas for clothing, the overall theme, and a picture into my story progression. There will probably be spoilers there because I use it as a mind-map for what I am doing in this story.</p><p>Lastly, I believe in Happily Ever After’s! I will find a way to guide Tom and Hermione together if it <em>kills</em> me, now I don’t guarantee this for every character because things can get messy in the process of everything happening. There will be character death, there will be angst, but our main couple will make it through in the end.</p><p>Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy!</p><p> </p>
