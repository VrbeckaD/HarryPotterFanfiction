    <p class="p1">On most days, Courtroom Ten was as damp and chilly as the bottom of a well, but that morning it had fogged up with the heat of hundreds of bodies packed along the benches and crowded against the public gallery rails, filling the chamber with their humming and rustling like bats on the roof of a cave.</p><p class="p1">“. . . How then do you explain the accused’s ability to cast a Killing Curse? A spell that requires genuine malice—”</p><p class="p1">“A common misconception, but the caster of a Killing Curse must merely <em>intend</em> with all their heart to end their victim’s life!”</p><p class="p1">“Malice, intent, what does it matter?”</p><p class="p1">“Because my client’s intent was not to harm Professor Dumbledore but to spare him pain and see his plans against Lord Voldemort carried out!”</p><p class="p1">The advocate for the defense paused in his pacing to deliver this last remark, flinging his arms up in theatrical frustration.</p><p class="p1">Severus leaned his cheek on his hand—or tried to, at least. When the chains around his wrist yanked him up short, he set his hand down slowly, hoping to look like he’d been stretching.</p><p class="p1">His advocate—Durbly or something, Severus hadn’t been listening—wore satin robes the color of an unripe banana, and his tied-back chestnut hair ended in a single, perfect corkscrew curl that bounced every time he moved. Severus couldn’t take his eyes off it. In his imagination, it made a <em>boing, boing </em>sound, like one of those toys Lily had played with and Petunia had broken.</p><p class="p1">The men before him argued on.</p><p class="p1">Elphias Doge, high above on the Chief Warlock’s bench, waved the advocate’s words away. “You cannot prove the intentions of the accused merely by the consequences of his actions. After all, he may only have <em>accidentally</em> contributed to Voldemort’s defeat. Who’s to say—”</p><p class="p1">The advocate’s exasperated huff sounded less feigned this time. “If you will not be swayed by the testimony of Albus Dumbledore himself, I must wonder what standard of evidence <em>would </em>satisfy you!”</p><p class="p1"><em>Boing, boing. </em>The curl went into an ecstasy of flouncing.</p><p class="p1">He and Lily had sat at the top of the concrete steps and Lily had made the toy walk down to the bottom, like a bedspring possessed by a tiny poltergeist. Muggle magic, she’d said. Severus hadn’t been impressed. But he’d thrilled at her laugh of delight as she ran down to collect the thing and ferry it back to the top, cradled in her hands like a little pet.</p><p class="p1">Doge and Mr. Durbly were arguing about standards of evidence. When you hired an expensive lawyer (not that Severus had; apparently an anonymous benefactor was insisting) this was what you were paying for: instead of marching you in, interrupting all your pleas for mercy and convicting you with no discussion, they sat you down for days and days while they discussed the finer points of Wizarding jurisprudence, and <em>then </em>they convicted you.</p><p class="p1">Earlier that morning, Shacklebolt had informed him that his was the longest-running trial in Wizengamot history since Linus the Loquacious had defended himself for five days straight in 1792, and Severus had no interest in beating the record. His head was pounding. He hadn’t slept for more than two hours at a time in weeks; one didn’t sleep in Azkaban so much as sink into a nightmarish twilight filled with monstrous visions of one’s daytime anxieties and the shrieks of the other prisoners. On top of it, he was badly craving a cigarette. He might have agreed to a hundred more nights in Azkaban if only someone would give him a cigarette.</p><p class="p1">“We’ll certainly need better than the circumstance and hearsay you have submitted these last two days,” said Doge—and truly, Doge was the latest of Severus’s string of bad luck; how had he ended up with Dumbledore’s most devoted friend as his prosecutor? “If you’ve no more arguments to present—<em>new </em>arguments, that is—I suggest we proceed to the vote.”</p><p class="p1">Severus nearly groaned with relief.</p><p class="p1">But his advocate showed no signs of giving in, despite the patches of desperation showing through his confidence. “What about the testimony of the school itself? Hogwarts has refused to acknowledge an illegitimate headmaster in the past, which, given that my client was installed without the usual legitimizing process, strongly suggests that the school conferred a deeper legitimacy upon him, one based in his loyalty to its late headmaster!”</p><p class="p1">Doge was squaring his papers as if their business was already finished. “We have been over this,” he said without looking up, “when several members of this council pointed out that Hogwarts has in fact tolerated a number of downright evil headmasters in its days.”</p><p class="p1">“And what about Professor Dumbledore’s familiar?” The advocate took a brilliant orange feather out of his robes and brandished it aloft. Even without the rest of the bird, Fawkes’s feather lit up the dark stone walls like a shard broken off the sun. Severus had to look away from the sight of it clutched in a stranger’s grubby hand. “This feather from the tail of a phoenix was found at the site of what ought to have been—and according to Mr. Potter’s testimony, in fact <em>was</em>—my client’s death. As you know, the phoenix would only have saved my client from his fatal wound if he had demonstrated incredible loyalty to the great man himself!”</p><p class="p1">Doge waved impatiently, as if hoping to blow the feather out of the advocate’s grasp. “Mr. Dillby,” he said patronizingly—ah yes, <em>that</em> was his name, Severus had been close—“you were unable to prove that this feather came from a phoenix, let alone Dumbledore’s. And even if you had, it proves nothing about the accused’s loyalty—merely that the animal was, for whatever reason, present at the scene.”</p><p class="p1">Kingsley Shacklebolt, who sat between Doge and Gawain Robards on the high bench, leaned over and said what sounded like “honestly, Elphias!” in an impatient whisper while the other members of the Wizengamot argued among themselves.</p><p class="p1">Severus swallowed his nausea. “Loyalty”—every mention of the word made an icy patch inside him spread a little farther. Had they bothered to ask, he could have told them what his “loyalty” had looked like. Mr. Dillby’s recent bit of sophistry had been clever but wrong—Severus hadn’t thought about defeating the Dark Lord when he’d killed Dumbledore. He’d thought about how much he hated the old man, and then he’d gone home and wept until he vomited.<em> Well? </em>he wanted to ask Albus.<em> How </em>damaged<em> do you think my soul is now?</em></p><p class="p1">And what would they say if he described how much he’d still missed the hateful old bastard? That he was nothing without a counterfeit father to tell him how to wipe his arse, so desperate to follow orders that he’d let a fucking painting boss him around? Like him, they might wonder—did he get off on it? Had too much time spent bare-arsed over Tobias’s knee twisted him up inside? He might have helped win the war, true. But to call such sickness “loyalty” was grotesque.</p><p class="p1">“This is going nowhere,” said Doge, returning the court to order. “The very nature of a double agent makes their true allegiance impossible to determine—which leaves us only with the acts themselves.”</p><p class="p1">Poor Mr. Dillby finally lost his cool. “That the acts themselves were committed is not in doubt!” he roared. “Indeed, we never denied them! Ladies and gentlemen, the question <em>must </em>be one of intent—was my client loyal to Voldemort or was he loyal to Albus Dumbledore? However difficult it may be, <em>that</em> is the matter you must judge, and Professor Dumbledore himself has already explained in great detail why my client acted as he did—”</p><p class="p1">Doge slapped the lectern hard, startling Dillby into silence. “Dumbledore merely said why he <em>believed</em> Snape did what he did! If we had Lord Voldemort before us, he could no doubt paint a very different but equally convincing picture!”</p><p class="p1">Voices swelled all around. Shacklebolt and Robards were openly arguing with Doge, and the other members of the Wizengamot no longer bothered keeping their discussions to a whisper.</p><p class="p1">Severus wished he could ask the chains to let him rub his throbbing temples. His eyeballs felt like they’d been left out to dry in the sun. Hadn’t he done all he could to satisfy the world? He’d been “loyal,” he’d obeyed, he’d done everything Dumbledore told him to do. But oh, did he <em>mean </em>it? He’d dismantled himself to the foundation, practically stopped being a person for Dumbledore<em>—</em>but these people had to know what was in his <em>heart</em>. They had to check under the sheets to see if his soul was clean. And if it wasn’t, well, he barely deserved to live, did he?</p><p class="p1">He wanted to lie down. He wanted his lice-infested bed in Azkaban, wanted to fall asleep to the shrieks of the condemned. He wanted to get on with planning his suicide, a difficult feat now that Azkaban was patrolled by human guards, but not impossible. If nothing else, he could starve or dehydrate himself, an unspeakably painful way to go but he had a savage will—nothing short of a Full Body-Bind could keep him alive if he put his mind to it—</p><p class="p1">“Mr. Snape!” Doge was giving him a narrow-eyed look that almost suggested concern. The noise had subsided and every gaze in the room was crawling over him. “Are you ill? Do you require a Healer?”</p><p class="p1">He unclenched his grinding teeth. His lips were trembling, and a cold tear ran down his nose.</p><p class="p1">“Elphias, perhaps a short recess,” said Shacklebolt.</p><p class="p1">“No!” Severus jerked his hand toward his face to wipe at the tear, but the chains stopped it, which only made more tears spring up. “Take your vote! Take it! I’ve had enough!”</p><p class="p1">Dillby gaped at him in shocked betrayal, then spun toward the high bench. “Please disregard my client—he is not in his right mind. If I could beg your patience a little longer, I ask that you consider the precedent set in the 1809 trial of Herbert Hickinbottom, in which a spy for the MLE was accused of . . .”</p><p class="p1">“If I may,” a mild voice put in, “I might be able to satisfy the court’s doubts once and for all.”</p><p class="p1">As one, the room turned toward the portrait sitting on an easel in the front row. The seating barrier hid the feet of the easel, so that if one didn’t look closely, one might momentarily think a whimsical soul had mounted an empty picture frame in front of a living Albus Dumbledore. For the last hour, he’d sat absolutely still with a fixed expression of polite interest, and Severus had assumed he’d fallen asleep with his eyes open. Apparently he’d just been waiting for the right moment to intervene.</p><p class="p1">Severus wasn’t sure why he couldn’t meet the portrait’s eyes. It certainly wasn’t grief—he’d had plenty of time to get sick of the old fool all over again while he hid from the Carrows in his office.</p><p class="p1">In the hush, Dumbledore went on. “I do understand your resistance, Elphias. You are not satisfied with knowing <em>how</em> Mr. Snape’s actions served my purposes because you cannot imagine <em>why </em>a young man like him, who had never displayed any particular bravery or care for others before, would suddenly place himself in peril to oppose a master he had only recently sworn to serve.” The portrait paused, as if for a breath—hesitating. “I just so happen to know his reasons, and I can assure you they are reasons even Tom Riddle would not have an answer for, were he capable of understanding them.”</p><p class="p1">Cold terror flooded him. “No!” he shouted, forgetting the chains again and surging forward only to be jerked back into his seat. “Albus, you promised!”</p><p class="p1">“Severus,” said Dumbledore urgently, his pleasant act falling away, “this may mean the difference between freedom and a lifetime of—”</p><p class="p1">“I do not <em>want</em> freedom at such a cost! I do not want such a life!” He couldn’t get enough air; his vision split and darkened. The rest of this humiliating ordeal he could bear, but this—this would kill him.</p><p class="p1">“You don’t want a life in which people know you for who you really are? I have never understood—”</p><p class="p1">“I do not care if you <em>understand</em>,” he roared, “only that you keep your promise!”</p><p class="p1">Dumbledore sighed. “And so I shall.”</p><p class="p1">Dillby stormed over and lowered his mouth to Severus’s ear. “If you don’t allow this,” he muttered, “you will lose. <em>I </em>will lose. Do you know how many cases I’ve lost, Snape? <em>None</em>, that’s how many. They’re calling this the trial of the century, and <em>my name </em>will be plastered across the history books—”</p><p class="p1">Unlike Dumbledore, this man merited no pleading. “That sounds like your problem, not mine,” said Severus coldly.</p><p class="p1">Dillby’s eye twitched. Although Severus couldn’t see it, the chestnut curl was undoubtedly vibrating with fury. “Remember,” Dillby hissed, “<em>you </em>brought us to this.” He turned back to the Wizengamot. “Ladies and gentlemen! I have a late piece of evidence to submit.”</p><p class="p1">“NO!” Severus shrieked. Before it was out of Dillby’s pocket, Severus knew what it would be—a small glass phial, which Dillby held up for the Wizengamot.</p><p class="p1">“These memories were collected by Mr. Potter directly from Mr. Snape in the moments before his, er, death, which means they could not have been altered or redacted. I ask that they now be reviewed by the court.”</p><p class="p1">Snape struggled in the chains, shivering with rage and panic. They’d taken everything else—they couldn’t have <em>her</em>. He’d bite his own tongue off if he had to—he’d break his wand. “You have <em>no right! </em>Do you hear me? NO RIGHT! Those are <em>my memories—</em>not some scrap of cloth or bloody footprint to be analyzed and—and picked over by careless, gossiping—”</p><p class="p1">“Mr. Snape!” bellowed Doge. “You will compose yourself or be held in contempt of this court.”</p><p class="p1">As Severus was preparing to tell Doge where he could put his contempt, a voice from behind said, “Wait!” and Harry Potter came jogging down the steps, shoes squeaking. Under his somber dress robes, he appeared to be wearing jeans and trainers. “There’s another option,” he said, risking a glance at Severus’s face before flinching away. “You might ask Professor Snape to cast the Patronus charm. It’ll tell you everything Professor Dumbledore or those memories would.”</p><p class="p1">“Potter, are you mad?” Severus laughed hysterically. “If I won’t allow Dumbledore to speak of—of—then what makes you think I’d—”</p><p class="p1">“Mr. Potter,” Doge interrupted, “I don’t see how the Patronus of the accused can give us any useful information.”</p><p class="p1">“Look, it’ll require some explaining,” said Potter. “But—just trust me. Please.”</p><p class="p1">“Fine. But this is the last we’ll hear from the defense.” Doge turned to Severus and somehow managed to fill his expression with more disdain. “I leave it up to you, Mr. Snape. Either cast the Patronus charm or the court will be compelled to review this new evidence.” He pushed down his glasses and peered over top of them. “That we’ve given you the choice at all is a mere courtesy. And to be honest, your resistance tells me all the more that this evidence bears importantly on your case.”</p><p class="p1">Snape shook his head violently. “Evidence that is <em>me! </em>That came from <em>inside my brain!”</em></p><p class="p1">“And which you freely placed outside of it.”</p><p class="p1">
  <em>“While I was dying!”</em>
</p><p class="p1">Doge looked deeply put-out, like he’d do anything to be back in bed reading the newspaper instead of witnessing this scene. “Make your choice, Mr. Snape, or we will make it for you.”</p><p class="p1">Severus stared up at the fifty faces of the Wizengamot. There wasn’t a choice, really. Reveal her in one way or another—he would lose her either way. They would see, and they would laugh, and the beautiful secret that had kept him alive would be trampled underfoot. He thrashed in his chains while his mortified dignity looked on in horror, a helpless spectator—the excited murmurs of the crowd grew into a roar, and then into a rushing sound like ocean waves but faster, more rhythmic, and growing faster still—</p><p class="p1">He should never have spoken to her. He should have watched her glide on a trail of flame through the afternoon, held that memory in his heart forever, and run as far from her as he could get.</p><p class="p1">“Mr. Snape, for the last time!”</p><p class="p1">“Fine,” he said weakly, collapsing in his chair. “I’ll take—the spell.”</p><p class="p1">The chains slithered off and an Auror handed him his wand. His numb fingers barely felt the handle, and he watched his arm lift as if moved by an Imperius curse. With his mind paralyzed, it seemed his body had decided to go on without him. He tried to think—but there was no loophole, nowhere to hide. He could not do this. He <em>had</em> to do this. He could not—he <em>had</em> to—he could not—</p><p class="p1">The wheel in his head stopped there. The wand slipped from his hand, and when it hit the floor, he felt only relief.</p><p class="p1">That relief didn’t last long. Severus blinked and found himself being lowered back into his chair—when had he stood up? He shook his cloudy head. The chair had been moved against the wall, and where it had been, the Aurors were rolling away a false floor to reveal a ten-foot concavity. Severus realized in horror that it was a Pensieve, large enough that even people in the public galleries could see the images on its surface.</p><p class="p1">“No no no no NO!” One last time, he flung himself against the chains, but they only glowed angrily and coiled tighter. An awful noise scraped its way out of his chest—if he made enough of a racket, perhaps they wouldn’t hear the voices in the Pensieve—</p><p class="p1">“Aurors, immobilize the prisoner, if you would.”</p><p class="p1">
  <em>“Petrificus Totalis!”</em>
</p><p class="p1">He couldn’t breathe—from the spell or the panic, it didn’t matter. She was there, in that phial, in the ocean of shimmering fog that now spilled into the Pensieve. Severus wanted to shut his eyes, like a child hiding from a monster, but his eyelids were as frozen stiff as the rest of him. Frantic, he rolled his eyeballs toward the top row of benches—at least he could avoid looking directly. But he could still hear.</p><p class="p1">
  <em>“I know what you are.”</em>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em>“What do you mean?”</em>
</p><p class="p1"><em>“You’re</em> . . . <em>you’re a witch.”</em></p><p class="p1">He’d hoped by some mercy they’d only watch his memories of the war. But this—he couldn’t even recall which memories he’d spilled for Potter in his desperation, he’d just gathered up the whole tangled mess—and now the court was going to see it all, every last treasured, shameful moment<em>. </em>His dirty little face as he adored the red-haired girl. Her brilliant eyes as the affection in them turned to wariness and then disgust.</p><p class="p1">At last, he got a breath into his lungs. His mouth and tongue couldn’t move—but if he exhaled hard enough, he might be able to . . . yes. His vocal cords produced a feeble hum. Not a very loud one, but loud enough.</p><p class="p1">
  <em>“I’m sorry!”</em>
</p><p class="p1">
  <em>“Save your breath.”</em>
</p><p class="p1">He gasped, and hummed louder. Louder and louder, until his chest and throat burned. After some struggle, he managed a tune—a rude old song his mother had sung—<em>there was an old sailor came over the seas, ha-ha, but I won’t have him—</em></p><p class="p1">From the Pensieve came the roar of wind in the trees and the crack of Apparition. <em>“Well, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort have for me?”</em></p><p class="p1">Severus hummed around the sob that spasmed in his throat—<em>my mother said, won’t you bring him a stool—I brought him a stool but he sat like a fool—</em></p><p class="p1">
  <em>“If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her—”</em>
</p><p class="p1">Love, love, LOVE—the word tore at him—he was dying—why, why wasn’t he dying? <em>Then mother said, will I put him to bed—I put him to bed but I wished he was dead—</em></p><p class="p1">
  <em>“After you have killed me, Severus—”</em>
</p><p class="p1">He wouldn’t weep. At least the spell would prevent them from seeing his face crumpled in anguish. He swallowed his tears and hummed with all his might. <em>Then mother said, would I hurry and wed—I said I’d not wed—so I shot him instead—</em></p><p class="p1">
  <em>“But this is touching, Severus. Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?”</em>
</p><p class="p1">The tiny panicked mammal in his brain summoned its last defense. It was as if a wire had snapped and a curtain fell over his mind, muffling the clamor of his foolish distress under heavy, dusty cloth. The world went away. He was flying backward down a corridor, the bright door at the end growing more and more distant until it hung in space like a buildingless window, shrinking until it was no larger than Venus at dawn, and there was no sound in that place except the breath of eternity hissing between the stars—</p><p class="p1">“Mr. Snape? Mr. Snape!”</p><p class="p1">The void turned back into the glowing membranes of his eyelids. He opened them. The Pensieve was gone and his chair had been returned to the center of the room, but he didn’t remember it happening. He felt like a swimmer floating in the sea of his body.</p><p class="p1">“Mr. Snape, if you would please attend to the verdict!”</p><p class="p1">“. . . Verdict?” He croaked as if he’d been screaming for days.</p><p class="p1">“Yes, Mr. Snape, the court has voted and will now deliver a verdict, if you could be bothered to take an interest.”</p><p class="p1">He shook his head, trying to clear the smoky film from his eyes. “I’m—listening.”</p><p class="p1">“On the charges of murder and conspiracy to aid Lord Voldemort, the Wizengamot finds the accused—not guilty.”</p><p class="p1">A curious pain lanced through him and passed. He wondered if Doge saying <em>guilty</em> would have felt any different.</p><p class="p1">The room had already erupted in a frenzy of noise. Whistles, cheers, hoots, laughter, all losing distinction in a savage excitement. Not over Severus, not over the trial—excitement for its own wild sake. He had the oddest thought that at the moment the verdict was spoken, he had ceased to exist.</p><p class="p1">Doge’s expression was sour as he brought the room to order. “On the lesser charges—though that’s relative, I suppose—of Unforgivable Curse-casting and accessory to murder, kidnapping and torture, in light of the extraordinary circumstances, the court has accepted the deal proposed by the Minister for Magic: dismissal of all charges in exchange for aid in the capture of fugitive Death Eaters. As the defendant provided this aid weeks ago while awaiting his trial, this court’s business with Mr. Snape is concluded and he is hereby free to go.”</p><p class="p1">As if they had as much faith in the verdict as Doge had, the chains reluctantly let go of his wrists. People poured down from the benches and galleries. Severus looked around, baffled—their faces seemed distorted, their movements inhuman. He shut his eyes. <em>Get ahold of yourself, </em>he thought. <em>Get up. Get out. </em>He stood, and nearly fell.</p><p class="p1">“Mr. Snape?”</p><p class="p1">An Auror had caught him by the elbow. Something was thrust into his hand—his wand. He clutched it until his fist ached.</p><p class="p1"><em>Don’t look at them. </em>He staggered through the waves of thrusting bodies, trying not to imagine the grasping and tearing of hostile hands. One hand alighted on his shoulder and he recoiled, but it found its way back, steering him this way and that until he was passing through the door.</p><p class="p1">Down the corridor past the cells, up the stairs—Severus felt like a passenger in his own body. He could only vaguely feel two men pressed into either side of him, each with one of his shoulders in their grip. From under his brows, he spotted the gold glint of Shacklebolt’s earring, then Robards’s blue silk cravat. He couldn’t remember what they were doing there, but he let them steer him down the corridor.</p><p class="p1">As the golden grilles of the lift shut behind them, both men sighed and let Severus go. “Atrium,” said Robards. “Get ready, Snape—it’ll be worse up there.”</p><p class="p1">The lift juddered to a halt and opened onto a wall of noise and bodies. There were camera flashes now—his name shouted from all directions—some shouts distinctly angry while others demanding he face their way—more flashes—</p><p class="p1">
  <em>Laughter—taunts—“Hey, Snivellus!”—</em>
</p><p class="p1">They knew they knew <em>they knew</em>.</p><p class="p1">He was dangling in the air with his pants on display. Weak, wretched, clutching his shabby, hopeless love to his chest—every man, woman and child in the Wizarding World would laugh themselves sick.</p><p class="p1">He tried to step back, but Robards and Shacklebolt urged him forward. They were going through, then—fine. <em>Just get out, </em>said his mind. <em>Get through, don’t look, get out, flee.</em> He ducked his head and shouldered more bodies out of the way.</p><p class="p1">Up ahead, among the forest of legs, a bit of bright green satin flashed. Severus’s eyes followed the fabric up its wearer’s back to a bouncing corkscrew curl.</p><p class="p1">As if it had heard a kitchen timer go off, the icy water in his veins began to boil.</p><p class="p1">Dillby spun round as Severus approached, his face registering puzzled recognition and then alarm as Severus’s hands locked around his throat.</p><p class="p1">“I’LL KILL YOU, YOU BASTARD—HOW DARE YOU—YOU HAD NO RIGHT—!”</p><p class="p1">The next few moments were lost in confusion. His limbs were seized, his fingers pried loose—Dillby’s neck slipped out of his hands—shouts of <em>“everyone calm down!”</em> and <em>“get him out of here!”</em>—whether “him” meant Severus or Dillby, he never learned—then the crowd divided into two, like a ball of dough, one half wrapping around Severus and the other absorbing the figure in green. The dough ball dragged him through the lift door, the grilles clanked shut, and a voice said “Level Two!”</p><p class="p1">Shacklebolt leaned against the wall of the lift while Robards mopped his face with a handkerchief.</p><p class="p1">“Well, Snape,” panted Shacklebolt, “you’re off to an excellent start.”</p><p class="p1">“I never promised to be a good sport,” Severus murmured, his voice sounding very far away.</p><p class="p1">In the office of the MLE Head (which was Robards now), Shacklebolt pushed Severus into a chair while Robards, bizarrely, shook his hand. “A most hearty congratulations to you, Snape,” he said, smiling. “And of course, many thanks for your contributions to the effort.”</p><p class="p1">Severus stared at him as if he were a lunatic who’d run up to him in the street. He was still shivering with rage, and he felt weak, as though he had the flu. “I want to leave,” he said.</p><p class="p1">“Wouldn’t recommend it just yet.” Robards chuckled. “My Aurors are clearing the Atrium, but it’ll be a little while.”</p><p class="p1">Shacklebolt thrust a cup of tea under his nose, then practically dropped it in his lap when Severus made no move to accept it. Severus took a sip, for no other reason than to avoid any more conversation. The cup’s bottom clattered against the saucer as he tried to put it down.</p><p class="p1">He wanted to be alone. He never wanted another human being to look at him ever again.</p><p class="p1">Shacklebolt reached into his cloak pocket and took out the phial of memories and the feather. “Before I forget—these are yours, I believe.”</p><p class="p1">Severus snatched them and tucked them away.</p><p class="p1">Watching the phial’s journey to safety, Shacklebolt said, “I’m sorry. I know how it must have felt to be—exposed like that.”</p><p class="p1">Severus wanted to vomit. He wanted to break Shacklebolt’s nose, or worse. Clenching his jaw to keep his teeth from chattering, he said, “You have no <em>fucking </em>idea.”</p><p class="p1">“I want you to know that Gawain and I had nothing to do with that. Harry as well. We kept Lily’s name out of the trial for as long as we could.”</p><p class="p1">Rage pulsed up through his neck and throbbed in his temples. “Really? What a relief. I hereby absolve you, Minister. Happy?”</p><p class="p1">“Snape.” Shacklebolt’s voice lost its pacifying tone. “You’d have died in prison. Your health is already poor, and residents of Azkaban on both sides of the bars want you dead. You’d not have lasted out the year.”</p><p class="p1">“I still might not,” he muttered.</p><p class="p1">“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p class="p1">“Nothing.” Snape noisily cleared his throat. “When can I leave?”</p><p class="p1">“Are you sure that’s wise?” said Shacklebolt, glancing at Robards. “With you—looking the way you do?”</p><p class="p1">Severus narrowed his eyes. “And how <em>precisely</em> is that?”</p><p class="p1">“Like you’ve been through the wringer and haven’t slept in a year.”</p><p class="p1">“I don’t want to curse you,” said Severus calmly, “but I will if you force me to stay here a moment longer than I must.”</p><p class="p1">Shacklebolt sighed. “Do you at least have a place to stay?”</p><p class="p1">Severus froze with his teacup halfway to his mouth. “Has something become of my house?”</p><p class="p1">“We—didn’t know if you had one.”</p><p class="p1">“Well I did. Unless someone’s burnt it to the ground, it should still be there.”</p><p class="p1">Robards pulled a steno out of his pocket and flipped to a blank page. “Did any Death Eaters know its location? Are there adequate protection charms in place? I can assign you a security detail.”</p><p class="p1">“No!” Severus snapped before getting ahold of himself, aware that the more unhinged he acted, the more likely they were to force him to stay. “No—just the Malfoys knew. And any Aurors who come round will be summarily Stunned.”</p><p class="p1">Shacklebolt wore a troubling look of pity that made Severus want to beat him unconscious. “And you’re sure you can settle back in on your own?”</p><p class="p1">“I’ve been looking after myself just fine for years without you there to give a damn!” Severus snarled. He was <em>finished</em> with this.</p><p class="p1">Shacklebolt held up his hands. “Fine, fine. I should know better.”</p><p class="p1">Overcome with sudden exhaustion, Severus rubbed his face. He needed to leave, right now, before he said or did something he regretted<em>.</em> Or <em>would</em> regret, once the momentary satisfaction had passed.</p><p class="p1">“Er,” said Robards, “your Floo can be reconnected by tomorrow morning—now that we know you have a house, we can put in the request.”</p><p class="p1">“And Snape”—Shacklebolt made to touch Severus’s shoulder, then thought better of it—“I hate to do this to you, but I need you to stop by my office tomorrow. We have a few follow-up questions about the statement you gave last week.”</p><p class="p1">“Fine, fine.” Severus thought about ever coming back to this building and shuddered, but he needed this conversation to end.</p><p class="p1">An interoffice memo flapped into the room, and Robards snatched it out of the air. “Looks like the lads have got the Atrium cleared.”</p><p class="p1">Severus shot to his feet, barely managing to set down his teacup without knocking it over.</p><p class="p1">“Go home and rest, Snape.” Shacklebolt smiled—warily, sensing Severus’s mood. “I’m glad things came through for you. We all are.”</p><p class="p1">“I’m sure,” Severus muttered, and hurried out.</p><p class="p1">He was so consumed by the need to escape that he took several moments to work out where he was. Once he found the lift, he made it down to the deserted Atrium and Flooed up to street level.</p><p class="p1">For a long while, he could only lean trembling against the tiles of the Whitehall men’s loo. At last he stirred himself and shook the water off his boots. Disgorged by a toilet—God, what an appropriate end to an unspeakable week.</p><p class="p1">But he wasn’t quite out of the woods. He glanced morbidly in the mirror, careful not to look at his face—nothing to be done about that—but his clothes were another matter. His holding cell had come with a few amenities Azkaban had not—a razor, a washbasin, sufficient food, clean clothes—but he still looked less than reputable, not to mention like a fucking Wizard. He Transfigured the robes into trousers and a jacket, splashed some water on his face, and headed out to the street.</p><p class="p1">There were plenty of nearby Apparition spots—his preferred one was the loo in McDonald’s—but he felt too sick and shaky to Apparate, and more than that, something in him wanted to avoid going home for as long as possible. He quickly turned off Whitehall Road, unwilling to face the tourist hoards of Trafalgar Square, and headed for the Embankment, where he could get the Tube to Euston Station and then the train to Cokeworth. Halfway there, he ducked off the sidewalk, leaned over and sobbed. It felt a bit like vomiting, as if he were expelling the stress and misery from his body, and the almost narcotic stupor that followed was almost worth the swollen face and the headache. After a few seconds he finished, wiped his face on his sleeve, and resumed his journey.</p><p class="p1">Outside the Tube station, he bought a pack of cigarettes and stood on Villiers Street to smoke one. It wasn’t peace, exactly, but a numbness that felt terrifyingly temporary. He knew he ought to be feeling something, but his body was like an empty bottle, hollow and transparent. He wondered if the people passing by could even see him. The noonday sky was white and uniform, flattening everything with its shadowless glare, and the world looked to him as if a unique and irreplaceable magic had passed out of it. Tourists in white t-shirts and ugly sandals blundered from one souvenir stand to the next, unaware that joy and beauty were over, and had been for some time.</p><p class="p1">That was what his great task for Dumbledore had been, after all—a way to keep her in the world, if only in the form of an invisible creditor waiting for him somewhere, expecting final payment. With their debt settled, she was truly, undeniably gone. And any world without her in it was a dung heap.</p><p class="p1">He didn’t want to go home. What was there to do in that house besides pack himself up in a box and store it with the rest of his parents’ rubbish? It was worse than that, though. There were . . . <em>things</em> waiting for him at home. Soon the shock-induced numbness of the morning would wear off, and when he stepped back into the house on Spinner’s End—assuming it was even still standing—the horrors of the last twenty years, dammed up so ruthlessly, would break their dikes and crush him under one devastating wave. He couldn’t predict what he would do once that happened. What <em>he </em>would do—that scared him most of all.</p>
