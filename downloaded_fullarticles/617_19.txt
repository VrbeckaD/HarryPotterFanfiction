          <div class="userstuff"><p>harry wasn't sure why he felt this way. voldemort was dead, harry killed him, hogwarts would be restored in less than 6 months, it was all over. harry knew this, yet he hurt. fred had been dead for 7 hours now, lupin and tonks less than 5, lavender's body was still missing and even worse, dennis and colin creevey had been found.</p><p>in fact harry could <em>barely</em> remember who he had left in his life. </p><p>ron gently gripped harry's shoulder, who then turned to see the face of a stranger staring back at him. ron's warm smile, soft blue eyes, and gentle hands were gone. replaced with cold shaking fingers covered in dried blood and soot, darkened eyes filled with sympathy and grief, and a mournful frown twisted on his purple tinted lips.</p><p>
  <em> harry mentally counted ron as one of the corpses. </em>
</p><p>"hermione?" he asked, scared for the response as he pushed the broken frames of his glasses up his face. ron looked at the ground and kicked a rock, "she's alive — <em><strong>or at least i think she is.</strong></em>" he let out a rough grunt that was intended to be a laugh, "hard to tell these days what life is." harry would smile if he could.</p><p>"anyone need me yet?" </p><p>he settled for a lighter question instead of the thousands of hurtful thoughts in his mind. they trickled in anyway. <em>how many? are our parents alive? is george still huddled around his twin's body? did anyone tell collin's parents? or lavender's father?</em></p><p>"they've needed you since the day you were born harry." </p><p>ron sunk down on to the debris-filled ground and looked up at the bright sunrise, harry scuffled to sit next to him but kept space.</p><p>"i fucking hate sunny days" he said, harry swallowed the lump in his throat, "i hate everyday."</p><p>"that was quite a stunt malfoy pulled… draco, i mean" ron started blabbering, "i don't think i've ever felt bad for him or his family but i guess they didn't really have much of a choice, well lucius did i suppose. you should've se—" </p><p>rage settled in harry's stomach, as he let it eat into the sadness with it's fiery temperature. "how could you say that? feeling bad for them? they're— lucius is the whole reason our friends are dead, it should've been me—!" "you don't mean that" ron lashed back, raising up on his feet with a sympathetic look. "you cannot make me believe, ever, that you blame anyone for this other then yourself. harry, mate, you did everything you could and more, you're the only reason any of us are alive still."</p><p>harry wanted to throw up, so he did, but ron continued. "you tried to help sirius that night, you gave lupin the sense to go home, you're the bloody reason—"</p><p><em>"I'M THE REASON THEY ARE DEAD RON. I'M THE REASON MY PARENTS ARE GONE, SIRIUS AND REMUS, FRED, CEDRIC,D  ALL OF THEM. I NEVER WANTED THIS TO HAPPEN—"</em> breaking into sobs, harry tugged on his dirty black hair. ron gently reached out and held his best friend in his arms. "i know it's hard harry, but none of this could've been avoided. everyone that died? they died doing something they believed in, that's the best way anyone can go." harry clung onto the smooth wool of ron's sweater.</p><p>"<em>you'll stay with me</em>?" he asked, harry knew his question didn't make much sense, that he couldn't find the right thing to say. ron squeezed tighter, "<em>until the very end</em>." </p><p>harry's emerald eyes flickered shut and his painful searing of his scar was absent for once in life, and all would be well.</p></div>
