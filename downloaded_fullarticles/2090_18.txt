    <p>I do not own HP.</p>
<p>Xx </p>
<p>"well boy? My breakfast isn't going to cook itself!" the latch on his door slammed shut with a resounding metal clang as the pig man walked away.</p>
<p>Bahamut sighed as he slowly moved into a sitting position. Eleven years, eleven bloody years he's been dealing with the ruddy pig man and his pig family. One day, yes, one day he'd roast the pig man alive and eat him. That's what any other dragon would have done long ago. Unfortunately, Bahamut couldn't do that right now as he had yet to regain his full strength. Hell, he had yet to regain any strength as he was, to busy keeping this fragile body alive. If it died… he shuddered to think what would happen to his soul if it did.</p>
<p>Slowly he got up. stretching malnourished aching muscles and started another day doing the pig family's bidding. Cooking, cleaning, gardening, most of the chores the pig son should be doing really. But alas it wasn't in the cards it seemed. Bahamut had flown through this worlds skys for many millennia. Seen many humans and their strange going ons. At his age nothing much should have surprised him. It did come as a shock however when the pig family had started to force him to into slavery at a young age. From what he understood the neck woman was brood kin to this body's mother. He understood humans fairly well from his own dealings with the fragile beings sure, but this? He wasn't sure what the neck woman's motivations were.</p>
<p>Bahamut was brought out of his thoughts a spoon collided with the back of his head. "pay attention boy! If you burn my bacon, you'll regret it!" his eye twitched, snarling at the man in his mind. Slow roast he decided. Low heat with a touch of honey. That's how he was going to prepare the pig man when he got his body back. Just then the pig son walked in as well. His piggy blue eyes slowly counting out the mound of presents that were on the table.</p>
<p>"thirty-six? That's two less than last year!" the pig son threw a tantrum. The neck woman doing all she could to calm her brood down. Bahamut plated the bacon and eggs he had been overseeing, swiping a few pieces of the cooked pig stomach for himself, and placing it in front of the pig family with the same enthusiasm one fills a trough on a farm. He decided not to stay for the pig sons' tantrum. Opting for the dusty relatively barren solace of the cupboard. He could understand why some people might not want to stay in a dusty cupboard under some stairs.<br/>
Bahamut didn't mind it though. He was a dragon after all. Dragons had a preference for caves, though those caves were normally filled with mounds of gold and jewels. Well his old cave was at least, for he was a very, very old dragon. His newer kin preferred to stay bound to their reservations and live lazy carefree lives. Bunch of freeloading hippies if you ask him.</p>
<p>He was sure his brother, Hraesvelgr, would be rolling over in his hoard to see his descendants so lazily accepting their lot in life. Well Bahamut would be sure he would if the lazy bastard would ever wake up. though he did wonder what his younger siblings were up to these days. He knew Nidhogg was off trying to fight, fuck or kill something or other. Midgardsormr was still swimming and eating and just generally being a glutenous fuck last time he checked.</p>
<p>Yes, the old guard seemed to be forgotten these days. What would father Tiamat say? Well probably nothing, he mused. Tiamat was more the 'beat-you-till-you-got-the-message' sort of parent. Bahamut briefly wondered what he'd have to say about his current situation? Trapped in the fragile body of a human child? Disgraceful.</p>
<p>Briefly he overheard the pig man and the neck woman arguing over something or other in the kitchen. Something about the squib woman who always watched him on days like today. He gave it little thought as he closed his eyes and briefly looked inward. He developed this habit long ago when this body was that of an infant. He was checking on this body and the souls inhabiting it. Souls are powerful things. Every creature has one. Some are large, like his. Some are small, like a squirrel. A body is designed to fit a specific size of soul. You can't have more than one soul occupying a body. If this happens one soul would inevitably make the other wither away to nothing. That is exactly what happened when he was stricken of his power and crammed, rather uncomfortably he might add, into the body of a yearling child.</p>
<p>During this time, he was extremely confused and thrashed around within the body trying to force his way out. Bahamut felt slightly guilty at this now. By the time he calmed down the damage was done. The child's soul was damaged and began fading. It would have done this over time of course, his soul was to large for the body to be able to comfortably contain them both, his draconic core and the child's budding magical core. That didn't mean he hadn't felt guilty over it. He spent the next few days as the soul left this plane trying to soothe it and comfort it until it finally ebbed away. All that was left of Harry James Potter was a small ball of magic, the infants core.</p>
<p>Bahamut faintly noted that the pig son's cronies had arrived. He paid them little mind as he looked at the other soul that was STILL here. He noticed it several days after the yearling's soul had vanished. At first, he hadn't known what it was. Less like a soul more like a leech. Black and greasy, evil seeped out of it like a dementor on the hunt. It was latched onto him. Feeding off his soul to keep alive. This he would not allow. So as before he threw another rage filled tantrum in the body. Thrashing and screaming till the leech was thrown off his soul. Bahamut downed it in a sea of draconic magic. He threw everything he had at it. But it. Would. Not. Die! This enraged him every time he looked at the blasted leech. On the bright side, it had eroded over the years. Right now, it looked like a dried-up raisin. this was a good thing, Bahamut supposed, it meant it would be gone sooner than later</p>
<p>Bahamut was torn from his musing as his cupboard door was thrown open by the pigman. "get your coat boy! Ms. Fig can't watch you today so you're coming with us." The pig man grabbed Bahamut by his baggy hand me down shirt. "and if you ruin my dudders special day. You. Will. Regret it." He was tossed violently back against the wall of his room.</p>
<p>Great… he thought. A whole day with the pig boy and his goons. A splitting headache started to form behind his eyes. He swore he could hear the leech laughing at him.</p>
<p>Xx </p>
<p>Hello.. You may be confused as to why a dragon is inhabiting Harry's body. But what would a good story be if showed all my cards in the beginning.</p>
