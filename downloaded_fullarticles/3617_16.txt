  <em>Don't look at him. Do not look at him.</em>
</p><p>Minerva sat straight backed, hands clasped together on her lap, repeating the words like a mantra. If she looked at him, she would explode. She would fight him and then she would die. He wouldn't kill her, good God no, he couldn't kill her- but his master could. She was under no illusions that she would be able to fight her way out of death with Riddle but she knew that she would be able to kill Snape with a flick of the wrist. It was deliciously tempting, that was for sure. To see him crumple before her eyes, limbs broken, head bleeding would be delightful but not at the cost of her own life. Not yet, anyway. Soon. But not yet. </p><p>Instead, she sat with her colleagues, tight lipped and white faced but defiant. She knew that Snape sat in <em>his </em>seat, in Dumbledore's seat and was no doubt enjoying the feeling of superiority. He was probably sneering at them all, his thin lips spread in a smug smile as he looked down on those who had isolated him. There had been a time when she had felt sorry for him but now- Now she hated him with a fury that invaded her whole body. Albus had been a fool to trust him, why, so had she - how did they, two intelligent people, not see him for who he was? How did they allow him to marry their daughter? Would he have killed her if he had been ordered too? Could he kill Hermione? </p><p>Poppy moved her hand under the table and squeezed Minerva's. She didn't look up but continued to look straight ahead, at the plain stone wall behind Slughorn's head. She could hear Snape drone on and on, a machine blurting out what has been fed into it. How much longer could she suffer this? How much longer would she be able to sit, not six feet apart, from the man who had killed her husband? She could feel her wand in her pocket, suddenly heavy and noticeable as if it were calling out to her, begging to be used. How easy it would be to grab it, pull it from her cloak in one swift motion and aim. She wouldn't even need to speak a word and he would be dead, gone from the world and good riddance. She closed her eyes, fighting her twitching hand, cursing herself-</p><p>"Minerva?" </p><p>Snapping her eyes open, the voice made her skin crawl. "Yes, Severus?" She hissed, still not turning her head to look at him. </p><p>"Do you agree?" </p><p>"Agree to what?" </p><p>"The timetable? You are on duty Thursday and Saturday nights."</p><p>"Do I have a choice?" She watched Horace's face widen with alarm and smirked a little. It was good to know that she still had some her gumption, after all she wasn't scared of Snape. She never would be. </p><p>"Must you always be difficult?" He barked. </p><p>She looked at him, turning her head quickly. Her green eyes blazed as she looked at him directly in his black, cold eyes, her mouth twisted upwards ever so slightly. He looked like he usually did - pale, pointed and sullen. To her satisfaction, he blanched slightly as she looked at him, obviously shocked to be looking straight at the woman he had widowed. "I agree to the rota...Snape," she smiled bitterly. "I'll wager that I will have bigger fights to pick." </p><p>The two Carrow's, their dark faces twisted, rose suddenly from their seats. Minerva clutched at her wand as Poppy lifted herself slightly from the chair. She watched them, ready to fight in a split second should they move towards their wands, her heart pounding in her ears with excitement- she should like to teach them a lesson or two. Despite their spitefulness and obvious joy of cruelty, neither of them were particularly skilled or swift,Minerva and Poppy could have them on their knee's within a minute. As Minerva began to pull her wand from her pocket, Snape held out his hands between the brother and sister. </p><p>"That is enough," he said slowly. "We have better things to do," he added to the siblings. </p><p>"As do we," Minerva said pompously, rising to her feet. "I assume we are done, Severus? Yes, well, Madam Pomfrey and I have some matters to attend to. We will be in my office should anyone need us." </p><p>They left quickly, Minerva marching into the corridor and around the corner as quickly as she could. She let out a breath and fell against the wall, letting go of her resolve as soon as she was certain that nobody but Poppy would see her crumble. She felt Poppy's hand squeeze her arm gently and she covered it with her own in thanks. </p><p>"Oh, Poppy," she said. "That man!"</p><p>"You are handling yourself so very well," Poppy smiled. "The Minerva I knew years ago would have killed him on first sight." </p><p>Minerva smiled wryly. "I'm tempted...more than tempted but something within me is stopping me. Before I had nothing to lose but now, well I can't leave this school on it's own can I? But, Poppy, it's so damn hard. That man killed my husband and he still walks the halls a free man. How can he have the gall to talk to me? To look at me even?" </p><p>"Because he has the greatest of defenders and yours has gone." </p><p>Minerva furrowed her thin brows - was that how the world saw her relationship with Albus? Had she been the damsel for most of her life? She suddenly thought of Grindelwald and the fight in the forest: Albus had stood in front of her, he had pushed her out of the way. And then there was the time with Riddle in the cottage; as he lifted his wand and Minerva prepared herself to die, it had been Albus who burst in and pulled her from the room. Oh, God and what about that night when she rid of the baby and she'd been dying? Albus had carried her! Albus had carried her all that way and brought her to the safety of Priscilla. All of her life, at every pivotal, life threatening moment it had been Albus who had saved her life. He had been the one to save her, every time. </p><p>She didn't know if she should be angry or terrified. Part of her knew that if he were standing before her now, she would be screaming at him- why did he have to control everything? Why had he never allowed her to be brave and take the fate which was hers? But even as she thought it she knew it was irrational to be angry at someone for saving her life - several times. She supposed it was wounded pride, rather than irritation, that provoked her anger. She had always thought that she was strong and capable. More to the point, she had always thought that's what people thought of her but obviously she was wrong - everyone had always seen that Albus was the only reason she was still alive. </p><p>But Albus wasn't here anymore, Albus couldn't save her. On her shoulders rested Hermione and the whole school. "<em>I need you here, Minerva, for when the end comes." </em>Minerva could of laughed. He had had no idea what he was saying - she couldn't protect the school. She couldn't even protect herself. She was terrified, a war was coming and Albus was not here to fight it. He had obviously expected too much from her and he was wrong - she wasn't capable of fighting in his place. She was a pale, lifeless comparison to him, how had he made such a grave mistake? She was going to die, of course she would die fighting, but she was going to die without having saved anybody. Poppy was right: Minerva's defender was well and truly gone. </p><p>"Yes," Minerva finally replied. "Mine has gone. Yours has gone. Everyone's has gone." </p><p>"What do you mean?" </p><p>She threw her hands up in the air. "Come on now! What the bloody hell can we do without Albus here? How are we supposed to win this?"</p><p>"Darling, you can't give up," Poppy said softly, though for a fleeting moment a look of fear lit up in her wide eyes. "We'll never win if you of all people give up. We're relying on you. Our captain is dead and now we look to you to lead your troops into battle." </p><p>"What a poor substitute I am," Minerva laughed bitterly. "I can't do this. I can't even kill Snape like I should." </p><p>"I wish my mother were here," Poppy snapped. "She wouldn't listen to this nonsense. Have I not got enough to do without soothing you? There is nothing wrong with you Minerva, you are clever, strong and your ability is near enough the same as Albus's. I will listen to you seethe about Severus; I will comfort you when you cry over Albus and I will listen when you speak about Eleanor but I will not be involved with this self pity thing. I haven't the patience, Minerva and nor would you."</p><p>Minerva smiled. "You're right. Positively right. What is the matter with me? I'll fight him, I'll fight him with my bare hands if I have too. I'll die but I'll have a bloody good time doing it!" She wasn't just saying it for Poppy, she did mean it. The determined streak in Minerva revelled at the thought of her words but the careful, thoughtful side of her was still concerned. </p><p>"Albus wouldn't have left you alone like this if he thought that you weren't capable," Poppy said. "He knew that he... well he knew that he was going to go, not by Snape's hand obviously but somehow, he knew that he was going to die that night. He would have changed it, he would have changed his plans." </p><p>"You think his death is all part of a plan of his?" </p><p>"Aberforth thinks so. He said that Albus never did anything without a plan, without some foresight into the future. He thinks that his death had to occur for some reason, no doubt to enable us to fight Riddle." </p><p>"Why would a plan of his involve his own death? He knew that he was the only person in the world that Riddle was afraid of. Why would he take away our one good and strong net and allow us to fall?" </p><p>Poppy shrugged. "When did we ever know what was going on in his head? Other than when you were in it?"</p><p>Minerva pursed her mouth. "But, someone must know," she said thoughtfully. "Somebody must know what his plan is otherwise what was the point in dying if nobody were aware of his reason for it?" </p><p>"Potter," Poppy said simply. </p><p>Minerva thought of the boy, the boy who had been hunted all of his life. She worried about him and thought about him a lot, especially now that he was missing but she knew that she worried because Hermione was with him. She was proud that Hermione was brave enough to stick with him no matter what but she still wished that their friendship hadn't blossomed as it had - Potter was always in danger, which forever put Hermione in danger. But she knew that Harry would never let anything happen to his friends before it happened to him. He was the same as her in that way - Minerva would die before she allowed anything to happen to Poppy. She would have done the same for Ellen, had she not been taken away in such a manner as she had. </p><p>It was Potter who had been with Albus the night he died. It was Potter with whom Albus mysteriously disappeared, only to come back and die within moments. She could still see him, lying on the grass face up towards the stars, his eyes still open and magnificently blue. He had hardly looked dead and for a moment Minerva had foolishly believed him to be alive, that was, until she looked up at the tower looming over them to see the dark figure of Snape, wand still in his hand, peering down. No man, no matter how great and power, would have survived that fall, even if Snape hadn't finished him off before he fell. She saw that face, the sparkling dead eyes, every night before she went to sleep, before she even thought about them as they were when they were alive. </p><p>"You think that he knows?" Minerva asked. "Is that why he's run off without a word? Why Molly hasn't heard from Ron and why I haven't heard from Hermione?" </p><p>"It's the only reasonable explanation," Poppy concluded. "Why else would he of taken Potter with him? Perhaps he has explained all to Harry, perhaps he even told Harry the manner in which he planned to die before Snape..." </p><p>"Killed him," Minerva said flatly. "Before Severus Snape killed him. To think, my daughter loved him. How could she? How could she not have seen-"</p><p>"You can't go into that," Poppy said. "Eleanor isn't here to explain it and there is no way that you can explain it for her. Perhaps, when Potter comes back you will know. Do you really have no idea where they are?" </p><p>Minerva shook her head. "No. They disappeared during the raid on Bill's wedding. Molly hasn't heard anything since." </p><p>"And the Grangers?" </p><p>"I went to their house. They do not know Hermione any longer." </p><p>"Oh, Minerva, she didn't!" </p><p>Minerva nodded slowly. </p><p>"She is most definitely your granddaughter. Braver and more selfless than anyone I've ever met." </p><p>"I worry about her every minute of every day," Minerva admitted. "I just wish that I knew something."</p><p>"And no-one in the order has heard anything?" </p><p>"No. The three of them have simply vanished." </p>
