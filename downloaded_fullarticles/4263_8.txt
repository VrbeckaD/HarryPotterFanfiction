    <p>The heart-pounding moment still echoed in his ears the next morning as he laid in the Hospital Wing bed.</p><p>
  <em>“Harry, Harry, you’re very confused, you’ve been through a dreadful ordeal,” the Minister said. “Lie back down, now, we’ve got everything under control…”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“YOU HAVEN’T!” Harry yelled. “YOU’VE GOT THE WRONG MAN!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Minister, listen, please,” Hermione said; she had hurried to Harry’s side and was gazing imploringly into Fudge’s face. “I saw him too. It was Ron’s rat, he’s an Animagus, Pettigrew, I mean, and—”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You see, Minister?” said Snape. “Confunded, both of them… Black’s done a very good job on them…”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“WE’RE NOT CONFUNDED!” Harry roared.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Minister! Professor!” said Madam Pomfrey angrily. “I must insist that you leave. Potter is my patient, and he should not be distressed!”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’m not distressed, I’m trying to tell them what happened!” Harry said furiously. “If they’d just listen—”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into Harry’s mouth; he choked, and she seized the opportunity to force him back onto the bed.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Now, please, Minister, these children need care. Please leave—”</em>
</p><p>They had managed to save Sirius, sure, but only by breaking who knows how many laws and going back in time in order to do it. Plus, Pettigrew had escaped and there was no telling where he went. Harry kind of wished that Professor Lupin had found him while he was still a werewolf and eaten him but then they’d never prove Sirius’s innocence.</p><p>He couldn’t believe it though, how could one word from Snape – Confunded – be so powerful that nothing they could say or do could fight it? He hated feeling that powerless so there was really only one thing he could do and that was exactly what Hermione would’ve done. ‘When in doubt, go to the Library,’ Ron had said of her last year and he was right; it did work though, not that he’d ever let her know it.</p><p>Harry put on his glasses and looked over at his two best friends.</p><p>The sun was just peeking into the hospital wing’s windows but they were still fast asleep in their beds, which wasn’t surprising with how eventful last night had been. He and Hermione had actually stayed awake for three hours longer than anyone else – though with how much time traveling she’d done this year that was only a guess – so he decided that she could probably use the rest. It looked like Ron’s broken leg was mended, though he had never been much of a morning person to begin with, so rather than waking them up he just let them sleep.</p><p>After a quick once-over by Madam Pomfrey, Harry made his way to the Library; the doors were open but no one was likely to be there since exams were over. Inside, he wandered about with no idea where to start looking; was Confunded a curse, a hex? Going by the how wizards liked matching the first letter of things together he thought it’d be a charm, but what kind?</p><p>That was when he turned a corner and almost walked right into the Hufflepuff Seeker that had beaten them in Quidditch this year – but only with Dementor help.</p><p>“Harry, what are you doing here?” the older boy asked from where he sat with his books as if they actually knew each other.</p><p>“Nothing,” he said quickly as he turned to walk away. “I’m just looking for something.”</p><p>“I’ll help,” the larger boy said as he got up to follow him. “I still feel bad for the Dementors ruining our match, not to mention destroying your broom. Gryffindor still managed to win the Cup but that’s not the point, is it?”</p><p>That got Harry to stop and turn around. Fred and George had said that – what was his name, Diggory? – had tried to get Madam Hooch to do a rematch but he’d had other things on his mind back then.</p><p>“You really meant it about having a do-over, didn’t you?” he asked.</p><p>“Of course,” Cedric said with a look as he joined him. “Where’s the honor in winning if you have to cheat to do it?”</p><p>“Er – right,” Harry said with grudging approval. It didn’t take away the sting of the loss, but it did help.</p><p>“In fact if I had my way we’d all be playing on the same brooms, that way it’d all be about skill, not about equipment.”</p><p>Harry didn’t say anything to that because he certainly wasn’t going to volunteer to give up his Firebolt when it was the fastest broom in the world.</p><p>“So what are you looking for?” the other boy asked.</p><p>“Oh – er – I’m trying to find out what ‘Confunded’ means,” he replied.</p><p>“It means you’ve been hit with the Confundus Charm. It’s over here near the Memory Charms,” Cedric said as he led him further into the Library. “Why would you be looking for that though?”</p><p>“Snape called me Confunded but I didn’t know what it meant,” Harry replied briskly.</p><p>“Ah,” the boy said distractedly as he stopped to crouch down near the bottom row of one of the shelves.</p><p>Looking about Harry reached out to grab a book called The Confundus Among Us when Cedric popped back up with a small book of his own.</p><p>“This will probably tell you everything you could possibly want to know,” he said as he passed the book to him and looked at the one he'd been about to take down. “Oh, you should always avoid the books that're placed in easy reach, they're pretty much written for idiots who only do the bare minimum," Cedric explained. "All the really good ones are at the bottom or the very top; no one ever looks there."</p><p>"Er – thanks," he replied. Thinking that it'd be rude not to say something more than that Harry asked, "So what are you doing in here anyway? I thought finals were over."</p><p>"They are but I figured I'd check my answers to see how well I did," the older boy said with a shrug. "After all, why wait weeks to find out?"</p><p>"Good point," Harry replied, thinking that it sounded like a particularly boring and Hermione-like thing to do. "Well, I don't want to interrupt you any more than I already have, so I'll just leave you to it," he said before the boy could invite him to join him. "Er – thanks for the book."</p><p>"Not a problem," Cedric said as Harry turned to walk away. "And Harry," the boy continued quickly, drawing his attention back. "Next year we'll beat you fair and square," he said with a smile before giving a small wave and heading back to his seat.</p><p>Harry looked for a place to sit, well away from the other boy. Everyone knew that Hufflepuffs were odd but Cedric seemed barely human. He was about as un-Slytherin as anyone could possibly get.</p><p>Reaching one of the tables that he, Ron, and Hermione had used for doing homework before Harry sat down to look at what Cedric had seemed to pick for him at random. Finally seeing the title though he had to wonder just how bad wizards could get with their fondness for naming things. It was called Curious Confundus Charm Cases by Cecil Cadwallader and the title probably would've been a lot longer if this Cecil person had been able to think of any more C-starting words to cram into it.</p><p><em>'Confundo, the Confundus Charm,</em>' the book started out, <em>'was once better known as the Confusing Curse before it entered the realm of mental healing because it's often been used to make people believe things that they absolutely know to be a lie.</em>'</p><p>Harry could see now why Snape had claimed that they were Confunded. How better to not have to acknowledge the truth than to make the person telling it believe that the truth was a lie? He continued on.</p><p><em>'What the people using it in this way fail to realize though is that in forcing a person to act contrary to what they know to be true will only result in rebellion, and that rebellion resides in the target's persons own damaged mind that they're supposed to be trying to heal. This rebellion only further damages the mind for it pits the target's mind against itself and will inevitably result in increasingly strange behavior, which will eventually result in a need for the patient to return for proper treatment.</em>'</p><p>This passage struck him as rather odd. Harry had been to the hospital wing often enough but he had never once wondered if there was any other sort of hospital or what their doctors were like. Surely the whole world couldn't rely on Madam Pomfrey for everything.</p><p><em>'A more proper way to treat such mind-damaged patients would be to use the Confundus Charm to reinforce a basic fact about themselves – the most innocuous the better – that the person already knows to be true. While this may not do much in itself, it can then be used to build upon – either through continued Confunding or simply through a more passive persuasive protocol, like conversation – in order to achieve the larger mental reconstruction and healing that's required to bring the patient back in line with reality.</em>'</p><p>While this hadn't been at all like what he had been expecting, Harry had to admit that it was rather interesting. Something like what this person was suggesting, starting things small and building to a larger more natural change, was so at odds with what they usually taught them that magic did. He wondered why this wasn't taught more often before realizing that when magic could do huge changes in a second, no one would be interested in doing things in a slower but better way.</p><p>The book continued on to show how something like this could be applied to various conditions that required what they called 'mind healing' and soon became increasingly boring. And though it did contrast how the smaller-change method compared to the strange behavior that the larger-change method resulted in, it didn't give any help at all to someone trying to fight the charge of being Confunded. After all, as the book pointed out, if someone were properly and repeatedly Confunded then you could get them to think, feel, and believe anything you wanted them to.</p><p>"Harry! There you are," someone said quietly nearby and he turned to see Hermione, his wild-haired and bookish best friend. "We've been looking all over for you."</p><p>"Oh," Harry said, wondering how long he'd been reading. "Where's Ron?"</p><p>"He went to the great hall after we'd checked the dorms," she replied, her sharp eyes darting the book in his hands. "He said it was to look for you but he probably just wanted breakfast. What are you reading?" she asked somewhat suspiciously due to his lack of interest in studying.</p><p>He quickly told her how he'd hated how being called Confunded and how not knowing how to say they weren't without everyone taking it as proof that they were had ruined everything last night and Hermione was quick to agree.</p><p>"Wait–," Harry said to something she'd said. "You knew what Confunded meant?"</p><p>"Of course I did," she replied as she sat next to him and his nose twitched at some floral scent. "I came across it a few months ago when I started reading ahead. Everything just happened so fast last night that I never got to ask if there was some way they had to check and see if we were actually Confunded. That way they'd know what we were saying was true."</p><p>Harry had to give it to her, that would've been a good thing to do.</p><p>"I don't know if it would've helped," he said instead. "According to this book, if you do it several times with small Confunds– Confundeds– Confundedsus?" Harry said struggling with what the plural of it would be.</p><p>"Confunduses," Hermione supplied.</p><p>"–Right," he said quickly. "Well, if you do it right, this book says that practically no one would be able to tell at all. And they never said if there was a counter to it or not – at least not yet," Harry added since he had gotten no where near through the entire thing, even as small as it was.</p><p>"That would make things difficult," she agreed as she moved closer to examine the book herself that made the girly floral scent seem stronger to him. Had she taken a shower, he wondered? When he thought of it though he could almost remember smelling it last night when she'd been latched onto him as they were riding Buckbeak up to save Sirius.</p><p>"Oh, this is well-written," Hermione said after a moment, quickly flipping back to the beginning to scan the first pages herself. "I can see why you were reading it; it's much better than the one I'd found. Where'd you get it?" she asked.</p><p>"Cedric Diggory found it for me," Harry admitted. "He said all the best books were the ones not in easy reach, and this was on the bottom of the shelf."<br/> Hermione scrunched her brow in thought at that.</p><p>"I hadn't noticed that before," she said to herself in a way that somehow reminded him that she was a girl. "All of the really informative books I've found had been those I'd had to work for–."</p><p>Harry tried hard not to imagine Hermione bending over or stretching up high to reach for something. His heart started pumping faster and it felt odd to be so close to her. Was it getting hot in here?</p><p>"–But I didn't think they did it on purpose," she said in a way that reminded him of his own lax studying, though in a way that was much less accusative than what Cedric did. In fact, it was almost funny.</p><p>Something tugged at the back of Harry's mind. Ron, in his most honest moments, had always called her 'brilliant, but scary' but when he really thought of it, Hermione was simply amazing. Not only was she super smart – which in itself had saved them several times – but she was an amazing friend.</p><p>True, she could get kind of naggy about schoolwork and did go to McGonagall when she thought his Firebolt could've been cursed, but that was just because she cared for them. She had faced basilisks, trolls, werewolves, and giant man-killing chess sets with him and never once even thought of backing out of it. And when he'd thought of it, she'd even gotten more lax about following the rules – she had broken several laws with him last night just to save the godfather that he had never known he had and barely bat an eye.</p><p>When it came to doing dangerous stuff, Hermione would do anything for him, and what could you call that other than amazing? And how much more amazing would she be if that was reinforced the way the book said that you could reinforce things? She'd be astounding. There wouldn't be anything that Hermione wouldn't be able to do and she wouldn't be afraid to do it if she needed to.</p><p>There was a weird squirmy feeling in his gut and a jittery feeling along his skin as he gave a few panicked thoughts about actually doing it. If she would benefit so much from it and never know it happened, how could he not do it? She could be Prefect, Head Girl, Minister of Magic, and leader of the entire wizarding world – eclipsing even Dumbledore – with just a little nudge so wouldn't the right thing to do be to do it?</p><p>Harry pulled out his wand as Hermione flipped another page. He was going to do it. For the good of his best friend, for the good of the world, he was going to give her that little nudge. He pointed the wand at her and tried to work some moisture back into his suddenly dry mouth. He was going to do this.</p><p>"Confundo," he whispered, causing Hermione to stop what she was doing.</p><p>His whole body seemed to seize up and his insides turned to jelly. He'd fucked it up! There hadn't been any sort spell or light or anything, and now she'd know that he was trying to use it on her. How could he have been so stupid?</p><p>All that worry suddenly drained away though when she turned to him with a slightly confused look on her face, almost as if she'd forgotten what she was doing there.</p><p>"You would do anything for me," Harry said, feeling much more calm again as he pocketed his wand. "Wouldn't you, Hermione?"</p><p>Her confused look cleared in an instant.</p><p>"Of course, Harry," she said quietly and with a nervous little smile before she quickly moved to bury herself in the book as her cheeks turned a nice shade of pink</p><p>His stomach did a bit of a flip seeing that. Hermione was a girl but she had never acted that way before; not like a <em>real</em> girl. That didn't have anything to do with the spell, could it?</p><p><em>'No, it couldn't have,</em>' he thought. <em>'I didn't mean it that way. Hermione knew that.</em>'</p><p>Harry looked at her again to see that while her head was determinedly angled down at the book, she wasn't reading. Far too often her eyes were darting over to him and her blush wasn't going away. Did–Did this mean that she fancied him? And what did that mean when she said that she'd do anything for him? The images of Hermione bending over to reach the bottom shelf and particularly the one of her stretching out to reach a high shelf popped into his mind again. He just had to know.</p><p>"Hermione," he said as he turned and inched closer to her, putting an arm on the back of her chair. "You'd do anything for me, right?" Harry asked again, feeling hotter than before.</p><p>"You know I would, Harry," she replied as her blush deepened a bit, her hands still on the table as if her whole body had been frozen.</p><p>"Would you–," he started, now very much aware that they were in a very public place and that anyone could come up to them at any moment. "Would you show me your breasts?" he asked, the words popping out of his mouth before he could think of them.</p><p>Hermione turned to look at him then, her shyness making it all the more thrilling.</p><p>"I'd do anything for you," she said.</p><p>"Show me," he breathed, unable to believe that something like this could even happen.</p><p>Hermione looked around quickly. Although they were off on their own and had a bit of privacy, she had to be thinking about how anyone could discover them. She'd refuse to show him if there was even a chance of someone walking up to see her tits hanging out, wouldn't she?</p><p>Instead of refusing though she quickly undid the clasp to her robe and pulled out the bottom of her shirt from her skirt. Unable to think of anything else, Harry thought for a moment that she was going to take off the shirt too, but all she did was unbutton some of the lower buttons. Then, with another glance around to make sure, Hermione lifted the bottom of her shirt and sweater vest up, and even used her thumbs to lift her bra out of the way as well.</p><p>He hadn't even thought about her wearing a bra before, or how odd it'd look with her clothes bunched up around her neck, and he certainly wasn't thinking about it now either. All he could do was marvel at her breasts. She was actually showing him! He couldn't believe it.</p><p>"D–Do you like them?" Hermione asked quietly, looking at him right in the eye.</p><p>"They're amazing," he said honestly, his eyes leaving hers to return to what was on display.</p><p>Harry didn't know how big her breasts were but amazing certainly covered them, especially the center nipple part that was becoming more crinkled by the second. Her breasts moved and slightly swayed with every breath she took, and the breaths she was taking were becoming deep. It made her breasts hypnotic. He wondered what it'd be like to touch them, but maybe that would be too much. No matter what, Harry didn't want to take advantage of her. She may have been willing to do anything for him before but surely before that spell that 'anything' had had a limit. That meant it was up to him to know where to draw the line.</p><p>"Do you mind doing this?" he asked, wanting to know how she felt about it.</p><p>"Of course not," Hermione said in a breathy voice as her breasts continued to shift. "Not really," she amended as she kept an eye out for intruders. "I never thought you'd ask, to be honest – and certainly not in the library," she said incredulously.</p><p>Harry drew his eyes away from her marvelous breasts to look her in the eye again. While she may have never thought of showing him her breasts before there was something in her eyes that said that she was enjoying it. It might've been the naughtiness of it or the fact that it was in the library – and he certainly liked both of those as well – but it seemed as if what she really thought was that she'd never even considered that he could be so daring.</p><p>If it hadn't been for the spell though Harry didn't know if she would've participated at all, and that made him feel that she should stop.</p><p>"That's enough, Hermione, thanks," he said finally, his eyes darting down to get one last look at her breasts before she hid them away again.</p><p>She smiled as she dropped her shirt. What he hadn't been expecting though was how... exciting it was to see her adjust her breasts to fit into her bra properly again though. Without a thought he'd thanked her again for it, which brought another small pleased smile even if she did roll her eyes while doing it.</p><p>This had been too good not to do it again later – and she did seem to enjoy it – so that wouldn't be wrong, right? The change that the Confundus spell had done was just a small one, so there still had to be a limit to what Hermione would do because of it, right? She was still the same Hermione, wasn't she?</p><p><em>'She's just... a little more daring,</em>' Harry thought, and that certainly wasn't a bad thing. <em>'She hadn't just blindly obeyed,</em>' he reminded himself as she refastened her cloak and stood to tuck in her shirt – though that did distract him for a moment when he noticed how thin and attractive her figure was too. '<em>She had been watching for people spying on us, so surely she would've stopped if she'd so much as seen a blur of movement, right?'</em></p><p>"Come on," Hermione said when she was done. "Ron's got to be through eating by now but we should still find him and let him know you're okay. Besides, I'm sure you need to eat too, all you ate last night was chocolate," she said in a very Hermione-like way that dispelled all his doubts.</p><p>He stood and followed her out of the library, the book that'd made it all possible left forgotten on the table.</p><p>Out in the hall Harry couldn't help but feel that things had changed between them. He felt connected to Hermione in a way they hadn't been before. He didn't know how to explain it but she must've been feeling it too for as they walked she moved over and bumped his arm with her shoulder, drawing his attention.</p><p>He smiled at her – and couldn't help but feel his cheeks getting a bit red – while she smiled and adopted a proud and unashamed look in return. That was definitely good, Harry decided. He didn't know exactly what was going on or what it meant, but it was definitely good and a change for the better.</p><p>There had to be a way to get more of that feeling. And when he thought of it, why should he stop changing things for the best when it brought out the best in people? It was just a little persuasion when you really thought of it. Sirius hadn't Confunded them last night but if Harry had known then what he knew now then perhaps he could've convinced the Minister of the truth.</p><p>There had to be a way that everything could be alright. He wasn't going to force anyone to do something wrong, but that didn't mean that he was going to stop them from doing something right if he could help it, even if it took a bit of persuasion to get them there.</p><p>Harry returned the bump that Hermione had given him and they went on to find Ron.</p>
