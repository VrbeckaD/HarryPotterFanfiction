    <p>After the war, everything happened so fast. All Draco could remember was that one moment, he was hugging his parents and being held by them, and the next, all three of them were being bound by those around them in the hall. He hadn't expected anything better, really, given their part in the battle, but it didn't make it any easier.</p><p>Then Potter had stopped the others. "No. Mrs Malfoy helped me. And I doubt she was doing more than standing here with her family."</p><p>"Regardless, Harry, she will need to be processed. If she had stayed home…" The new Minister, Shacklebolt, didn't seem to be pleased, but it didn't make it any easier to hear.</p><p>Draco wanted to rail at the man, but Potter had done it for him. "Kingsley, you can't—" He sighed. "What if it were your family? Would you have stayed home? Can you blame her?"</p><p>"I'm sorry, Harry. But we can't give her or them special treatment. But you can stand up for her when she stands before the court. Okay?"</p><p>It wasn't okay, but it would have to do.</p><p>So he found himself separated from his parents, locked in the cells at the Ministry along with far too many other witches and wizards who'd found themselves on the wrong end of the war. </p><p>Waiting.</p><p>For what felt like forever. Sure, he had a place to sleep, food three times a day, and a guard to watch him. At least, one who came by a few times a day to make sure he was still alive (or at least, Draco suspected he was checking he was, since nothing he said made a bloody difference in getting the man to respond with anything other than the same words every day).</p><p>Then something changed. A new group of guards came to watch the cells. And one of them was Potter.</p><p>The first time he'd seen him, Draco was shocked. "What are you doing down here, Potter? Shouldn't you still be celebrating your victory?"</p><p>"For your information, Malfoy, I happen to be trying out as an Auror. Not that it's any of your business. But I figured if I helped with the trials, it would at least show I can do things other than destroy madmen."</p><p>It was definitely a change from the usual. "So… you're going to be here a lot then?"</p><p>"I'll be sharing guard duty with a few others, and doing prisoner transfers to the courtrooms. When I'm not busy with other duties."</p><p>It was sobering. For a moment, seeing Potter almost helped Draco forget why he was there. "Right." He settled back in his bunk, looking at him for a moment. "How are they going?" he asked. </p><p>"I couldn't tell you, Malfoy. I'm not allowed. Not to a prisoner."</p><p>Draco scowled. "Not even about father? Please… I just want to know he's all right. And mother. I know you stood up for her before. Do you know…?"</p><p>Potter shook his head. "I can't, Malfoy. Not until your trial's done. You're supposed to be kept separate from the trials. They don't want you using someone else's defense to get free."</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes. "Please, you know that's not why."</p><p>"I do. But I can't. I'm sorry." And then Potter hurried down the corridor to the next cell before Draco could try anything more.</p><p>By the time Potter returned for his next guard duty, Draco was ready for him. He only hoped his plan would work. When Potter glanced in, Draco was quick to move to the bars. </p><p>"Potter."</p><p>"I told you, Malfoy. I can't tell you anything."</p><p>"Please. You can tell me some things. Just little things. And I'd be willing to offer something in return for each piece of information. I'd even be willing to sign a wizarding contract not to use anything you tell me in my trial, if it will make you feel more comfortable."</p><p>"You would?"</p><p>Draco nodded. "I just want to know they're okay."</p><p>Potter thought about it for a moment. "What are you offering in return? Or was the contract it?"</p><p>Draco shook his head. "Stories. Surely this can't be the most exciting job of all time. I can offer a way to make the time go faster. For every day you come visit. What do you think?" He knew it wasn't really much, which was why he'd offered the contract first. It was the more important bit anyway.</p><p>Potter frowned. "Stories?"</p><p>"No worse than sitting and reading a book."</p><p>"What kind of stories?"</p><p>"Up to you. What do you like?"</p><p>"I don't know." He frowned, then stepped back. "I need to finish my rounds. I'll let you know later, okay?"</p><p>Draco nodded, unhappy he wasn't able to get more from him. But pushing wouldn't make him more likely to agree, so what else could he do?</p><p>So Draco watched him walk away and waited. Again.</p><p>It wasn't until Potter brought his tray for supper he got his answer. "I agree to your terms. But I can't stay too long. So for every story, you get one question. Okay? And I promise to answer them as truthfully as I can. If I can't…"</p><p>"That won't be fair," Draco said with a scowl. </p><p>"I was going to say if I can't, then you get to ask another question. All right?"</p><p>Draco calmed, then nodded. "Fine." He took the tray from Potter, then settled on the bench with it next to him and picked up the sandwich. It wasn't high cuisine, but it was better than he'd expected it to be. "So when?"</p><p>"How about now?"</p><p>Draco blinked up at him, not having expected that. "Now?"</p><p>"I have to take your tray after anyway. This way I have an excuse to linger," Potter said </p><p>"Right." The problem was, now he had the chance, he didn't know what to tell Potter. "Um… did you want to hear anything in particular?"</p><p>Potter shook his head. "Whatever you're up to."</p><p>"Right…" Draco said again. He searched his brain for something, anything to tell Potter. Then the perfect idea came to mind.</p><p>
  <b>
    <i>I Am Pandora</i>
  </b>
</p><p>Have you heard the legend of Pandora? The one about the girl who opens the box and lets all the evil out into the world? That's me. I'm her. I'm Pandora. I'm the one who let the evil into Hogwarts. The evil which caused Dumbledore's death.</p><p>Some would say I'm taking a bit too much responsibility for the darkness we've so recently been through, but I don't. I know what I've done. I deserve worse than I am getting. Not that anyone else thinks so.</p><p>Oh, to be sure, they think I've more than earned a trip to Azkaban, but they see me only as a minor irritant. A boy from a pure-blood family, twisted to his family's needs.</p><p>They don't know. Can't understand I'm far more responsible than they could possibly give me credit for. </p><p>Who am I? Oh, well, I'm sure most have heard my name. Or at least my father's. Draco Malfoy. Yes, that Malfoy. The one who let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts. The one who caused Dumbledore's death. The one who foolishly took the Mark shortly after his sixteenth birthday because it was the only way he could think of to free his father. Never mind father deserved to be there. </p><p>But let me start at the beginning.</p><p>Two things fascinated me from a very young age: Harry Potter and the Dark Lord. From the time I could understand, father told me of them both. Of how our Lord tried to kill Harry Potter, a boy my own age, and failed. But some day, we would rise to greatness again, with the Dark Lord leading us.</p><p>I never knew anything different. Our world was filled with people like us: purebloods, moreover, purebloods who supported the Dark Lord, whether openly or in secret, though more in secret than not. Many, like father, claimed they were merely spelled to obey, but we, their children, were told differently. We were all merely biding our time until the Dark Lord could rise once more.</p><p>But there was another I hoped to meet. Harry Potter. Unlike my friends, I held a fascination for him rivaling my need to be a Death Eater. I was convinced, if I could have but a chance, I could bring him to our way of seeing the world. He would join us and the Dark Lord, and together we would all make the world a better place.</p><p>Understand, I had no concept of what my father truly meant. Yes, I believed Muggles and Muggleborn were a blight, it was their fault we needed to be so careful and sparing with our magic. But I had no concept of why, or what might happen to those people we deemed Muggle or Muggleborn. It was an abstract concept at best.</p><p>Then came Hogwarts, and with it, the realization of Harry Potter, and of what Muggles and Muggleborn were truly like. Somewhere, in the back of my head, I could see Muggles and Muggleborn were different, but my annoyance at Harry Potter and his friends, particularly the know-it-all witch who seemed to want us all to think her better than all of us, kept me from acknowledging what I could see plainly for myself.</p><p>And when the time came for me to choose, my path was only too clear. No one would help my father. So I had to help him myself. Show my true quality. I had knowledge even the Dark Lord did not, and through it, I would free my father, and we would rise to greatness once more.</p><p>Mother and Severus tried to argue me against it, but I was long set on my path by then, and nothing they could have said would have changed my mind.</p><p>It wasn't until I'd faced the Dark Lord himself I understood. There was nothing but hate in his snake-like eyes. Not for me, not for my father, not for our plight…  We were all just tools to him. And we would all die at his whim.</p><p>My suggestion was accepted gleefully. After all, he only ever managed to get one spy into Hogwarts. This would give him as much access as he wished, any time he wished. But it was not enough for him, even despite being a great advantage. No, he had another task for me. One that chilled me to the core—Kill Dumbledore.</p><p>He stated it as though he had given me a boon. As though I should bow and scrape and thank him for this favour of favours. But I knew it even then for what it was—a death sentence. Even should I succeed—and how could I, a mere student, ever manage to kill the greatest wizard who ever lived?—there was no way I would make it out of the castle alive. The castle itself would rise up against me, surely?</p><p>But there was no choice. If I failed, not only would father not be freed, but mother would be at risk as well. He would destroy us all, merely to show he could.</p><p>So I did what I was told, and Hogwarts fell. And Dumbledore died, though not at my hand.</p><p>The Wizarding World seemed truly lost, and each day after grew darker, with new and more horrific acts being played in front of my eyes. And all I could think was it was my fault. I caused this. I was the one to blame.</p><p>But there's another part to the story. Do you know that bit? About what else was in Pandora's box? Ah, well, that happened, too. And because of it, because I finally understood, everything changed again.</p><p>You see, I never thought I would have a chance to fix things. Then Potter and his friends showed up in our Manor. It was him. How could I not know? I'd seen him after so many Quidditch matches and scrapes. I knew what he looked like as well as my own face.</p><p>But I was also certain by then we would never win. I don't mean I thought the Dark Lord would never win, but that the Malfoy family would never survive, regardless. At least under the old Ministry, we might have had a chance, but under Voldemort's regime? We would never survive. Not for long, anyway.</p><p>So when father asked, I did the only thing I could do. I set my hope in Potter, just like the rest of the Wizarding World. If I'd been given a chance, I might have done more. But then aunt Bella saw the sword they carried, and everything else was swept aside.</p><p>And Potter ended up with my wand. Not an outcome I'd have predicted, and definitely not something I was pleased about. But perhaps it all worked out for the best.</p><p>For our Hope saved us, just like everyone knew he would. Potter defeated Voldemort, and it was because of me he could. For in taking my wand, in defeating me, he became the master of the Elder Wand. Not that I'd known at the time, of course, but still a far better outcome than Voldemort winning and destroying the Wizarding World.</p><p>So you see, though I let all the evil into the world, I also let hope escape, and because of that, he was able to destroy Voldemort, and so evil faded once more.</p><p>But the moral isn't Hope can destroy evil. Quite often, the two exist side by side, one never touching the other. No, the true moral is so long as Hope exists, evil will never win.</p><p>Just remember that. </p><p>
  <i>Fin</i>
</p><p>Once Draco finished his story, short as it was, both of them were silent for a time.</p><p>Finally, Harry spoke. "Is that really what you believe, Malfoy? It's your fault?"</p><p>"It was my idea, Potter. Knowledge I used against the school. For <i>him</i>. It was my fault Dumbledore died. Even if I didn't kill him myself."</p><p>"Life isn't like that, Malfoy. Maybe you knew things you shouldn't, and did the wrong things, but you couldn't have stopped him, either. I know that better than anyone. And well… Dumbledore was already dying. It's why he asked Snape to step in for you when it came down to it."</p><p>Draco blinked. "He did? When?"</p><p>"After they found out what you were up to."</p><p>Draco pushed the last of his food away, no longer hungry. "So… Snape really was a spy, then?"</p><p>Potter nodded. "I'm sorry if it upsets you."</p><p>If he thought about it, he supposed he should be, but he wasn't. "It's not that. I just… I wish… he'd been able to trust me. Save me. From myself."</p><p>"From your father's ideas, you mean. And we both know how impossible that would have been."</p><p>Draco nodded, then sighed. "So… do I still get a question?"</p><p>"Of course, Malfoy. I promised."</p><p>"Then do you know… is mother still here?"</p><p>Potter glanced down the corridor, then moved closer. "They released her," he said softly. "She helped me and, well… because she did, this is all over. It was enough to get her a commuted sentence for her part in the rest."</p><p>Draco hurried to the bars. "And father?"</p><p>"That's two questions, Malfoy. And I won't be able to tell you even if it weren't. You know that."</p><p>Draco sighed. "Fine. Right." He was silent for a moment, then moved to pick up the tray and hand it to Potter. "Here. And Potter?"</p><p>Harry took the tray, then looked up to meet his eyes. "Yeah?"</p><p>"Thanks."</p>
