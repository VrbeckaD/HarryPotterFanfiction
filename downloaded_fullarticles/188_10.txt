    <p>Birthdays had never been important to Harry Potter. The Dursleys’ never celebrated them  he only knew what day he was born because of a school project so when he woke on the morning of his tenth birthday to a package wrapped in silver and green paper he was surprised to say the least. He thought it was a mistake at first but his name was written on the tag with swirly writing. Didn’t know how his Uncle hadn’t seen it when he had gone to work that morning but he picked it up and ran his finger over his name. The package seemed to tingle as he touched it and Harry let out a breath before taking it inside and tiptoeing to his cupboard. Once inside he hid the package under the thin sheet he had for a blanket and then hurried to the kitchen where his Aunt was shouting at him to wash the dishes from breakfast before getting out into the garden to pull the weeds. </p><p> </p><p><br/>
“I have a headache so I can’t deal with your attitude today” She snapped though Harry hadn’t said two words to her all morning. He washed the dishes quickly ignoring Dudley who waddled back and forth from the living room to the kitchen to get snacks and drinks. He kicked out at him a few times but Harry was to distracted by the package hidden in his bedroom to care. </p><p> </p><p><br/>
Once he had washed and dried the dishes, carefully putting them away and avoiding all Dudley’s attempts to get him to drop them Harry went out into the garden. As always his aunt was wearing the only pair of gardening gloves though she just stood over him with her hands resting on her narrow hips. She would chat happily to neighbours when they walked passed but otherwise she only spoke to bark orders at him. His aunt kept him working in the garden all day, he was only allowed one stop to use the bathroom and he used the time to take some water from the tap to drink before having to go back out and clean out the shed. </p><p> </p><p><br/>
At four he was called in to make the dinner for Vernon and his hands were covered in blisters and bruises from his day in the garden. Nettle stings ran up his arms and he wanted to itch them to stop the prickling but he knew that it would just make it worse. </p><p> </p><p><br/>
“Had a fun birthday cousin?” Dudley laughed as the family sat down for dinner and before he could speak Vernon muttered; </p><p> </p><p><br/>
“Hope you weren’t expecting a gift, you get enough out of us just living here...” </p><p> </p><p><br/>
“Of course, Uncle Vernon” Harry replied finishing his meal and starting on the dishes eager to get back to his cupboard and open the package. He wondered if a neighbour had given put it there but it seemed unlikely. In the years that he had lived with his aunt and uncle only Mrs Figg, the batty old lady from down the road, actually talked to him the rest of them believed that he was a dangerous delinquent and she had never given him a gift before. </p><p> </p><p><br/>
Finally at half passed eight he was allowed to slip into his cupboard with a glass of water and a bucket and was told not to come out until morning. He heard the lock slide into place and then he waited for a few minutes before slowly taking out the package. For a moment he was positive that it wouldn’t be there, that he had imagined the whole thing but his fingers brushed against it and he pulled it out. The name seemed to shine in the dullness of the cupboard and the tingling feeling happened again causing the hairs on his body to stand on end as he untied the silver ribbon. </p><p> </p><p><br/>
With anticipation curling like snakes in his stomach he lifted the lid and looked inside gasping just  little too loudly as he saw that it was filled to the brim of sweets, and strange looking toys. There was a stick and a feather on one side and then a little sweeping brush on the other that seemed to hover when he touched it before zooming around the box that was holding it. Under the sweets and toys were books, the were tied together with another ribbon and although it was dark in his cupboard he was almost positive that the pictures were moving. Trying not to make too much noise he pulled out the items one at a time before taking out the books which seemed to be fairy stories but the names were nothing like the ones he had seen at school and sure enough the pictures were moving. On the front of the top was a wolf that was running up the side of a mountain and was called the Wolf who cried. The next books were all in the same vein, the tales of beadle the bard and a more adult looking book called Hogwarts; A history. He had no idea what a Hogwart was but there was a huge castle on the front along with a fancy looking crest. </p><p> </p><p><br/>
The last thing in the box was a thick looking envelope with a wax seal over the flap. The imprint in the centre was of a dragon and Harry smiled running his finger over it before he lifted it up and pulled out a slip of folded paper. It was written in the same hand as the front of the package and he carefully opened it out and started reading. </p><p> </p><p><br/>
“Dear, Harry Potter, allow me to introduce myself, my name is Draco Malfoy. I asked my mother when your birthday was and she informed me that it was the 31st of July. When I was with father in Diagon Alley I thought that I would buy you a few things. I hope that you enjoy them and that you don’t already have the books. Many happy returns, yours in hopeful future friendship...Draco Malfoy...” </p><p> </p><p><br/>
“Draco...” Harry whispered looking at the books, toys, and sweets again his eyes itching with a prickle of tears surprised that somebody, anybody he didn’t know would send him a present and he wondered if there was a way of sending a letter back to thank the mysterious boy.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
