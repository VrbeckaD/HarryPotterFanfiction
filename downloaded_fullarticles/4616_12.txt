    <p>“Remus…”<br/>
<br/>
There was an insistent tugging on Remus’s shirt, He was in a world of his own and was content to remain there while observing the ever moving crowd around him.<br/>
<br/>
“Remus…” the voice said again, slightly louder this time, still tugging at his shirt which he attempted to bat away.<br/>
<br/>
“Remus… come on, it’s time to go”<br/>
<br/>
Remus, awakening himself from his own thinking turned around to see the slightly stressed face of his friend.<br/>
<br/>
“Lily, time for what? Where are we going?” Remus asked<br/>
<br/>
“The Bachelor auction Remus, remember I asked you to be one of the bachelors…”<br/>
<br/>
Giving Lily a confused look “no lily, you never mentioned anything about a bachelor auction”<br/>
<br/>
It had taken Lily a week to convince Remus to attend the ball. It was for a charity that Remus couldn’t even remember the name of or it’s cause but he knew that Lily had been doing regular volunteer work for them for the past couple of months, trying to organise this event.<br/>
<br/>
Lilly was dressed in a full length green evening dress that hugged her curves, which contrasted strongly with her bright auburn hanging free and wavy down her back. She looked stunning.<br/>
<br/>
Lily began to ponder “Really? I thought I did” she said then suddenly snapping her attention back to Remus “then this is me officially asking you now”<br/>
<br/>
“No, Lilly”<br/>
<br/>
Remus really didn’t want to be here, he didn’t do well around crowds, let alone potentially being put in the spotlight. He wanted to be at home in the little 2nd story flat that he and Lily shared, curled up on their old leather couch in front of the fire with a good book, what he did every Saturday night while Lily went out with her girlfriends.<br/>
<br/>
Lily had convinced him to suit up for the night, and he had reluctantly agreed as he had no idea what else he would wear if he didn’t. The problem was the only suit he had was old and slightly too small for him, it was also the suit that he wore to funerals.<br/>
<br/>
He was trying the suit on when Lily walked into his Room. “Remus”<br/>
<br/>
“Lily, No!” Remus responded knowing exactly what she was thinking.<br/>
<br/>
“Remus, we’re going shopping”<br/>
<br/>
So he was wearing a typical black and white tuxedo at the event, that he was not at all comfortable in, he preferred his oversized grandpa jumpers after all. Lily had said that it suited him and he trusted her judgment, not that he really cared that much about what he looked like to others anyway.<br/>
<br/>
“Please Remus”<br/>
<br/>
“No Lily”<br/>
<br/>
“Please Remus! Don’t make me get all whiney on you”<br/>
<br/>
“Lily…” Remus growled “I’m not even good looking, who in their right mind would want to spend money on me”<br/>
<br/>
“Don’t growl at me Remus, you sound like an animal, you’re gorgeous, don’t even get me started on that. The auction is for charity and I’m sure there are plenty of rich men and women willing to spend their money on you for a dance and a date. I’m going up there too so you’re not going to be by yourself.”<br/>
<br/>
“Lily…” Remus pleaded with his friend<br/>
<br/>
“Remus, Please” Lilly pleaded back “we’re already meant to be up on the stage.”<br/>
<br/>
After a moment Remus replied “The things I do for you Lily”<br/>
<br/>
“Aww, you know you love me!” Lily said as she grabbed Remus’s hand and began to drag him through the crowd towards the stage where everyone was taking their places.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s lucky for you that I do”</p>
