    <h3>Acceptance</h3>
<p>Tears blurred his vision as Harry stood before the graves of his parents.  A cold wind blew his raven black hair across his face and caused him to blink his dry eyes.  He had been standing there for over half an hour and he still couldn’t make himself move away.  This was the first time he had ever seen his parents’ graves and he didn’t want to leave yet.  He had snuck away from Hogwarts and he knew Dumbledore was going to talk with him when he returned.  He hadn’t told anyone where he was going, not even Ron or Hermione.  He wanted to be alone with his parents.  He wanted to be able to talk to them without anyone judging him.  He wanted to let them know what he was doing with his life.</p>
<p>So many different emotions ran through him as he stared at the cold stone.  Would his parents be disappointed in him?  Would they still love him, knowing what he was doing?  Doubts began to rise up in his mind bringing more tears to his eyes.  He didn’t want to disappoint his parents.  He wanted them to understand what he was doing and be proud of him.  But what if they weren’t?  Could he continue on this path if he knew his parents disapproved?  He was so confused and frustrated that he let out a small whimper of grief.  Harry sat down on the ground and traced the letters of his parents’ names with his eyes.</p>
<p>“Would you both still love me, knowing what I’m planning on doing?  Would you be proud of me, or would you be disappointed in me?  Is Sirius there with you?  Would he be disappointed; knowing that he died for nothing?  Knowing that you both died for nothing?”  Harry's voice broke as he finished asking his questions aloud.  He still felt the ache of Sirius’s death, even though it had been over a year ago.  Sirius had been his last connection to his parents.  When he had died, Remus had gone off on Dumbledore’s orders to negotiate with the werewolf packs and had yet to return.  Remus had drifted away from him and he no longer had a living connection to his parents.  All he had now were these two old grave stones to talk to.</p>
<p>Shakily, he raised a hand and brushed it across his mother’s grave stone.  What would she think of him?  She had died for him!  Would she be disappointed with his chosen path, knowing where it would lead him?  Finally, the tears that had been building up fell down his cheeks as he silently grieved for the parents he never knew.</p>
<p>He was so lost in his grief that he never heard the crack of apparation behind him.  Because of this, his heart almost burst out of his chest when an icy cold hand brushed across the back of his neck.  Spinning around and getting to his feet as fast as possible, Harry started into the bloody eyes of Lord Voldemort.</p>
<p>Voldemort stood a few feet from Harry and observed him with crimson eyes.  His black robes blew around him in the wind, and his snake like nose seemed to be scenting the air.  Harry felt tiny next to the Dark Lord who had no problems with allowing his power to be felt by all.</p>
<p>The two of them started at each other for a few moments, before Harry's shoulders dropped and his gaze fell to the ground.  Tears continued to fall down his cheeks as Harry stared at the brown grass below his feet.</p>
<p>“You should be at school, Little One.”  Voldemort's voice echoed through the quiet.  Harry nodded, but still refused to look up.  The Dark Lord took a few steps until he was standing right before Harry.  He lifted a hand and placed two freezing fingers under Harry's chin to make him look up.</p>
<p>“Why are you here, Harry?”  He asked his voice softer now that he was so close to Harry.</p>
<p>Harry's eyes met Voldemort's crimson ones briefly before he looked away again.  “I needed to see them.  I needed to talk to them.  I just needed to know what they would think about what I’m doing.  Are they going to hate me because I’m not choosing the path they were on?”  Harry asked, returning his gaze the Voldemort's.  His eyes were pleading for an answer.</p>
<p>“I cannot give you an answer to that Harry.  I didn’t know your parents at all.  I cannot tell you how they would feel.”  Harry felt his heart drop at the Dark Lord’s words.  “However,” Voldemort began again.  “From what I’ve heard about them, I think they would be proud that you are thinking for yourself and doing what makes you happy.  You have broken away from the Old Coot’s manipulations and you are thinking about yourself and what you should do.  I think they would have been bad parents if they weren’t proud of you for that.”  Voldemort finished, using his two fingers again to make Harry look at him.</p>
<p>“I just don’t know what to do anymore.  I can’t go back to Dumbledore, knowing how he manipulates everyone to do his bidding, but I’m not confident that my parents would accept the path I’m on now.”  Harry whispered, still keeping eye contact and allowing Voldemort to see the emotions racing behind his eyes.</p>
<p>Voldemort allowed his hand to drop and he stared coolly at the boy before him.  “Would it help if I apologized?”</p>
<p>Harry's eyes snapped to Voldemort's in shock.  The two stared at each other again.  Voldemort's eyes were closed off, assessing Harry and what his answer would be.  Harry's eyes were wide wish shock that Voldemort would actually be willing to apologize for something.</p>
<p>After thinking it over for a moment or two Harry sighed and shook his head.  “No,” he stated.  “No, it wouldn’t help.”</p>
<p>“And why not?”  Voldemort inquired.</p>
<p>“Because you wouldn’t mean it.  You aren’t sorry that you killed them.  It was war and they were in your way.  They died protecting me from you.”  Harry whispered, but it still traveled in the silence for the graveyard.</p>
<p>“And because they died to protect you, died to make sure you lived, do you honestly think they would be disappointed with how you chose to live your life?”  Voldemort questioned as he started circling Harry.  “They died so that you could live and I think they would be proud that you are living the life you want.  Is this the life you want, Harry?”  He asked, stopping behind Harry and leaning in to smell the boy’s hair.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Harry breathed out after a moment of contemplation.  “I want this life.  I don’t want to be trained to kill someone or have to be prepared to die young.  I want to live my life without the world putting its problems on my shoulders.  I want to be free and stay with you.”  All these words rushed out of Harry's mouth as thin, cold arms came forward and wrapped around his waist.</p>
<p>“Then you need to stop worrying about what other people are going to think.  Your parents aren’t here anymore and you can’t live your life based on what you think they would have wanted.  This is your life, Little One; no one else’s.”  Voldemort's words caressed Harry's neck as his head fell back to rest on Voldemort's boney shoulder.  Voldemort smirked against Harry's neck and pressed a few kisses against his pulse point, smirking wider as Harry released a small whimper in appreciation.</p>
<p>“Yes.”  Harry breathed out, his eyes falling shut as Voldemort gripped him tighter, preparing to disapparate.  “It’s my life and I want to stay with you.” He finished, his breath hitching as Voldemort bit down and pulled the boy close to him until there was no space between them.</p>
<p>With a loud crack, the two figures disappeared leaving nothing but the silence and the two cold, grey headstones as witness to Voldemort's victory.<br/></p>
