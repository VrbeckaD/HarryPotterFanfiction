    <p>"Daddy!" </p>
<p>A small toddler came running around the corner with a gigantic smile on her face. She had on a turquoise dress and some black shoes. She tilted her head as she came to stand in front of a tall man. His hair was a midnight black with dark orbs. Just like one of her eyes were, the other one was blue. She was special, or at least that was what the people around her said. </p>
<p>"This is her?" The man asked in a monotone voice. </p>
<p>Raven tilted her head as she studied the man. They had told her that she was meeting her father today. She squinted her eyes. He had a weird nose. <br/>"Daddy?" She asked again, this time a little more hesitant. She needed confirmation that what she was saying was in fact right. </p>
<p>The man looked down at her again, the corners of his mouth twitched a little. "Yes that's her." The woman answered with a smile on her face. <br/>"Then yes, I am daddy." He kneeled down right in front of her. </p>
<p>Raven took the time to study her new found father and gave him a tooth full grin. She blinked up at him, "Do we go home now?" She asked, a quiver of uncertainty filled her voice, but somehow she knew he wouldn't turn her down. </p>
<p>"Yes, now we go home, princess." He made a motion to pick her up and she accepted greedily, her tiny arms wrapping around her new daddy's neck as he begun to walk towards the door. Her eyes gliding over the orphanage she had been living in for the past year, ever since her mother had died. She scanned over the familiar surroundings for the last time. She didn't cry. It had been a long time since she'd felt this excited. </p>
<p>"Home." She repeated the word as she laid her head in the crook of his neck. Coming to find that it fit perfectly. Yes, this was what she had been waiting for. </p>

<p>"Raven Snape!" </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A giggle echoed through the hallway not long after the words had been yelled. "Do you have my wand?" Giggle. The wooden floors in the hallway cracked as footsteps neared. "Raven, I'm not kidding. Come here, we need to go to Hogwarts or we will be late." </p>
<p>She held her breath as he came to stand in front of the bed she was laying under. She tried so hard but could not contain a giggle from slipping out. "Here you are." Before she knew it a hand grasped her ankle as she tried to get away. Laughs from both of them could be heard throughout the entire house as he dragged her from underneath the bed before lifting her up. He sat her on the bed, gently preaching his wand from her hands. </p>
<p>His smile fell off of his face. "I'm being serious, love." He touched her forehead with his hand. "I- This is very dangerous if you don't know what you're doing." He scolded lightly. </p>
<p>She frowned, "But you get use it." She worried her bottom lip as big eyes looked up at him. "I know that, but I've been taught how to use this." He stood, making sure to tuck his wand away safely. "I want to use it too!" She advocated, jumping up on the bed. So she was standing right in front of him. "In time, little  one. You will get you're wand. When you are old enough." </p>
<p>She sighed. "How many nights of sleep will that take?" She asked. He laughed, "Many still, and I hope they take some time. You are growing too fast darling." She rolled her eyes and shook her head. Making her curls bounce. "No, daddy. I'm not going to stay little forever."</p>
<p>Severus looked down at his daughter. "I know that, I know that." He placed her back onto the ground. "Now, get ready. Or Albus will get angry." </p>
<p>"No, he won't!"</p>
<p>And with that the four year old skipped down the hallway.</p>
