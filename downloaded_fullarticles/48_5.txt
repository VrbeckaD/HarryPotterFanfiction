    <p>He stumbles into her London flat late on a Wednesday evening.</p><p>He is battered and bleeding, mud dripping from his sodden coat, eyes haunted and desperate on her, and her heart is in her throat as she ushers him inside and maneuvers him onto her couch. She can just barely make sense of his mutterings, a mixture of endless apologies and something she knows better than to hope meant “<em>I had to see you</em>”; instead she brushes cool hands over his feverish skin and forces herself to slip into familiar patterns of her emergency healing training.</p><p>Wand swirling, she mentally works through the critical checkpoints: fractures, hidden contusions, internal haemorrhage, cursed wounds, infection, poison; readily applying immediate treatment wherever required. Then flicks her wand at the bathroom, filling the tub with hot water, and gently levitates him there, peels his clothing carefully away, determined not to wince at the angry pattern of bruises blooming across his protruding ribs. He mumbles feeble protests between more apologies, but his lids are heavy and he is just barely hanging on the vestiges of consciousness. Tenderly, she washes away the blood and the dirt as warm fumes bring the colour back to his face. She forces potions down his throat; restoratives and blood replenishers (endlessly thankful for whatever providence made her keep her emergency kit well stocked), then a diagnostic one just in case she missed something the first time around.</p><p>He falls asleep before the water has had the chance to cool and it isn’t until she has him dried and tucked into her bed that she finally breaks down.</p><p>She curls up on the floor at the foot of the bed and buries her face into her knees as her shoulders shake with silent sobs.</p><p>It has been two days – <em>exactly</em> two days, almost to the minute – from that dreadful night at the Astronomy tower. Two days since the world lost Dumbledore and she thought she had lost Remus for good.</p><p>It was all a blur to her still - the fight breaking out, their pitiful handful of fighters desperately engaging Death Eaters left and right; she had ducked out of the way of a killing curse that enourmus maniac was firing off all over the place, then froze in horror as that same flicker of green headed straight for Remus, whipping less than an inch from his ear. Had he turned his head half a second later, had he taken a step forwards instead of backwards, had that other Death Eater not come hurtling down the stairs at that precise moment... She was petrified, eyes glazed, watching realisation dawn on his paling face as Gibbon toppled, as if in slow-motion, at his feet. Numb with shock, she went full offensive on Rowle, metaphorically stretching herself as a human shield, as if to absorb all of his mad casting onto herself. She barely remembered the end of the fight, went through the motions of levitating Bill to the hospital wing, then Dumbledore - <em>dead</em>...</p><p>Her brain was on auto-pilot for the better part of that conversation.</p><p>And then, Fleur and Molly's completely unexpected showdown and --- well. In retrospect, her timing <em>really</em> is the worst. And he hated that, <em>of course</em> he hated it - he's always hated bringing private matters into the public. Afterwards, she could only listen in horrified disbelief as he announced he was going back to the werewolf camp, before being forced to leave herself, heartbroken and humiliated, to vacate her rooms in Hogsmeade on direct orders from the Ministry.</p><p>For two days she lived in that daze, work to Order meeting to home, convinced he was dead, or as good as, now truly all alone in his predicament.</p><p>Now the tears that streamed down her cheeks, she couldn’t tell whether they were from sorrow or relief. Pulling herself together abruptly, she rubbed at her face until it was red and raw and drew herself up to sit on the bed next to him. She felt his forehead, the fever seemed to be subsiding, and his breathing was deep and even. Careful not to rouse him, she leaned forwards and pressed a long kiss to his scruffy cheek, right at the corner of his lips, then silently left the room.</p>
