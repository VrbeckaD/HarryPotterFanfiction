    <p>Draco wanted so badly to bury his face in his hands, something that would be quite impossible to do if he wished to kill Blaise - in a painful and humiliating way, if possible - and watch all those curious expressions Potter was making, all at the same time. </p><p>‘A… lap dance’ Granger let the words sink in while her face turned a horrendous shade of red.</p><p>Weasley snorted by her side, all the eyes in the room turning to him. He was laughing so hard Draco pitied Potter for having such an idiotic friend. Not that Potter himself wasn’t an idiot.</p><p>‘Don’t worry Harry,’ the ginger was breathing hard when he spoke, a wide smile on his face. ‘I doubt Malfoy would be able to give a proper- a proper lap dance’</p><p>Draco could feel his friends freezing beside him and felt his lips form a smirk.</p><p>'You’ve never seen Draco dancing, I presume’ Pansy took another shot of Firewhiskey before handing the bottle to Draco.</p><p>For him to play something like Truth or Dare with Gryffindors - since now they were all stuck together in that bloody eighth year common room with nothing better to do - some alcohol was required.</p><p>Especially if he wanted to give his best in front of those arrogant pricks.<br/>
Draco drank until he felt his throat burning, acknowledged the courage growing inside him, and got up.</p><p>He walked straight to Potter and stopped right in front of him.</p><p>'There’ he pointed to the huge armchair in front of the fire which would provide a nice view of his show to all of them.</p><p>Weasley’s smile had faded completed by that point.  </p><p>Draco watched as Potter got up slowly and walked towards the chair, his eyes fixed on Draco like he expected him to hex him if he turned his them away. Draco just rolled his eyes, following the git towards the chair.</p><p>***</p><p>Harry’s cheeks were in flames. He was fucked, he was so fucked. He could only pray Malfoy wasn’t as good as Parkinson made everyone think he was, or the blond would probably wake up all those weird feelings Harry had tried so hard to bury deep inside him for the past few years.</p><p>'Sit’ Malfoy cocked an eyebrow at him.</p><p>'I think’ Parkinson said from where she was sitting, a wicked smirk on her face. 'I want you both shirtless’ </p><p>’What?!’</p><p>Draco sighed and Harry darted his eyes at him. No, Malfoy wouldn’t agree to this, right? He wouldn’t, why would he? But he was already unbuttonning his shirt, letting the silk slid down his strong shoulders and Harry felt his throat dry. He was doomed.</p><p>'Want me to help you?’ Malfoy took a step forward, Harry took a step back. The bastard gave him an angelic smile that didn’t match his eyes when the back of Harry’s knees bumped the armchair.</p><p>Harry unbuttoned his shirt as fast as he could and sat down.  </p><p>'Arms here’ Malfoy grabbed his wrists and placed them firmly on each arm of the chair. He was so close Harry could see tiny white scars all around those deeper one’s that covered Draco’s torso. His fault, he thought, darting his eyes away.</p><p>And meeting Draco’s instead. His irisis were blown wide, his lips wet, cheeks blushed. He was right there, Harry could reach if he wanted to and-</p><p>'No touching, Potter’ Draco’s voice was hoarse when he spoke, his words so precise Harry was almost sure the boy had read his mind. </p><p>Harry took too long to answer, to tell Malfoy he would never touch him willingly. To give him proper lies.</p><p>He gulped instead. Malfoy’s smirk widened.</p><p>'Who would want to touch you, Malfoy?’ Harry heard Ron’s mocking words. He saw Malfoy turn his back to him to look at Ron and for a second he thought the blond would walk away and leave him there.</p><p>The feeling of Malfoy’s thighs against his, the feeling of his ass brushing Harry’s crotch as he sat down on his lap was enough for him - and everyone else - to forget Ron completely.</p><p>'We’ll see, then’ Malfoy turned his face to the side and smiled at him.</p><p>***</p><p>Potter’s legs were strong, the muscles well defined. Draco tried to relax his shoulders, letting his head drop to one side. He exhaled, closed his eyes.<br/>
Potter was tense, his fingernails digging into the armchair. Draco rolled his hips tentatively, something hard immediately poking him from behind.</p><p>Oh. Oh. Fuck, so Potter- That was why he was so tense. </p><p>Draco bent down slightly, exposing more of his ass, and started to move his hips in a way only he could. Pansy was giggling from where she was. She knew better than anyone Draco was the best. He winked at his friend as he lowered himself on Potter’s lap in the dirtiest way he knew, rolling his hips without actually sitting down. </p><p>'Malfoy, that’s enou- AH ahh- fuck…’</p><p>Draco heard every Gryffindor gasp and even Blaise was gaping at them. Draco had sat down as soon as Potter’s words had left his mouth. What he would never have imagined was that Potter would actually grab his thighs and buck forward. </p><p>Holy. Fuck. He could feel all of it pressed against his ass.</p><p>'Do you want me to st-stop?’ Shit, why was he stuttering now? He was in control, he needed to-</p><p>Harry’s hand slid forward, unbuttonning Draco’s trousers before he could react. Then he was cupping Draco through his pants, squeazing his hard cock lightly. Draco let a small moan escape his lips. Granger covered her mouth with her hands while Weasley seemed on the verge of a heart attack by her side. </p><p>'Later’ Harry whispered in his ear before grabbing his hips and forcing Draco to get up.</p><p>Later. Later. With Potter.</p><p>Blaise would pay, Blaise would have to pay for waking up his feelings for Potter.</p>
