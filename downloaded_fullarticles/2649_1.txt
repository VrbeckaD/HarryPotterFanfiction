    <p>Andromeda Tonks is a light sleeper.</p><p>She always has been– she blames it on growing up with Bellatrix, who always liked to play <em>tricks</em> while her sisters slept. And then once she had moved out there was a newborn, and then the war, and god knows that kept her up at night. By the time she didn’t have to worry about Nymphadora waking or her estranged family members bursting down their door and slaughtering her husband and daughter, well. She’d rather gotten in the habit of stirring at any odd sound.</p><p>And He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back now, so it was a good thing too she never got out of the habit.</p><p>But the point is: Andromeda is a light sleeper, so it’s her who wakes at the sound of the doorbell. </p><p>She blinks until her eyes focus. The clock beside her bed glows blue, reads 2:46. The bell rings again, followed by the distant slam of the knocker against the front door, and a jolt of adrenaline courses through Andromeda’s veins. She scrambles out of bed and shakes Ted, asleep beside her. “There’s someone at the door,” she hisses when he stirs, then grabs her wand and makes her way downstairs.</p><p>It is not the enemy, she reassures herself. Death Eaters wouldn’t fucking knock. But it must be urgent, to come in the middle of the night. Urgent news concerning… Nymphadora? What else could it be? Oh, god. God, why did she have to be an auror? Why couldn’t she have wanted to… farm potatoes, in the countryside, or something?</p><p>When she reaches the door, she looks out the peephole. There is a single, hooded figure on the porch. Andromeda can’t see their face. She can hear Ted on the stairs behind her. She grips her wand tighter and opens the door.</p><p>The figure was reaching out to knock once more. Her hand freezes in midair. Andromeda sees the face under the hood, and her mind goes blank. “Cissy?”</p><p>Her little sister holds herself stiff and cold and does not reach out to Andromeda. “Can I come in?”</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Andromeda takes her to the kitchen. Narcissa does not seem to see Ted frozen on the stairs. He gives Andromeda a wide-eyed look as she passes, and she shrugs helplessly. He doesn’t follow them into the kitchen, but Andromeda is sure he is lingering in the hall outside, in case…</p><p>In case.</p><p>Narcissa lowers her hood. Andromeda stares at her. God, she’s a grown woman. For the past twenty-five years, she has existed in Andromeda’s head as a sixteen year old girl. But her face is that of a woman in her middle age– still beautiful, and with an elegance she had not quite grasped in her teens, but there are lines around her eyes and her cheeks are no longer round with youth and her eyes are deeply sad. Andromeda hardly recognizes her.</p><p>Andromeda does not know what to say, and Narcissa doesn’t wait for her to figure it out. “Dromeda,” she says, and it’s been so long since anyone has called her that, “I need help.”</p><p>She sounds desperate, and of course she must be, to come here of all places. “What’s happened?”</p><p>“My <em>son</em>, Dromeda,” her voice shakes. Her hands shake too, Andromeda notices only because she somehow cannot look her in the eye. “He’ll kill him. Please. Please, you’re my last hope”</p><p>“I don’t understand, what are you…” Andromeda trails off. She can’t absorb this, this collision of the old world and the new. Narcissa doesn’t belong to this part of her life, and to have to her here, under the florescent light with the hum of the fridge in the background, is surreal, impossible.</p><p>“It’s Lucius’ fault,” the trembling has spread from her hands and her voice to her whole body. “He failed, and the Dark lord is punishing us. Punishing <em>Draco</em>.”</p><p>Andromeda doesn’t remember exactly how old Narcissa’s son is, but she’s sure he’s not grown. No more than fifteen or sixteen, no more than a child. “Punishing him how?”</p><p>Narcissa laughs, but it’s bitterness and rising hysteria, no humor at all. “He says it’s an <em>honor</em>.” Andromeda’s stomach twists. She doesn’t want to know what He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named calls an honor. Narcissa continues hoarsely, “It’s a suicide mission. He’ll either die trying, or fail and the Dark Lord will kill us both.”</p><p>“Cissy, what–”</p><p>“He’s been commanded to kill Albus Dumbledore.”</p><p>Andromeda gapes. “That’s <em>absurd</em>.”</p><p>“Of course it is! That’s the point! He’ll never manage it; even if it weren’t Dumbledore, he couldn’t kill anyone. He’s just a boy.”</p><p>Twenty minutes ago, Andromeda was asleep, and now there is a child’s life being thrust into her hands to, somehow, save. Jesus. “What do you want from me, Cissy?”</p><p>“You need to <em>help</em> him,” Narcissa demands with a vicious desperation that cuts her to the bone. For a moment she sounds five again, running to Andromeda when Bella plays too rough. “You have connections to the Order, I know you do. Help him. Hide him. Get him out of this. I know you can.” And there it is, the reason Narcissa came to her, of all people. “<em>You</em> got out, Andromeda.” </p><p>Andromeda’s never felt guilty about leaving her family. She was smart about it, not like Sirius– she waited until she was an adult, she withdrew as much as she could carry from her trust fund, and then she cut all ties. She wondered occasionally about Narcissa– when she saw her engagement and her wedding and her child printed about in the society pages, when she caught sight girls who looked a bit like her (Nymphadora turned her hair white once, and looked so familiar it nearly gave her a heart attack), when random things like hair ribbons or perfumes in the shops sparked a memory– but she’s never even considered that she should feel guilty for leaving her behind.</p><p>Because Narcissa didn’t want to leave. She was happy. She believed in everything they sold, she… she was…</p><p>She was sixteen. And Andromeda left her, alone, to suffer Bella, and… and she married Lucius right out of school, and… was that her choice? Or was she encouraged by father and mother to the degree that she couldn’t say no? But she was happy. Andromeda couldn’t have convinced her to leave. She’s <em>positive</em>.</p><p>But maybe she should have tried.</p><p>Andromeda rubs a hand across her forehead. “I can try. Talk to some people, arrange a safe house under a fidelius charm for you two. We should be able to get you out by the end of summer–”</p><p>Narcissa interrupts. “He’s set to me marked in <em>two days</em>, Andromeda! And it’s done then. That’s the <em>end</em> of it forever.”</p><p>Andromeda blanches. “Two fucking days? Jesus Christ. Fucking <em>hell</em>.”</p><p>Narcissa looks betrayed. “I though you could help,” she says, accusatory.</p><p>“Are you– Cissy, <em>nobody</em> is going to take your word on this! You’re a Death Eater’s wife. You’ve certainly never taken issue with You-Know-Who before. It’ll take <em>weeks</em> to convince everyone this isn’t some scheme to, to infiltrate the Order, or–”</p><p>“Then don’t take my word!” Narcissa seizes her hand. “I’ll do whatever, I’ll– I’ll swear an unbreakable vow.”</p><p>Andromeda is blindsided for feels like the hundredth time that night. “You’d do that?”</p><p>“<em>There is nothing I wouldn’t do anymore!</em>” Narcissa cries, with a desperation all her own. Andromeda has never seen her like this.</p><p>But she recognizes it.</p><p>Insanity runs in their family’s blood. The Blacks burn hot and reckless and over-emotional, and Narcissa had always been the exception. She was ice where Bellatrix, and Sirius, and Regulus, and yes, even Andromeda, were fire. She was composed and careful and constant. In a family where madness was the norm, Narcissa remained stubbornly sane. Even her looks were icy, her albinism taking her family’s wild black hair and stormy grey eyes and turning them both a shining silver.</p><p>But right now, for her child’s sake, there is madness in her eyes.</p><p>“Stay here,” Andromeda commands. “I need to make some calls.”</p>
