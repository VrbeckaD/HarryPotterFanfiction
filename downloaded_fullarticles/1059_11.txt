    <p>The door shut behind Hermione with a sharp snap. With narrowed eyes, she strode away from the prefects meeting-room toward the Great Hall. <em>Bloody Malfoy.</em> Her lips tightened as she huffed. <em>Can't even be arsed to come to a meeting that he requested!</em></p>
<p>She shouldn't have been all that mad since she did get to use the empty room to make headway on some of her homework but it was just the rudeness of it all. <em>Shouldn't have expected differently from a prat like Malfoy</em><em>.</em> Except she had expected differently since they were Heads now. When she had gotten the news that they would be Heads together she had resolved to at least be cordial to him but even before she could offer a grudging truce he had set the terms by sneering at her and insulting her muggle heritage and her unpopularity and <em>her hair</em>. She had tried not to rise to the bait but he just would not sod off about it so she had given up and stomped away before she had to give herself detention for hexing him.</p>
<p>She passed by a window on the third floor when she paused, eye twitching. She stepped back and, as she had suspected, there was Malfoy out on the quad. Hermione hissed as she watched him and his friends, completing unrepentant to his dismissal of her. He laughed sitting on one of the stone benches with Blaise and Daphne as Pansy climbed onto the ledge before them and strutted with a smirk, modeling her altered school uniform. Personally, Hermione thought she looked ridiculous with her Slytherin necktie wrapped her waist and skirt hiked so high. It was also against the rules to wear a skirt higher than five inches above the knee and more than one button unbuttoned on her school shirt so technically Malfoy, as Head Boy, should have reprimanded her. Of course, he hadn't; not only just because of Slytherin loyalties, but also because of their questionable relationship.</p>
<p>She watched his stupid grinning face with curled lips, really stewing in her averseness for him before she walked away. <em>Insensate blighter!</em></p>
<p>She took a shortcut through one of the hidden statues and finally entered the Great Hall, still quite peeved<strong>.</strong> Only Ginny gave her a slight nod of acknowledgment as Hermione sat down. "Oh boy, look at you. Who pissed you off?"</p>
<p>Hermione huffed. "I was supposed to meet Malfoy for a meeting that <em>he</em> requested but he skived off and I just saw him having a jolly good time with his friends out on the quad." Ginny frowned with her.</p>
<p>"He did that completely on purpose. What an arsehole!" Hermione nodded her agreement before she shot a nod at the boys. Harry and Ron sat arguing heatedly over a parchment, Ron gesturing to it with grand hand movements while Harry furiously shook his head, nearly upending his glasses from his nose.</p>
<p>"What's that about?" Ginny gave her a look.</p>
<p>"Quidditch, of course! Has there been any other topic of conversation this millennium? I can't seem to remember..." Hermione snorted.</p>
<p>"I would've thought that you would like that, Ginny, since you're just as mad about it as they are." Ginny flicked her fiery red hair over her shoulder.</p>
<p>"I am but I would also like to <em>snog my boyfriend sometime this year</em>!" Her voice escalated until she was practically screaming the last bit. The conversation between Harry and Ron abruptly cut off as they both turned to her with horror. Ginny met their stares with a glare of her own. "Oh, I'm sorry, did I say that too loud? Let me try again. <em>I would like</em>-"</p>
<p>Harry clapped his hand over her mouth, face going red. "Ginny!" he hissed. Hermione couldn't help but chortle a bit as she ate.</p>
<p>"Oi!" Ron shouted indignantly, his face red with righteous fury. "That's bloody disgusting! I don't want to hear my sister going on about snogging my best mate!" Harry looked mortified as Ginny ripped his hand off her mouth. Hermione shared amused glances with Neville sitting across from her.</p>
<p>"Oh, so you'd rather I show you? Alright." Then she forcibly grabbed Harry's head with her hands and pulled him down to press her lips to his. Harry's eyes widened comically as Ron sputtered. Hermione laughed at her friends' antics. She was still laughing when a brown tawny owl plopped its massive body down by her food with a loud hoot. It stuck its leg out for her and she took the proffered letter with a small thanks.</p>
<p>
  <em>Dear Ms. Granger</em>
  <em>
    <strong>,</strong>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>We need some extra hands this Saturday, so if you're not too busy, would you like to come in for extra hours? Ideally, we would like for you to come in at 8 and stay until 2. Please send a response with Barny.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>All the Best</em>
  <em>
    <strong>,</strong>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Hippocrates Smethwyk</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Healer-in-Charge for Dangerous Dai Llwellyn Ward for Serious Bites.</em>
</p>
<p>Hermione reached into her bag for a quill and quickly penned an affirmative before sending Barny off.</p>
<p>"What was that?" Ron asked, the result of his argument with Ginny at a momentary draw. Hermione shifted uncomfortably. She knew Ron didn't like to hear about her internship with St. Mungo's since it only stood to remind him that he had been rejected from an internship with the Aurors Department. It also reminded him that Harry had also applied but had not been rejected and then it would become a...<em>thing</em>...again.</p>
<p>She did not want a repeat of summer so she shrugged dismissively. "Just some extra work."</p>
<p>Hermione wondered about Healer Smethwyk's letter and could barely keep her anticipation in check. <em>Maybe Healer Broward finally identified the bites from those six patients.</em> Dinner passed with Hermione contemplating what she might experience come Saturday. Things had been busy at St. Mungo's and she loved it. She had always wanted to be a doctor, influenced by her family of doctors like her grandfather, a retired neurologist, and her Aunt, a cardiologist. Her father and mother were doctors too but Hermione wanted to do more than fix teeth. She wanted to save lives. She wanted to find cures for diseases.</p>
<p>When Saturday rolled around, Hermione was bouncing with excitement. She assisted Healer Pye, her mentor, as they made their rounds around some of the less dangerously infected patients and learned more and more about some of the studies made on infectious bites around the world. Time flew by for Hermione as she shadowed and she hardly felt as if she had worked extra hours at all. She was just heading to report to Healer Smethwyk what she learned from Healer Pye when she stopped and her eye gave an involuntary twitch, a telltale sign that <em>Malfoy</em> was in the vicinity.</p>
<p>She took a step back, expecting to see that snarking, sneering face but was surprised when instead she saw Lucius Malfoy. He stood looking just as imposing as ever in dark robes made of the finest material- mulberry silk she suspected- with his long hair tied back and cane in hand. However, even though all the haughtiness was still there, Hermione couldn't help but notice something off about him. She narrowed her eyes as she examined him. His face—more portentous than Draco, she noticed— was more grey than pale. She observed that he did not hold the cane so much as gripped it for dear life with both hands. His back was still as rigid as ever but it definitely seemed, at least to her, that he wanted to hunch in on himself.</p>
<p>Her gaze fell to the healer that was speaking to Lucius but did not recognize him as anyone from her ward. Her eyes fell back to Lucius pensively. <em>Wonder why</em> <em>he's here?</em></p>
<p>Was he sick? Or was Narcissa? Or maybe no one sick and Malfoy was just checking to see if they needed any new medical equipment? If she recalled correctly, which she always did, Malfoy enterprise did dabble in medical sales...<em>It's none of my business anyway.</em> Hermione shook her head and continued on her way. Healer Smethwyk gave her the usual praise on a job well done and then requested that she come in again for the same hours next Saturday. Hermione readily agreed.</p>
<p>Saturday rolled around, and Hermione tried not to look out for him but couldn't help it. She asked Healer Pye if he had anything he wanted delivered to the other departments—already knowing that he would say yes because there was always stuff that needed to go to other departments— and he happily gave her a pile of things. She went to ward after ward, room after room, delivering charts and medical tools and yet there was no sign of the Malfoy patriarch.</p>
<p><em>Oh well, he was just here on business then.</em> Hermione shrugged it off and made her way back to her floor to tell Healer Pye she had completed her duties when her eyes caught the healer Lucius had been talking with before. She watched him flirt with the pretty welcome witch, Victoria, before he gave his goodbyes. Unable to control herself, Hermione followed the healer as he made his way back to his ward. They made their way up to the second floor, which was designated as the Hesper Gamp Ward for Magical Bugs.</p>
<p>Once there, the healer made a right turn as opposed to continuing up another floor and so Hermione followed. <em>I should go back to Heal</em><em><strong>er</strong></em> <em>Pye. I shouldn't be doing this.</em> But her feet wouldn't stop, and she watched, trying to look into every patient's room she passed and then, finally, her feet stopped. She found him. Luckily, his back was toward her as he stood facing his wife while she helped him put on his cloak. Hermione could not hear them, probably due to a privacy spell, yet Narcissa's face spoke volumes as she gazed at her husband. Hermione quietly walked away, the pair none the wiser.</p>
<p>There was no doubt in her mind anymore. Lucius Malfoy was sick.</p>
<p>The thought followed her back to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>"Hermione?" Hermione blinked as Padma gave her an amused look. "You enjoy your trip?" Hermione smiled, shaking her head before turning back to her arithmancy equation. "Why were you staring at Malfoy anyway? Can't help but succumb finally to his good looks?" She teased.</p>
<p>Hermione balked and threw a nasty glare at Padma. "Absolutely not! I just..." Hermione turned her eyes once again to the lousy sod that had occupied more space in her mind than he ought to have any right to. Unfortunately, Arithmancy class was one of the ones that were a mixed house class since not enough students elected to take it. Malfoy just had to be one of the few that did take it which meant she couldn't help but see him and wonder about him and his father.</p>
<p>Did he know about his father's sickness? Was it a life-threatening disease? Surely, it was something serious...Narcissa had looked so <em>gutted</em>. Draco, on the other hand, seemed not at all rattled which either meant he didn't know, or it wasn't as serious and Narcissa was just an overly distempered spouse.</p>
<p>"You sure about that Hermione?" Padma teased. Hermione shook her head against her thoughts and Padma's words.</p>
<p>She couldn't help but question if she should give Malfoy a hint if he didn't know about his father's illness. But how would she without seeming creepy? <em>Hey, Malfoy! You might </em><em>want </em><em>to reach out to your daddy and make sure he's alright. Got it, prat? Great.</em> That would not work out well in the least. Her eyes narrowed on the prissy twat's head. What was she worrying for anyway? Surely, if it got bad, Malfoy's parents would say something. She didn't have to be the one to do or say anything. There. Sorted.</p>
<p>But it still felt wrong to know something intimate about something he should know. <em>But Malfoy's a prat so really, who cares?</em> She huffed at her warring thoughts.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the bell rang before her thoughts could go in any more circles. She packed up and said a quick goodbye to Padma before exiting the classroom and making her way toward the moving staircase.</p>
<p>"Oi, Furby girl!" Hermione slowly closed her eyes in annoyance before turning to Malfoy.</p>
<p>"Don't call me that." She said giving him a deadpanned look. He had taken to calling her that in third year, going as far as buying a whole bunch of Furby animals and pelting her with them once on a Hogsmead trip. She hated it; they had bitten her with their creepy little teeth. They weren't nearly as cute as Pygmy Puffs. Ron always made sure to compare her to Pygmy Puffs whenever he teased her.</p>
<p>"I have to say after an hour of feeling your traumatic lustful stare, that there is no way in hell I'd ever return your feelings. I'd rather fuck a blast-ended skrewt than even touch you. Be sure to cut this way when you try to end your life after my rejection." Malfoy started away, smirking triumphantly. Hermione balked at his audacity and complete narcism. She could hardly let him get on thinking that she actually fancied him. The unmitigated gall!</p>
<p>"You unbelievable git! Only an idiot dumber than a troll would like someone as acerbic and pointy faced as you and last time I checked my name wasn't Pansy Parkinson!"</p>
<p>Malfoy paused and turned back to face her, unable to help but engage in banter. "Don't lie Granger. I know you've been watching me for a while now."</p>
<p>Hermione scoffed and crossed her arms. "This might be a shock to someone with such a big head like you but I don't like you. Not even an infinitesimal amount."</p>
<p>It was Malfoy's turn to scoff and it grated that he did it so much better than her. "Oh really, it's you who doesn't like me, is that right Granger? Why because you're so popular? Really got your pick of the litter coming after you like...let me think...Oh right, there is no one. No one likes you, Furby girl. Just stick-up-your-arse one and stick-up-your-arse two."</p>
<p>Hermione felt a hot heat inflame her face and gritted her teeth. <em>Low blow</em>. "Just because I have standards doesn't mean that no one likes me, unlike you who seems to date every girl in order to prove something. Are you neglected at home, Malfoy, is that it? Mummy and Daddy can't be arsed to care for their pathetic second-rate son?"</p>
<p>As soon as she said the words, she wished she could take them back especially when true malice contorted Malfoy's face as he stared daggers at her. "Are you sure you of all people should be bringing up parents, <em>mudblood</em>?" He hissed and Hermione felt the word like a slap in the face. He grinned cruelly as he stalked even closer to her. "At least <em>my</em> parents understand me. We come from the same world and I have always known my place in it. I have a real family here and don't have to impose myself on other pureblooded people like a <em>parasite</em>. I bet your parents are relieved that they only have to see an ugly freak like you a few times a year. Wish I could say the same. In fact, I bet more than half the school would agree with me."</p>
<p><em>Don't hit him. Violence is not the answer. Do. Not. Hit. Him.</em> They stared at one another, both a hair's breadth away from hexing each other bloody when Professor Vector exited her classroom.</p>
<p>"Goodness, are you two still here? Did you have a question? I was just on my way to lunch but..." Hermione looked away to give a pinched smile to her professor.</p>
<p>"No, I was just leaving, thank you, Professor." Without waiting for a response, Hermione turned and quickly hurried away, uncaring if it looked like she was running away. She just needed to regain some control.</p>
<p>Malfoy's words had no merit as Hermione was quite confident that she was beloved by her parents. It was only that there was some sad truth to the unfortunate chasm between them because they would never have a place in the Wizarding world and therefore could not help her in it. She could not rely on them like Ginny and Ron could with their family nor Harry with his parents. She could not ask them for advice in ways that were important which meant she had to go to the Weasleys or the Potters. It smarted, especially with all that she had to do in order to get her internship at St. Mungo's. If Headmaster Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall hadn't offered to write her excellent references she doubted she would have gotten it despite her impressive litany of scores and skills.</p>
<p>Hermione sighed as she moved on to her next class but refused to mope about it. She didn't want Malfoy to think he actually managed to hurt her.</p>
<p>"Hi Neville," she said, taking her usual seat in Defense. Neville gave her a smile and she blinked with sudden realization as another one of Malfoy's insults wafted through her mind about no one fancying her.</p>
<p>Neville. <em>Neville.</em> He was single and kind and they got along rather well. She remembered that he had asked her to the Yule Ball last year and they had a great time together. She hadn't thought about it at the time but didn't that perhaps mean that he might have special feelings for her?</p>
<p>She blushed and gave him a sideways glance as Professor Lupin began the lesson. Neville had gotten even taller over the summer and his face had lost all traces of baby fat. She liked the way he had rolled up his sleeves, showing off his manly forearms. He looked...<em>fit</em>.</p>
<p><em>Oh goodness! I've lost it! I just called Neville's forearms manly!</em> She shook her head at herself and focused back on Professor Lupin before she could embarrass herself any further.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p><em>'No one likes you, Furby girl'</em> became a steady mantra in her head. Surely, Malfoy didn't have a point there. Surely, someone liked her. Hermione frowned. It was hard to find prove against Malfoy's cruel taunts. No one had ever confessed to her, not in the romantic way that Harry had to Ginny in the common room. Not even in the boorish way Ron had to Parvati in Professor Binns' class of all places. She glanced again at Neville, just as he absentmindedly raised his sugar quill to his mouth to suck on the end.</p>
<p>She quickly averted her eyes, blushing madly. Maybe it would be worthwhile to ask if Neville had meant anything special when he asked her to the ball last year. <em>But wouldn't it be strange to ask nearly a year later?</em> It definitely would. Hermione decided then to ask the only two people she knew would have the answers. Lavender and Parvati. Those two gossiping fiends even knew things about herself that she didn't know.</p>
<p>Sitting in the Gryffindor common room later that night, helping Harry and Ron with their potions essay while revising her own, her opportunity came.</p>
<p>"Can I just...?" Ron slowly extended his hand toward her essay like a tentative newborn fawn. Hermione brutally slapped his hand away, ignoring his answering whimper. "No." Harry snickered beside her and Ron shot him the finger.</p>
<p>"Baby, how much longer is that going to take?" Hermione's head snapped up at the sound of Parvati's voice. Ron shot Hermione a glare before turning to his girlfriend.</p>
<p>"I don't know ask <em>this</em> one." He said with a brutal point in Hermione's direction.</p>
<p>"Actually, I wanted to talk to you for a second." She said, gaining interested glances from both Parvati and Lavender who had come down from the girls' dorm with her. Lavender smiled as she draped herself over Parvati's shoulders, giving Hermione an up and down look.</p>
<p>"Oh? Are you finally going to let us give you a tarot reading?" The blonde asked with a cheeky grin. Hermione rolled her eyes. Hard.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"But-" Parvati started but Hermione cut her off.</p>
<p>"No." Lavender rolled eyes and straightened from her reclined position over Parvati. "Then what do you want, Granger?" she asked with an impatient pop of her bubblegum. Hermione shifted uncomfortably before grabbing the two girls.</p>
<p>"Hey! Be gentle!" Parvati protested.</p>
<p>"Did she hurt you darling?" Lavender asked raising her free hand to brush some of Parvati's hair away. Hermione rolled her eyes again as she let them go. She would never understand these two's relationship. Sometimes it seemed entirely too romantic to be normal but then again they both had boyfriends so...</p>
<p>"Sorry," she said unapologetically. She then whipped out her wand and performed a quick '<em>Muffliato.</em>' Lavender and Parvati gave her twin curious looks.</p>
<p>"Okay, you've got our attention." Hermione fidgeted a bit under their curious gazes. "Wait, are you coming out to us?" Lavender asked. Hermione's eyes widened as she blushed.</p>
<p>"Goodness, no!" She breathed giving a shocked little laugh. Parvati raised a brow.</p>
<p>"It's not like it's ridiculous to think that <em>you</em> would, Hermione."</p>
<p>"What, really?" She asked. Did people think that she was lesbian?</p>
<p>"No need to look so horrified, Granger." Lavender chimed in with a slight glare. "I'm pansexual and Vati is bi." Hermione blinked at the announcement.</p>
<p>"Oh, you didn't know?" Parvati tilted her head. "I thought you did and that's why you came to us, so you don't have to be afraid to come out."</p>
<p>"Er, well," Hermione nervously, tucked her hair behind her ear. "I didn't know and I appreciate you two being so candid with me but that not why I asked to speak with you." She took a breath. "I was actually going to ask if you heard if Neville-"</p>
<p>"What, this is about Nev?" Lavender interrupted and Hermione was again reminded why she didn't hang out with her roommates more often. "Oh my god, please don't tell me you wanted to talk to us about Neville!" Lavender and Parvati shared a look before bursting out laughing. Hermione blinked unsure about their reactions.</p>
<p>"What?" She asked when neither one continued.</p>
<p>"Oh, you poor thing." Lavender shook her head, long blonde hair nearly hitting her face. "Your timing couldn't be worse." Hermione bit back a noise of impatience.</p>
<p>"Why?" Lavender and Parvati calmed, Parvati reaching out to pat Hermione's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Neville had fancied you since first year." Hermione's heart involuntarily spiked at the news. "But after last year at the ball, he knew you would never fancy him that way so he gave up on you."</p>
<p>"Yeah, and now he's madly in love with Hannah Abbott. Hannah told Susan who told Emily who told Padma who told us that she thinks Neville is <em>the one</em>." Lavender finished giving her a pitying look.</p>
<p>"Oh, I see." Hermione looked down, unable to help her disappointment.</p>
<p>"You know, that's kinda why people think you like girls and were just too muggle about it to come out. I mean, you never showed any interest in <em>anyone</em>. Not a cutie like Ron or a hottie like Harry-" Hermione chose to ignore the backhanded insult.</p>
<p>"Hey, you say that as if Harry is better looking than my boyfriend," Parvati broke in, turning to Lavender with a frown. Lavender shrugged, speaking over Parvati's indignant snort.</p>
<p>"Well, Harry is quite fit."</p>
<p>"But Ron is taller and he's got those eyes-"</p>
<p>"Yeah, but Harry's got even better eyes and being taller doesn't make a man hotter."</p>
<p>"That's bullshit. Tell that to Seamus,"</p>
<p>"Don't you start on my man, Vati-"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't if you hadn't started with mine-"</p>
<p>"Well, Seamus can fuck better than-"</p>
<p>"Er, well, thanks, you two. I'm just going to go back to my essay." Hermione quickly walked away leaving Lavender and Parvati to compare highly inappropriate things about their respective partners. She sat back down in a sort of daze, mulling over the very enlightening albeit exhausting conversation.</p>
<p>"Er, should we ask?" Harry asked in a tentative quiet voice. Hermione shook her head and didn't even so much as glare at Ron as he slowly slid her essay back into place.</p>
<p>Throughout the next day, Hermione was distracted by her vain thoughts. People thought she was a lesbian and Neville had given up on her because he thought she was a lesbian. And Lavender...and Parvati...They had identified their sexual orientation because they had already had sex with enough people to know what they liked.</p>
<p>Hermione wondered what was wrong with herself. She was older than the lot of them yet she had never even kissed anyone let alone had sex with someone. She concluded that she must be hormonally underdeveloped since she hadn't even felt the want to. In all honesty, even hearing that Neville had held a torch for her didn't excite her in any other way that she hadn't really expected it. Shouldn't she want to date by this age? Shouldn't she crave sex and intimacy?</p>
<p>On her break, Hermione decided to pay a visit to some of the case studies on sexual diseases. She scoured the information, trying to find anything that sounded similar to her own lack of sexual interest but found nothing. She was just making her way back to Healer Pye when she spotted her.</p>
<p>Narcissa Malfoy didn't look up from where she stood talking in quiet tones to the welcome witch. She looked...well pristine. Her silky blonde hair was pulled in an elaborate chignon and she was practically dripping in diamonds and jewels. Her face was like a young Grace Kelly and Hermione realized that her son had a lot of her pretty features.</p>
<p>However, there was something about the way she held herself. The off-ness was in the way she fidgeted with her wedding ring and kept touching her neck. She was nervous about something. Hermione watched as she bid the welcome witch goodbye before heading straight toward her. Hermione quickly made her way down the hall so that she would not be spotted by the elder woman. Only when she was sure Narcissa had passed did Hermione turned around to quickly follow behind. She trailed after the long graceful strides of Narcissa Malfoy, not even sure why she was doing so.</p>
<p>"Narcissa," she heard from behind her, nearly jolting her out of her skin. Narcissa pivoted at the voice with all the grace of a prima ballerina. Hermione kept her gaze forward and continued down the hall, ears perked toward their conversation.</p>
<p>"Errapel! I came as soon as I got your message. Please tell me that you've found a cure…" Narcissa breathed. Hermione's heart jolted at the implications.</p>
<p>"Not here Narcissa, let's go to my office." Hermione turned the corner, listening to the quick steps of the two behind her. They turned down the opposite hallway and once Hermione heard the door shut close, she turned. Her eyes fell upon the nameplate on the door. Healer Selwyn. Hermione bit her lip, musing on what she should do with this new information.</p>
<p>Later, in the Great Hall, Hermione couldn't help but take a peek at Malfoy. He sat between Astoria and Pansy looking smug as they lavished him with attention. She watched Pansy glower at Astoria as she offered her apple pie to Draco. She then watched as Pansy whipped out her wand and exploded the other pie in the girl's face before offering her own pie.</p>
<p>Hermione grimaced at the piteous display. Those girls were competing over a dastardly sycophant! He didn't seem to care a bit as Astoria waved her wand over herself, trying to clean off the apple pie bits. It made Hermione loathe him even more.</p>
<p>"Hermione, you going to the library after this?" Harry asked, drawing her attention away from glaring at Malfoy.</p>
<p>"Actually, no, if you can believe it. I was just going to revise my charms essay and turn in a bit early." Harry grinned.</p>
<p>"Getting lazy in your old age, eh?" Hermione shot him an icy glare.</p>
<p>"Har, har. No Quidditch practice for you lot, then?" Harry shook his head.</p>
<p>"We lost the lottery for today. You mind helping me with my potions essay? Snape gave me a T for my last so I really can't get another."</p>
<p>"A T! Harry, that's horrid! You can't be getting those kinds of scores if you want to get into Auror training! What were you thinking? Why didn't you come to me last time?" Harry rolled his eyes at her, succeeding in peeving her off even more.</p>
<p>"You were busy with your own mad schoolwork, I wasn't about to bother you. Besides, I learned my lesson. I got a howler from mum."</p>
<p>"Nearly, as bad as a howler from my mum." Ron suddenly piped in, taking a most warranted breather from decimating his dinner. Hermione fixed her unnerving stare on him.</p>
<p>"And what did you get on the Potions essay, Ronald?" She watched his face suffuse with red.</p>
<p>"Don't start. You're not my mum."</p>
<p>"What?" She shot him a look so ferocious he wilted and quickly averted his eyes. "Sorry." he mumbled. Hermione kept her eyes on him for a few seconds longer before she took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"Look, I know it's the beginning of the year still but everything we do this year matters. This can be your only freebie but from here on out, everything you two turn in has to be at least an Acceptable."</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am." Harry said with a salute. Hermione shot him a nasty scowl.</p>
<p>"I'm not joking. If you want my help then you two are going to listen to what I say. In fact, I'm going to make us a study timetable and I don't want any complaining!" She hissed over Ron's groan.</p>
<p>Hermione made good on that promise back in the common room. She steadily worked on their study schedule as she advised Harry and Ron on their essays. A few hours later, they called it quits.</p>
<p><em>This is probably why I don't have a boyfriend.</em> Hermione slid under her covers, staring up at the red canopy curtains above her. <em>I don't need one when I have Harry and Ron.</em></p>
<p>Despite all her berating and aggression, hanging out with them tonight reminded her that her life was just as fulfilling as Lavender or Parvati's. <em>It's in a different way but it works for me.</em> She went to sleep with a smile.</p>
