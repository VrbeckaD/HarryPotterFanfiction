    <p>Harry was shaking, he was used to waking up screaming, but he would be going back to Hogwarts in less than 24 hours. He had defeated Voldemort once and for all in June and had stayed in contact with the other champions since. </p><p>Ron was going out with Viktor, Hermione was with Fred, Bill and Fluer where dating, George was with Oliver Wood, Charlie was off with dragons, and Ginny and Luna had been caught multiple times by multiple people making out. And Percy was being a prick. Still. </p><p>Everyone had their someone, except Harry. He and Cedric had written the most, Cedric had written first, thanking Harry for his help in the graveyard along with a red, yellow, and black bracelet to show there alliance. Harry put the bracelet on and hadn't taken it off. </p><p>Harry walked down the stairs of Grimmauld place. He found Sirius and Remus reading over old law textbooks and holding hands. Harry coughed to announce his presence. Sirius Put his book down and Remus grumbled about how the trial was tomorrow and they needed to know the law. Pettigrew has been found and they where trying Peter and Sirius. </p><p>"Sirius, Love, there's no evidence against you. Peter will be found guilty and you will get a pardon. Then we can go get married alright?" Mumbling Sirius walked over and curled into Moony's chest and started to cry. Remus spoke first. "Harry, I'm sorry but I'm going to have to ask you to leave, I'm sorry pup, we'll be up later ok? Come down with the twins in about half an hour to eat and leave." Nodding Harry left to go find the twins. </p><p>Harry heard snippets of a conversation through the twins door. "Oi you bastard put your jumper on! No one wants to see that." He couldn't tell if it was Fred or George. But he chuckled and knocked. "Oi you bastards open the door. You know Ced right?" Was all Harry said before barging in the room. "Hey Harry mate, maybe wait next time for all you know, Hermione or Oliver might have been in." "ABSOLUTELY NOT FRED. HERMIONE ISNT EVEN 15. I WILL GO FULL BIG BROTHER MODE." Harry mockingly fake shouted. </p><p>"Fine Harry. And yes I at least know Cedric. We where friends when we were younger." Nodding Harry dragged George into the hall. This is where Harry finally broke. Slamming his forehead and left fist into the wall. Luckily, no one else was up yet so Fred came out to comfort Harry while George went and got Remus and Sirius from the kitchen. </p><p>Coughing before he went in George whisper-yelled at them "HARRY IS HAVING A BREAKDOWN FUCK YOUR COFFEE AND LAW BOOKS AND GET TO HARRY." Before slamming the kitchen door behind him. </p><p>Scrambling out of the kitchen they apparated right into the twins room, where Fred and George sat either side of him rubbing his back his face buried in a pillow. He heard the door open and it was Sirius and Remus. "Hey pup, it's going to be ok. We'll take it form here boys, thank you." Lupin said, addressing the twins as well as Harry. Sirius was kneeling on the floor in front of Harry, talking to him, calming him down. Remus walked over to join his lover and Harry. </p><p>Harry had started to calm down a bit when they heard the floo. Luna, Oliver, Blaise, and Cedric where all accompanying them to kings cross, with three of the four getting on the train. The four of them made a lot of clatter when they where downstairs.</p><p> As soon as he heard the floo, George ran out of the room to go great his lover. He directed Cedric upstairs, whispered quietly "Harry needs you." Blaise had already left to go see Ron and Luna was already half way up the stairs. Cedric followed after Luna and made it to the twins room where Harry was starting to get better. </p><p>Seeing Cedric made it all go away and a wide smile spread across Harry's face. "Let's go to Hogwarts." Cedric said and grabbed Harry's hand before they left the room</p>
