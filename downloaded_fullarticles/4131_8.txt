    <p>Chapter 1:</p><p>The alarm started annoyingly going off at 6:45 am. I groaned from beneath my warm duvet, but I climbed out of bed anyway, and shut the alarm off. I slowly walked to the bathroom and I did my business and I turned the shower on, and once the water was warm enough, I stepped into the spray and sighed.</p><p>“I wonder what Pansy wanted to discuss with me so bad yesterday...she's probably going to blab my ear off once I get to school and complain how I ignored her..." </p><p>I drizzled shampoo into my pale blond hair and I started massing my scalp and I started lightly humming. As I continued my shower, I started thinking about a song that I had started to write and I sadly smile because it's based upon the one person who I believe has never noticed me. And what really sucks? It's Harry-fucking-Potter. The wonder boy of the school. Yes, a boy. I have an absolutely huge crush on the most unobtainable boy in my school. Just my luck, huh? And what makes it even worse, his friends have always bullied me through school...picking on me about how I was such a spoiled brat, but they don't know anything about me. Not a damn thing. </p><p>I rinse off, and I realize while I was lost in my thoughts, that I had already finished washing up and rinsing off. So, I get out of the shower and I grab the green towel from off its hook and I dry my face before wrapping it around my waist. I look into the mirror and frown, and I grab my comb and I comb my hair and I gel one side of it back and I let the other side hang loose. I nod to myself, approvingly, and I walk back into my room, towards my closet, and I grab a few clothes and take them out. </p><p>I grab a pair of black boxers and I drop my towel and I pull them on, and then I grab my black, ripped skinny jeans and I pull those on too, their finishing touch being my favorite belt with chains. I tug on a button-up green shirt and I tuck it in. I fiddle with one of my lip rings nervously as I think about what Pansy has to say and if she has Blaise on her side or not. </p><p>Looking at the time, I grab my school bag and I dash down the stairs towards the kitchen and I walk over to my mother, who's cooking a bit of breakfast.</p><p>“Good morning mother. How'd you sleep?" I place my bag next to my chair and I make a glass of orange juice.</p><p>She sounds tired, “I slept good...still a bit tired though..."</p><p>I nod in understanding. “Does father have work today?" </p><p>She nods. “He does. You know how admant the company he works for is about getting things done on time, and they always need everyone working hard..."</p><p>I munch on some bacon and I down my glass of juice and I go for a bit of coffee and a piece of toast with cottage cheese. I hear heavy footsteps coming down the stairs, telling us of father's arrival to the kitchen and he grabs a mug of coffee and places a kiss on mother's cheek. </p><p>His voice is a bit soft. “Good morning dear..." He looks at me.<br/>
“Good morning Draco."</p><p>I nod my head respectfully. “Morning father..." </p><p>Narcissa smiles at Lucius and motions him to the table where some food is laid out and he places a thankful kiss to her cheek again. He sits down at the head of the table and drinks from his mug. </p><p>Soon, I stand up and I grab my school bag and I walk over to the fridge and I grab my lunch and I hug mother goodbye and I wish father a happy day before grabbing  my bike keys and leaving through the door that leads to the Manor's garage. I twirl he keys in my hand as I walk to my bike and I make sure that I have my bag on properly before climbing into the bike and turning it on. I click a button and the garage doors open and I drive from the garage onwards to school. </p><p>~~~15 minutes later~~~</p><p>I finally arrive at the school, or should I say acadamy? It's called Hogwarts Acadamy and it's a pretty big place. I park my bike and I see Pansy walking towards me with Blaise in tow and she has a huge smile on her face. I get off of my bike and I grab he keys and I place them in my bag and I walk up to them. </p><p>“What have you done this time, Pans?"</p><p>She shrugs. “I don't know what you mean.”</p><p>I shake my head. “You never have a smile that big on your face unless you've done something. Now, tell me. What. Did. You. Do?" </p><p>Her smile becomes bigger. “Ill tell you when we get into the library." </p><p>I nod, already accepting my fate and I follow alongside her and Blaise to the school's entryway and then the library. The whole walk: uncomfortable silence from my end, Pansy vibrating with glee, and Blaise just being non-cholant about the whole thing but after years of knowing him, I could tell he was hiding something too. </p><p>Once at the library, we sit at our normal corner and Pansy can't stop fidgeting in her chair and I half-heartedly glare at her.</p><p>“Pans, don't leave me in the dark anymore that I have to be...tell me?" </p><p>She just about explodes with excitedness and she starts rambling really fast. “Pansy, slow down. I didn't catch any of that..." </p><p>She nods and takes a deep breath in. “ You know how there is a talent show coming up?" </p><p>I reluctantly nod and let her continue. </p><p>“ I signed us up for it, and we are going to be playing that song."</p><p>I look at her confused for a minute,and then it finally clicks and I shout, “What!?! No Pansy, please not that one..." </p><p>Her and Blaise grin evilly. “Too late."</p>
