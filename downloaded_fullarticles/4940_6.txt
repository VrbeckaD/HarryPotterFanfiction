          <div class="userstuff"><p>Florean Fortescue’s ice cream parlour was packed, and this was most likely due to it being September and the new school year approaching. Many students, both prospective and old, flocked for a sweet treat in the midst of buying stationary.</p><p>The summer days were coming to an end but the hot weather seemed to say otherwise; ice creams and cold drinks providing beaming sales for the parlour. Melted, sticky spots were all over Diagon Alley from cone disasters. The smells of cotton candy, coffee and sugar drifted from the establishment onto the pavement lined streets, making the mouths water of every witch and wizard in the area. Bright multitudes of ice creams sat, constantly refilling themselves, in the open freezer. The limited edition, Bertie Bott’s, was proving to be a new favourite despite the risk of having earwax or bogey flavoured. </p><p>Of course the summer weather and new year weren’t the only reasons that the ice cream parlour was so busy. Many wizards and witches knew that the famous saviour of the magical world loved this particular shop. The chance of meeting Mr. Harry Potter, the boy who lived, died and killed Lord Voldemort was high. </p><p>“Mr. Thomas-Finnigan.” The salesperson called, an ice cream at the ready for the small boy who came to collect it.</p><p>Immediately her wand began waving again, creating the perfect iced coffee for the next customer. “Mr. Potter.”</p><p>Conversation immediately lulled, save for a small explosion coming from the direction of the Thomas-Finnigans. Eyes searched around the brightly coloured parlour, looking for the famous auror. Whispers started, wondering at the potential for an autograph or even photo. That was until Mr. Potter collected his drink, and every reporter in the shop grabbed their quills and ink. </p><p>In place of dark curls and ebony skin was the opposite. White blonde hair flicked to the side and pale skin accentuating the dark mark cleverly disguised under floral tattoos of narcissus flowers. Draco Malfoy calmly walked up and took his drink, relieved at the cold liquid in the heat of this never ending summer. The smug expression on his face definitely proved the speculations now circulating Florean’s parlour. The public had known the ex death eater was dating the wizarding world’s saviour for some time now. However they’d all just assumed it was some kind of phase, possibly a ruse to guilt trip the Ministry into not sending Draco to Azkaban. No one thought their relationship would last. </p><p>“It’s Draco Potter now,” he spoke at last. Pride evident on his face as he sipped his iced coffee and looked around at the astounded faces. “Harry and I got married.”</p></div>
