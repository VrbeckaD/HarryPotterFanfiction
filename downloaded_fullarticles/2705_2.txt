    <p>The solid concrete wall shook before it split in two and fell and tumbled towards the ground, joining the layers of smoke and crumbled pieces of debris. Scorpius panted as he kept running, the sound of his footsteps becoming quicker and quicker as he panted and panted for breath. But he didn’t stop running. He kept his eyes forward and kept highly alert of his surroundings.</p><p>Thunder rumbled from above in the dark clouds as the sound of a strong gust of wind made itself known to Scorpius’ ears. The young Malfoy’s eyes widened in fear as he searched for the nearest rubble and hid behind the broken piece of concrete, possibly from a building before and looked up to the sky. Surely enough, Scorpius had narrowly managed to escape as the trail of black smoke along with the sound of roaring wind came into the skyline view. Scorpius kept insanely still, not daring to take his eyes away from the shadow in the sky and kept quiet.</p><p>The shadow hidden among the clouds made a series of spins and turns, seemingly searching for someone, before rising up even higher and stopped. A ball of light came from its wand as multiple spells were fired towards the ground, and some hit the buildings, exploding below and lighting up the dark apocalyptic city. Rubble and debris flew everywhere, but nonetheless, Scorpius remained alert as the wind from the force of the spells blew his platinum hair. He didn’t move.</p><p>The figure in the sky made another series of spins in the air and stopped, before finally turning around and disappearing amongst the clouds. Scorpius followed its movements closely before blinking twice and resumed running.</p><p>He ran and jumped over bits of debris and rocks, hiding behind them whenever he heard something unusual and continued his journey without ever looking back. Until finally, he arrives upon an old factory building. He finally stopped and stood in front of the old factory, looking around him before letting out a sigh of relief that he was alone. His ragged pants for breaths were audible from all the running, he took one look at the old metal steel door leading to the inside… and let out a smile.</p><p>…</p><p>The gears to the machine whirred as Hermione stood beside it in intense concentration, typing on the computer while casting spells at the moving machine. She flipped through the screen of the tablet as she glanced back and forth between the machine and the tablet, casting more spells along the way when a voice from the door caught her by surprise</p><p>“Aunt Mione!”</p><p>She glanced towards the voice with a gasp before seeing Scorpius Malfoy standing by the back entrance of her laboratory, a small smile on his face as Hermione’s face brightened and she smiled in delight.</p><p>“Scorpius!”</p><p>Scorpius smiled back warmly at her and slowly made his way down the metal staircase that led to Hermione and the machine.</p><p>“Oh thank goodness, it’s great to see you.” She smiled at him. “You’re looking well.”</p><p>“More or less.” Scorpius chuckled rubbed the back of his head. “And you haven’t changed a bit, Aunt Mione. Looking as beautiful as always-”</p><p>Scorpius’ sentence was cut off midway as his attention was on something else. A strangely shaped transparent container was settled on the end of Hermione’s machine and inside was a strange type of glowing purple liquid, only filling up half of the whole container. Hermione noticed this and let out a sigh.</p><p>“That should be enough to make a one-way trip.” She sounded worn out.</p><p>“That’s all of it?” Scorpius sounded shocked. “After an entire year of work?”</p><p>“Come on, don’t look so upset. Let’s stay positive.” Hermione smiled brightly at him. “A one-way trip is all we need. We just need to get you and Albus there, it’s the best we could do.”</p><p>“Still, this means we can’t come back.” Scorpius protested. “And besides, I can’t just leave you here.”</p><p>But Hermione simply smirked at him and waved a hand in the air.</p><p>“There is a way to get back, but it’s a bit of a gamble though.”</p><p>Scorpius glanced at her way and can’t help but feel a sense of admiration for her.</p><p>“You’ve been in here working yourself to the bone this whole time, haven’t you?” He smiled at her and shook his head. “Please, why don’t you take a little break and rest for a bit?”</p><p>“Don’t worry about me. I’ll be fine.” Hermione reassured him and turned towards the machine again, pressing a few buttons on the computer connected to the machine. “We’re in a race against time here so we don’t have a second to waste.”</p><p>She pressed a series of buttons on her tablet before she waved her wand at the machine, powering it down. She waved her wand and the lights in her factory switched off once again, the only light source was from the glowing purple liquid in the container as she removed it from the end of the machine and held it in her arm, finally turning back to face Scorpius.</p><p>“We need to hurry and take this straight to Fred and George’s old shop.” She told him. “And remember, we can’t apparate there otherwise <em>he </em>could detect you. I have a portkey here, I’m not taking any chances.”</p><p>She handed him the portkey, which was a muggle watch. Scorpius smiled and carefully took it from her.</p><p>“I’ve made a few modifications with this one.” She said. “It won’t activate unless you turn the button on the rim of the watch used to adjust time.”</p><p>“Thanks, I can take it from here. I’ll run it over.” Scorpius smiled at her. “You stay here and get some rest, Aunt Mione, seriously. When was the last time you got real sleep?”</p><p>“Nice try Scorpius, but I’m coming with you.” She shook his head at him. “What if something happens on the way there? If you go alone and he attacks, we can’t run the risk of you being on your own.”</p><p>She held up the container of liquid.</p><p>“Two of us going means two chances to keep this safe.” She said sternly. “If this gets destroyed then this past year will have been for nothing.”</p><p>“You’ve made your point.” Scorpius sighed. “I understand.”</p><p>“And Scorpius…” She spoke quietly, more seriously now. “I need to make sure you understand this…”</p><p>Scorpius looked up at her and could swear he saw tears in her eyes.</p><p>“We can’t forget how many people gave their lives to make sure we had the chance in order to create this energy.” She looked him dead in the eyes. “We have to honour that debt. Promise me that.”</p><p>Scorpius nodded in reply.</p><p>“That means seeing this through no matter what happens. You <em> must </em> succeed, even if it means throwing away everything you have, even if it means we have to sacrifice <em> everything </em>to succeed.” She put a hand on his shoulder. “You and Albus are everyone’s last hope, it’s all up to you two.”</p><p>He looked at her and nodded. “I know.”</p><p>She visibly relaxed after that and let out a smile.</p><p>“All right then, let’s go.” She chuckled. “Albus is waiting for us too.”</p><p>They made their way to start to leave when Scorpius heard it, the sound of rocks crumbling and thunder rumbling from the other side of the laboratory wall. When he turned his head towards the direction of the sound, the front wall of the laboratory exploded with a loud bang and pieces of debris flew everywhere.</p><p>Scorpius quickly waved his wand and produced a shield bubble around him and Hermione. The equipment and the front wall of the lab exploded from around them as smoke filled the atmosphere. Their eyes widened in fear as they stared at the giant hole caused by the explosion where the wall once was. Hermione’s whole body was shaking as she looked around, coughing because of the smoke. Scorpius looked around to see if there was a sign of attack and found all of Hermione’s lab equipment destroyed and stared at in utter shock.</p><p>“Aunt Mione… your equipment…” He stammered.</p><p>But Hermione wasn’t listening. Instead, her eyes widened in fear and her whole skin went pale when she looked at the direction the smoke was going. It was being sucked into her other laboratory room through the open door, where she keeps most of her dangerous experiments and magical machines, and only one thing on was on her mind now… the smoke was flammable.</p><p>She turned to Scorpius and thrust the container of liquid into his arms, looking dead into his eyes and pleaded.</p><p>“Scorpius, go! Get out of here, do you hear me?!”</p><p>Scorpius barely had enough time to reply as the smoke caught on fire and exploded around them. Scorpius was blasted away by the force of the explosion as his back his the wall, causing him to let of a pained shout, the container still in his hands where Hermione left it. Quickly, he looked around to see that Hermione was no longer beside him. His eyes frantically searched for her around the room.</p><p>“Where did she-”</p><p>He let out a loud gasp. What he saw was beyond terrifying. Standing there, above the rubble of the broken down wall of the laboratory, with a hand clutching on Hermione’s lab coat and holding her up by the throat was none other than him, the dark shadow Scorpius had been trying to avoid. Hermione’s wand was on the floor and she was struggling to get out of the figure’s grip, with both of her hands around its hands, trying to pry them off her throat.</p><p>“Aunt Mione!” He made to stand up and run towards her, but Hermione’s shout stopped him.</p><p>“Scorpius, don’t!” She choked out. “Be strong! You have to hurry and go… you have to.”</p><p>Scorpius didn’t know what to do. The shadow in the smoke slowly raised its other hand, its red eyes shining in the clouds of smoke. Scorpius was frozen still.</p><p>“Go, Scorpius!” Hermione shouted again. “Hurry!”</p><p>With a heavy heart, Scorpius looked away from the scene in front of him, tears already falling from his eyes and turned the button on his watch, activating the portkey and disappearing. The figure in the smoke darted its red glowing eyes and stared straight back at Hermione as she breathed out a sigh of relief, glad that Scorpius got away. Slowly, the figure pointed it’s wand under her throat, the tip of it sparking the all-familiar green. She took one last look at the man in front of her, let out a long exhale… and closed her eyes.</p><p>…</p><p>Scorpius landed in the familiar shops of Diagon Alley as he quickly got to his feet once again and started running towards the Leaky Cauldron, where Albus was waiting for him in one of the rooms. Now wasn’t the time for mourning. He had made a promise to Hermione, and he doesn't plan on letting her down.</p><p><em> Aunt Mione… I swear, no matter what it takes, I’ll make it back here! </em> He thought to himself, blinking back tears and clutching the container of liquid tight in his arms as he ran. <em> I’ll save this world no matter what. </em></p><p>Scorpius continued running down the streets of Diagon Alley and soon came across the familiar building. The very building connecting the Wizarding and the Non-Wizarding worlds. He looked around one last time and breathed out a sigh of relief when he couldn’t see anyone following him. Slowly, he entered the Leaky Cauldron and shut the door behind him. The whole place was empty, which was no longer a surprise for Scorpius, after all, nearly everywhere was empty. He walked up the stairs leading to the guest rooms of the place and searched for the room where he was supposed to be meeting Albus.</p><p>
  <em> A110...A111...A112...Ah-Ha! </em>
</p><p>Room All3. It was eerily quiet. Scorpius looked around once again in the empty hallways before taking a deep breath and knocking twice on the door. There was no answer. Confused he knocked again. There was still no answer. He tried turning the knob, but the door was locked. Scorpius’ whole face went pale and he assumed the worst. Had Albus been found by him? Had he left the Leaky Cauldron? Is he dead-</p><p>“Looking for me, Scorp?”</p><p>Scorpius gasped at the voice calling his name and turned around. Albus Severus Potter stood in the dark hallway of the inn, with a thick black winter overcoat along with a green beanie on his head. He held his wand in his right hand and his backpack on his other arm. There were small bruises and cuts across his face, but his eyes held determination like always. His frown shifted to a warm smile upon seeing Scorpius.</p><p>“Al.” Scorpius breathed out a sigh of relief.</p><p>Albus chuckled softly and nodded at him in greeting. “Welcome back.”</p><p>Scorpius smiled back at him, but Albus noticed it didn’t quite meet his eyes. Albus walked closer to him and looked around the hallway and realised that Scorpius was the only one here.</p><p>“Where’s Aunt Hermione?” He looked up at Scorpius and saw the tears falling from his eyes. Albus’ heart sank. <em>No...it couldn’t be.</em></p><p>“In order for me to escape…” Scorpius’ whole body began shaking as more tears streamed down his pale face.</p><p>“No...Don’t tell me...” Albus walked closer and placed both hands on Scorpius’ shoulders softly, his own tears gathering at the back of his eyes. "...Is she-"</p><p>“Aunt Hermione’s gone…” He said shakily. “...she bought me time.”</p><p>Scorpius could only let out a sob, which caused Albus to wrap his arms around him and pull him into an embrace. Scorpius didn’t hug back. He was too overstruck by grief and guilt that he curled his hand into a fist.</p><p>“Her entire lab is destroyed...” Scorpius sobbed angrily, his hand shaking with rage. “I led him right to her and now she’s gone and her equipment’s gone too…</p><p>“That damned bastard.” Albus gritted his teeth as he pulled Scorpius closer to him.</p><p>“But at least...there’s this, Al.” Scorpius pulled away from the embrace and held up the container with glowing purple liquid. Albus gazed at it in wonder as the glow sparkled in his eyes. “This is what our Aunt Mione gave her life for. She risked her life to extract this energy.”</p><p>Albus reaches forward with his hand and touched the container, tracing the glowing purple liquid as he gazed in astonishment. He looked up to see Scorpius looking directly at him.</p><p>“With this energy, it means we can go back… to the past.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Want to get some rest for a while?” Albus asked Scorpius as he put down his wand on the bed and sat beside Scorpius.</p><p>Scorpius shook his head at him with a small smile as he drank the bottle of water given to him by Albus, finishing it all up in one go.</p><p>“I’m okay, Al.” He smiled at him. His gaze then travelled to the bag Albus was holding. “What’s in there?”</p><p>Albus’ whole expression brightened at that question as he eagerly opened the bag.</p><p>“Look, I found something good.” He said with a chuckle as he dug through the bag. “It’s something I’ve been saving for us, for when we really needed it.”</p><p>He took out a small tin food container of some sort and handed it to Scorpius. The big word “TUNA” was sprawled out across the label as Scorpius smiled in delight.</p><p>“Isn’t it amazing?” Albus giggled as Scorpius opened the can of tuna. “It’s not even dog food!”</p><p>Just then, a soft ‘meow’ came from under the bed as a tiny stray black kitten crawled out from underneath. It walked and stopped right in front of Scorpius and Albus, looking up at the tin of tuna with wide eyes. Scorpius chuckled and held up the container and shook it gently to which the cat let out another meow.</p><p>Albus chuckled and knelt down on the carpet, picking up the kitten and hugged it close to him while stroking its fur softly.</p><p>“Don’t worry, you cute stinker.” Albus laughed. “I’ve got something here for you too.”</p><p>He settled it down again and took out a tiny bowl of cat food from his bag. Scorpius was surprised at the number of things he has all stuffed into one bag. The kitten dug into its food immediately, meowing and purring as it ate. Albus took out a fork from his bag and handed it to Scorpius.</p><p>“Dig in.” He smiled at him. “You should eat.”</p><p>Scorpius blushed and took the fork, slowly eating the tin of tuna as he gazed at the little kitten in front of them, munching away.</p><p>“I wonder if it’ll be okay by itself when we’re both gone.” Scorpius sighed.</p><p>“Don’t worry, it’ll be fine,” Albus said, seeing the worry on Scorpius’ face. “Cats are really self-reliant. And unlike dogs, they can survive really well in the wild.”</p><p>“I see.” Scorpius chuckled and leaned down to stroke its fur, earning a small meow from the kitten.</p><p>He smiled at the creature and glanced back to Albus. Shaking his head, Scorpius held out the container of tuna for Albus, which was still half full. Albus’ eyes widened and he looked up at him.</p><p>“What’s the matter? I’m fine.” Albus blushed. “You can eat it all, really, it’s okay. I saved it for you.”</p><p>“Oh come on, you should eat as well.” Scorpius laughed. “I know you’re hungry.”</p><p>As if sensing the food and Scorpius’ comment. Albus’ stomach growled loudly as he stiffened in embarrassment and blushed. They both chuckled and Albus gladly took the tin of tuna offered. He quickly munched it down and let out a sound of delight, smiling at Scorpius as he licked his lips. Scorpius simply smiled back and blushed.</p><p>“So then,” Albus said, pointing to the container with purple liquid seated on the bed. “How many trips will that give us to travel with?”</p><p>“Only one-way.”</p><p>“What?! One-way?!” Albus abruptly stopped eating. “Aren’t we going to come back?! We can’t if it’s only one-way!”</p><p>“Right now, all that matters is surviving long enough to get there.” Scorpius sighed. “But that’s not absolute, Aunt Mione said that there must be a way to come back if we’re lucky.”</p><p>“And how do we do that?” Albus inquired.</p><p>“That… I don’t know.” Scorpius closed his eyes. “But still… Aunt Mione said to trust her, and I do.”</p><p>Albus nodded back in acknowledgement. “So first we’ll head to Fred and George’s shop, and then it’s an 18-year jump back from there.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“And that’s where we will find them?’</p><p>“Yes.” Scorpius stood up from the bed and looked out the window, a glint of hope in his eyes. “That’s where we’ll find Harry Potter and his friends.”</p><p>…</p><p>The duo ventured out not long after that into the dark apocalyptic city. It was dead silent and barren. Almost the whole population had been wiped out. Hiding behind one of the rocks behind Ollivander’s, Albus and Scorpius could see Fred and George’s shop from where they were standing and slowly made their way towards them. They ran as quickly as possible, but also keeping their footsteps light, not wanting to catch the shadow’s attention. They stopped by the entrance to the shop and looked around, left, right, and up at the sky. Scorpius pulled out his wand and cast a spell to see if there was anyone else around.</p><p>“So, what does the spell say?” Albus whispered from beside him, his wand drawn. “Is he here? Can the spell detect his presence?”</p><p>“No. It can’t seem to sense him.” Scorpius quickly waved his wand to cancel the spell. “Let’s move.”</p><p>Albus nodded in reply.</p><p>The two waved their spells at the door of Fred and George’s shop, deactivating the wards. Scorpius put his wand away and reached for the handle…</p><p>A rumbling crack of thunder from above sounded the entire city as Scorpius took his hand away from the door in terror and fright. Albus gasped from beside him as loud gusts of wind filled the atmosphere. The two boys turned and looked up into the sky.</p><p>The clouds spiralled by the gust of wind created an open vortex as it slowly descended from the clouds above, creating a tornado. Energy and electricity sparked from the tornado as lightning struck the sky. A shadow figure slowly descended downwards from inside the tornado and both of the boys gasped in horror. The bright red eyes of the figure glowed among the tornado and stared right at Scorpius and Albus before stopping mid-air, blowing away the tornado and pointing its wand at Albus.  </p><p>By instinct, Scorpius threw himself on Albus and pushed them both to the ground. The spell narrowly missed them as it hit the wall of the shop behind them, creating a large explosion and leaving behind a hole in the wall. Scorpius and Albus hurriedly sat up and drew their wands, by what surprised Albus next was how Scorpius shoved him the container of purple liquid and pushed him away, running forward straight into the direction of the figure in the clouds.</p><p>“Go ahead of me!” He shouted back. “Leave now!”</p><p>Scorpius rushed forward and held his wand tightly in hand. The figure in the air aimed its wand at him and fired a spell to which Scorpius jumped up and dodged it with quick reflexes. With a loud shout, he fired another spell back at the figure, to which it easily dodged it and sent multiple spells back at Scorpius’ direction.</p><p>Scorpius’ eyes widened as he deflected the first few and blocked the rest, creating a big explosion of fire in front of him, covering his view of the enemy. He looked around when suddenly, the figure appeared in front of him amidst the burning flames. His eyes widened as the figure drew his wand hand back, ready to fire a spell. Scorpius quickly met it with its own spell and his wand and the figure itself was blasted back by the explosion, with Scorpius falling to the ground with a thud.</p><p>Scorpius struggled and quickly tried to get up from the ground. He was surprised when he heard footsteps come from behind and see then see Albus kneeling down and shoving the container with purple liquid into his chest.</p><p>“What are you doing?! Stay back!” He shouted at Albus, eyes widening. “You’re supposed to go and leave!”</p><p>“Stop trying to save me and think!” Albus grabbed Scorpius by the shoulders. “I’ll be a decoy! That will buy you some time to get out of here!”</p><p>“ALBUS, WAIT!”</p><p>Albus stood and rushed forward, ignoring Scorpius’ calls for him. He stood with his wand in hand and fired three conclusive spells at the shadow flying and hiding once again amidst the clouds. The shadow simply easily dodged it by flying out of the way and its red eyes glowed hauntingly in the dark. As Albus shot the fourth spell, the shadow dodged it again before shooting a curse from its own wand, firing directly at Albus’ feet. Albus let out a gasp as the spell neared, and finally collided with the ground below his feet.</p><p>The explosion caused by the spell caused Albus’ whole body to fly upward, his wand falling from his hand as Scorpius watched him fall in slow motion, before finally hitting the ground, with fire burning all around him from the spell.</p><p>“AL!” Scorpius ran towards the boy and knelt down, slowly picking him up from the ground. Albus’ eyes were fluttered closed and he wasn’t moving. As Scorpius picked him up, Albus’ head fell sideways, and his arm fell towards the floor and dangled there, swinging left and right like a corpse, as if all the life had gone out of him.</p><p>Scorpius watched in horror at his unmoving best friend in front of him, he watched, shocked, gobsmacked, and tears started to fall from his eyes. He slowly set the unmoving body back down on the floor again and could only watch as anger and sadness overtook him. Scorpius gritted his teeth and curled his fist up in anger, his tears were flowing more rapidly as his rage became even stronger.</p><p>The figure from the clouds slowly descended from flight as it landed slowly and softly on the rubble amidst the fire. The sound of his feet landing on the rock made its way to Scorpius’ ears as his eyes widened in anger. Slowly, he looked up from where Albus’ body was lying on the floor and directly met the red glowing eyes of the shadow.</p><p>He felt his anger flare to life like never before.</p><p>“You bastard…” Scorpius said angrily, gritting his teeth. “You killed him…”</p><p>The pillar of fire split in front of him, giving Scorpius a clear view of the figure standing on top of the rubble of pieces of broken down buildings. The light from the fire slowly shone across the figure’s face, revealing his unruly black hair, the elder wand in his right hand, a dark smile playing on his lips along with the infamous lightning scar on his forehead as he stared straight down at Scorpius with his blood red eyes.</p><p>Harry Potter wore an evil smirk as he stood on the rocks with murderous and crazy crimson red eyes. His black cloak flopped and fluttered hauntingly through the wind as he let out a dark laugh.</p><p>“Finally… it’s about time...” He chuckled darkly. “You’ve been running around making messes for too long… Today is the day you’ll take your final breath when I choke the life from you.”</p><p>Harry smiled evilly at Scorpius and it sent shivers down his spine.</p><p>“... I can’t wait to watch you die.”</p>
