    <p>December 1889, Three Broomsticks, Hogsmeade,</p><p>The beginning of a new year was soon to come. A new year of new possibilities to be explored and new challenges to overcome. It was the time of the year when nobody could even think of working and the only thing that mattered was to spend time with friends and family.</p><p>The snow fell from the sky and the wind was howling and the magnificent view of the Hogwarts castle towered over the wizarding village of Hogsmeade in the Scottish Highlands. The dark and spooky environment was nothing that seemed to bother the villagers as laughter and joy could be heard from every cottage in the village.</p><p>In one of the many pubs in the village, in the one called "Three Broomsticks," 5 figures of 4 different nationalities had come to meet on a rare occasion to celebrate the new year together. They sat next to the window which gave a great of the Hogwarts Castle and the black lake that shimmered in the moonlight.</p><p>One of the couples consisted of a blond middle-aged Swiss wizard dressed in his typical workplace clothes that consisted of a three-part suit and necktie and brown overcoat. His wife an Eastern European witch, with curly black hair and dressed more fashionably in black dress robes.</p><p>The foreign couple had traveled all the way from the Black Forest, in the German state of Bavaria to Scotland to meet the Swiss wizard's aunt, a graceful and stoic lady by the name of Bathilda Bagshot who had introduced them both to her neighbors Percival and Kendra Dumbledore.</p><p>Percival Dumbledore was a long and well-built man with a growing white beard. This particular evening he was dressed in a grey tweed jacket and a purple bowtie while his wife preferred long red medieval robes which contradicted her Native-American origins.</p><p>Despite all their cultural differences these 5 wizards and witches proved to get along perfectly, talking about their family life and history.</p><p>"Tell me, Zsofia, since you're from Hungary, which wizarding school did you attend? It was not Durmstrang I presume, " Bathilda Bagshot asked the Eastern European witch.</p><p>"No it certainly wasn't Durmstrang. I attend the Koldovstoretz Institute, "The Palace of Witchcraft", in Lake Ladoga of Western Russia. The best Eastern European wizarding school that is actually situated in Eastern Europe, and not only that, it accepts Muggleborns and petty commoners too, " she said while giving a glance at her husband Franciscus, an alum of the Durmstrang Institute, an elitist private school that did not admit Muggleborns like herself.</p><p>"Koldovstoretz, Durmstrang. Always mixes those two up. They appear to be so awfully similar," Bathilda followed up with her previous question.</p><p>"They have literally nothing in common," Franciscus filled in.</p><p>"Why did you attend a Russian school if you're Hungarian, Zsofia? " Percival Dumbledore asked.</p><p>"My father is Russian and when I was 7 years old, he took us all to St. Petersburg to work. It was there my powers revealed themselves. Perhaps that was for the best. There are not many wizarding schools in Eastern Europe that regularly accept children born in non-magical families. It is usually homeschooling for us. Which is a problem if your parents are Muggles. Koldovstoretz, in short, saved me. "</p><p>"I see..."</p><p>"Where did you go Kendra. Was it Ilvermorny? " Zsofia asked the Native-American witch.</p><p>"You're correct about that Mrs Grindelwald. I had no other option, " she answered.</p><p>"What do you mean about that?" The Hungarian witch asked.</p><p>While both Francis, Percival, and Bathilda knew what she was talking about and wanted to speak of something else. Something more lighthearted perhaps but Zsofia asked right out; "What do you mean 'used to belong to'? I know you have strict secrecy laws but surely...'"</p><p>"Yes, I was by the age of 9 taken away from my tribe, by the MACUSA and put in an orphanage for other No-Majborn wizards and witches myself waiting to be adopted by a wizarding family, " Kendra interrupted her and started sobbing in her husband's arms.</p><p>To Francis who was a well-traveled wizard and an ICW employee, those weren't news but Zsofia who rarely traveled beyond Central and Eastern Europe was shocked by this revelation.</p><p>"That is awful... "</p><p>"No one wanted to adopt me so I was pre-determined to go Ilvermorny where I would have my cultural roots taken from me. They tried to make a U.S citizen but the tribe I used to belong to, the Potawatomi of Michigan didn't identify themselves as such. We were our own people not answering to any higher force but our gods and spirits, " the Native American responded now feeling tenser than she had before throughout the evening.</p><p>"Kendra, I'm so sorry, I didn't know..."</p><p>"And to the orphanage, I had to return to each summer from Ilvermorny. It was dreadful. If only Rappaport's Law could cease. If only the Statute of Secrecy could be burnt on the stake like the innocent witches that suffered during the Salem Witch Trials, " the Ilvermorny graduate kept rambling.</p><p>"I very much agree with you! Rappaport's Law should vanish, " the Hungarian witch stated loudly. "Who does MACUSA think they are? Separating Muggleborn kids from their families to put them into orphanages for adoption and then expecting everything to be fine! That's preposterous?"</p><p>"Thank you Zsofia! And what makes the situation even worse is the stigma us No-Majborn kids have to carry throughout our entire lives while the Magical Congress keeps boasting about how there's no segregation between pure-bloods and No-Majborns in the United States. Humbug, I say, " Kendra filled in.</p><p>"Then you shall feel lucky you were selected for the Ilvermorny-Hogwarts exchange program. It was the start of your new life, and you wouldn't have met me and the wonderful and happy family we've got together would have never seen the light " her husband Percival said in his noticeable Scottish accent while raising his glass of butterbeer.</p><p>Kendra looked at him angrily because the truth was that the Dumbledore family was anything but a happy one, but they couldn't say that out loud.</p><p>"I wasn't lucky to be chosen, Percival! I had to work harder than anyone else to get chosen."</p><p>While Kendra was not normally a witch to talk openly about her tragic past with people outside the family this evening was an exception. Some sips of cauldron spirit had been more than enough for tounge to slip looser than usual. And she normally hated alcohol in general.</p><p>"I feel you, Kendra. My schoolmates at Koldovstoretz could not resist humiliating me at every turn. Hopefully, my dear Gellert's school years won't turn out the same as mine, " the Hungarian witch hoped while giving another fierce look at Francis who just sat there sipping on his glass of red wine.</p><p>"Oh please can't we talk about anything else? Something more light? Like Quidditch for example. I heard both the German and the Scottish teams went to the finals in Quebec this year," her husband said feeling very uncomfortable with all the tragedy and deep politics his wife and the Native American witch kept sharing with each other.</p><p>Due to working as an ambassador for the German Ministry of Magic at the International Confederation of Wizards; Francis Grindelwald was more than aware of all the dark sides of the political system that plagued the wider wizarding world and it was something he preferred not to discuss during social gathering like this one.</p><p>"Quidditch! That's all the kids talk about these days, " Bathilda Bagshot bluntly stated due to her lack of interest in the sport. "I'd never seen what so spectacular about that game. Adult wizards and witches flying around in circles while getting hit down on the ground by bludgers. A bunch of childish nonsense. That is what it is. "</p><p>"Neither Albus or Aberforth is particularly interested in it. But maybe they will once they attend Hogwarts, " Percival speculated feeling very frustrated by his neighbor's blunt and harsh comments. While Bathilda was anything but a modest and humble witch she was a hospitable and kind-hearted one indeed and she could certainly be a delight to have in a company during social gatherings. But not always.</p><p>"Another round of butterbeer please!" Bathilda called on the nearest house-elf.</p><p>"Wonka is on it, " the house-elf screeched and apparated onto the bar-desk to fill another couple of glasses.</p><p>The clock hit 0:00 and the new year had just begun. Everyone in the bar collectively raised their glasses of alcohol and started cheering and sounds of trumpets and violins that played themselves could be heard throughout the room.</p><p>"Happy new year everyone! And Frohes neues Jahr to you Francis, my nephew " Bathilda greeted everyone around the table while she raised her near-empty glass of butterbeer.</p><p>" Frohes neues Jahr, indeed Aunt Bathilda, " the Swiss wizard calmly responded with a smile while raising his own glass.</p><p>Roughly an hour later</p><p>"Well, what do you say, my fellow wizards and witches? Should we call this a night, " Bathilda said making herself ready to leave.</p><p>"Most certainly, auntie. But how will you take yourself home all the way to southern England? It will be very dangerous trying apparate whilst drunk, " her foreign nephew asked.</p><p>"We have been given permission by Madam Rosmerta to use her fireplace, but not for free of course, " Percival answered while paying Wonka the house-elf some extra sickles.</p><p>They all went to the desk where Rosmerta was seen enthusiastically talking with a young wizard who seemed to be in his twenties.</p><p>"Madam we are ready to leave!" Percival called on her.</p><p>"Mr. Dumbledore, of course. Mr. Potter, wait here please, I'll soon be back, " the landlord responded.</p><p>Rosmerta and her guests went upstairs to her room where the English magicians would use her fireplace to get home.</p><p>"That'll be galleons for each traveler. Do all 5 of you intend to use the floor network?"</p><p>"Not me and wife. We live in the state of Bavaria, near the border of Austria, so we purchased a portkey created by both ours and your Ministry of Magic. It was not cheap I can tell you, Madam," Francis answered her question.</p><p>"Ah, so you are Germans? I was in lower Saxony not too long ago. It is a beautiful country indeed, " Rosmerta said trying to be polite.</p><p>The three British magicians paid the landlord 5 galleons each.</p><p>"Incendio," Madam Rosmerta whispered pointing her wand at the fireplace.</p><p>Bathilda grabbed a handful of Floo powder and threw it into the fire rendering it harmless.</p><p>"Well I hope I see you soon, my dear Francis, " she said hugging her nephew.</p><p>"I'll miss you too auntie," the Swiss wizard replied.</p><p>She then stepped into the fireplace and shouted clearly and loudly, "Godric's Hollow," which caused her to dematerialize and be transported back to England.</p><p>After the Dumbledores said goodbye to the foreign couple they repeated the same process as Bathilda, leaving Francis and Zsofia behind.</p><p>"So what do you say? Shall we go immediately? " the suit-wearing warlock asked his wife.</p><p>"No. We are in no hurry. I want to go for a walk on the shores of the lake near the castle. Gellert probably went to bed hours ago anyway."</p><p>"If you say so."</p><p>They held the hands of each other while walking on the shores of the frozen black lake near the Forbidden Forest soaking up the cozy and mysterious atmosphere.</p><p>No one else was outside except Ogg the groundskeeper who waved to them on his way into the forest with a carriage of fodder levitating behind him.</p><p>The Russian lady turned her head towards the castle. "It is beautiful. Not quite as big as Koldovstoretz but it seems cozier. Like something out of a fairy tale."</p><p>"It is a true marvel indeed," the Swiss wizard agreed.</p><p>Zsofia turned her attention towards the forest.</p><p>"I feel so bad for Kendra. Taken away from her family, her entire culture, and put away in an orphanage and then forced to attend a school she never wanted to go too. And I thought my childhood was bad. America's secrecy laws sure are messed up. "</p><p>"They sure are. Only been there once. At an ICW emergency meeting at MACUSA's headquarters in Washington DC when we were discussing what to do with the increasingly aggressive sasquatch rebellions at the east coast. "</p><p>"That reminds me of the vampire wars of Eastern Europe, I learned about in school. "</p><p>"OOOOOOOHHHHHH"</p><p>They both heard a long and scary sound coming from underneath the icy surface of the lake.</p><p>Zsofia seemed both curious and a bit nervous about it.</p><p>"What was that?"</p><p>"I believe it was the giant squid that resides in these waters. Auntie has told me everything about it, " Francis said.</p><p>"Oh okay, that seems exciting. Anyway back to the Dumbledores; I think we should take Gellert to see them at some point. He's so lonely and he could make friends with their kids."</p><p>"That is a really good idea indeed. Did he not get along well with the kids of your colleagues?"</p><p>"Not so well I hoped he would. Other kids tend to find him too bossy and demanding for a lack of better words."</p><p>Francis put a hand on her shoulder.</p><p>"He got too much spirit for them. He is very mature for his age and needs an equal. I think he would get along perfectly with Albus, Percival and Kendra's firstborn son. "</p><p>"It is worth a try. But that friendship would not last long. Albus and his younger brother, whatever his name was, will eventually be sent to Hogwarts, a boarding school for 7 years like all kids of the British Isles. And we are not British. Hopefully, Gellert will find some friends at the nearest day school. "</p><p>"And here I hoped to send him to Durmstrang, my alma mater, " Francis conceded.</p><p>Zsofia looked at him with an annoyed expression.</p><p>"I don't understand why you are so determined to send Gellert to that school when there are so many other options. "</p><p>"And I don't understand why you are so against sending him there. I went to Durmstrang and had the time of my life there. That was until I met you of course. "</p><p>"Do you really think this is best for him? Consider that purebloods are the norm there and he's a half-blood."</p><p>"I am a pureblood and alumni from Durmstrang and you don't see me preach about pureblood supremacy ideas. Plenty of your colleagues at the hospital attended the Institute and do they show any bias?"</p><p>"Some of them... But is Gellert even guaranteed to be admitted due to his blood status?"</p><p>"I've told you before and I am telling you again, you don't need to be a pureblood to be admitted. Only one magical parent is needed. And that you have the money to pay the tuition fee and the skill to pass the admittance exam."

"The best thing about Koldovstoretz is that it is free for everyone like a school should be. "</p><p>"We aren't exactly poor. I stand by my arguments for why there's no better choice for Gellert than Durmstrang. It is there he will learn to become the greatest man he could ever be, I know it."</p><p>It began to snow and the witch just looked at him not knowing what to say and unwilling to come up with any more counter-arguments.</p><p>"I don't even want to argue with you any longer. It is late. We should go home."</p><p>"That might be for the best."</p><p>She looked for the portkey inside her magically expended purse and found it. It was reserved in a grey blanket and took the form of a silver spoon.</p><p>"Ready to go?"</p><p>"I am ready to go, " Francis assured grabbing her left arm.</p><p>Zsofia took a last look at the castle of Hogwarts, as she felt spoon vibrating faster and faster until the view of their surroundings disappeared in a whirlwind of imageries as the couple was transported across the country to their homeland.</p><p>A few seconds later they landed safely on a hill in the outskirts of Munich, Bavaria. The town was still lit by gaslights and the local Muggles could be heard celebrating the new year although there were fireworks to be seen in the sky like back in Hogsmeade.</p><p>Zsofia first took a look at the portkey which now had reverted back to a normal spoon with no magical powers which been used up through the two journeys it was created for. Then she immediately turned her head around.</p><p>"Do you think any Muggles spotted us?"</p><p>Francis took look around them as well.</p><p>"I don't think so and even if someone did, nobody would believe it anyway consider that this is New year when everybody drinks too excessively to see things clearly."</p><p>"Well do you feel drunk, Francis?"</p><p>"Only a little but it is still safest to walk home. Won't take the risk of disapparating in this state."</p><p>"I feel the same."</p><p>They walked through the spooky and dark forest on their way home. Nobody else could be seen on the road except the occasional fox or deer. The wind was howling, and the trail was covered with snow at least one decimeter above ground which caused Zsofia to deeply regret that he had chosen to wear high heels for the evening, something she normally despised. It was tempting to just use apparation to get home in a heartbeat but she knew she and Francis would risk splinching if they did and then they would not be able to get home until some other wizard or witch would come to pick up the pieces left of them.</p><p>Neither Francis or Zsofia had exchanged a word since set their feet on the trail but the wizard was now the one to break the silence.</p><p>"Just hang on a bit more. I'm pretty sure we'll be home in twenty minutes or so. "</p><p>The witch who had been very tired and unfocused so far on their way home started to regain her concentration and she became very suspicious that something was wrong.</p><p>"Really? Because I don't recognize this path of the road since before."</p><p>The wizard took an immediate look at the surroundings and realized that his wife was right. There was not meant to be a trail in this part of the forest.</p><p>"I believe you are right, Zsofia. Something is wrong here."</p><p>Suddenly it would seem like the trail disappeared leaving them both in the forest with no path home.</p><p>The Hungarian immediately drew her wand up from here overcoat.</p><p>"We need to get away from here."</p><p>Before Francis could answer he saw a masked figure moving from behind a tree with his wand ready to cast a spell.</p><p>"ZSOFIA! LOOK OUT!" He said throwing himself at her thus dodging the stunning spell had aimed at them.</p><p>She immediately grasped what was going on. It had to be one of the pureblood-supremacists that had plagued this region for far too long. Dark wizards that targeted Muggleborns to sell them for human-trafficking to far-way places where Merlin knows what satanic practices that they would to witches like her.</p><p>Francis directed his own wand at the attacker to cast a full-body binding curse at him.</p><p>"Petrificus Totalus."</p><p>The masked wizard fell down into the snow with his limbs invisibly tied together. The victory was short since two other masked figures, one of them a witch, appeared on the scene ready to attack.</p><p>Francis didn't get if they would to splinch. He grabbed his wife's arm and made attempt to disapparate away to no avail since the wizard-traffickers had cast an anti-apparition spell on the area. They had no other choice but to fight and fight they would.</p><p>Zsofia threw stunning spell but her lowered reflexes made it easy for the attackers to block it with a shield charm.</p><p>Luckily her husband made a sweep with his directed at the tree next to the attacking witch and cast a nonverbal spell which made one branch strangle itself around the masked lady's throat, raising up her entire body several meters above ground while she struggled to free herself.</p><p>"TWO AGAINST ONE. DROP YOUR WAND IMMEDIATELY, WHOEVER YOU ARE, " Francis shouted at the remaining attacker.</p><p>The masked wizard refused to respond and with a quick move with his wand he said; "INCARCERUS."</p><p>Several long ropes were conjured out of thin air and incarcerated Francis from the top to bottom causing him to fall down into the snow as well.</p><p>"Don't care about me! Just focus on taking him down I know you can do it, Zsofia!"</p><p>Even though she was in great panic, his words gave her some extra and confidence and she were ready to cast another spell to defeat her attacker.</p><p>"Expelliarmus!"</p><p>Before he could cast a counterspell, a red light hit his wand causing to fly out of sight, rendering him seemingly defenseless.</p><p>"STUPEFY!"</p><p>This time Zsofia's spell did not hit her target as the wizard easily dodged it with his superior reflexes.</p><p>Then he did something unexpected.</p><p>He clapped his hands while shouting and incarnation that neither Francis or Zsofia had heard of before, which created a massive shock wave that swept through the forest.</p><p>The shock wave caused Zsofia to temporarily shut her eyes and once she opened them again she saw that her wand had been turned to ashes.</p><p>Now she was at a complete loss.</p><p>What should I do now?</p><p>Much to her and Francis's horror, the masked wizard drew a big knife out from his pocket and moved forward.</p><p>"Just give up I won't hurt you, " he calmly said with his knife in the left hand.</p><p>"RUN ZSOFIA, RUN, " Francis shouted, incarcerated at the ground.</p><p>Even though Zsofia hated leaving her husband she understood that there were no other alternatives so she turned around and started running away the fastest she could.</p><p>However, running in high heels on a snowy ground was not to her advantage, exactly and she could hear how the man came closer and closer until she felt his arm around her neck lifting her backward.</p><p>"Let go of me."</p><p>"Don't think so. You are worth too much money for that."</p><p>Those words made her feel cold as ice. The very fact that they kidnapped Muggleborn witches for money made her feel that hope for wizardkind was a long time lost.</p><p>She was caught and would be taken away from her family forever. Francis would be killed and nobody would be left to care for Gellert.</p><p>But then she caught a glimpse of a raven sitting on a tree branch watching over them and now she got an idea.</p><p>"Oppunungo," she said directing her right hand at the man's head.</p><p>"What the hell are you doing Mudblood?"</p><p>Now the raven came flying towards them aiming for the wizard's eyes.</p><p>Zsofia finally managed to free herself from the man</p><p>"GAAAHHHHH," she heard him scream as the raven attempting to scratch out his eyes. He backed off a few meters waving with his knife hoping to kill the bird.</p><p>From behind a Eurasian eagle-owl came in to join the fight, and after the owl, a family of bats joined as well. The warlock was overpowered and the stumbled down on the ground as birds and bats scratched out his eyes and pecked on his skin leaving him a bloody mess.</p><p>Zsofia wanted to cry. To cry for having taken a person's life for the first time ever. But there was no time to cry when she had to check that her husband was safe.</p><p>Francis comforted her wife who's flooded with tears, on their way home.</p><p>"Please, you did what needed to be done. You had no other choice."</p><p>She could not come up with anything to say. Her mind was like a whirlwind of confusing thoughts. Was her soul broken now? Would the other members of the gang seek out revenge? What would happen next? Would the traffickers target Gellert as well?</p><p>They had now reached their home. A three-story mansion guarded by multiple protection charms that made anyone outside the family unable to enter these grounds without permission.</p><p>The door was opened by Anastasia, Gellert's babysitter, who seemed to be worried out of her mind. Anastasia was the squib daughter of one of Zsofia's schoolmates back at Koldovstoretz. Zsofia felt so bad the squib due to her lack of magical powers which made it impossible for her to get any other job in the wizarding world.</p><p>"Mr. and Mrs. Grindelwald, what happened? Why are you home so late?" she said in German with a slight trace of her Moldovan accent.</p><p>"We were attacked by pureblood supremacists and Muggleborn traffickers in the forest, " Francis answered for his wife who was in too much shock to say anything.</p><p>"Oh god! Come in quickly. "</p><p>"Anastasia, is Gellert asleep?" Zsofia asked when she got into the living room.</p><p>"I assume he is, " the blond twenty-year-old replied.</p><p>Zsofia first grabbed one of her extra wands, one that she had won in a fight against a particularly nasty school bully. Then she walked upstairs to her son's room and slowly opened the door to find that Gellert was not asleep but laid in the with his open, staring at the ceiling.</p><p>"Gellert, my why aren't you asleep? It is very late," his mother said walking closer to him.</p><p>"Mother, I had a nightmare, " the child answered.</p><p>"A nightmare you say? What happened in it?"</p><p>"I don't remember exactly. But I was in a dark room, sitting on the floor. When a man came to flying in black smoke. He was pale with red eyes and had no nose."</p><p>The mother became very curious about this.</p><p>"What did he do. This man?"</p><p>"He asked me for something. I don't remember what. Then I saw green and I woke up. "</p><p>His last words echoed in her mind. Then I saw green and I woke up.</p><p>"Well, luckily it was just a dream. Do you want me to read a story for you?"</p><p>Even though it was tempting to just go to bed she knew that she would be able to sleep due to all the crazy things that had happened recently. Perhaps reading a story for her son would set her mind at ease.</p><p>"Aren't you tired, mother?"</p><p>"No, I'm not," she lied. "Which story do you want me to read?"</p><p>"The Tale of the three brothers. "</p><p>"'The Tale of the three brothers', again. Is there not any other you could think of?"</p><p>"It was you who wanted to read a story, mother. "</p><p>"Fine, I get the book," she said.</p><p>The mother pointed her wand at the bookshelf and said; "Accio Tales of the Beedle Bard" which made the book fly to her by itself. She sat herself down next to her son and started reading.</p><p>"There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight —"</p><p>As she continued to read the story she saw how young Gellert's eyes became heavier and until they were closed and fell asleep.</p><p>Zsofia kissed him on his forehead.</p><p>"Goodnight my son, " she said and walked out of the room.</p>
