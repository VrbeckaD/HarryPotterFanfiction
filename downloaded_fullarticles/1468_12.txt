    <p>A Hufflepuff ran in the heels of two Gryffindors with a Ravenclaw and a Slytherin right behind her. They had just broken several school laws, in just one hour. Now you can do nothing but wonder why these five people are running, that is until you start to notice that the Gryffindor at the front of the group is none other than Sirius Black. Right behind him is Remus Lupin. Both boys grinning like there’s no tomorrow. The Hufflepuff girl, Maria Snow, wishes she didn’t just do what she just did yet she still smiles by the fact that she did indeed do it. The Ravenclaw, Andromeda River, she’s a whole other side, she wishes she could have stopped the two Gryffindors and the Hufflepuff and yet she too is oddly satisfied with the accomplishment. At the end of the chase, we have the Slytherin August Milt, who can do nothing but congratulate his Hufflepuff friend in a lowered whispering grin. You would think that Sirius Black and Remus Lupin would do this kind of stuff only with James Potter and Peter Pettegrew, but alas, those two were causing mischief somewhere else in the castle. As Maria Snow would put it <em>‘It started out as a normal school year. That is until the other schools got here, and then all hell broke loose with the games.’ </em></p>
