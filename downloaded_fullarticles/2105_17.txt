    <p>The redheaded teen genius Jasmine Fenton watched in horror as her little brother was hit with multiple high level blasts of electricity that would kill a normal human. Something inside her <i>snapped</i>, as Danny started to fall to the floor when the power was finally cut, forcing her to catch him. Her furious glare barely kept their oblivious parents back as she tended to her barely breathing brother. The cold slowly leaking from her brother's ice based ghost core told her that he was badly hurt and that allowing their ghost obsessed parents near him would mean his final death.</p><p>"Danny and I are going to school. We need lunch money since it clearly isn't safe to approach the kitchen or the lab door in the kitchen," Jasmine informed them both coldly, her voice a furious hiss.</p><p>Maddie, always the more controlled and intelligent of the two parents, dug out some money and handed it over. She instinctively sensed that any attempt to help or otherwise intervene with her two offspring would be unforgivable at this juncture. To her eye Danny looked groggy and in some pain but otherwise unharmed. As a result she didn't argue with her eldest in getting her son away from the equipment that had just hurt him. Jack was still fiddling with the erratic equipment, trying to figure out what had gone wrong, completely oblivious to the stand off between the women of the family.</p><p>Jazz wasted no time in hustling the pair of them out of the house despite it being an hour before they had to leave for school. Dazed blue eyes barely tracked the brilliant orange shaded red hair of his sister as Danny was hustled out the door and into her car.</p><p>"What's this?" Desiree, the genie wishing ghost, watched them leave the house in curiosity.</p><p>Danny's halfa, half ghost-half human, status was as much of an open secret among the ghosts as Vlad "Plasmius" Masters own halfa status. To see the teenage halfa hero so weakened and willingly leaving the relative safety of the ghost fortified building was unsettling. To see the <i>sister's</i> absolute <i>fury</i> as she gently helped her brother into the car was even more disturbing. Just the week before she had snuck into the human world while the heroic brat was distracted saving his clone-sister Dani. Whatever had hurt the ghost boy could potentially destroy most of the rest of the less powerful ghosts.</p><p>"Whichever one of you is hanging around invisible I need you to take a message to Clockwork," Jazz announced casually as Danny finally slipped into unconsciousness in his car seat. Desiree froze fora moment before reluctantly approaching and making herself more human like before dropping her invisibility as she floated slightly above the ground nearby.</p><p>"Why would I deliver a message to the Time Master for <i>you</i>?" Desiree scoffed arrogantly.</p><p>"Fine, then fetch Death and tell him his master is hurt but still sleeping," Jazz shot back sharply, irritation bleeding through her tone. "I just thought you would be more willing to tell Clockwork, his official ghost guardian, that Danny needs him. Of course I'll need to inform Death that his master from another life was dying because some ghost wouldn't play messenger. Maybe Plasmius will be able to save him in time?"</p><p>"And how, exactly, am I to use the portal if the latest danger did this to him?" Desiree asked in her own irritation, jabbing a finger at Danny and his condition. Messing with either Clockwork or Lord Death was bad news. If she needed one of them it was best to play messenger as fast as possible and stay away from the situation until it all blew over no matter what was going on.</p><p>"Go underground and come up behind the portal off to one side before moving into the lab and scooting through the portal," Jazz said sharply. It wasn't like the lab its self was actually ghost proof, just the hunting and examination equipment.</p><p>Desiree nodded sharply and sunk into the ground to obey. She was secretly grateful that the knowledgeable teen had not "wished" for her compliance. For that she would inform both the Time Ghost and several of the ghost boy's allies. The confusing reference to Death's Master would only be mentioned to Clockwork. Every ghost had their secrets after all.</p><p>"What am I going to do with you Danny? My son first, my best friend next, and now my brother who might as well be my son but still a trouble magnet drawn into impossible situations," Jazz sighed. She quickly got them moving, heading her car straight for the Mayor's Office.</p><p>"Miss you can't park there," a police officer complained as Jazz parked on the steps up to town hall.</p><p>"Get the Mayor. Tell him we have a problem regarding ghost halfas!" Jazz snapped at the poor officer before worriedly checking on her still unconscious brother. Realizing the situation might be above his pay grade the officer sent someone nearby running for the Mayor while he stayed with the two teens. In almost no time Vlad was at Jasmine's side checking Danny expertly.</p><p>"What happened?" the tall wiry man with silver hair tied back in a pony tail at the base of his skull asked quietly. The two of them were taking careful care of the downed hero in his human form. Both ignored the crowd of gathering people in favor of their patient.</p><p>"Mom and Dad have a new <i>security invention</i>," Jazz spat, trying not to cry. "If he were normal he would be dead. Seeing it nearly finish the job the portal did unlocked my memories from two previous lives. He passed out as soon as I got him in the car and hasn't woken up since. I sent the wishing ghost that was lurking around after Clockwork as his ghost guardian. Vlad, this is the last straw. Danny will hate it but you need to take custody of us."</p><p>"Damn," Vlad said, cursing properly for once. His normal cursing trend of random sweet things was not enough to adequately describe the situation.</p><p>"We have paramedics on the way sir," the officer from before reported.</p><p>"Good, I might be able to use their supplies to help my godson," Vlad told the man curtly. He never once looked away from his godchildren.</p><p>"Vlad, as Danny's medical proxy since Sam and Tucker aren't here I give you permission to reveal his <i>special</i> medical condition should you deem it necessary," Jazz told him forcefully. Vlad Masters studied his goddaughter for a moment and then nodded slowly.</p><p>"Officer, start the paperwork for a child abuse case against the parents of two minors. Make sure to indicate that I, as their godfather, have taken custody on suspicion of attempted manslaughter if not attempted murder of my godchildren," Vlad said grimly. Turning back to Jasmine he asked one important question that sealed it for the officer. "What did the invention do to Danny?"</p><p>"Enough electricity to make it smell like pork was starting to burn," Jasmine whispered, her voice trembling as her control threatened to break. Vlad cursed like a sailor just as the paramedics showed up in a blaring ambulance and Clockwork arrived to grimly stand off to one side.</p><p>"Why didn't you stop this?!" Vlad demanded of the time ghost, his eyes briefly flashing red in rage as the paramedics did their own check of the unconscious teen.</p><p>"Because I was keeping the Observants from ordering an invasion with the sole purpose of eliminating Daniel from existence! Do you think he would forgive either of us if <i>that</i> had happened?! He is barely going to accept that you and I will have joint custody," Clockwork retorted angrily. He really didn't care about the staring crowd of humans.</p><p>"Enough! Argue later, somewhere there aren't innocents who can't survive an ectoblast!" Jazz ordered the two before they could really get going. "We need solutions or at least temporary measures. The purely human treatments wont be enough and you both know it!"</p><p>"Time Out!" Clockwork said, freezing time for everyone but Vlad, Jasmine, Danny, and - oddly - the paramedics.</p><p>"You will speak of this to no one!" Vlad ordered the frightened paramedics who quickly nodded their agreement.</p><p>"Just give the boy your blood. I will infuse it with extra ectoenergy as it passes through the transfer tube," Clockwork said pointedly. "And before the pair of you argue I have been a ghost for thousands of years and tended to more than my fair share on a medical basis. This is not new to me."</p><p>"We need to test the blood type first..." one paramedic started forcefully only to be glared into silence by everyone moving aside from his partner. Clockwork floated over and promptly triggered Danny's transformation. The paramedics watched their patient in shock and only when they looked up at the Mayor did Vlad also change.</p><p>"There are no other possible donors unless Danny managed to rescue that one female clone of himself and stabilize her but we have no idea if she even still exists," Vlad said softly. "The ghost energy should compensate for any blood type differences. It will be dangerous enough with just myself and his still fully human sister."</p><p>"Well alright then," the paramedic said and they got to work. This was highly unorthodox and could cost them their jobs if they said anything or the kid fully died but it was also a clear chance to keep the kid breathing. They took it.</p><p>"Oh what I wouldn't give for a blood replenishing potion or two just now!" Jazz scowled as she worriedly watched the blood and energy infusion from both ghostly men flow into her brother.</p><p>"Jasmine, prepare to give a litre of your own blood. Be warned, he will wake with his memories of being Harry James Potter," Clockwork instructed sternly. Just then the paramedics started to worry about taking too much blood from Mayor Masters/Ghost Plasmius.</p><p>"I had guessed that. My son has always been a trouble magnet," Jazz said wryly. Vlad gave a quiet gasp and clutched at his head while the paramedics unhooked him from the blood transfer set up, moving it to connect to Jasmine Fenton.</p><p>"Sit down man and let the Occlumency skill flow," Clockwork ordered Vlad as he continued infusing the flowing blood with ectoenergy.</p><p>"I fixated on the wrong red head," Vlad muttered ruefully twenty minutes later as he gave an unimpressed Jasmine a sheepish smile. It was clear that he now had a handle on his new/old memories.</p><p>"Green eyes? Untamable hair? Inability to stay out of trouble? Even worse inability to leave someone unrescued in a life threatening situation? Ring a bell?" Jazz said pointedly, completely unimpressed.</p><p>"Lily's child," Vlad agreed with a sigh. He mentally checked for his magic, switching between forms, only to find that his ability to use magic was present and balanced with his ghost core.</p><p>"My child," Jazz agreed archly. Vlad's eyes widened at the confirmation and ruefully nodded his understanding.</p><p>"I have memories from both Severus and Voldemort. Although, Voldemort's memories are so chaotic as to almost not even be there. He truly was insane," Vlad said carefully, wary of the young woman standing before him.</p><p>"Lily Evans and Hermione Granger... Professor," Jazz smirked. "Does this mean you will stop obsessing over mom?"</p><p>"As long as you accept that I will be obsessing over yourself and Daniel instead, although probably not romantically," Vlad grimaced. "We are lucky that my ghostly obsession could be refocused at all."</p><p>"No way fruit loop!" Danny groaned, having come too in time to hear about the obsession target switch but nothing else.</p><p>"Danny! Enough is enough. We're staying with Vlad from now on... you almost didn't make it," Jazz explained quietly, tears in her voice that made her brother cringe. The paramedics quietly moved back away from the siblings, unhooking the pair from the blood transfer setup.</p><p>"She is right young Daniel. You can discuss your new memories once we are all safely elsewhere. The alternative to Plasmius sharing custody with myself of both you and your sister was allowing the Observants to order the extermination of yourself and the entire town. My arguments barely stopped them which is why I was late arriving," Clockwork observed apologetically. "Madeline and Jack no longer have any right to either of you, nor to your clone-sister. For the legalities I listed you both as her cousin on the paperwork but with Daniel holding primary guardianship as her legal father. Once she returns to you she is to live with you until she is of age in both realms. This was the other part of stopping the Observants for she would have been hunted down as being a part of you."</p><p>"Shit," Danny cursed. No one argued with his response, all of them feeling that he had a right to it for this situation. The moment he actually tried to get up his body reverted to his human form, much to the interest of the paramedics.</p><p>"Any issues?" Clockwork asked mildly, indicating Danny and his general health as the halfa got to his feet and did a brief once over.</p><p>"I think I'm going to be extra tired for awhile but otherwise what ever you all did seems to have fixed it. As long as I don't have to fight Skulker or Pariah Dark in the next week I should be okay, assuming that Vlad is willing to agree to a truce with us all living together?" Danny asked pointedly.</p><p>"Brat, yes... we can suspend your combat training until you've actually recovered. I will settle for moving our impromptu spars into a cleared zone and you accepting my place as your guardian over the previous apprenticeship offer. I wont even ask that you renounce Jack... as long as you go along with the legal things I started before Clockwork showed up," Vlad offered.</p><p>"Legal things that I will be helping along and smoothing over in regards to both of your halfa status as needed," Clockwork tossed in pointedly. Both ghostly men knew how stubborn Danny could be.</p><p>"Alright, alright, I get the point! I'm not getting out of living with Vlad," Danny scowled, trying not to pout.</p><p>"Good," Vlad said curtly as he finally reverted to human form. The time master simply smiled and returned time to its normal flow without a word.</p><p>"To arrange for the custody transfer and press charges you will need a closed hearing. We will give our affidavits to the police about our official position on his medical status. You will still need someone fully certified to check him and be read in on his special medical condition," the lead paramedic informed the Mayor quietly. "I recommend reporting your own condition to the board and requesting that all of the records be sealed on a safety basis once the decision is made. Make sure that you explain your own alternate appearances and the damage from them. The judge might order you to give reparations to previously affected parties but he should also recognize that you or one of the full ghost are the only ones who can effectively help him since the Fentons are out of the question."</p><p>"I'll be certain to make sure that the judge officially declares us as still human and living as well as citizens to head off <i>those</i> parts as well," Vlad said with a grimace and a sigh of agreement. With that he ushered the two teen Fentons back into City Hall and further into his office as Clockwork peacefully floated along behind them. It was going to be a <i>long</i> day.</p>
