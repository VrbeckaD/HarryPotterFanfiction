    <p>It was an early morning when Aurora Lily Black was born. Her parents Remus Lupin-Black and Sirius Black were enchanted by how beautiful their daughter was. She had ginger-ish brown hair, pale skin with some freckles and beautiful silver eyes with some golden flakes in them.</p>
<p>“She has your hair Rem” stated Sirius with some “manly” tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Yes..” said tired Remus “But she has your beautiful eyes” he stated again with love written on his face.</p>
<p>“I can’t wait till she’s older, we will have soooo much fun and pranking to do! You will see love she will have the best dad ever!”</p>
<p>“Of course, you’ll be the ‘fun’ parent, and I will be the responsible one” said Remus with en eye roll, but there was a found smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Well I think it’s for the best I don’t want my cute goddaughter to become like her flirtatious father”</p>
<p>Right then through the door stepped Lily and James Potter, with little Harry in James’s arms.<br/>
Harry was 3 month old boy with tan skin, black as night hair and emerald green eyes. He looked just like his father, but his eyes were just like Lily’s.</p>
<p>“Well Mrs <em>Potter</em>, I will take that as a complement” said Sirius with smirk</p>
<p>Lily just rolled her eyes and asked “How are you feeling Remus?”</p>
<p>“Good given the fact that I given birth few hours ago”</p>
<p>“Well when Lily gave birth she was all pale and sick looking, you really look good mate” said James with a grin on his face and seconds later he was elbowed by his red haired wife.</p>
<p>“Thanks James” answered Remus</p>
<p>“Okey so now can I see my little Rora?” asked Lily with with an excitement</p>
<p>“Of course after all, you are her godmother” said Remus with a smile</p>
<p>“Well if she gets to hold her goddaughter then I can hold my godson!” said Sirius already running to James and Harry</p>
<p>Everyone in the room rolled their eyes at him. Soon after that Aurora was in Lily’s arms, and Harry in Sirius. Remus and Lily were talking about their children, and James and Sirius were playing with little Harry.</p>
<p>It was evening now Potters already left the Lupin-Black residence. Little Aurora was sleeping, Sirius and Remus were laying in bed in loving embrace. After a while Remus spoke in quiet and gentle almost scared tone.</p>
<p>“Sirius?”</p>
<p>“Yes love?” answered Sirius</p>
<p>“What if.. she’s like.. <em>me</em>? A monster that everybody fears..?” asked Remus with fear and tears in his honey like eyes</p>
<p>“Love <em>you</em> are not a monster, and you will <em>never</em> be. If Rora is a werewolf then nothing will change I will love her the same, even stronger” said Sirius with serious expression</p>
<p>“You.. you will?” asked Remus with tears falling down his freckled cheeks</p>
<p>“Of course. I will love just as I love you Rem” stated Sirius with a gentle smile moon was shining through the window making his eyes even more silver. Remus wasn’t a big fan of the moon but he loved seeing Sirius’s eyes almost <em>glow</em> in the moonlight.</p>
<p>“I love you too Siri” said Remus with a loving smile on his pink lips</p>
<p>After hearing Remus say that Sirius pulled honey eyed man and kissed him. The kiss was gentle and loving.</p>
<p>When the kiss ended both of them hugged each other and fell asleep.</p>
