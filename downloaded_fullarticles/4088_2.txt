<hr/><p> </p><p>Tom heard the tinkling of the bell above the shop door, carefully closed his book and placed it behind the counter before looking up. A cloaked, hooded figure stood in the dim light, slowly turning around as if taking in every detail. His face broke into his most charming smile and he straightened up a little more. “May I help you?”</p><p>Two elegant hands pushed down the hood and revealed a pale, pointed face with snub nose, dark eyes and bobbed, black hair. Cherry-red lips curved into a thin smile. Tom swallowed, slightly uncomfortable under the steady gaze that seemed to see right through him. She didn't respond. Tom squared his shoulders and doubled the charm, repeating his earlier question. “May I help you?”</p><p>The woman gave him one more piercing look, then waved a dismissive hand. “I’m just looking around for now, thank you.” She turned away and started examining a display of cursed jewelry.</p><p>Tom felt strangely irritated by her dismissal. He came around the counter and joined her at the display. “Are you looking for anything in particular? A birthday gift, perhaps?” He made an effort to look beguiling and interested, but the cool, assessing gaze that met his was clearly not fooled. The woman straightened up abruptly and walked over to the counter, where she stood tapping her foot impatiently until he came around and faced her again. This time, his smile was a little more strained. “How may I be...”</p><p>“I wish to sell some jewelry,” she cut in, placing a velvet purse on the counter and opening it with deft movements. “Make me an offer.” She rolled the contents out on the counter with a grand sweeping gesture, two diamond bracelets and a ruby necklace shining up at Tom in the dim light. He cast a <em> Lumos </em> to examine them closer,blinking against the sudden radiance of the stones and reached out a hand to touch them.</p><p>“Are you sure you want to do that?” The woman’s voice cut through the silence.</p><p>Tom looked up, his eyebrows raised.</p><p>“How long have you been working here?”</p><p>The sneer in her voice irritated Tom, but he maintained his charming smile and tried to hide his annoyance. The amused glint in her dark eyes told him he hadn’t quite succeeded. “Five years,” he answered, retracting his hand and whisking out a pair of dragon hide gloves in one smooth move. “I don’t believe I’ve seen you here before, Miss. I’m sure I’d have remembered.” He flickered his eyelashes at her, but his attempt at ingratiating himself with her seemed to backfire. Women didn’t usually burst out laughing when he gave them that look.</p><p>“And you didn’t bother asking if these were cursed before trying to touch them? I’m surprised you still have all your limbs.”</p><p>Tom could feel his cheeks heat up. That had been a mistake. A stupid mistake. And, upon closer inspection, he could feel the faint, dark pulse of a curse surrounding one of the diamonds in each bracelet. Damn that woman. “Do you know which curse?” he asked.</p><p>“Don’t you?”</p><p>Tom ground his teeth. This woman was getting to him in the worst possible way. “If it’s no more than a simple Fidelity Curse I don’t see it adding much value,” he murmured in a disparaging tone.</p><p>She laughed again. That laugh was beginning to grate on his nerves.</p><p>“I can offer you 200 Galleons for the set.” He saw the flash of displeasure in her eyes and couldn’t help the smug little smile that crept onto his face. “Honesty, we have many such bracelets and they are not in high demand. The ruby necklace is a fine piece, but rubies are not particularly the gem of choice for our clientele.” He shrugged and put on a sympathetic face. “I’m sorry I cannot offer you more.” He gave her a once-over, intending to let the disdain sip through his gaze as his eyes flicked from her face over her clothes to her shoes and back up, but he couldn’t find any sign of the usual impoverished Pureblood pretending that everything was fine even though the vaults were running empty. No, her cloak was of the finest wool, a beautiful Midnight Black turning to Slytherin green depending on the light, a perfect teardrop diamond necklace around her neck, her dragon hide boots shone in the dim shop light and the lace cuffs that poked out from under her cloak were of the best quality, no mending in sight. This woman was not desperate to sell family jewels just to keep her style of living.</p><p>She had pursed her lips in a smirk that almost made her look attractive while she let him assess her, but she didn’t speak. She only cocked her head a little to the side, as if listening for something, and a moment later, Tom heard what she had noticed before him: the footsteps of Mr. Burke coming down the stairs. Her gaze fixed on the door behind him.</p><p>He bristled again. She was ignoring him, as if he was of no consequence. If he ever found out her name, she’d regret crossing paths with him…</p><p>Mr. Burke waddled into the shop, his beady eyes studying the customer and Tom’s tense shoulders. Before he could address either of them, however, the woman spoke again.</p><p>“I’m afraid I shall have to take my goods elsewhere. I will suffer insolence if i must but I will not be insulted by such an offer.” She moved to gather the jewelry into the velvet purse again, but Mr. Burke stayed her hand. “Tom, what did you offer the lady for these gems? I’m sure we can come to an understanding, Miss…” He let the words trail off, but she didn’t offer her name.</p><p>“Only 200 Galleons. It’s an insult, Mr. Burke. If this is the best you can offer…” She shook her head in dismay. “I honestly think your little assistant here has no clue what he is doing. And I will not do business with idiots.” She yanked her arm free and gathered the bracelets and necklace into the purse.</p><p>“5000 Galleons.”</p><p>Tom’s mouth dropped open in surprise at the offer his boss made. He hadn’t even looked closely at the jewels.</p><p>The woman sent him a triumphant smile, then turned to Mr. Burke. “Much better. How about 6500? You know you can easily get twice that for that set of bracelets, but I need to get them off my hands.”</p><p>Mr. Burke only hesitated for one brief moment. Then he nodded, sending Tom to the back with an impatient wave of his hand. “Go check out the stock, Tom, I’ll finish this transaction with the lady.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p align="left"> </p><p>Tom was fuming. Fuming! That bloody woman had ruined his entire day. She had destroyed his credibility with Burke, and she had gotten the better of him in every single part of their conversation. Maddening. Infuriating. He’d never forget that grating laugh. He’d find her and teach her the consequences of …</p><p>“You should learn to pay attention to details.”</p><p>He stiffened and turned, wand in hand, to face the figure in the shadows. He’d not seen her when he passed that spot, but he recognised that voice immediately. In two steps he stood in front of her, almost nose to nose, his wand pressing in her throat.</p><p>“What do you want? Haven’t you done enough?”</p><p>She laughed again. “Oh, my Lord,” she said, shaking her head, “How did you ever get those idiots to follow you the first time around? You’re so easy to rile up.”</p><p>Tom stepped back a little, lowering his wand to his side. His eyes narrowed as he studied her. She had called him Lord, but he wasn’t sure if she was using the Muggle expression or referring to his alter ego. But that was a name he only used with his closest friends, the name only a select few knew. She was not one of them. Unless someone had blabbed. He ground his teeth together.</p><p>Her hand reached out and cupped his jaw, her thumb stroking his cheekbones and then his lips. “I didn’t expect you to be so handsome,” she murmured. “You don’t look like old Snakeface at all. Let’s keep it this way, this time round, shall we?” Her mouth curved into a sinful smile. “Hmm, I can work with this.”</p><p>“What do you want?” he repeated, channeling his confusion into anger. His blue eyes flickered red for a moment.</p><p>She drew in a sharp breath. Then, without warning, she pressed her lips onto his, nibbling, tasting, a little tentative, but when he didn’t push her away, with more confidence. Her tongue slipped between his lips and sent sparks of fire through his body. He balled his hands into fists, unwilling to give in completely. But, oh sweet Salazar, when she bit his lip and sucked away the pain, he couldn’t help groaning.</p><p>She broke the kiss and smiled again. “I can definitely work with this.”</p><p>“I still don’t know what you want.”</p><p>The woman tucked her arm into the crook of his elbow and began to walk towards Diagon Alley. “My name is Pansy Parkinson. I was there when you lost your final battle, and life hasn’t been very kind to me since then. So I travelled back in time to find you before you started doing the idiotic things that led to your downfall.” She shot him a sideways glance. “I fear I’m a little too late, but I couldn’t very well go back much further. It wouldn’t be proper. Now we’re about the same age. Much better.”</p><p>Tom drew in a slow, deep breath. The woman’s answer didn’t make sense. It didn’t make sense at all. How could she know? What did she know? He stopped just before they reached Diagon Alley and turned towards her. “I have no idea what you are trying to imply, but…”</p><p>She placed a finger on his lips, then stood on tiptoes to bring her mouth close to his ear. Her breath ghosted along his cheek, sending goosebumps down his neck.</p><p>“I’m here to help you conquer the world, my Lord. And, believe me,” she stepped back again with a mischievous grin, “You will need help.”<br/>
