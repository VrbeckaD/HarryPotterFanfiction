    <p>Draco Malfoy was fuming. Harry fucking Potter was the reason. </p><p>The green-eyed prick had been ignoring Draco for at least two weeks now. </p><p>And that was not okay. They were arch-enemies for Merlin’s sake! Potter can’t ignore him! Draco wouldn’t allow it.</p><p>So there Draco was in front of Potter’s door after sneaking past the Fat Lady who was, surprisingly agreeable, about letting him into the dorm. </p><p>Something about Harry finally being happy or some nonsense like that. Walking quietly from the common room which was empty, for it was a holiday where the students could visit home. </p><p>Draco had chosen to stay at school, so he wouldn’t have to be bothered by his mother’s constant attempts to force him together with Pansy. </p><p>Draco suspected that Harry was likely to be in his room because he had heard that the boy wonder had had a fight with the red haired boy and his lousy bushy-haired girlfriend. </p><p>The fight had been huge and the trio hadn’t spoken in weeks. Almost as long as Harry had not been fighting with Draco. </p><p>Gathering up the fleeting courage he had left Draco knocked on Harry’s door. Not hearing any movement from inside, Draco knocked harder than before starting to get angry that Harry was not responding to his knocks. </p><p>Before he could knock one more time the door swung open, the occupant almost getting hit with Draco’s, albeit small, fists. </p><p>“Draco?” Harry said bemusedly leaning against the doorway in a sort of seductive way.</p><p>Before he had come here Draco had a list of things he wanted to say to Potter, many of them being angry, but now that he was in the presence of him, all of his confidence flew out the door. </p><p>Harry had obviously been sleeping before being awakened by Draco’s knocking so his hair should have been a mess. Wrong!  Instead it looked like he had just shagged someone to hell and back. </p><p>He was wearing loose-fitting sweatpants that seemed to be hanging by the sheer willpower of his hips, which were narrow. </p><p>The sweatpants were pulled down enough so if Draco really tried (which he totally wasn’t because that would be wrong) he could just slightly see Harry’s happy trail.</p><p> Even without looking down there, Draco could see Harry’s..impressive package. </p><p>Trailing his eyes upward, Draco gasped softly at the defined stomach that Harry possessed. Of course Harry had grown up unlike Draco who had maintained a sort of child-like physique, mostly in height. </p><p>When they were younger Draco had at least been an inch taller than Harry but now Harry was towering over Draco. Draco couldn’t say that he minded though. Harry was the epitome of a dream man. </p><p>“Draco you alright there love?” Harry said snapping his fingers in front of Draco’s face, as if to wake him up. </p><p>Draco blinked quickly before moving back slightly his face blushing hard. </p><p>“I am not your love and I am perfectly fine!” Draco said quickly </p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow before chuckling quietly. </p><p>“You've always got something smart to say don’t you.” </p><p>Before Draco could respond with something smart again, Harry sighed and said “Are you going to come in or shall I leave you out here?” </p><p>Rolling his eyes primly, Draco muttered a small “Ugh”before walking into Harry’s room</p><p>Harry once again raised his eyebrow before closing the door behind the blonde prima donna. </p><p>Harry was faced with Draco sitting very properly on his bed as to not disturb anything in his vicinity. </p><p>Harry couldn’t help but stare at the beauty.</p><p> Draco looked particularly soft that evening, with the evening sun coming from Harry’s window coming through and hitting Draco in just the right light, he looked like an angel. </p><p>His grey eyes were reproachful but also very innocent. He had stopped slicking back his hair a long time ago and started growing it out, so now he looked almost like a lady. </p><p>“Well Draco is there anything I can do for you?” Harry asked sweetly</p><p>Once again Draco blushed.</p><p> Apparently being in Harry’s room, with Harry standing and talking so commandingly did things to Draco. </p><p>Never one to give up, Draco breathed quietly and looked up at Harry with fire in his eyes. </p><p>“Yes Potter, you can do something for me”</p><p>Harry motioned for him to continue </p><p>“You can stop treating me like I am nothing! I am your arch-nemesis and you better act like it. Malfoys’ do not allow ugly little boys like you to treat them like trash. I am and always will be better than you! We are enemies, we are supposed to fight and the fact that you are not paying attention to me is unacceptable!” Draco finished panting slightly. </p><p>For a moment the room was still as Harry looked at Draco in part astonishment and part amusement, before breaking out into a laughter. </p><p>Shocked Draco stood up in a fury.</p><p>“You fucking arse! You brainless prat!” Draco yelled fuming trying to reach the door so he could make a stormy exit. </p><p>Before he could get to the door handle, Draco felt Harry grab him by the hips and push him into the door. </p><p>Draco gasped at the sudden proximity, his body heating up almost immediately.</p><p> Harry pressed Draco harder against the door to try and stop him from wriggiling, and in that gained a moan. </p><p>Draco whimpered out “P-Potter wh-?” </p><p>“Call me by my name” Harry said quickly cutting Draco off also squeezing him harder. </p><p>Letting out a whine Draco replied “ Harry! W-what are you doing?” </p><p>Feeling Harry grin against his neck, Draco’s eyes widened in surprise before he was whirled around and facing Harry. </p><p>“Well baby, I’m just paying attention to you. Isn’t that what you wanted?” Harry said with small grin.</p><p>By now Draco’s face was fire truck red and he was curling in on himself as to not let Harry seem him so vulnerable. </p><p>Harry noticing this, pushed his leg between Draco’s thighs, making Draco look even more delicious. </p><p>“Now poppet, what did you call me?”</p>
