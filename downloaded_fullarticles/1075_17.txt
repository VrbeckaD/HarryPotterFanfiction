    <p>Scorpius sat on the floor of the Slytherin common room, with parchment, quills, and books in front of him. The rain is pattering on the windows of the common room. He’s working on an essay for history of magic, but he has gotten distracted by the loudness of the rain. He’s in deep thought, thinking of sweet nothings, just random thoughts that have popped up in his mind, Albus was one of them. How could he not think of his beautiful boyfriend? For Scorpius, it was almost impossible to not think of him every second of the day.</p>
<p>Speak of the devil, the portrait hole swung open, and there was Albus, covered head to toe in mud.</p>
<p>“Sorry quidditch practice ran late.” he apologized. He was holding his quidditch robes in his arms, and he removed his dirty boots and put them by the door for the house elves to clean. Most of the time, Saturday practice only went until two, but it was now three. Albus had become the seeker for the Slytherin team in the middle of the season when the old seeker quit. It was quite odd that a player just quit because it didn’t happen a lot. Quidditch spots are envied and hard to get.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” Scorpius said. Albus sat down next to him and gave him a quick kiss. It was no secret that they were together. As soon as they got back from Christmas break, they just held hands around the castle, and questions began to spring up. Most of them were “Are you together?” which they had simply said “Yes” to. That was way easier than making a huge announcement. </p>
<p>There were only about five other people in the common room. Most of them were studying, only two of them were talking quietly.</p>
<p>“How did you get covered in so much mud?” Scorpius asked his boyfriend.</p>
<p>“Oh,” Albus grinned a little. “ Well, it’s raining, as you can tell, so it’s really muddy. And I fell off my broom a few times, and well, the mud kind of became a joke after a little. So the others were throwing mud at me every once in a while. It was all good fun.” Scorpius laughed a little.</p>
<p> “So… why don’t we go upstairs and have some fun,” Albus said sensually, implying that they would snog.</p>
<p>“Albus, I can’t, I have to study,” he argued.</p>
<p>“C’mon!” Albus insisted. “Please?” Scorpius put down his quill.</p>
<p>“Fine,” he said “But if I get lower than a nine mark on this, you’ll be the one to blame.”</p>
<p>“Scorp, you never get lower than a nine mark, ever. You have nothing to worry about.”</p>
<p>A few minutes later, they were enjoying the privacy of their dorm room. They were mostly just cuddling instead of snogging. Scorpius felt as if he could lay in Albus’s arms for eternity. Scorpius was truly in love, even though he had never said it, he wanted to, he just didn’t know if Albus felt the same. Scorpius’s face was buried in the crook of Albus’s neck. He looked up at Albus and pressed a kiss to his mouth. Albus pulled away and smiled, then kissed Scorpius again, more passionately. Scorpius slipped his tongue into Albus’s mouth. Their tongues danced together, and at that moment, Scorpius decided that snogging was better than anything. Albus pulled away and started sucking on the tender spot he’d found on Scorpius’s neck. </p>
<p>“Oh, Al.” Scorpius moaned. When he was with Albus, nothing seemed to matter except the two of them, the world seemed to revolve around them.</p>
<p>“Shit,” Albus said when he stopped sucking on his boyfriend’s neck.</p>
<p>“What?” Scorpius asked. What was wrong? Why was Albus worried?</p>
<p>“Go look in the mirror.” Albus just said.</p>
<p>Scorpius sat up and pulled open the green curtains on Albus’s four poster bed. He walked over to the dormitory mirror.</p>
<p>“Shit,” he echoed. He saw a bright red hickey that Albus had left on his neck. It was too high to be covered by his collar, so it was very noticeable. Albus started to laugh on the bed.</p>
<p>“Hey!” Scorpius said. “You’re the little shit that left this, you’re not getting off that easily.” he hopped back up on the bed, closed the curtains again, and started tickling Albus’s feet, where he was the most ticklish. Albus laughed and laughed.</p>
<p>“Stop! Stop!” He cried out to Scorpius. Scorpius stopped tickling his foot, but he didn’t let it go. He pressed a kiss to the bottom of Albus’s foot. Albus let out a small gasp, but he looked like he was enjoying it when Scorpius started to suck on his big toe.</p>
<p>“Getting kinky huh, Scorp?” Albus made fun of him lovingly. Scorpius blushed.</p>
<p>“Shut up, obviously you like it,” he said, referring to Albus’s obviously hard member. Now, it was Albus’s turn to blush.</p>
<p>“Maybe you could do something about that?” Albus asked. Scorpius blushed once again. Albus turned him on so much when he uses that sexy voice. He leaned down and kissed him, and put a hand on his crotch area. They’d never done anything more than snogging before, so this would be a first.</p>
<p>“Little tease,” Albus said against Scorpius’s lips. </p>
<p>“It’s not teasing if I plan to go through with it.” Scorpius said. But, before they could get much farther, the dormitory door opened.</p>
<p>“WE’RE COMING IN WITH OUR EYES CLOSED.” Charlie Wood yelled, he’s walked in on some stuff before, so now he’s extra careful. “ARE YOU DECENT?” Albus sat up and adjusted so you couldn’t see his boner.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Scorpius said and opened the curtains on Albus’s bed. Standing there, was their roommates, Blaise Zabini Jr, Charlie Wood, and Marcus Clearwater.</p>
<p>“Just had to check,” Charlie said.</p>
<p>“Do you guys want to play a round of exploding snap?” Blaise asked them. Scorpius turned to Albus, who looked annoyed that that’s what they had interrupted their heated snogging for.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Scorpius said for the both of them, then turned back to look at Albus, who was pouting. <em>Later</em> Scorpius mouthed to him.</p>
