  <em>
    <span class="s1">24 October 1997</span>
  </em>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">This was all wrong and Percy was approximately ninety-six percent convinced he would end up either in Azkaban or in St. Mungo’s by dawn.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">How had he even gotten to this point? Everything had been perfectly fine when he had simply kept his chin up and spoke only in slews of ‘yessir’s and ‘nosir’s. Those were simpler times. Well—maybe not as simple as he had fooled himself into thinking. It had just been easier to pretend they were simple. Easy to work away the days in the Ministry, go through the motions of the same exact dinner with Penny, add yet another unopened letter from Mum to the rapidly growing pile… everything about that was complicated for some subliminal reason, that was true, but Percy had grown into the routine of it all. Routine could fool even the cleverest people into thinking everything was perfectly fine.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Routine had been shattered into a million tiny pieces since the wedding of his brother that he had refused to attend.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Percy wasn’t even sure what his official job title was anymore. He just knew he worked for the Ministry and, for the first time ever, that left a sour taste in his mouth. Penny had abruptly ended things with him—it was easier to leave the wizarding world entirely, just pretend she was a muggle, at the very least while this war was still being waged. Maybe that end had been a long time coming. Percy had felt a troubling amount of nothing about that whole situation, though that might have been because he kept thinking about his sister and brothers.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Of course, he was too proud to actually <em>go see </em>if they were okay.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And then he did… <em>something</em>. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He hadn’t meant to do it, the first time it had happened. Everything just… pressed down on him. <em>Life</em> forced him into it, Percy kept telling himself. Maybe he really was more heartbroken about Penny than he realized. Maybe he felt more than just sour about being stuck in the Ministry. Whatever it was, it weighed on him and pushed his patience to the very edges. And then he hadn’t even realized what he was doing, at the conception of this <em>something</em>. Instinctively, he had moved his quill with a careless look on his face and a complete disregard for neatness. It had been one of the few actions that Percy had done with absolutely no thought to the future. No planning. But all of a sudden, the weeping muggleborn sitting across from him was his third cousin once removed—you have Great Aunt Muriel to thank for that, always so secretive about her cousins abroad.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The woman was thin, her blonde hair wispy and her face gaunt and thin, but she had offered Percy a shaky smile and a sob before proudly presenting her Ministry-approved family tree to the Death Eater waiting on her. Percy had had a panic attack later that night and hadn’t slept a wink. What had he <em>done</em>?</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The next day, he did it again. On purpose, this time, and more meticulous. He had thought it out, as Percy did all things, and it would be a great deal more foolproof and credible. Yes, he had perfected this system.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He didn’t have another panic attack. The insomnia, however, persisted.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">So Percy did more. If he couldn’t sleep, he had to at least be productive. He had to wash the stink of the Ministry off of himself somehow. If guilt had a smell, that would be it. Percy had never felt extremely guilty, not even when his brothers kept telling him it was the only thing he <em>should</em> have been feeling. It wasn’t an emotion with which he wanted to be acquainted.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He had always been the observant type, someone that prided himself on knowing the ins and outs of everything. There were places where the muggleborns would gather, places that were safe, even if only for a few days. When Percy couldn’t sleep, he would try to help in whatever way he could. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At first, people had been apprehensive about his presence. Then Percy had started showing up in denim trousers instead of his work robes and that had helped.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And now… oh, gods above, the reality of it all was starting to crush him a bit. Cool, Calm Collected Percy Weasley was slipping away with each second he kept staring at the ominous, cryptic invite in his hands. It had been a pain to even decode, but he had gotten it in the end.</span>
</p><p class="p3" align="center">
  <span class="s1"></span>
    <em>The day of Odin’s wife</em><br/>
<span class="s1">
    <em>At Artemis’ twilight<br/>
</em>
  </span>
  <span class="s1"></span>
  <em>In the office of the pyrotechnic healer</em>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The note had appeared on his desk in a sealed Ministry envelope, along with the scribbled note ‘you should be clever enough, Weasley.’ For once, the mythology they had learned in Astronomy class had been put to good use. Percy had recalled the legends of Frigg and Odin, how the day ‘Friday’ came to be. Any fool knew Artemis was the goddess of the night. And the last line…</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Well, it was only thanks to Fred and George that he knew it referred to Dr Filibuster’s Fireworks.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Decisively, Percy crumpled the note in his hand and glanced around the dusk-lit street. The air smelled of an oncoming rain, not unusual weather for this time of year, though certainly not welcome. It was a stifling quiet—all of the streets became eerily empty once the sun started to go down nowadays. Anyone with a sane head on their shoulders was scared to be caught out alone after dark. The brief, rational thought that it could all be a trap, that the Death Eaters had caught onto him all this time and decided to lay a trap that would stroke his ego a little, occurred to him as his other hand wrapped around the cold doorknob.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That thought was gone by the time he crossed the threshold.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The bell above him jingled as the door opened and closed, followed by a silence that filled the empty shop. Percy glanced around with a confused frown, a slight panic setting in before he quickly decided that that was <em>ridiculous</em>. He had already committed, it was too late to panic now. What sort of bloody Gryffindor was he? So he lifted his chin slightly, took a few slow steps forward, and continue to look around.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hello?” he called out.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Maybe he had gotten the invite wrong.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The jangle of a bead curtain and the sound of footsteps drew Percy’s attention to a sharp focus and eliminated all doubt that had set in his mind. His eyes landed near the cash register, where a woman now stood with a friendly smile on her face. She had dark, curly hair piled high on her head and brown eyes that settled on him with a scrutinizing focus that conflicted her easy grin.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sorry to keep you waiting,” she spoke once their eyes met, a thick Scottish accent coming out. It was startling, much bigger than her body. From her short stature and pristine posture, he had expected something a little more soft and southern. “Can I help you find anything?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1"><em>Fuck</em>. The note didn’t say anything about <em>this</em>. Percy’s eyes shifted to the woman’s forearm for a second before focusing back on her face. There was no Mark, not that he could see, anyways. She was small, and thin—though that was more of a guess based on the way her baggy tee with shimmering block letters reading ‘WEIRD SISTERS 1995: HIPPOGRIFF ON FIRE TOUR’ billowed about her frame.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I would like to…” Percy trailed off, slowly stepping toward the cash register as he glanced around the shop in the hopes of a <em>hint</em> of some sort. Finally reaching the counter and running out of stalling time, he met the woman’s eyes once more and gulped. Well, he wasn’t a Gryffindor if he didn’t at least <em>try</em>. “To see the… <em>healer</em>.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The woman only raised an eyebrow at him, her expression otherwise unchanging, and the space in between them filled with a deafening silence as she continue to pierce through him with her sharp gaze.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And then she snorted out a laugh, a hand going to her mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Oh, gods, Weasley—you’re <em>funny</em>.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Percy’s face dropped as he blinked far too many times. “Wh—what?”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The woman only shook her head and let out a sigh, then moved towards the doorway behind the counter that was shrouded by a bead curtain. She pulled the curtain aside, revealing a tiny broom closet. “In ya go, Weasley. Don’t worry—you’ve been approved for passage,” she said with a nod towards the small space.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That’s a broom closet,” Percy stated simply, finally getting over the initial shock of the woman’s reaction. She was young, he realized the longer he stared at her. Probably similar to him in age. Was he young? He certainly didn’t feel it.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What? Scared of cleaning supplies?” the woman challenged with a smirk.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“<em>No</em>. No, I just—” Percy cut himself off and sighed, then moved around the counter and stopped in front of the woman, spreading his arms out in exasperation. “All right? In I go.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">One step in and Percy felt as if he had just been shoved into the lake back at Hogwarts, in the middle of winter. There was a cold and wet feeling that sank into his bones. He tried to move faster and faster, but whatever was wrapped around him was not allowing him to change his speed any which way. It felt like an eternity until, finally, warmth started to spread up through his body, from his feet to his legs, his chest, until he was stumbling forward uncontrollably.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Once Percy managed to regain his balance, he finally paused to look around again, his jaw slowly dropping as he took in his surroundings. <em>How…?</em></span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A light tap under his chin snapped him back to reality and Percy glanced down at the source of the tap. “Don’t want any pixies flying in, do ya?” the woman teased with a smirk before walking past him, the implication that Percy should follow left to his imagination.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Beyond the bead curtain was more than just a broom closet. The place was…<em> massive</em>. Percy figured this level of magic had to be on par with the Room of Requirement. They had entered through some foyer of sort, that much was evident. It seemed to be decorated like any house, hardwood floors covered in rugs that vaguely reminded him of home and tacky wallpaper that reminded him of Muriel. It was evidently lived in, candles were floating above them lighting the place well and the sound of conversation filled the space. Something vaguely smelling of shepherd’s pie made his stomach grumble.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The woman took a sharp turn through a doorway to their left and Percy quickly changed course to follow her into a room that was decorated like a living room. He kept glancing around like he was a tourist in a theme park, nearly running into the small woman where she had stopped. Percy cleared his throat nervously, stopping just a bit behind her, and settled his gaze ahead.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He quickly froze in place after that.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Now, Weasley, you should know the matter of inviting you was a bit divided, as you might be able to tell by the familiarity of some of the faces, but majority rules,” the woman’s voice echoed in his ears. “After Mary’s little anecdote, you sorta became a sure thing.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Percy <em>did</em> recognize faces. It was somewhat calming to know that this wasn’t some intricate Death Eater trap, thank Merlin and Morgana, but now a new sort of panic was setting in. He recognized Mary Cattermole, from her rather traumatizing visit to the Ministry—a visit <em>he</em> had handled, sending her and her husband well on their way. There were some other faces of muggleborns that had passed through his office, but there were also faces from <em>Hogwarts</em>. The Haywood sisters, Roger Davies…</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Kneazle got your tongue, mate?” a familiarly strong Scottish brogue spoke, drawing Percy’s attention to the one face he had been avoiding: his former dorm mate, Oliver Wood. Someone that had been his closest friend, against all odds, before they had graduated from Hogwarts.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I… um…” Percy started slowly, his voice tapering off, before he shook his head and muttered, “I think I need to sit down.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Aye,” the woman agreed, moving around Percy to pull a chair out and set it down behind him. He muttered a thanks as he sat down into it with a heavy sigh.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Auds, you wanna give him the rundown?” Oliver spoke once again.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Sure,” the woman replied, moving around the room to sit on the arm of a couch, facing Percy. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">A certain gravity filled the room, everyone else falling silent. Even the rest of the conversation around the house, the chatter of voices that Percy could hardly make out, seemed to dim. All of the attention—too much of it—was focused on him and the woman with the wild curls. The warmth was gone from her face now, replaced by a severity and seriousness that seemed to better match the times they lived in.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Here’s the sitch, Weasley. Some of us were left in difficult situations when shite hit the fan. Not all of us were or are… capable of fighting the old-fashioned way,” she started. “Most of us just need to survive. Mary’s husband works in the Ministry, Wood here had to help some muggleborn teammates when Bodmin Moor was ambushed, leaving him a fugitive. We all still need to <em>eat</em>. So, here, we do what we can with the positions we have.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“We’ve gotten a lot of muggleborns out of the country, relocated some to safehouses so muggle a purist prick would never <em>dare</em>… but you, Percy, would be a valuable addition,” the woman—Auds, Oliver had called her—continued. “Ya gotta face the music, mate. This isn’t a one-man job. You <em>will</em> get caught if you stick it alone. And… we could use someone like you in the Ministry.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The room filled with silence after that, many pairs of eyes fixed on Percy in anticipation. The words swam around in his head. In some ways, it was exactly what he had been expecting, and in others, he felt completely caught off-guard. It wasn’t the <em>safe</em> move by any means, but neither was the first time—and every time after that—he had committed fraud to help a muggleborn.</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“He won’t do it,” Davies piped up with a roll of his eyes. “Is Lucas around? We’ll need an Obliviator.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Percy sharply turned towards Davies, his eyes narrowed and a fire roaring inside him that he hadn’t felt in a long time. Fuelled by anger, and perhaps a bit of spite, he slowly turned to face the woman named Auds. The same scrutinizing gaze from earlier was back, focused solely on him with an intensity that made him feel somewhat self-conscious. Percy pushed that down, though, and slowly began to nod. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Count me in.”</span>
</p><p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Quicker than the eyes could see, that same smirk was back on the woman’s face. She stood up, rocking back and forth on her heels for a moment before stepping towards him and extending a hand. “In that case, pleasure to meet you, Percy. Name’s Audrey, but ya can call me Auds.”</span>
