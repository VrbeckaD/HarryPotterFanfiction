  <em>we’re not bruised, they’re just party tattoos and the colourful mess is just colourful regret. - Dodie</em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>The mornings were the hardest part. Returning to the world where Draco wasn’t allowed to acknowledge that he was hurting. The place beyond the deep grey of his bed-curtains was currently his least favourite of all the places he visited. Especially when the curtains were like this. </p><p>“Harry,” he whispered, poking the bare, sleeping shoulder where it was curled deeply under the heavy duvet; the rest of Harry’s body was curled around him too, but his shoulder was accessible without having to enter the fuzzy reality that was Outside the Blanket. “Harry,” he repeated more urgently. </p><p>“Wha—” </p><p>“It’s morning. You have to go.” </p><p>“Shh,” Harry mumbled, reaching further around Draco’s back and nuzzling his face into his chest. “Sleeping.”<br/> <br/> “Harry,” Draco insisted.<br/> <br/> “Could just pretend it’s fine,” Harry said, kissing Draco’s clavicle with an open mouth. </p><p>“We could also walk through fire while casting death curses at each other, but I don’t want to do <em>that </em>before 9 am either. Up.” </p><p>His brusque tone was feigned, and he knew Harry would pick up on that; he just also didn’t have the current headspace to resist Harry. If he didn’t get him out of his room before the elves appeared with breakfast, he knew he’d end up going along with Harry’s plan. Most notably, he’d wind up agreeing that staying in bed all day was an excellent plan, that he could definitely ignore his parents and their very ridiculous hold on him, and that he could survive going back to the club for the fourth night in a row. </p><p>He didn’t <em>want </em>to have to resist the urge to undo Harry as thoroughly as he had the night before, but the truth remained, he <em>did </em>have to resist. </p><p>“Fine,” Harry replied a moment later, frustration and exhaustion fighting for a place in his voice as he dragged himself out of the covers. </p><p>When he scrubbed his face and his feet hit the floor, Draco turned his face away before he saw the muscles in Harry’s back and arms hoist him out of the high bed and out of Draco’s day. He listened as Harry riffled around on the floor and found his clothes, closed his eyes tight against the hurt, and hauled the covers up around him to push out the chill of the suddenly too-big bed. </p><p>He sensed Harry but did not see him until he came around the other side of the bed and stuck his head through the curtains there. “I’m going to kiss you goodbye now,” he announced, leaning down on the bed. Apparently, he was on his knees on the other side. “And I am going to keep kissing you goodbye until you stop being ashamed of me. I meant what I said last night.”<br/> <br/> True to his word, Draco’s face and senses were enveloped by a kiss that was not the swift peck of a man headed off to work. The type of kiss that made his head go fuzzy and his heart go soft and his senses disappear in the wake of his affection. Harry began to retreat, and Draco found himself flinging a hand out to hold his forearm and stall him. </p><p>Head against Harry’s forehead, Draco whispered, “It’s not shame.”<br/> <br/> “It’s not your family either though, Draco,” Harry replied, pulling away again and kissing his forehead as he stood. “The sooner you admit that to yourself, the sooner we can get over this silly game you’re playing.” </p><p>He didn’t pull his arm away from Draco’s grasp but he reached out to take the curtain and Draco instinctively let go. </p><p>“You have a bruise on your neck,” Draco muttered, embarrassed. “Better heal it before you go.”<br/> <br/> Harry smiled, petted at the spot on his neck in a way that must have made it twinge with dull pain. “No,” he said a moment later, smirking. “No, don’t think I will.” </p><p>He pulled the curtain closed, enveloping Draco in darkness once more. </p>
