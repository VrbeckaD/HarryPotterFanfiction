    <p> </p>
<p>I stared, heart pounding and shivers running down his back, Lord Voldemort was as frightful as ever. His monstrous face twisted into an ugly sneer.</p>
<p>“You want me to spare the mudblood?” He spat as if he had tasted something vile.</p>
<p>“Y-yes, my lord.” I couldn’t keep the fear seeping into my voice. I had to try and save Lily, I couldn’t allow my mistakes to affect her even more.</p>
<p>A cruel smile spreed across the dark lords face and he slowly lifted his wand, pointing it straight at me. He started to utter the incantation for his favourite unforgivable and my breath got caught in my throat as I stared at it.</p>
<p>“Cru-” Suddenly he grasped his robe over his heart and panted. Eyes wide and shocked. What was happening to him? Was he having a heart attack? The dark lord fell to one knee as he fought to catch his breath. Head hung down, almost hyperventilating, his fists pressed into the floor to steady himself. But he soon lost the battle with whatever illness had taken him. His body slumped over and without a sound fell onto the ground.</p>
<p>“My lord!” I rushed forward and reached out with a shaking hand, frantically searching for a pulse. But found nothing. The dark lord was… dead? I sat there stunned and stared unseeing. Frowning I laid his corpse on the ground and slowly backed away. It couldn’t be. How could a… heart attack kill Voldemort? I continued staring. However before I could turn away and flee I noticed how lines of light began to spread out over his body, like glowing tattoos, forming runes, geometrical patterns and lines. If it had happened to anyone else it could have been beautiful but it was scaring the life out of me. Would I be punished for this? A loud crackling surrounded me and I could feel magic fell up around me, caressing me like a lover.</p>
<p>I stood there stunned, not comprehending what I was witnessing. What in Merlin’s name was going on? I don’t know how long I stood there and stared. When the dark lords body twitched I took a step back in fear and couldn’t stop the gasp that I let out. Slowly and unsteadily, like a newborn foal, the dark lord stood up again. His body swaying as he stood there gazing with vacant crimson eyes. I watched mesmerised as green started to bleed into his eyes replacing the crimson and then he blinked and turned his gaze on me. Calculating bright green eyes stared at me and a lazy smile spreed on his face.</p>
<p>“Severus.” He said calmly, the insanity no longer present in his voice or eyes. He waved me forward. I slowly and cautiously stepped forward until I was right in front of him. With a slow and steady hand he reached out and grasped my chin, tilting it upwards, he leaned forward until our lips barely touched and spoke , his voice barely a whisper. “Severus, my loyal servant. Please repeat your request for me.”</p>
<p>A shiver and a spike of arousal ran through me body, I gasped for air as I could do nothing but stare into his eyes.</p>
<p>“P-please spare Lily Potter.” I barely managed to get out as the dark lord touched me chest with his other hand slowly caressing me. But a moment later he stepped back but his gaze promised me so much more.</p>
<p>“Lily Potter?” He asks me and I nod unsure. “That prophecy… Severus, tell me honestly, do you believe I should pursue the Potters?”</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Severus freezes, surprise evident on his face, and stares dumbly at the dark lord. Not only surprised at the question but the fact that he was asked. But also scared. What should he say? Is it a test?</p>
<p>“I… I do not… I do not believe you should do so.” He murmurs unsure and scared. Severus can not stop the flinch when the dark lord starts to pace.</p>
<p>“I see.” Was Voldemorts only answer as he continues to pace back and forth. After a moment, which feels like an eternity for Severus, the dark lord stops and turns to Severus. “Very well I won’t.”</p>
<p>“You won’t?” Severus repeats in shock. Voldemort smiles and strides toward Severus who stands still terrified. The dark lord stops in front of him and once again grasps his chin.</p>
<p>“I will not. I can do this favour for you Severus, after all, you are my favourite servant.” The dark lord says with a possessive look in his now green eyes. Severus body tingles with pleasure when he says this and murmurs a thank you. The dark lord smiles at him and gives him a quick kiss before releasing his chin and instead grasps his marked arm. Voldemort draws his wand and lowers it to the mark, summoning his other servants. Then he releases Severus’ arm and returns to his throne but before he sits down he smirks and shots Severus a look full of promise which makes the younger man gulp at the arousal that goes through his body.</p>
<p>A moment later the doors to the room open and several figures walk in, dark robed and masked. For a moment they paused and stared at the changed dark lord but when they realised they were staring they rushed over to the dark lord and threw themselves onto the floor and knelt.</p>
<p>“My lord.” They greet him before the dark lord waves them off with a negligent gesture. They back away and gather in small groups around the walls and slowly converse with each other. It didn’t take long for the chamber to fill with death eaters and when the last death eater walked through the door the dark lord stood up and spread his arm wide with a gentle smile on his lips.</p>
<p>“Ah, my friends. Welcome back.” He started in a low voice. “I am sure you have noticed the change I have gone through.” At this he paused and made a sweeping gesture over his body. The death eaters nodded worried at what this change would mean but also fascinated by the strong magic in the room.</p>
<p>“I performed a ritual earlier today that gave me far more power and magic than ever before. Not even Dumbledore will be unable to stop me now.” At this a cheer went through the crowd of death eaters.<br/>
“Yes, yes… However!” Voldemort barked and glared the crowd into silence. “Our plans have changed. As you all know, my dears, recently our potion master Severus revealed a prophecy to us that claimed that a small child would defeat me. Me!” He huffed and sneered, the crowd stared raptured at the dark lords speech.<br/>
“But I say nay! I will not allow the prophecy to control me as it as done until now. Instead we will all focus our attentions on a far more noble cause.” He smiled gently, warmth reaching his eyes as he gazed at them. “No more will we allow ourselves to be terrorised by the ministry and their muggle-friendly politics. We will build a nation of magic. A nation where only magic matters, where magic will rule.”</p>
<p>“How? How will we do this, my lord?!” A death eater exclaimed and stepped forward. “There is no land in the British isles where we can-”</p>
<p>“No?” The dark lord said pensively and stared at the death eater who backed away frightened that he had spoken up. “That is true. There is no land where the ministry wouldn’t attack us. Which is why we will go underground.”</p>
<p>The dark lord chuckled and allowed his gaze to sweep over the crowd.</p>
<p>“The ministry can not pursue us underground, at least not easily, and underground we can build a society the muggles can not reach. We are magical, we do not need to live above ground to thrive. A little spell work and we could make our own sun and moon.” At this he raised his hand where two small globes appeared, one grey and one burning. “Underground we can grow our nation without fear of the non-magic discovering our people. We could freely use magic as was meant to be used.”</p>
<p>He stepped forward with a pensive look on his face.</p>
<p>“What say you?”</p>
<p>A murmur rose among the crowd as they started to discuss this. Severus himself was pulled into a conversation with Lucius Malfoy and Regulus Black.</p>
<p>“Underground? Sounds more like fantasy than anything else if you ask me.” Lucius said with a sneer. “How would we do that? Dig a hole?” Regulus snorted and shook his head.</p>
<p>“Are you questioning the dark lord?” He asked with a sneer of his own.</p>
<p>“Of course not! However we have to think of the logistics. We will need a large area, not to mention what will we do with the rest of the magical world? Leave them?” Lucius countered with a upturned nose. Severus followed their conversation for a while before he noticed the dark lord moving around the crowd listening in on the various conversations going on. He was so caught up with staring at Voldemort that he didn’t realise that the two others were questioning him until he got tapped hard on the head by Lucius cane.</p>
<p>“Lucius!” Severus growled turning to the man in question and glared at him with a dark look.</p>
<p>“While the dark lord is fascinating to look at now I would appreciate it if you listened to me while I speak.” Lucius said haughtily, making Severus glare harder. “As I was saying-”</p>
<p>“Severus.” The dark lord whispered in Severus ear, making the man in question jump a little as he hadn’t realised the dark lord at come up behind him.</p>
<p>“M-my lord.” He stammered out in response, Lucius and Regulus both had frozen and were staring at them. The dark lord chuckled and circled me until he stood at my side.</p>
<p>“Have you reached any conclusions, my friends?” The dark lord asked, as if nothing had passed between him and Severus. But the two other men stared at them in confusion before Lucius cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“My lord, while your idea has merits, I do believe it will be difficult to… complete. We need a location to start a digging operation if we want to get anywhere underground.” He said at first hesitantly but when the dark lord said nothing he continued on. “We can not start to dig in a muggle or ministry area, not to mention who would do the manual labour and who would finance these?”</p>
<p>“Of course, you have brought up several points worth discussing.” The dark lord nodded looking pensive.</p>
<p>The discussions lasted well into the night and a great deal of points for and against were brought up before a general outline had been made.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Silence greeted Severus when he stepped into his living room at Spinner’s end. No surprise there as he lived alone. However Severus himself was in a serious and pensive mood. After the meeting the dark lord had asked Severus to stay behind and had spoken with him.</p>
<p>
  <em>“I have something to ask of you, Severus.” Voldemort said with that same lazy smile and a relaxed look on his face which made Severus nervous. The dark lord was never relaxed.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“My lord?” Severus queried cautiously.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“I would like you to move here and work with me directly.” The dark lord said in a calm voice. Severus stared at him shocked. Was this a means to watch him more closely because of his plea to spare Lily, or a genuine offer? The dark lord had acted so unpredictable up to now that it was impossible to tell.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“I… I am aware that I have been… Quite insane for a long time now.” Voldemort said in a low whisper, as if he was ashamed to admit it. “But the ritual I performed to receive this new power as stabilised me and brought me new clarity.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Severus knew this, he had watched the dark lord closely during the meeting and it was as if the old dark lord had been completely replaced with a new one. Severus did not trust him.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“You need not answer now. Take some time to think about it.” The dark lord said with a dismissive wave before he left the room leaving Severus alone in it.</em>
</p>
<p>Join him? Move to his manor? How could he? The dark lord was insane. Lily… Even if the dark lord claimed he would no longer pursue the Potters he might very well change his mind tomorrow. No. He had to warn them. Somehow…</p>
<p>Dumbledore! He could go to Dumbledore and beg him for help to protect Lily. He shook his head, no, no he couldn’t. Dumbledore would never trust him. Besides what good would it do? Dumbledore knew the prophecy, he would protect Lily either way.</p>
<p>No, Severus would watch and wait. Either the dark lord truly had changed or this was just another phase of insanity.</p>
