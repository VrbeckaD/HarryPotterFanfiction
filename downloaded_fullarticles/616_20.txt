          <div class="userstuff"><p>Connor Angel, Blaise Zabini and Draco Malfoy stood looking up at the<br/>window currently concealing the objects of their separate desires and<br/>then looked with trepidation at the innocuous door that guarded the<br/>entrance to the house where their beloveds resided. Connor placed his<br/>hands on his hips and scowled in annoyance. "This is ridiculous. We<br/>should just go in there and make them talk to us."</p><p>Blaise slanted a look at his friend from the corner of his eye and<br/>quirked an amused eyebrow. "Would this be before or after the<br/>stupidly vicious vampire rips our throats out or that bloody twat<br/>with the scar hexes us all into next week?"</p><p>Draco snorted. "The day I bloody well turn tail and run because old<br/>scar face might pull his over inflated head out of his arse long<br/>enough to get it together for a proper curse is the day you'll see me<br/>hand over all my galleons to St Mungos and willingly wear hand-me-<br/>down robes from Weasel-boy." He tilted his head as he considered the<br/>house. "Mind you, I'm not *that* enthusiastic about meeting that<br/>loopy blonde bird again. What was her name; Busty? Bit too happy<br/>about cutting bits off people to my way of thinking."</p><p>Connor huffed out an impatient breath. "I can take her." He scowled<br/>as he looked up at the window again. "*She* probably won't be too<br/>happy if I beat up her sister though. And it's Buffy, not Busty."</p><p>"Agreed." Blaise folded his arms over his chest and rocked<br/>thoughtfully on his hells. "She's definitely a bit lacking in that<br/>region, and the arse is certainly nothing to write home about<br/>either." He leered and nudged Connor in the ribs. "You can certainly<br/>see who got smacked with the gorgeous stick in that family."</p><p>Connor kicked the ground with an annoyed boot and glared up at the<br/>window once more as he muttered darkly, "That's what I should have<br/>done, hit her with a freakin' big stick and just locked her up in our<br/>room till she came to her senses. It wasn't like this in Quor'toth,<br/>y'know. Women knew their places there, there was none of this�"</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes and thumped his friend on the shoulder. "Yes,<br/>and did you actually get *laid* at any point in this wonderland of<br/>abused females and testosterone leakage?"</p><p>Connor scowled harder. "No, but that isn't the point! I was still a<br/>kid when I left there and�"</p><p>Blaise took up Draco's point effortlessly. "And the *women* were<br/>actually *demons* and all scaly and quite possibly green. The totty<br/>in this dimension may lead us a merry chase when we piss `em off and<br/>make us suffer for our sins, but at least they all only have two eyes<br/>and take the old skin care seriously."</p><p>Connor huffed and switched his glare from the window to the<br/>ground. "S'not the point. She's my mate, she should damn well learn<br/>her place."</p><p>Draco and Blaise looked alarmed and sidled abruptly away from<br/>Connor. "Bloody hell, Angel, have a care and lower your voice, will<br/>you?" Blaise shot a distinctly hunted look up at the house and edged<br/>a little further away from Connor just to be on the safe side. "You<br/>might have taken leave of your senses when it comes to your own<br/>woman, but I'd quite like to be able to take mine back to our bed<br/>*sometime* before the next apocalypse."</p><p>Draco patted his friend on the shoulder bracingly. "S'okay, we've got<br/>plenty of time, it's not due till next Wednesday, that gives us<br/>nearly five days."</p><p>Connor huffed impatiently to himself. "Still think we should just go<br/>in there and drag them out by their hair." He wheeled suddenly on his<br/>heels and glared at the three vampires that were sneaking up behind<br/>them. "And what the fucking hell do you want?"</p><p>The vampire in the lead � a rather obviously overdeveloped young man<br/>that looked as though he had been turned at the height of his high<br/>school football glory days � looked startled and stopped dead in the<br/>middle of reaching out to grip Connor's neck. "What?" He reached up<br/>to make sure he hadn't come out without his game face, but on feeling<br/>the ridges above his eyes and his beloved fangs didn't look<br/>especially reassured to find out he was wearing his demon credentials<br/>for all to see. "Er�"</p><p>Draco raised a laconic eyebrow and tapped an impatient foot as he<br/>eyed the other two vampires � one looking suspiciously like she had<br/>risen only that night thanks to the clumps of dirt and grass sticking<br/>to her cheerleading uniform. "Well? Come on, we haven't got all day."<br/>He glanced up at the sky and amended grouchily, "Night. We haven't<br/>got all *night*."</p><p>The football player shifted nervously from foot to foot, uneasily<br/>aware that there were certain codes of conduct your prey were meant<br/>to follow when you snuck up on them in the dead of night in Sunnydale<br/>and having said prey glare and demand to know what the hell you<br/>thought you were playing at was most certainly *not* how this<br/>particular game was meant to be played. He looked worriedly at the<br/>house behind the three boys, sniffed the air and then stared in<br/>sudden dark suspicion at Connor. "You're not a vampire with a soul<br/>are you?"</p><p>Against all probability the dark scowl on Connor's face got even<br/>darker. "No I'm not!" He squinted his eyes menacingly at his soon-to-<br/>be-dead-demon. "Do I smell like a vampire to you?"</p><p>The vampire sniffed again and failed to look reassured. "Are you some<br/>kind of sorcerer then?"</p><p>Connor managed to look even more insulted. "No!"</p><p>The vampire squinted his own eyes thoughtfully and wracked his brains<br/>for any other possible otherworldly creature that wouldn't be<br/>impressed by a vampire showing up behind them with intention to bite<br/>through their jugular and suck out all their blood. "Um, werewolf?"</p><p>Blaise smirked at the very annoyed growl that erupted from Connor's<br/>chest and couldn't resist winking at the very pretty dead girl that<br/>would shortly be feeling the sharp end of his wand if he had anything<br/>to say about it. "Believe it or not, he's just human. Boringly so in<br/>fact."</p><p>Connor stopped looking annoyed and instead looked hurt. "I'm not! I'm<br/>very interesting, Dawn said so."</p><p>Draco snorted in disbelief. "Was this before or after she absconded<br/>from England in the middle of the night just to get away from your<br/>extremely riveting person?" He remained unmoved by another warning<br/>growl from Connor and continued mercilessly, "Or perhaps after she<br/>decided he-of-the-scar was more fascinating company and took him<br/>along to meet the family?"</p><p>Even Blaise looked shocked. "I say, Malfoy, there's no need for that<br/>kind of language, there *is* a lady present after all." He shook his<br/>head reprovingly at his friend. "I don't think we've *quite* reached<br/>the stage where we actually need to start pretending that Potter is a<br/>subject fit for discussion in mixed company."</p><p>Connor started snarling again and started to reconsider tearing off<br/>the three disconcerted vampires heads in favour of ripping off<br/>Draco's. "She said they were just friends."</p><p>Draco refused to look even slightly worried. "Yes, well she *also*<br/>said that she loved you and would stand by your side for the rest of<br/>her life, but as you can see�" He looked pointedly at either side of<br/>Connor and then � for good measure � turned in a fast circle to<br/>indicate the absence of any Angel mates in the near vicinity, "That<br/>plan doesn't seem to be working out as hoped."</p><p>Blaise tilted his head to one side and nodded in reluctant<br/>acknowledgment of this indisputable fact. "Okay. Good point." He<br/>heaved a sigh and cast another look back at the house which held his<br/>own particular love interest. "Bloody women."</p><p>Connor was now making a sound generally more associated with a<br/>particularly powerful engine. "That's it, I'm going in there and I'm<br/>going to drag her out and then I'm going to�I'm going to�"</p><p>Draco waggled his eyebrows helpfully. "Go down on your hopefully<br/>unshattered kneecaps and beg and grovel until she takes pity on the<br/>brittle shell of the man you used to be and re-opens her shapely,<br/>womanly arms to take you back to her surprisingly cushiony bosom?"</p><p>Connor glowered, hissed out a seriously irritated breath and then<br/>barked out a defeated laugh. "Yeah, that's the plan. There may be<br/>some wailing involved as well."</p><p>Draco and Blaise exchanged concerned looks. "There'd better bloody<br/>not be, that was *our* plan." Blaise switched his attention back to<br/>the three vampires who were now all sidling backwards as fast as<br/>their demonic feet could carry them. "Sorry, who said you could<br/>leave?"</p><p>The three demons froze and the football player licked his upper lip<br/>nervously and then yelped when he cut his tongue on his own<br/>fangs. "Ow!" He blinked away the tears of pain and continued with his<br/>slightly frantic retreat. "This really isn't the time for this and<br/>you're all obviously very busy, so we'll just come another night�"</p><p>Draco looked down his nose and raised an eyebrow. "I don't think you<br/>will. You still haven't explained why you're here *tonight*."</p><p>If possible the demons looked even more nervous.</p><p>Connor eyed them suspiciously. "You weren't just attacking at random,<br/>were you?" He shot the confused looking blonde cheerleader a<br/>withering look. "I mean, you were here for something else than just<br/>trying to bite us, weren't you?"</p><p>The third vampire � a youngish accountant looking type � adjusted his<br/>unnecessary spectacles and shuffled his skittish feet. "Well�"</p><p>Blaise rolled his eyes and crossed his arms over his chest before<br/>saying in his best Senior Prefect voice, "Come on, out with it, what<br/>were you up to?"</p><p>Accountant-boy looked at his companions, looked at the three human<br/>boys and then at the house over their shoulders. "The Slayer lives<br/>there."</p><p>Draco nodded gloomily in agreement. "Unfortunately."</p><p>Connor's hand twitched in anticipation of someone getting a good<br/>staking before the explanation was over. "What of it?"</p><p>Cheerleader spoke up. "We were meant to deliver a message to her."<br/>She flicked her blonde mane back over her shoulders and brushed a<br/>clump of mud from her skirt. "But then you guys got all weird and<br/>started being mean to each other and not scared of us like you're<br/>supposed too, `cos we're like *vampires* here and�urk!"</p><p>Connor � and his hand � felt a lot less twitchy when she exploded in<br/>a shower of ash, courtesy of the stake he had concealed up his<br/>sleeve. "Moron."</p><p>Football-guy yelped again, this time with shock. "Oh my God, you<br/>killed Symphony!"</p><p>Blaise rolled his eyes. "Good grief: Symphony? Only in America."</p><p>Connor divided his glare between his friend and the two remaining<br/>demons. "Yeah, because `Blaise' is *such* a dignified name. Your mom<br/>and dad might just as well have called you `Steele' or `Flame'." He<br/>tilted his head at his remaining friend as Draco began to snigger at<br/>Blaise's affronted look. "And I don't know what you're laughing at<br/>Dragon-boy."</p><p>Draco hurriedly sobered. "Oi! I'll have you know that Draco has been<br/>an honoured name in the Malfoy family for generations."</p><p>Connor looked unimpressed. "Yeah, *that's* something to be proud of.<br/>You come from a family of megalomaniac psychos that keep calling<br/>their kids after flying lizards." He turned his back on Draco's livid<br/>spluttering and re-focused on the unsettled vampires still staring<br/>down in disbelief at the sad little pile of ashes that had been the<br/>unfortunate Symphony. "Anyway, what's the message for the Slayer?<br/>There's some new big bad in town that's calling her out, right? Could<br/>be a real nasty player that could keep her and her pals out of the<br/>house for, oh, say the next couple of hours?"</p><p>Accountant-boy looked confused. "Uh, no?" He looked at Connor's<br/>impatient face warily and then said hesitantly, "Actually we were<br/>meant to tell her that we've got her sister and some of her friends<br/>and that if she didn't hand over the Jewel of Anakesh to us<br/>immediately then the girls would be drained and turned before dawn."<br/>He took a step back as Connor's mildly hopeful and curious expression<br/>melted into one of deep, murderous rage. "Um�"</p><p>Draco forgot all about the insult to his family and his name and he<br/>whipped out his wand. "One of these friends wouldn't happen to be a<br/>small, ginger English girl who swears like a sailor and has a kick<br/>like a donkey, would she?"</p><p>Football-guy eyed the slender wooden stick in the blond boy's hand<br/>with gloomy trepidation. "Maybe." He took another step back and<br/>wondered how far he'd get if he tried to make a run for it as he<br/>remembered the distressing ease with which Symphony had been staked<br/>by the moody definitely-human-boy. "Why?"</p><p>Blaise pulled out his own wand and idly tried to decide which demon<br/>to set on fire first. "There's a slender, blonde girl with ravishing<br/>blue eyes and a mouth the colour of fresh cherries as well, isn't<br/>there?"</p><p>Football-guy looked a bit confused and then said doubtfully, "Uh,<br/>well she's blonde and her eyes are a bit more goggly than ravishing,<br/>but she didn't stop asking us questions on how it felt to be a demon<br/>and what it was like to claw our way out of our graves so I can't<br/>really swear to what colour her lips are." He looked worriedly at<br/>Blaise's wooden face and swallowed heavily. "Is that right?"</p><p>Blaise looked gratified to find the setting-on-fire question had been<br/>settled so easily. "Her eyes are *not* goggly!" One sharp slash of<br/>his wand and a muttered curse later and Accountant-boy was horrified<br/>to find himself standing over another pile of ashes, although these<br/>ones were considerably warmer than the late unlamented Symphony's.<br/>Blaise pointed his wand at the petrified demon. "Do you have anything<br/>to add?"</p><p>"NO!" The poor vampire was visibly shaking in his shoes as he stared<br/>from one uncompromising face to the other. "I thought she was<br/>delightful! A truly unique beauty!" He darted a look back at the<br/>Slayer's house and � possibly for the first time in vampire history �<br/>started to pray for the sworn enemy of his kind to come save one of<br/>the demons she was meant to destroy. "Can I go tell the Slayer now?"</p><p>Connor � although naturally concerned to find out his errant love was<br/>in the hands of evil *again*-- gave a slow delighted smile. "I don't<br/>think so." He moved forward and slung an arm around the vampire's<br/>neck, charitably ignoring the panicked whimper from the<br/>creature. "Let's talk."</p><p>*~*~*</p><p>Connor, Draco and Blaise were slightly disconcerted to find that<br/>after they'd gone to all the trouble of racing across town after<br/>obtaining their missing lovers' locations from their gibbering<br/>captive, kicking in three extremely heavy doors *and* fighting hordes<br/>of screaming vampires, the first reaction they received to their<br/>dramatic entrance to the chamber where torture and death were shortly<br/>about to happen to their beloveds was to be shouted at and told most<br/>emphatically to�"BUGGER OFF!"</p><p>Draco brought himself up short and stared in hurt amazement at Ginny,<br/>hanging most fetchingly in some chains dangling from the ceiling and<br/>wearing not very much of what had previously been quite a sedate<br/>dress. "I beg your pardon?"</p><p>Ginny ignored the burning in her arms from hanging from the same<br/>position for too long and scowled at the man she had only two days<br/>previously been laughingly calling the light of her life. "I said,<br/>BUGGER OFF!"</p><p>Draco stopped looking hurt and started looking confused. "But I'm<br/>here to rescue you."</p><p>Dawn Summers butted in helpfully with a rather spiteful, "Yeah? Well<br/>Luke Skywalker, you ain't, pal. Get lost!"</p><p>Draco blinked at her and looked even more confused.</p><p>Ginny sneered and ignored the overwhelming evidence of her current<br/>situation to say most convincingly, "Do I *look* like I need your<br/>help? GIT!"</p><p>Dawn narrowed her eyes at Connor as he stepped towards her through<br/>the ashes of the last vampire still trying to fight the valiant<br/>rescuers off and spat warningly, "You lay one hand on me, Angel, and<br/>I swear the minute I get loose I'm cuttin' it off!"</p><p>Connor stopped and looked at least as perturbed as Draco. "What?" He<br/>looked around the dark, dank basement they were currently occupying<br/>and frowned in disapproval. "You don't want to stay here, do you?"</p><p>Dawn twisted in her chains as he reached out towards her and kicked<br/>out viciously. "If it means never laying eyes on your lying, ugly,<br/>soon-to-be-pox ridden face again then YES!"</p><p>Blaise smiled soothingly at his own recovered love and just stopped<br/>short of batting his eyelashes at her in a bid to escape the less<br/>than enthusiastic welcome that his friends had received. "Darling�"</p><p>Luna Lovegood sniffed and turned her back as best she could<br/>considering she was chained to a wall and slightly off-balance<br/>because she'd lost one of her heeled boots. "Go away, I don't want to<br/>see you."</p><p>Blaise chuckled and cupped her mutinous face with a gentle hand as he<br/>bent his head to taste her aforementioned cherry coloured<br/>mouth. "Beloved, you don't want to stay down in this nasty old�FUCK<br/>ME!" He reared back in astonishment as Luna demonstrated that behind<br/>the cherry coloured velvet lips lay a set of teeth any self-<br/>respecting piranha would be happy to posses. "You bit me, you little<br/>bitch!"</p><p>Luna glared defiantly up at her ex-lover. "And I'll do it again. You<br/>don't take from me what I'm not willing to give, Zabini, remember<br/>that."</p><p>Connor stared in sudden alarm at Dawn. "Hang on, what do you<br/>mean `soon-to-be-pox-ridden-face'?" His hands flew up to touch his �<br/>for the moment � unblemished skin. "What did you do?"</p><p>Dawn looked desperately pleased with herself and exchanged wicked<br/>looks with her co-damsels in distress. "I think boils on the penis<br/>are *so* last year, don't you? Jerk!"</p><p>Three pairs of male hands clamped protectively � and slightly<br/>manically � on three male groins. "WHAT?!"</p><p>Dawn chuckled meanly. "Don't worry, I *said* that the penis thing is<br/>so last year and I meant it." She waited to see the three men relax<br/>and then finished with great relish, "You just have to worry about<br/>the boils showing up everywhere *else*!"</p><p>Draco and Blaise immediately released their groins to clutch<br/>worriedly at their faces instead and Connor narrowed his eyes at Dawn<br/>furiously. "You did a spell!"</p><p>Dawn stuck out her chin and spat, "Darn right I did a spell, you<br/>scumbag. After what you did to us�"</p><p>Connor threw up his hands in exasperation. "I was trying to protect<br/>you, you stupid girl!" He included Ginny and Luna in his irate glare<br/>as he continued, "Although why we bothered when absolutely the first<br/>thing you do when we turn our backs for five minutes is run off to<br/>America with fucking Hero Potter and get your ass snatched by the<br/>forces of darkness *again*�"</p><p>Ginny gasped and took the time to bite Draco's hand that was trying<br/>to stroke her face before answering, "Don't you talk about Harry like<br/>that; he's sweet and kind and he helped us!"</p><p>Draco snatched his hand back and ground his teeth in<br/>frustration. "Yes, and don't think there won't be a reckoning for<br/>that, Gin. I thought something dreadful had happened to you when I<br/>came back to our room and found you were gone." He tried for a<br/>roguish grin and missed by a mile under Ginny's contemptuous look. "I<br/>frowned so hard I very nearly gave myself wrinkles."</p><p>Blaise didn't make the mistake of getting anywhere near Luna's mouth<br/>again, but he did shift around until he was bent awkwardly in front<br/>of her and peering up into her dismissive blue eyes. "Sweeting,<br/>please, we were only doing what we thought was best for all of you.<br/>You must know how we feel about you by now."</p><p>Luna sniffed and looked down into his imploring face with every ounce<br/>of feminine dignity at her disposal � the look was surprisingly<br/>effective considering all she was wearing was muggle jeans, a<br/>slightly bedraggled sweater and the sleeve of what looked like to be<br/>a fairly expensive leather jacket. "No, Zabini, amazingly we don't."<br/>She bit her lip and looked away from the look of stunned hurt on his<br/>face at not only her dismissal of his feelings, but also her<br/>continued use of his last name. "It must have something to do with<br/>the fact that you keep lying consistently about your so called<br/>feelings whenever you're questioned by your friends and the fact that<br/>you were photographed with other women in sordid little clubs not<br/>once but FIVE times in the last week alone!"</p><p>"Oh." Blaise straightened and -- possibly for the first time in his<br/>life -- flushed with shame. "That."</p><p>Ginny glowered at Draco as he looked away from her to the floor and<br/>said waspishly, "Yes, that. Or did you think that we would actually<br/>be *happy* that the men we've been involved with for the past *year*<br/>were quite happily running around town and shagging the life out of<br/>any witch that moved *and* making sure that the bloody wizarding<br/>press was there to record every single squalid detail?"</p><p>Draco coughed uncomfortably and shuffled his feet. "Well, no, not<br/>happy as such�"</p><p>Connor shook his head impatiently and reached for Dawn's chains to<br/>yank them out of the wall. "We are not talking about this now. We're<br/>getting you out of here and taking you back to England and then we're<br/>going to�OOF!"</p><p>Blaise and Draco winced as Connor folded inelegantly in half<br/>clutching his most private area and then toppled over to curl on the<br/>floor with a pained wheeze. Then they hurriedly stepped out of range<br/>of Ginny and Luna who were both looking between Dawn's still raised<br/>foot, Connor gasping on the floor and the unprotected groins of the<br/>Slytherins. Dawn waggled her foot threateningly at Blaise and Draco<br/>and said firmly, "The next two-timing slimeball to come near me gets<br/>this up their *ass*." She turned her head in dismissal away from the<br/>said two-timing slimeballs and stated calmly, "Now get lost and leave<br/>us alone. I'm sure Buffy and the others will be here soon and they<br/>can get the chains off."</p><p>Ginny bared her teeth at Draco. "Yeah, what she said."</p><p>Blaise and Draco eyed the three obviously insane women and then eyed<br/>each other. "So, just to get this straight," Blaise quelled the first<br/>pang of real annoyance at the somewhat inflexible attitudes the<br/>little bit�minxes�had displayed since being almost rescued. "You're<br/>so pissed off with us, so utterly incensed with our ungentlemanly<br/>behaviour, that you'd rather stay here in this dank little room and<br/>possibly get eaten by demons on the off chance that the Slayer will<br/>show up and rescue you, rather than come with us and get warm and<br/>have something nice to eat whilst we have a little chat and explain a<br/>few things?"</p><p>The three girls looked at each other and then Luna nodded firmly as<br/>she spoke for herself and her friends. "Yes, that sums up the<br/>situation quite nicely I would say." She looked pointedly at the<br/>ruined door hanging from its one surviving hinge after Connor's size<br/>eleven sneaker had kicked it down. "Try not to let the door ram sharp<br/>and incredibly painful splinters in your decidedly podgy bum on the<br/>way out."</p><p>Dawn rolled her eyes in exasperation and ignored Connor finally<br/>uncurling at her feet and tottering unsteadily upright. "How many<br/>more times, Luna? *Pithy*, the insults should always be *pithy*! That<br/>was far too complicated."</p><p>"Yeah. Like this." Ginny curled her lip disparagingly at Blaise and<br/>Draco and spat, "Fuck you *and* the broomstick you rode in on!"</p><p>Dawn nodded approvingly. "That's more like it."</p><p>Draco pulled himself up to his full height and glowered at the ginger<br/>witch that he was head over heels in love with � despite the rather<br/>condemning evidence that had appeared in the Daily Prophet to the<br/>contrary earlier that week. "Now see here, you filthy mouthed little<br/>tart, we came here to rescue you and that is *exactly* what we're<br/>going to do whether you want us to or not." He glared pointedly at<br/>Ginny. "Personally I have no problem adding a gag to the chains if it<br/>means getting you out of here any quicker."</p><p>Ginny gnashed her teeth at him. "Just try it and see what happens,<br/>you sod!"</p><p>"Right," With great dignity � and grimly holding onto his<br/>increasingly precarious grip on his temper � Draco turned to the now<br/>recovered Connor and said coldly, "You know that big stick you were<br/>talking about earlier?" Connor stopped scowling darkly at Dawn and<br/>perked up visibly as he nodded at his friend. Draco's mouth stretched<br/>in a terrible smile. "Go fetch it, I've had just about enough of this<br/>nonsense and one way or another they *are* coming with us and they're<br/>bloody well going to listen to what we have to say."</p><p>Ginny, Luna and Dawn all gasped in shocked outraged and stared wide<br/>eyed at their grim faced rescuers. Luna darted a glance up at Blaise<br/>and gulped as she realised that the tender, loving man she'd been<br/>quite happily shagging rotten for the last few months was now<br/>apparently quite happy to consider�"You wouldn't dare!"</p><p>Blaise squinted down his nose at her and quirked an eyebrow and said<br/>calmly, "Try me." He folded his arms over his chest and tilted his<br/>head enquiringly. "And while we're beating some manners into you I<br/>think it would also be an *excellent* opportunity to discuss you<br/>running off with Harry fucking Potter�who � I can't help but notice �<br/>is nowhere to be bloody seen whilst you and your fellow harridans are<br/>languishing in a fucking cellar waiting to be some scabby demon's<br/>supper!"</p><p>Connor looked around the room accusingly. "Yeah, where is the great<br/>Bore Wonder? Off brooding over his tragic and traumatic life again,<br/>is he?"</p><p>Three vicious pairs of female eyes focused on Connor and<br/>narrowed. "No he's not. *Harry* is out with a friend of mine tonight,<br/>*not* being a selfish, lying piece of demon crap�" Dawn sneered at<br/>Connor and tossed her head. "Unlike some bastards I could mention."</p><p>Blaise, Draco and Connor were momentarily derailed from their ire at<br/>the continued hostility in the room by the astonishing news that<br/>Harry Potter was actually out on a date. Blaise blinked. "Pardon?<br/>Potter's out with a *girl*?" He blinked again. "A real one?"</p><p>"Blimey." Draco looked desperately impressed. "Who knew he had it in<br/>him?"</p><p>Connor sniggered and nudged his two friends. "Wonder if she's gonna<br/>get it in *her*." He caught the outraged expressions on the girls'<br/>faces from the corner of his eye and held up his hands in<br/>apology. "Joking, just joking!"</p><p>Ginny stuck out her chin and shot a withering look at Draco as he<br/>tried to stop laughing. "Kit isn't that type of girl, and Harry most<br/>certainly wouldn't take advantage of someone like that. *He* happens<br/>to be kind and gentle and respectful of other people's feelings,<br/>unlike�"</p><p>Draco stopped laughing and rolled his eyes. "Yes, yes, we know.<br/>Unlike *us*." He shook his weary head. "Look, don't we at least get<br/>points for chasing you three halfway across the bloody world so we<br/>could try to explain things and work them out?"</p><p>"Unless your explanation includes hard evidence that three people<br/>have taken on your appearance thanks to a large ingestion of<br/>Polyjuice potion and have been running amok around London in a bid to<br/>discredit your names, then no." Luna's voice was cool and controlled<br/>but she couldn't quite suppress the look of hope in her eyes as she<br/>looked from one guilty face to the other. She shook her head when<br/>none of the men could meet her gaze and slumped in her chains. "Then<br/>no, no points for you. Just go away and leave us alone."</p><p>Blaise scrubbed hard hands through his hair, selflessly disregarding<br/>the fact that he was now slightly rumpled instead of his usual<br/>immaculate self. "For Merlin's sake, we were doing it for you! Do you<br/>think we liked tarting ourselves about like that?" He stabbed one<br/>annoyed finger in Ginny's direction when she opened her mouth to<br/>reply. "Before you say anything, Weasel, just you bear in mind that<br/>we didn't lay a single, solitary *finger* on any of those women aside<br/>from what was captured by that little creep Creevey." He looked back<br/>at Luna slightly desperately. "And *anything* that was captured and<br/>published in that bloody rag of a newspaper was carefully<br/>choreographed and set up by *us*. We knew exactly what we were bloody<br/>doing at all times!"</p><p>Dawn snorted. "Oh, well, that's okay then. Seeing my boyfriend with<br/>his tongue down the throat of a girl the size of a house with all the<br/>natural charm of Voldemort in his *decapitated* state just seems so<br/>much more bearable now."</p><p>Draco and Blaise shuddered in remembered horror. "Ugh, Bulstrode."</p><p>Connor looked like he was fighting the urge to be sick, but manfully<br/>got control of himself and shook it off. "Right, like I was enjoying<br/>myself, I had no choice!" He stared pleadingly at Dawn. "Honey,<br/>someone was on to us, they'd found out about you and me and they were<br/>gonna tell *everyone* they could. I *had* to do something to protect<br/>you!"</p><p>It appeared to the three desperate men that even the rats held their<br/>breath after that dramatic proclamation.</p><p>Dawn shook her head as though she was trying to clear water from her<br/>ears and said, "I'm sorry, what?"</p><p>Blaise looked beseechingly at each female face and lowered his voice<br/>to a sincere growl. "It's true. I was contacted by an old family<br/>friend last week saying that they had in their possession irrefutable<br/>evidence that I was in a relationship with Luna and that Draco and<br/>Connor were bound to Ginny and Dawn and that unless we agreed to<br/>their demands then the knowledge would be made public and we would be<br/>ruined." He stretched out one cool hand towards Luna and stroked her<br/>rigid cheek. "Darling, I don't care about me, but the thought of what<br/>you'd have to bear if your friends � Merlin, your *father* -- found<br/>out about us." He shook his head wryly and smiled. "I couldn't do<br/>that do you. Obviously we went after the person responsible and got<br/>their evidence and destroyed any hope of you being used against us<br/>like that in the future, but there was a risk that the person<br/>blackmailing us might have talked and we needed to divert attention<br/>away from you and solely onto ourselves. Hence the rather degrading<br/>charade of the last few days and our withdrawal from you." He stepped<br/>closer when Luna remained frozen in place, staring at him with wide<br/>eyes. "I'm sorry, I knew you wouldn't let us go ahead with the plan<br/>if you knew, I swear I never meant to hurt you."</p><p>Draco jumped in when he realised that Ginny was also temporarily lost<br/>for words. "Ginny, please, it's all true. I couldn't take the chance<br/>of your family finding out about us, not now. We were just starting<br/>to find our balance and if the news of our relationship had come out<br/>now�" He swallowed heavily. "I just *couldn't* let you go yet, I'm<br/>not ready."</p><p>Ginny stared speechlessly at his stricken face and then darted a look<br/>at Dawn and Luna, both looking like they'd been unexpectedly slapped<br/>with a wet fish. She licked her lips and looked back up into Draco's<br/>earnest face. "Wait a minute, do you mean you're planning on letting<br/>me go at some point, then?"</p><p>"God, no!" Sensing an opening, Draco darted forwards and cupped her<br/>face in his hands as he stared down at her stunned face. "Gin,<br/>everything was just starting to fall into place and given more time<br/>then I could have changed how people saw me, maybe left some of the<br/>taint of my family name behind and perhaps people would have<br/>forgotten what my father did and what I used to be and then we could<br/>have�" He shook his head as words failed him and leaned forward to<br/>press his forehead against hers in supplication. "Ginny, I just need<br/>more time."</p><p>Dawn eyed Connor with a little less softening around the eyes than<br/>her fellow captives and with considerably more unspoken promise of a<br/>major hurt fest heading his way. "That your excuse too?"</p><p>Connor, never that comfortable with his feelings anyway, refused to<br/>spill sweet nothings in front of an audience even if it did help his<br/>cause and glared back at her. "It's not a freakin' excuse, okay? I<br/>know exactly what you'd have done and I'm not going to be the cause<br/>of you turning your back on your family just because they don't like<br/>you hooking up with a demon's spawn for your mate. You know how<br/>things are between your sister and my dad � that's not even counting<br/>fucking Spike ripping my head off for touching his little Nibblet �<br/>and I don't even want to *think* about what the goddamned wizards<br/>would be saying about the great and pure Key getting screwed through<br/>the bed by the nasty, mean Destroyer every night." He flung up his<br/>hands in exasperation as Dawn snorted in disbelief. "You'd turn your<br/>back on your family because they'd disapprove and then all the<br/>wizards would turn against you and then you'd blame me and we'd hate<br/>each other and then you'd leave and�"</p><p>Dawn cocked an impressed eyebrow. "Wow, got it all worked out there,<br/>dontcha?" She peered with interest at the pockets of his jeans. "Ya<br/>got some kind of hinky prophecy tucked in those pants, mister?<br/>Something like that just *has* to be written in stone somewhere."</p><p>Connor, beyond furious, punched the wall beside her head. "Tell me<br/>you wouldn't do that! Go on, deny it! Say you wouldn't choose me over<br/>them!"</p><p>"OF COURSE I'D CHOOSE YOU, YOU MORON!" The bellow from Dawn's throat<br/>had Connor rearing back in surprise and Draco and Blaise jumping with<br/>a couple of very unmanly yelps. "It's ALWAYS going to be you, there's<br/>not even a choice to make!"</p><p>Connor blinked and muttered rather lamely, "See? I told you."</p><p>Dawn hissed at him and strained at her restraints. "You just wait<br/>until I get free, buddy, I am *so* going to kick your ass!" She<br/>writhed against the chains and tried to kick out at him. "I can't<br/>believe you did that to me! YOU IDIOT!"</p><p>Draco yelped again when Ginny's foot connected with his ankle. "Ow!<br/>What was that for?"</p><p>"You stupid, idiotic�" Words failed her and she tried to kick him<br/>again, snarling when he dodged smartly out of reach. "You actually<br/>thought that I'd worry about losing my family more than losing you?"<br/>Ginny tried to kick him again. "I'm going to KILL you."</p><p>Blaise � always quick on the uptake � was already moving and thus<br/>managed to avoid his own bruising kick from Luna. "Now, Sweeting�"</p><p>"You lied to me." Luna blinked huge wounded eyes at Blaise and shook<br/>her head in disbelief. "You actually lied to me."</p><p>Blaise patted the air. "Luna, I know, but we did it with the very<br/>best of intentions and I was just trying to protect you, my love.<br/>You, Ginny and Dawn are some of the war's most well-known heroes;<br/>just imagine how it would look if it were found out that you were<br/>involved with three turncoats that most people believe only fought<br/>Voldemort at the end to save their own skins."</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes at his friend's apparent *extremely* selective<br/>memory. "We *did* do that."</p><p>Luna ignored the rest of the room and focused once more on Blaise. "I<br/>don't mean about that, I mean about reading `The Quibbler'. You lied<br/>about *that*."</p><p>Blaise flinched guiltily. "What? Nonsense, I haven't missed a day of<br/>your dear old father's publication since we first kissed, darling."</p><p>Luna stared at him coolly. "Really? Then perhaps you'd like to<br/>explain how you missed the centre page spread that daddy ran three<br/>*months* ago telling all our readers how happy we were and how much<br/>in love Ginny and Dawn were with their chosen partners?"</p><p>The silence was deafening.</p><p>Eventually Connor cleared his throat. "Sorry, could you repeat that?"</p><p>Luna turned a withering look on him. "I *said* that daddy already ran<br/>the story about all of us *months* ago and the sky has yet to fall<br/>in." She stared back at Blaise with her huge reproachful eyes. "In<br/>fact, I'd go as far as to say that, aside from a very small<br/>readership, no one even believes it."</p><p>Connor coughed. "Right. That's what I thought you said."</p><p>Blaise was desperately trying to catch up. "What? You told your<br/>*father* about us?"</p><p>Luna sniffed and said practically, "Well of course I did. I wasn't<br/>going to lie to him about something like that and, besides, I thought<br/>it might be quite nice to let him at least know the name of the man I<br/>plan to marry rather than just keep it as a surprise for our wedding<br/>day."</p><p>Blaise rocked back on his heels and repeated faintly, "Wedding day?"</p><p>This earned him a stern glare from his self-declared wife-to-be. "Of<br/>*course* wedding day. You don't honestly think I'd let any man do<br/>that thing to me that you do with your tongue and the ice cube and<br/>then *not* marry them, do you? What kind of a girl do you think I am?"</p><p>Ginny snorted. "Remember who he *has* been hanging out with lately,<br/>Luna, he's probably got you lumped in with the likes of Pansy and<br/>that trollop Lavender."</p><p>Luna's eyes widened even further and she pouted prettily. "Blaise,<br/>how *could* you?"</p><p>Connor stepped in to rescue Blaise who looked in imminent danger of<br/>collapsing of a heart attack at any minute. "Wait, wait; so<br/>*everyone* knows about us?" His expression darkened considerably. "Do<br/>you mean I kissed that heifer for nothing?"</p><p>Dawn sniggered at the look of total disgust on his face. "Yep." She<br/>shook her head in irritation at the thought of all the unnecessary<br/>heartache they had all been put through. "Which could have been<br/>avoided if you guys had just *talked* to us. We figured that someone<br/>was bound to notice sooner or later that we kept being seen in the<br/>vicinity of Draco's townhouse and put two and two together, so Ginny<br/>figured the best way to head trouble off at the pass was to make an<br/>announcement in The Quibbler, which no one ever takes seriously<br/>anyway," She paused and shrugged apologetically at Luna who was<br/>watching in fascination as Blaise's face went from white, to red, to<br/>purple and then back to white again and wasn't paying attention<br/>anyway. "And you guys were so *manic* about us keeping the whole<br/>sleeping together thing a big secret that we thought we just make it<br/>seem like a ridiculous rumour and then if anyone ever *did* put two<br/>and two together we'd just point them in the direction of The<br/>Quibbler and �voila!"</p><p>Draco rubbed a shaking hand over his pounding heart. "Hide in plain<br/>sight. Good grief, that's brilliant!"</p><p>Ginny looked suitably smug. "Yes, I know." She fixed him with a<br/>gimlet eye. "Of course if you'd have just *said* that the reason you<br/>were making us keep quiet about our relationships was because you<br/>were trying to protect our maidenly honour and not that you were<br/>ashamed of us or something then we'd have hit you with a really *big*<br/>curse and then a fairly large stick." Her face softened as she looked<br/>at Draco's stunned one and she continued in a low, intimate<br/>voice, "Then I would have shouted it from the rooftops that I'm in<br/>love with Draco Malfoy and I don't care what anyone thinks about it<br/>because, despite him being a big arse, he's makes me the happiest<br/>that anyone ever has and I want to stay with him for the rest of my<br/>life." She smiled fondly at her speechless boyfriend. "And if you<br/>ever pull another stunt like this, then I'll shrink your willy up so<br/>small it'll look like a third ball and take pictures to put in the<br/>Prophet. You twat."</p><p>Blaise wobbled and sat down heavily on the floor. "I'm getting<br/>married!" He swallowed and stared up at Luna's amused face. "To you!"</p><p>"Well, not right at this minute, but someday, yes." Luna beamed down<br/>at her newly restored boyfriend. "You fool."</p><p>Connor and Dawn stared at each other silently for a long moment and<br/>then Connor � with considerable caution � moved forwards and lightly<br/>touched her face. "There's no choice for me either, I just didn't<br/>want you to lose everyone you love."</p><p>Dawn stared, sighed and then tilted her cheek to press against his<br/>palm. "Connor, they'll get over it. They love me, who I'm boinking<br/>won't even be a consideration after a few apocalypses. When I<br/>promised you forever, I meant it, okay?"</p><p>A shuddering breath forced it's way out from between Connor's lips as<br/>he whispered, "You left me."</p><p>Dawn smiled tremulously at the look of vulnerability in his eyes and<br/>pressed harder against his hand. "Not forever. We just needed a<br/>couple of days to find some really *nasty* vengeance spells and then<br/>we would have come back. "I'll *always* come back."</p><p>Connor closed his eyes for a moment and then opened them to grin at<br/>his love. "I'm an idiot."</p><p>Dawn snorted most unromantically. "Yeah, this is news." She returned<br/>his grin and then turned her head quickly to sink her teeth into his<br/>hand. "Now, about the big stick you guys were threatening *us* with�"</p><p>Connor yanked his hand back with a shout of pain and stumbled back<br/>once more. "Honey, come on."</p><p>Dawn glowered and spat, "Don't you `honey' me, Connor Angel, you let<br/>me out of these chains right *now*, I'm gonna kick your ass all the<br/>way back across the OCEAN when I get my hands on you�"</p></div>
