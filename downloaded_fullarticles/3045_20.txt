    <p>The sun was beating down on the brown rocks of the canyon. Young goblins ran in fear as a man with exploding hands chased after them. "Little shits," He yelled as his cowering enemies ran into a cave on the cliff face, "I can't believe I got assigned to kill something as weak as these." As the few he couldn't destroy ran into a cave on the cliff side Bakugou raised his right arm as he let a humongous explosion rip from his hand. As soon as the dust settled and he saw the rocks covering up the entrance to their nest he began to turn to leave when he bumped into a man donned in a full suit of armor.</p>
<p>"You didn't kill them all," The Goblin Slayer calmly said to the young hero.</p>
<p>"Excuse me? ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY I DON'T KNO-"</p>
<p>"They have plenty of back escape routes. A young adventurer shouldn't be going after a nest anyway," He said walking past Bakugou.</p>
<p>"YOU BASTARD! SAYING I CAN'T DESTROY A FUCKING GOBLIN NEST! I'LL KILL YOU!," He screamed at the stoic adventurer. </p>
<p>"If we must fight I'll let you know," Goblin Slayer states while pulling out a scroll, "Just know you won't survive."</p>
<p>As Goblin Slayer lets out those words Bakugou leaps towards his enemy, propelling himself forward with explosions. However before he could reach Goblin Slayer he landed on a piece of seemingly solid air. As he looked down he saw the scroll burn up in the knights hand. "Protection spells are always handy," The Goblin Slayer remarked as he began to pull out his bow and arrow. However before he could take an arrow out his quiver Bakugou began to beat on the wall cracking it more and more before eventually breaking through and slamming his foe into the ground with an explosion. Bakugou then hit the side of his foe's head sending him careening into the side of the cliff face leaving a small crater.</p>
<p>"I HOPE YOU'RE READY TO DIE BAST-" Bakugou was trying to threaten his foe when he was cut-off by a sword being thrown into his knee. The blade slashed through flesh and muscle tearing a piece of flesh out of his leg. As Bakugou fell to the ground screaming he was suddenly hit in the shoulder by a small dagger. His vision was going in and out when he saw The Goblin Slayer walk up to him completely silent as he his bow up to the young hero's head. "Any last words?" The Goblin Slayer asked as calm as he had begun the fight.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Bakugou mustered out in between aching breathes, "Fuck you." As he said that his hands began to crackle and he pulled a pin out of his gauntlet. As soon as Goblin Slayer realized what had happened a massive explosion was let out of Katsuki's open palm and when the dust settled all that remained of the adventurer was a few pieces of armor. Bakugou began to stand back up and took the chance to spit on the scraps of what was The Goblin Slayer as he began his hard walk back to UA.</p>
