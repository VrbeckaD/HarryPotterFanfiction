    <p>A mop of messy black hair topped a youthful angular face that was a bit too thin with brilliant emerald eyes. Eyes that sparked with tired defiance with a backing of burning life. The bruises under his eyes explained the tiredness hiding in his gaze even as the fire of life refuses to dim within his crystal green orbs. His name? Harry Potter.</p><p>Raised as a modern slave in all but name by his hateful relatives his life changed the day he turned eleven. The day he discovered he was a <i>wizard</i>.</p><p>It was the very same day that all of the extra punishments were explained, all of the amazing and occasionally terrifying thing that happened in his life. Harry hoped for a normal life in this new world were he could be himself. It was not to be as Fate had long since marked him for things extraordinary. It was something that Harry often resisted, fading into the background whenever possible.</p><p>This day so soon after his 16th birthday his relatives had abandoned him to wait in an area of London near the Central Criminal Court building with a jibe about him belonging in chains. They left him on the side of the road without even a half-penny and a warning that they didn't want to see him again until next summer before heading out for a fancy dinner. One of the parting shots was that he could find his own way to school, knowing he was being left miles from Kings Cross train station and Diagon Alley - the wizarding shopping district.</p><p>Harry was unsurprised when Lady Luck immediately started a down pour to soak him through to the bone twenty minutes after he started walking, looking for somewhere to think. He knew he wasn't that far from St. Paul's cathedral but he never thought he would be called on once again to enter a new world of magic. The meeting that Lady Luck and Lady Fate had conspired with Lady Magic to arrange for him would change his life once more along with the face of the building magical civil war.</p><p>It all started with a girl that had been touched by a different kind of magic named Sarah Williams.</p><p>The rain had stopped before Harry had passed twenty minutes trying to find acceptable shelter <i>away</i> from the Criminal Court building. It only took his sodden form ten minutes to crash into a fleeing young woman who was being chased by a man. The two went down in a tangle of limbs and a small cry leaving the brunet's lips with Harry giving off a soft but pained grunt as the woman slammed into his bruised ribs courtesy of his Uncle.</p><p>"Sorry sorry sorry! Have to get away from that <i>thug</i>. Oh! Did I hurt you? Sorry! Why won't the idiot leave me alone?!" the slender yet beautiful woman babbled, swapping between her concern for the flattened Harry and her concern for the man who was quickly approaching the downed duo.</p><p>The man who had been chasing her looked to be in his mid-twenties dressed in blue Jeans and a dark no sleeved shirt. Harry automatically noted the cruel look deep in his eye even as the man's charisma put nearly everyone else at ease with his apparent goodness. The woman laying sprawled atop him wasn't buying it either.</p><p>"Up," Harry ordered sharply, the man was getting too close. Startled, the woman quickly obeyed allowing Harry to rise. She was shocked when the sodden teen grabbed her wrist and bolted in the direction of the cathedral and its grounds, swearing under his breath as he fought to breathe at a run.</p><p>The man simply followed them at more of a jog, too confident for Harry's comfort. They passed through the crowds and Harry dragged her towards where he had figured out was the closest tube station, <i>praying</i> that they could use the underground trains to get <i>far</i> away.</p><p>"Where?" the woman asked breathlessly as they ran.</p><p>"Tube station!" Harry called back, faltering briefly due to using more air than his lungs had.</p><p>They practically dove down the stairs barely noticing that the man now had a scowl on his face and had picked up speed. The woman's lack of tube pass or money held no problem as Harry <i>willed</i> the gate to let them through using his wandless accidental magic deliberately for once. The two darted through the crowd in the station as though made of quicksilver and as they passed near a man in a dark suit Harry's eyes met the gaze of a man he recognized. The look of curiosity quickly turned to shock and then anger.</p><p>"Potter!" Snape bellowed in clear outrage.</p><p>Harry promptly diverted their course calling out in relief, "Professor!"</p><p>"You aren't getting away Sarah!" the chasing man called angrily.</p><p>"Buzz off! No means <i>no</i>! You belong in the bog of eternal stench!" Sarah shot back, more confident now that she believed she had more help than a single skinny teen.</p><p>Reassessing the situation rapidly Snape gestured to the now loading train and commanded "<i>In</i>!" just as he did at the start of every class. Harry automatically obeyed, dragging Sarah with him and tossing evil glares at their pursuer with Snape close on their heels. A discrete tripping hex from the darkly clad Potions Professor had the man tumbling straight into a trash bin just as the doors of the train closed, whisking them safely away down the line.</p><p>"What on earth are you <i>thinking</i>? Running about London away from your relatives? <i>Without</i> back up no less? Not even your friends? And for what? A date with a pretty girl?" Severus scolded as the two tried to catch their breath. There were to many muggles around to dry the sodden Lion so Harry remained wet even as the man plotted to feed him a pepper up potion and make him scrub cauldrons.</p><p>"Actually, I slammed into him less than five minutes ago trying to get away from that idiotic pile of dragon dung. He figured out what was happening while I was apologizing and dragged me here while we tried to loose the idiot," Sarah explained, finally catching her breath.</p><p>"He shouldn't even <i>be</i> in London. No offense miss," Snape responded angrily.</p><p>"My relatives dumped me in front of the building with the statue of a gold lady with a sword and scales on the roof and said not to come back until next summer! They burned my trunk and I barely managed to send Hedwig off to the Burrow before they tried to kill her! My cousin is the only reason they didn't try to contact one of the other side and sell me as a slave. I overheard them talking about it," Harry explained quickly. He was too on edge to even try lying to the man and still trying to catch his breath even though Sarah had hers.</p><p>"A likely story," Snape snarked, crossing his arms and giving his student his best glower.</p><p>"That's interesting," Sarah said looking at them keenly before suddenly noticing Harry was favoring his left side a bit. "Oh, you're hurt! Did I do that? I am so sorry!"</p><p>"Its nothing," Harry denied quickly.</p><p>"Not from the way you're moving its not," Sarah said firmly, her eyes narrowing in determination that Snape recognized Harry using on occasion.</p><p>"What have you gotten into <i>this</i> time?" Severus demanded, grabbing Harry's arm and inadvertently dragging a hiss of pain from his student. The dour man dropped his hold as if burned, even taking a step back to give Harry space.</p><p>Harry gave them both a rueful smile before slumping down in his seat in exhaustion, fighting to stay awake. He hadn't been allowed to sleep the night before between the demands of his relatives and the nightmares that haunted him.</p><p>"I can't take you home with me as a certain <i>rat</i> is in residence to watch me. Contacting the others to come get you is out of the question for other reasons and the Headmaster obviously has no idea where you are or I would have been called to help look for you. You also got yourself hurt to boot. Did I miss anything? Do you even have what you bought from Ollivander with you?" Severus summarized the situation with a glower.</p><p>"They snapped it then burned it. I need a new one," Harry said sadly, briefly rubbing at the center of his chest as a phantom pain from the destruction of his wand reminded him of the broken focus. "Dudley got Hedwig out for me after arguing not to contact <i>him</i> since someone already tried talking to Uncle Vernon at work about it."</p><p>"Do I even want to know what the two of you are discussing," Sarah asked suspiciously.</p><p>"No/Not particularly," the two men told her simultaneously.</p><p>"I'm going to have to use up one of my special favors to sort this out without... unpleasant repercussions. We will drop your new friend off and head for Diagon. If we are <i>incredibly</i> lucky my Uncle Jareth will see us and have a solution that <i>doesn't</i> have me running his pet maze," Severus muttered angrily.</p><p>"Wait, what?! You know the Goblin King?" Sarah demanded in shock.</p><p>"Keep your voice down!" Harry snapped before mentally pausing and rewinding to review what had been said and asking, "Wait, the Goblins have a King named Jareth? He's your uncle?!"</p><p>"Yes, they have a king and how, young lady, do you know about my Uncle?" Severus asked her sharply, instantly on edge.</p><p>"I'm a former runner," Sarah said simply as if that answered everything. From Snape's expression Harry figured it somehow did.</p><p>"You must have learned something important to keep even a few memories of my Uncle's blasted maze when you failed to solve it," Severus said, nodding in understanding.</p><p>"I didn't loose. I beat it and him," Sarah explained with a blink of surprise.</p>
