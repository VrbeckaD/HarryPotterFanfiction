    <p>Draco's first awareness of the bond when he was very young, so young that the memory was hazy now. He had been talking with his mother, and suddenly there was a searing pain across his cheek that made him drop to the ground. He started sobbing, it had hurt so much, and he was so confused. He begged for his mother to tell him what was happening, but all she could do was stare at him with a pitying look in her eye. The look haunted him. There was a hand mark bruised on his face for the next couple of days.</p><p>These incidents continued throughout his adolescence, bruises like hands wrapped around his wrists and burns on his arms and more slaps than he could count. His mother was a genius with glamor charms by the time he was seven. It stopped shocking him around the same time.</p><p>He learned why this was happening when he was nine, and his friend (or, aquiantance was a better word for the time) Daphne had rambled on about this kind boy she had met who drew things on himself that appeared on her skin. Draco, the naturally curious boy he was, searched for anything he could find about the subject in the Malfoy library. Some of the words were hard for him to understand, but he knew enough to realize what was going on. Soulmates. You were bound to someone for life. Every mark on them was put on your skin. You felt the pain they felt. Draco was confused. Why was his soulmate feeling so much pain? Did he play outside too much? Maybe his friends accidentally hit him?</p><p>When he was ten, Draco learned why his soulmate was left with so many bruises. He watched as Blaise was slapped by his new father, as he screamed in his face, and suddenly it made too much sense to Draco and he felt beyond nauseous, and so very sad for his soulmate. He vowed, that day, to save his soulmate from the bar people around him. That task, of course, turned out to be far harder than he had anticipated.</p><p>Draco started Hogwarts with a mask of confidence he was sure no one would break. He would make his father proud, and find his soulmate. It could be done. At least, until that infuriating Harry Potter stepped into the scene. He turned down his hand in friendship, and embarrassed him to no end! Yet, he could feel himself drawn to the other boy. He had no valid reason to be, but Potter was so maddening he wanted nothing more than to be the one who wiped that smirk off his face.</p><p>He didn't forget the fact that he didn't feel anything from his soulmate that entire school year.</p><p>Draco realized who his soulmate was in fourth year. He had been slightly suspicious of it before, but he had thrown the thought away at the absurdity of it. But when Potter went up against that dragon, Draco could feel the graze of fire against his leg, he could feel the scrape of the claws against his arm, and it was all he could do not to scream out in pain. He walked out of the stadium halfway through the task, unable to watch it anymore, and spent the next thirty minutes screaming curses at the world in the empty common room, with silencing charms up just in case. He screamed for his horrible luck, for his lost years, for the overwhelming sympathy he had towards Harry. This wasn't how it was supposed to work out. He was soulmates with the boy who lived and he hated the fact with every fiber of his being.</p><p>Even so, it was Harry now. Not Potter.</p><p>Draco couldn't breathe during the final task. He knew he would feel a bit of pain while it went on, but not this much. He was beyond thankful he had opted to stay in his room for the task. He didn't know how anyone would react to his agonizing screams. What the hell was Harry going through in that fucking maze?</p><p>His mental complaints ceased as soon as he heard of Voldemort's return, of the rumors that Harry had fought against him inside that maze. His confusion of what had felt stopped after he watched the cruciatus curse used on one of Voldemort's followers. The sickening feeling in his stomach never seemed to go away these days.</p><p>Draco was shocked when the next year there was a stinging pain on his hand that awoke him from his sleep. He glanced down at it and stared as the words "I must not tell lies" were slowly etched into his hands, a bright red that hurt his eyes, but hurt his heart more. Blood quills were illegal! Who was doing this to Harry? When the constant scratching stopped, Draco made a decision to write a small note on his skin, the first he had ever done. He knew this was a bad idea. He didn't even know if Harry would see it. Or respond to it.</p><p><em>Are you okay?</em><br/>
<br/>
The ink laid on his arm and it took all of Draco's strength to not wipe it away immediately and curse himself for the idea. He was trying to talk to his enemy! This was probably the stupidest idea he had ever had-</p><p>
  <em>im fine. who are you?</em>
</p><p>Correction: This was definitely the stupidest idea he had ever had.</p><p>
  <em>No one... I'm no one. </em><br/>
<em>Who did that to you?</em><br/>
<em>Blood quills are illegal.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>it doesn't matter</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It does to me</em>
</p><p>
  <em>its fine</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You need to tell someone about that</em>
</p><p>
  <em>fuck off</em>
</p><p>Well, that was the most civil conversation Draco had ever had with Harry.</p><p>He let it go, and continued on with life. His eyes still lingered on Harry when he passed through the halls and Draco hated himself for every second. Harry was his enemy, he had to remember that. Yet, he couldn't help but stare off into space somedays, stroking his arm and wishing for conversations that could never exist.</p><p>The battle at the end of the year was torture for Draco. He could feel the pain Harry was in, had to muffle his sobs and shakily cast a silencing charms around him. Each second ticked down as Draco pretended in his mind that everything was okay, that his entire body wasn't on fire because Harry was out there risking his life again. His high pain tolerance from years of handling Harry's abusive household did nothing facing against this onslaught of agony.</p><p>He was helpless to it's clutches.</p><p>The one thing Draco didn't expect was that he'd be the one to cause Harry any physical pain. Sure, he knew his insults probably stung him a bit, but they had no true malicious intent. Draco didn't expect, when his family fell from Voldemort's favor, that he'd be hit by the cruciatus curse more times than he'd wish to remember. Voldemort knew this was the way to destroy his parents. Draco's voice was too hoarse to speak but his mind was occupied on Harry alone. He always felt the stinging slaps against his face and the bruises that formed after his sessions with Voldemort, but they weren't from the man himself. He knew Harry was getting punished for the pain Draco was going through, and Draco was sure that was a worse feeling than anything Voldemort could come up with.</p><p>His sixth year was meant to be redemption. He was going to fix that cabinet, he was going to kill Dumbledore, and he was going to get his family into Voldemort's good graces again. So why were his hands shaking so much? Why did, when he punched the bathroom mirror without much thought, the pain of the broken glass cutting into his skin feel like relief? He had felt so much pain in his life, why was it becoming a relief?</p><p>He stopped in the face of causing his soulmate pain. Harry didn't deserve that, even if Draco did. So Draco kept with his task and tried not to scream every time he messed up the cabinet, every time he looked at Dumbledore, every time he saw the Weasley girl and Harry flirting with eachother. His focus needed to be on his family first, and anything else second. Harry could take care of himself. That didn't prevent him from sneaking glances at him during class or following him occasionally in the halls. He wasn't doing it intentionally, he swore to himself, even though he knew it was a lie.</p><p>Draco's undoing was that day in Myrtle's bathroom, Harry had burst in and Draco could see the anger in his eyes, see the rage burning through the boy (although, his eyes revealed emotions far too advanced for a boy), and Draco knew he was in trouble. He had to leave now, before Harry tried to attack him, before he ruined absolutely everything.</p><p>But Draco was too late.</p><p>He laid there, on the bathroom floor, water rushing around him. The ringing in his ears deafening. He felt the blood rushing out of the wounds and pretended not to hear when the other boy gasped, pretended not to see when the other boy fell down on the ground, similar to Draco. His mind grew fuzzy and he desperately tried to block the blood flowing out of him, fighting a losing battle. He couldn't die here, not in this dingy bathroom, he had so much work to do! He knew Harry wouldn't die from his wounds, and that thought alone almost made Draco let go of the strings of life he was grasping on to. But if he died, Harry could very well get into another stupid situation that Draco would have no chance of intervening if he was dead.</p><p>His awareness slipped away form him.</p><p>When he woke up, he was in the infirmary. Shock, than relief, than panic. The news would get out to his parents, they would be disappointed in him, where was Harry, was he okay? All these thoughts jumbled around in his head until his eyes caught on to a figure on the bed across from him. The black mop of hair was unmistakable. He couldn't help the sigh of relief that swept through him. He knew Harry wouldn't die, but the terror that had gripped him ignored that fact. Draco stood up, ignoring the searing pain in his midsection, and walked over to Harry's bed, only able to see him by the barely risen sun. He stared for a few moments, at the peaceful expression on his face, before Draco slipped out of the infirmary, leaving the other boy alone.</p><p>Days turned into week and weeks into months. Draco avoided Harry like the plague, even if his heart was begging him to turn around and answer every question Harry had. Harry knew they were soulmates now. That fact was undeniable. He also knew that he would be sacraficing both of their lives if he approached him for conversation. He needed to focus on the cabinet. He needed to restore his family's honor. He reminded himself of this everyday as his hands shaked and he wept silently at his stolen future.</p><p>He stared at the dead bird on the base of the cabinet and pretended that the sight didn't horrify him.</p><p>Suddenly, he was pointing his wand as Dumbledore's face, hands shaking just as they had been doing for weeks. He stared into the old man's eyes and wanted nothing more than to run away from this life, to take up Dumbledore's offer of help. But he was trapped, he knew that, and the jeers of the Death Eaters behind him only confirmed his helplessness. He almost cried out in relief when Snape took over his job for him. He didn't know if he could live with himself if he killed someone. He didn't know if he could live with himself if he killed Harry's idol.</p><p>His seventh year was his worst nightmare. He played the good little death eater, pretended he took pleasure in the new way of life, but as he stared at the freshly tortured and killed innocent people, all he could focus on was his churning stomach. This wasn't what he wanted.</p><p>Draco only knew Harry was alive by his pain, which was the worst irony he had ever seen. He was always afraid that the pain he was feeling was Harry's death. The next pain sprouted a little bit of relief before it planted the same panic. It was a cycle he couldn't escape and he wasn't sure if he could continue on like this anymore.</p><p>Shock was Draco's first reaction when he was called down to the main hall to be faced with Harry's deformed face. He was wondering why those had appeared. Thank Merlin he knew how to use glamor charms. Dread was quickly settling into his stomach as he stared at Harry, who was on his knees in front of him</p><p>The death eaters asked if it was the boy who lived. Draco said he wasn't sure. They asked again. Draco insisted there was no way of knowing, that he couldn't tell, that it most likely wasn't him. It was the safest answer, and it didn't make him suspicious if they found out it actually was Harry. He was dragged away, and their eyes locked, and Draco wished for a fleeting moment that they could have been soulmates in different lives.</p><p>He held onto that thought as he was forced to watch Harry's best friend tortured right in front of him. He held onto that thought as he emptied his stomach in the bathroom for the eighth time that week.</p><p>Stepping on to Hogwarts grounds again was a special kind of torture. The place, his safe haven for a long time, had already been infected in his sixth year, but this was a new kind. He knew there was going to be so much more blood spilt soon. He could feel his heart threatening to pound out of his chest. He didn't want to fight. He really didn't. But there was nothing he could do to stop it. And the sickening thought that he had caused this settled in his brain. He continued forward. If he died in battle, maybe that was for the best.</p><p>The fighting had started in full force, and Draco watched as bodies fell to the floor, never to stand up again. He watched the bright colors of curses fly across rooms, he watched Hogwarts collapse around itself. He hid. And cried. He was a coward, always had been, and he didn't want to see what he caused. This was his fault, if he didn't care so much about his pride, he could have stopped it all.</p><p>When Draco toppled over, he was sure someone had hit him with the killing curse. Excruciating pain flashed through his body, causing him to fall over, but his eyes never closed, he never faded into darkness. Instead, an empty pit in his heart. One thought ran through his mind in that moment: Something happened to Harry.</p><p>Draco couldn't believe his eyes when he saw Harry's limp body in the giant's hands. The entire world went fuzzy, and he barely stumbled over when Voldemort called, barely noticed when the vile man's arms wrapped around him, barely noticed his father gripping his shoulder. Harry was dead. It... It couldn't be. There was no way the boy who lived was dead. Not Harry. He was supposed to do great things, wasn't he?</p><p>When Harry jumped from the giant's hands and went into action, Draco wanted to cry from relief. He did, a bit, but wiped them away and returned his stoic composure. He was still standing with the death eaters, and every person standing opposite him hated every bit of his being, and he knew Harry did too. He couldn't stay long.</p><p>The news Voldemort was dead was one of the happiest moments of his life. It only lasted so long.</p><p>Picking up the pieces of his life was difficult. He was put on trial, but Harry of all people testified for him. Draco wanted to reach out to him, to hug him, to beg him for forgiveness, but a tense "thank you" was all Draco could manage. Harry nodded his understanding.</p><p>That was a start to a tense friendship. It was more than Draco had ever expected to deserve.</p><p>The nightmares of the war never stopped. He smiled at the letter that informed him of Harry's acceptance to become a teacher at Hogwarts. The panic for both his and Harry's safety never stopped. He got a job working at a remote apothecary. Maybe it was for the best.</p><p>Draco didn't go to Harry's wedding. He didn't think he could last, watching Harry make heart eyes at the Weasley girl (Ginny, he reminded himself. He needed to be polite now). He didn't think his feelings for Harry would ever cease. They'd forever be one-sided. Draco was glad Harry was happy. He never would be.</p><p>Maybe it was for the best.</p><p>
  <em>im sorry</em>
</p><p>Maybe it was for the best.</p>
