Severus rolled his eyes as Lily pouted at him.</p><p> “I don’t want to go,” he said, crossing his arms. “A party with your boyfriend’s drunk frat friends is not how I want to spend my Friday night.”</p><p> “It’s cause he’ll be there, isn’t, it?” Lily asked, and Severus’s grip tightened. “Yeah, it is, isn’t it? C’mon, he’s not that bad. And honestly, you can just avoid him. There’ll be enough people there.”</p><p>Severus set his gaze on Lily and shook his head. “He’s a dick.”</p><p>Lily shrugged. “Just spend your night with Remus. Or Reggie, I think he’ll be there.”</p><p>He sighed, slouching into the seat. “I can’t understand how your boyfriend can deal with him.”</p><p>“They’re best friends, Sev. And Sirius is really nice. Just, you know, not to everyone.” Lily paused. “Kind of like you,” she added as an afterthought, and Severus grimaced.</p><p>“Please don’t compare me to him. I couldn’t stand the thought of us sharing any similarities.” He pulled a face at the thought.</p><p>Lily huffed out a laugh. “Yeah, you’re coming, Sev. It’s James’ party, and I want you to be there. And isn’t it worse if you choose not to go because of him? Doesn’t that mean he’s won?”</p><p>“He hasn’t won,” Severus shot back quickly, and Lily looked skeptical.</p><p>“Okay, then come and prove it. You probably make him just as angry, so he’ll hate to have you there too.”</p><p>Severus grit his teeth and thought for a moment, eyebrows furrowing. Lily regarded him from across the bedroom and smiled softly. She knew she had him; she had had years to learn how to press his buttons and with something like this, she had him on lock.</p><p>“Fuck, fine,” Severus growled. “I’ll come to the stupid party.”</p><p>Lily smiled brightly. “Perfect, now get over here. I want to watch the new season of <em>Grey’s Anatomy.</em>”</p><p>Severus stood and walked over to the bed. He hopped on and sat next to Lily, tapping his fingers against his thigh. He still looked deep in thought, so Lily sighed and pressed play.</p><p>She could remember exactly when Severus and Sirius had first met. It was September of their junior year, and one of those nights that held the dying breaths of summer.</p><p>James and she had been dating for about six months at this point, meeting in a Journalism class both had decided to take as a breadth. It was a small class – only about twenty students, and from the start, James had his eyes set on her. Her classmates used to tease her over it; James was a brother of a high-tier fraternity and nearly every girl was in love with him.</p><p>Lily had refused to buy into it, and months had passed with his increasingly desperate acts to get her on a date. When he didn’t seem to be letting up, she finally conceded.</p><p>She had honestly expected him to be an asshole. President of one of the coolest frats, probably spoiled to all extremes and as arrogant as they come, she imagined a one and done deal.</p><p>But James had surprised her, and this first date had been spent with her in a mild state of pleased awe. His reputation had done him a disservice as he sent her into fits of laughter and moved her when she realized how truly caring he was. Their first date quickly turned into a second, and then a third, and by the time the semester ended, they had decided to be girlfriend and boyfriend, and Lily was pretty happy over it.</p><p>She still doubted it sometimes; in a sense, she was competing with the prettiest, coolest girls on campus, and for whatever reason, she had won. She had said that once to James, and he had laughed at it the way he does sometimes, bright with eyes shut, and said there was no one else he would rather be with. That he had tried one of those “cool” girls, and Lily was better in every which way possible.</p><p>Lily had kissed him at that, and James looked at her like she was the most important thing he had ever seen, and Lily decided that was when she really started to fall in love with him.</p><p>Their relationship had strengthened over the rest of the summer, and she practically glowed as she thought back over it. The love letters James had physically sent like the romantic idiot he is, her visit to his house i.e. mansion, and the countless kisses they had exchanged.</p><p>Returning to school had made it more difficult, and Lily thought sourly of all the girls who had taken it as a personal offense that a sorority-less pre-med nerd had somehow managed to have the one and only James Potter fall heads over heels in love with her. Lily didn’t know how she had managed that either, and at one point, there were rumors of a love potion that sent Severus and her into hysterical laughter. James had only shrugged them off and remained insistent in his feelings to her.</p><p>“You’re special, Lils. These girls – they’re not, shit. They’re not you. Not someone who I would spend the rest of my life with,” he had explained awkwardly one day, and Lily had to bite her tongue at that.</p><p>It was nice to be in love, she decided at that point, nice to be in love with someone like James Potter. And for all she could tell, James Potter seemed to feel the same about her.</p><p>Dating him also thrust her into his lifestyle, and her general hatred and disdain for frats only solidified. Individually, they were all great. Remus, especially, and to a lesser extent, Sirius and Peter, but nice all the same. The minute the four of them occupied the same space, let alone the rest of the brothers in KSE, chaos reigned.</p><p>Lily had decided at one party that they were all drunk, not just on alcohol, but also on their perceived self-importance. Sirius, the heir to some old-money family, was especially culpable of that, arrogance reeking off of him, and Lily could only begrudgingly admit that, with the exception of James, he was the hottest person she had ever met. Fortunately, he was kind to her because he could just as quickly act as an asshole and a good one at that. She had seen how effective and cruel he could be to others, especially the girls who fawned over him. However, James’ love granted her some protection, and Sirius seemed to approve of the relationship, constantly teasing James about it.</p><p>So of course, when Lily invited Severus to one of the parties, desperate for some actual company, they had taken an immediate hatred of each other.</p><p>Severus, like her, had a strong dislike of fraternities, and only with a lot of pleading had she managed to convince him. They had gone over early, privy to the exclusive pre-game that girls and boys would sell an arm to get into.</p><p>James and Severus had already met, and while it was initially uncomfortable (“C’mon, Lils, he’s only your best friend from childhood? Are you sure he doesn’t…” “James, shut up. It won’t ever be like that, and I’m never abandoning him over you.”), they had eventually come around. While friends would be a far stretch, they tolerated each other for Lily’s sake, and even seemed to get along every so often.</p><p>At the pre-game, James had stepped up with a beer in hand and pulled Lily into a tight hug. He pulled away and kissed her, and Lily could taste the alcohol on his tongue. He then turned to Severus and shook his hand, and Severus had smiled back, muttering his thanks. James had pulled them onto the couch, pushing away three of the younger pledges. He handed them both beers and took a seat next to Lily, looping his arm around her shoulder.</p><p>Severus looked terribly out of place, his discomfort a physical presence. Surrounded by the campus’s Adonises, his skinny frame and tight features strayed far from the standard of physical beauty the brothers were used too. Lily almost regretted bringing him, but then he did one of those remarkable Severus Snape things where he turned his discomfort into removed, calculated confidence and regarded the room with a weary maturity.</p><p>Lily squeezed his knee quickly, and Severus rolled his eyes at her, giving her a look that perfectly expressed what he thought of the brothers. Lily smiled and turned back to James who was shouting across the room at one of the pledges. She moved in closer to him, reveling in his energy and presence.</p><p>At one point, Sirius came over, face flushed and that lazy, infuriatingly hot, smile of his dripping off his face. He threw himself down next to Severus and stretched his arms over his head as he took in the scene. Severus sat rigidly next to him, holding his drink tightly.</p><p>Sirius then turned to Severus, eyes narrowing. “Who the fuck are you?” he asked, having to raise his voice over the ruckus of twenty drunk men and assorted girlfriends. Severus took a moment to respond as if he couldn’t even be bothered.</p><p>“Severus. Lily’s friend,” he explained, glancing over at Lily who was laughing at something James said, her cheeks turning red from the alcohol.</p><p>Sirius huffed out a laugh, but it was cruel and immediately set Severus on the defensive. “You trying to fuck her?” he asked haughtily, his smile morphing into a smirk. Severus suppressed the urge to grit his teeth. Instead, he schooled his expression and looked at Sirius unimpressed.</p><p>“You trying to fuck him?” he shot back, his voice lowering and eyes conveying the slightest sense of disdain through a layer of apathy.</p><p>Something twitched on Sirius’s face, and Severus knew he had won.</p><p>“I’m not a fucking fag,” Sirius had spat. “Unlike you fucker.”</p><p>Severus had smiled ever so slightly. “Takes one to know one, love,” he said, voice curling over the last word in a way that would set Sirius’s teeth on edge. This was almost too easy, and he enjoyed the opportunity to take down his ego. God, was he actually having fun at a frat party?</p><p>“Fuck you,” Sirius had responded angrily. “Roberts, get me a drink,” he barked, and the kid who must have been Roberts jumped up and ran to the kitchen. He was back within a few minutes and handed Sirius a glass of sprite. Severus figured it was vodka.</p><p>“You’re friends with my brother, aren’t you?” Sirius had said, voice still harsh as he took a swig of the drink.</p><p>Severus blinked and then decided to play dumb. He didn’t need to add fuel to Sirius’s ego, and by pretending not to know he was, when indeed most of, if not the entire, school did, well, he couldn’t resist the opportunity. “Your brother?” he asked. Sirius turned to him and looked at Sirius as he was some lifeform that had just crawled out of the gutter.</p><p>“Regulus. Regulus Black”</p><p>“Oh, I didn’t realize he was your brother. Yes, I am friends with him,” Severus continued, arching an eyebrow. Sirius scowled.</p><p>“You’re fucking annoying, aren’t you?” he grumbled, taking another long drink. “Fuck off, will you?”</p><p>“I happened to be sitting here first,” Severus countered, the idea that he should exercise caution stumbling behind his typical rashness. Sirius turned to look at him, and when their eyes met, Severus had to try very hard not to look away. He kept the gaze, however, determined not to lose to Sirius. He couldn’t concede any victory to this asshole.</p><p>Sirius only broke away when a pretty dark-haired girl walked over, her hair bouncing over her shoulders. She was dressed in a red crop top and a tight jean skirt, and Severus averted his gaze.</p><p>“Siri,” she exclaimed, her smile physically blinding.</p><p>“Bella,” Sirius said, his voice losing the edge. Bella walked over and sat on Sirius’s lap, her long, tan legs knocking against Severus’s. She kissed him, and Sirius kissed back, long and deep. Severus shifted uncomfortably next to him, clenching the unopened drink tighter.</p><p>“Who’s this, baby?” Bella said, her voice a pitch too high for Severus’s liking. He figured he would have a headache after a few minutes of listening to her.</p><p>“No one,” Sirius responded, kissing her again. Severus scoffed, loud enough for Sirius to hear, and turned to Lily. Lily at this point was properly drunk and looked at Severus with bright eyes. She looked between him and Sirius, who was making out with the Bella girl, and understanding crossed her face. She turned to the brother sitting next to James, a nice looking one with glasses and surprisingly without the standard sense of arrogance.</p><p>“Remus,” she began, “Did I introduce you to my friend Severus? He’s a Chemistry major, really smart.”</p><p>“Pleasure to meet you,” Remus responded, tilting forward to shake Severus’s hand. “Chemistry, huh?” he asked, and then Severus was talking with him and Sirius Black left quickly afterward and was forgotten for the rest of the night.</p><p>After that, Lily started to regularly invite Severus to the KSE parties, and since he usually had no better excuse, he tended to go.</p><p>James was always welcoming, Remus a compassionate conversationalist, and Peter was a good laugh. Sirius, however, had seemed to regard their first conversation as grounds for hatred and glared at Severus whenever he could. Every so often, the party drove them together, and their rare interactions resulted in acidic barbs and scathing insults. </p><p>No matter how stupid he wanted to consider Sirius, the man was incredibly effective at coming up with the most scathing, damaging response. People cowered before him as it only took a spare comment to cause a girl to hold back tears or a boy to clench his fists. Yet, regardless of what he said, people continued to worship him, the attention of every room drawing towards him like he was a brilliant star and they were measly asteroids. Severus has asked Lily about it, utterly confused at how anyone could continue to tolerate his presence, and she had said something about that smile of his, and how yes, he could be an asshole, but when he liked you there was nothing else in the world that mattered.</p><p>To put it simply, Severus thought they were all idiots.</p><p>Thankfully, Severus had as just as a sharp tongue and arguably even quicker wit, so he could effectively stand his ground and give as good as he got. They were worthy opponents, and if it wasn’t for James and Lily to drag them apart when their hatred started to turn dangerous, Severus was certain one of them would have punched the other.</p><p>Sirius Black enraged him as few others could, and he figured the feeling was mutual.</p><p>Other than him, the other brothers were all fine and didn’t pay much mind to Severus, too caught up in the alcohol and the hot sorority girls. Severus didn’t mind himself. He would rather watch from the couch as the great drama of college parties played out before him.</p><p>He got to know the players, and frankly, as an anthropological experiment on the mindset of a standard frat boy, it provided enough intellectual stimulation to keep him engaged.</p><p>However, as most things tended to do, he did get overwhelmed and would walk outside, leaning against the back of the house and ignoring the smattering of boys who guarded the door. He lit a cigarette and would take slow drags, blowing out the smoke into the night. Hearing the dull pound of music behind him, the sound of girls entering and leaving in a flurry of activity, and the occasional passing car had a strangely calming effect on him, and he would spend a good amount of time there until it grew late and he became tired, and after shooting a quick text to Lily, he would leave.</p><p>Typically, people left him alone. He clearly didn’t look like he belonged. The ‘frat boy’ had an image, and Severus’s malnourished frame and unattractive features didn’t fit that. Girls generally left him alone, a few asking for a smoke and even fewer striking up a conversation. Boys, not seeing how Severus could offer any social advantage, tried to seek out the cooler boys, flocking around the likes of James and Sirius. Severus didn’t mind. The people didn’t interest him, except for the occasional kindred soul who looked just as fed up as he was, and more so, he regarded their entitlement and bellicosity with disdain.</p><p>The KSE house was a den for Dionysius, but one that Severus didn’t mind observing.</p><p>For the party tonight, Lily’s pressuring won out, and Severus begrudgingly joined Lily yet again. He lost her quickly to James and snuck outside, tired of the heat and the drunk brothers who had reverted to a twelve-year-old’s humor and a five-year-old’s intelligence.</p><p>He stood outside, cigarette held loosely between his fingers. It had started to get cold as October drew to a close, but Severus didn’t mind. Instead, he assumed his usual position, his eyes glancing upwards to catch the few stars that had forced their way through the light pollution.</p><p>He was jolted out of his reverie as a hand grabbed his shoulder, the person tilting forward to throw up all over Severus’s shoes. He cursed and tried to push the person away, but the person held on tightly, dark hair falling over his face.</p><p>Sirius Black, he thought scathingly. “Get the fuck off me,” he hissed, and Sirius did his best to stand up.  He lifted his head, seemed to think better of it, and threw up again, this time gratefully missing Severus’s shoes. “Fucking hell,” he cursed again. “What the fuck, Black?”</p><p>Sirius mumbled something. He tried again, this time louder. “Sorry, shit. Sorry.” He breathed deeply and rubbed his sleeve across his mouth. He removed his hand from Severus’s shoulder and pressed it against the brick wall for support. “Did I get you?” he asked, still tilted forward.</p><p>Severus glanced down and grimaced. “Yes, you fucker. Seriously, what the fuck?”</p><p>“What? You never drink too much?” Sirius responded disgruntled.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Sirius scoffed. “You’re full of shit, Snape.”</p><p>“Unlike you and your idiotic friends, I don’t drink, Black.”</p><p>Sirius was quiet for a moment, seemingly taken aback. “You don’t drink? Like at all? Do you even go to college?”</p><p>“Drinking is not a prerequisite for a degree,” Severus shot back, and Sirius huffed out a laugh before wincing. He turned to press his back against the wall and managed to raise his head.</p><p>“Still, Snape, you ever have fun?” He breathed heavily and closed his eyes before quickly opening them. He cursed under his breath.</p><p>“You consider this fun, Black?” Severus asked, and Sirius huffed out another laugh.</p><p>“Yeah, until about five minutes ago.”</p><p>“Then I pity you,” Severus said, not entirely sure why. The frat culture disgusted him, and it’s not like he ever wanted to waste one shred of empathy on someone as full of themselves as Sirius, especially since that person had just ruined one of his two pairs of shoes.</p><p>Sirius grew quiet at that, and they watched in silence as a flock of drunk girls shivered past them. “You’re a weird one, Snape,” Sirius finally said. “If you don’t drink, then what the fuck do you do here?”</p><p>Severus shrugged, gripping the cigarette tightly. “I watch. I have a smoke. I talk with anyone intelligent enough to hold a sensible conversation, which is just as difficult to find as I had expected.”</p><p>“Yeah, I bet you do,” Sirius mumbled, his eyes sliding shut. He tipped forward before correcting himself.</p><p>“Do you need help?” Severus offered, again unsure of why. It’s not like he cared.</p><p>Sirius thought for a moment, and then heaved. He winced again and wiped his mouth. “Yeah, fuck, some water? Or actually…” he slurred, and Severus waited for him to continue. “Help me upstairs? So I can lie down?”</p><p>Severus sighed. He had offered. “Fine, Black. Just don’t throw up on me again.”</p><p>“No promises,” Sirius said wryly, and Severus rolled his eyes. He looped Sirius’s arm around his shoulders and half-heaved him from the wall. Sirius was heavy, and he initially stumbled at the weight. He gritted his teeth and managed to navigate him back into the house. He pushed through the crowd of people, skin itching at the sweaty contact, and managed to half-drag Sirius upstairs.</p><p>He leaned against the wall at the top, shooting a nasty look at a couple that was blocking the hallway. The couple paled and quickly went downstairs. “What room?” Severus demanded, and Sirius stared at him blearily.</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>“You don’t know?” Severus said angrily. His shoulders were starting to ache from the weight of Sirius, and he didn’t want to deal with his stupidity.</p><p>“It’s not my house,” Sirius explained as if it was obvious. Severus suppressed the urge to yell.</p><p>“Fuck, fine. I’m going to leave you here and go get James, okay?” Sirius mumbled something, but Severus didn’t care because he had already gotten out from under Sirius’s arm and was half-way down the stairs. He stood on the third step, eyes scanning over the party as he searched for a flash of red hair. He desperately hoped he wouldn’t have to go down into the basement; he couldn’t stand the heat and the desperate pressing of bodies.</p><p>He eventually caught sight of her entering the room, and he made an immediate beeline to her, shoving past people who were too drunk to care. Lily caught sight of him and smiled as she leaned heavily against James.</p><p>“James,” Severus said, and James focused on him, eyes bright from the alcohol.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Sirius Black is upstairs unable to walk or do much else except throw up. I suggest you go and help him or at least find someone who will.”</p><p>James nodded, seeming to sober up slightly. “Fuck, okay. I’ll go get Remus. Thanks for letting me know.” James turned away, and Lily leaned forward to hug him before following James. Severus stood there for a moment, before deciding it was time to go. He had had far too much for tonight and needed a new pair of shoes and a long, hot shower to wash away the night.</p>
