<p>Message Delivered</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Where’s Mother?” Draco asked the moment Harry appeared. It’d taken Harry some time to find him in the gazebo. </p>
<p>Harry shrugged, settling on the bench beside him. “No idea.” </p>
<p>Reaching for Harry’s hand, Draco entwined their fingers. “It took you a while to follow. I assume she detained you?” </p>
<p>Harry sighed, squeezing Draco’s fingers. “She asked me to tell you she has no hidden agenda.” </p>
<p>Draco snorted. “Please! Give me a break. She <i>always</i> has a hidden agenda.” </p>
<p>“She seemed pretty sincere—”</p>
<p>“Pfft! She’s a Slytherin, a Black, <i>and</i> a Malfoy. She could lie to you and you’d never know.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Harry sighed. Clearly Draco was in no mood to hear anything good about his mother. “That’s possible. Although I <i>am</i> a trained observer. In fact I aced interrogation training.”</p>
<p>Leaning his head on Harry’s shoulder, Draco said, “Those techniques work against your average suspect. I doubt you could break Mother in an interrogation.” </p>
<p>“Let’s hope that event never arises,” said Harry. “Anyway, I’ve done what I promised her I’d do, I’ve passed along her message. The rest is up to the two of you.” </p>
<p>“What would you do in my shoes?” Draco whispered. </p>
<p>“I’d take time and think about it.” </p>
