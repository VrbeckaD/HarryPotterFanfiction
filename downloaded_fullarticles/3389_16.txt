    <p>Chapta one<br/>
The pimp who lived</p>
<p>Mista n' Mrs. Muthafuckin Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, was proud as a muthafucka ta say dat they was perfectly normal, fuck you straight up. They was tha last playas you'd expect ta be involved up in anythang strange or mysterious, cuz they just didn't hold wit such nonsense.<br/>
Mista Muthafuckin Dursley was tha director of a gangbangin' firm called Grunnings, which made drills, yo. Dude was a funky-ass big, beefy playa wit hardly any neck, although da ruffneck did gotz a straight-up big-ass mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin n' blonde n' had nearly twice tha usual amount of neck, which came in straight-up useful as her dope ass dropped so much of her time cranin over garden fences, spyin on tha neighbors. Da Dursleys had a lil' small-ass lil hustla called Dudley n' up in they opinion there was no finer pimp anywhere.</p>
<p>Da Dursleys had every last muthafuckin thang they wanted yo, but they also had a secret, n' they top billin fear was dat some muthafucka would discover dat shit. They didn't be thinkin they could bear it if they playas found out bout tha Potters. Mrs.Potta was Mrs. Dursleyz sista yo, but they hadn't kicked it wit fo' nuff muthafuckin years;<br/>
in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended her dope ass didn't gotz a sister, cuz her sista n' her good-for-nothang homeboy was as unDursleyish as dat shiznit was possible ta be. Da Dursleys shuddered ta be thinkin what tha fuck tha neighbors would say if tha Pottas arrived up in tha street. Da Dursleys knew dat tha Pottas had a lil' small-ass son, too, but they had never even peeped his muthafuckin ass. This pimp was another phat reason ta keepin tha Pottas away; they didn't want Dudley mixin wit a cold-ass lil pimp like dat n' like dis n' like dat y'all.</p>
<p>When Mista Muthafuckin n' Mrs. Dursley raised up on tha dull, gray Tuesdizzle our rap starts, there was not a god damn thang bout tha cloudy sky outside ta suggest dat strange n' mysterious thangs would soon be goin' down all over tha ghetto. Mista Muthafuckin Dursley hummed as he picked up his crazy-ass most borin tie fo' work, n' Mrs. Dursley ghetto hyped away happily as dat biiiiatch wrestled a beatboxin Dudley tha fuck into his high chair. </p>
<p>None of dem noticed a large, tawny owl flutta past tha window.</p>
<p>At half past eight, Mista Muthafuckin Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.Dursley on tha cheek, n' tried ta lick Dudley good-bye but missed, cuz Dudley was now havin a tantrum n' throwin his cereal all up in tha walls. "Little tyke," chortled Mista Muthafuckin Dursley as he left tha crib yo. Dude gots tha fuck into his hoopty n' backed outta number fourz drive.</p>
<p>Dat shiznit was on tha corner of tha street dat he noticed tha straight-up original gangsta sign of suttin' peculiar -- a cold-ass lil pussaaaaay readin a map. For a second, Mista Muthafuckin Dursley didn't realize what tha fuck dat schmoooove muthafucka done peeped -- then he jerked his head round ta look again. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. There was a pussaaaaay standin on tha corner of Privet Drive yo, but there wasn't a map up in sight. What could dat schmoooove muthafucka done been thankin of, biatch? It must done been a trick of tha light. Mista Muthafuckin Dursley blinked n' stared all up in tha cat. Well shiiiit, it stared back fo' realz. As Mista Muthafuckin Dursley drove round tha corner n' up tha road, he peeped tha pussaaaaay up in his crazy-ass mirror. Shiiit, dis aint no joke. Dat shiznit was now readin tha sign dat holla'd Privet Drive -- no, lookin all up in tha sign; pussies couldn't read maps or signs. Mista Muthafuckin Dursley gave his dirty ass a lil shake n' put tha pussaaaaay outta his crazy-ass mind. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! As da ruffneck drove toward hood tha pimpin' muthafucka thought of not a god damn thang except a big-ass order of drills da thug was hopin ta git dat day.</p>
<p>But on tha edge of town, drills was driven outta his crazy-ass mind by suttin' else fo' realz. As da perved-out muthafucka sat up in tha usual mornin traffic jam, his schmoooove ass couldn't help noticin dat there seemed ta be a shitload of strangely dressed playas about. Muthafuckas up in cloaks. Mista Muthafuckin Dursley couldn't bear playas whoz ass dressed up in funky threadz -- tha getups you saw on lil' playas, biaaatch! Dude supposed dis was some wack freshly smoked up fashion. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch yo. Dude drummed his wild lil' fingers on tha steerin wheel n' his wild lil' fuckin eyes fell tha fuck on a huddle of these weirdos standin close by. They was whisperin excitedly together n' shit. Mista Muthafuckin Dursley was enraged ta peep dat a cold-ass lil couple dem weren't lil' at all; why, dat playa had ta be olda than da thug was, n' bustin an emerald-chronic cloak! Da nerve of him! But then it struck Mista Muthafuckin Dursley dat dis was probably some wack-ass stunt -- these playas was obviously collectin fo' something... fo'sho, dat would be da shit. Da traffic moved on n' all dem minutes later, Mista Muthafuckin Dursley arrived up in tha Grunnings parkin lot, his crazy-ass mind back on drills.</p>
<p>Mista Muthafuckin Dursley always sat wit his back ta tha window up in his crib on tha ninth floor. Shiiit, dis aint no joke. If dat schmoooove muthafucka hadn't, he might have found it harder ta concentrate on drills dat mornin yo. Dude didn't peep tha owls swoopin past up in broad daylight, though playas up in tha street did; they pointed n' gazed open- grilled as owl afta owl sped overhead. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Most of dem had never peeped a owl even at nighttime. Mista Muthafuckin Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free mornin yo. Dude yelled at five different playas yo. Dude made nuff muthafuckin blingin telephone calls n' shouted a lil' bit mo' n' mo' n' mo' yo. Dude was up in a straight-up phat vibe until lunchtime, when tha pimpin' muthafucka thought he'd stretch his hairy-ass legs n' strutt across tha road ta loot his dirty ass a funky-ass bun from tha bakery.</p>
<p>He’d forgotten all bout tha playas up in cloaks until he passed a crew of dem next ta tha baker’s yo. Dude eyed dem angrily as he passed. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Dude didn’t know why yo, but they made his ass uneasy. This bunch was whisperin excitedly, too, n' his schmoooove ass couldn’t peep a single collectin tin. Dat shiznit was on his way back past them, clutchin a big-ass doughnut up in a funky-ass bag, dat his schmoooove ass caught all dem lyrics of what tha fuck they was saying.</p>
<p>"Da Potters, that’s right, that’s what tha fuck I heard-"</p>
<p>"-yes, they son, Harry-"</p>
<p>Mista Muthafuckin Dursley stopped dead as fuckin fried chicken. Fear flooded his muthafuckin ass yo. Dude looked back all up in tha whisperers as if da thug wanted ta say suttin' ta dem yo, but thought betta of dat shit.</p>
<p>Dude dashed back across tha road, hurried up ta his office, snapped at his secretary not ta disturb him, seized his cold-ass telephone, n' had almost finished dialin his crib number when he chizzeled his mind. Dude put tha receiver back down n' stroked his crazy-ass mustache, thinking... no, da thug was bein fuckin wack. Potta wasn't such a unusual name, yo. Dude was shizzle there was fuckin shitloadz of playas called Potta whoz ass had a lil hustla called Harry. Come ta be thinkin of it, da thug wasn't even shizzle his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even peeped tha boy. Well shiiiit, it might done been Harvey. Or Harold. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! There was no point up in worryin Mrs. Dursley; she always gots so upset at any mention of her sista n' shiznit yo. Dude didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sista like dis n' like dat y'all... but all tha same, dem playas up in cloaks...</p>
<p>Dude found it a shitload harder ta concentrate on drills dat afternoon n' when he left tha buildin at five o'clock, da thug was still so worried dat da thug strutted straight tha fuck into one of mah thugs just outside tha door.</p>
<p>"Sorry," he grunted, as tha tiny oldschool playa stumbled n' almost fell. Dat shiznit was all dem secondz before Mista Muthafuckin Dursley realized dat tha playa was bustin a violet cloak. Dude didn't seem at all upset at bein almost knocked ta tha ground. Y'all KNOW dat shits on tha contrary, his wild lil' grill split tha fuck into a wide smile n' da perved-out muthafucka holla'd up in a squeaky voice dat made passersby stare, "Don't be sorry, mah dear sir, fo' not a god damn thang could upset me todizzle dawwwwg! Rejoice, fo' You-Know-Dum diddy-dum, here I come biaaatch! Who tha fuck has gone at last! Even Mugglez like yo ass should be celebrating, dis happy, aiiight day!"</p>
<p>And tha oldschool playa hugged Mista Muthafuckin Dursley round tha middle n' strutted off. Mista Muthafuckin Dursley stood rooted ta tha spot yo. Dude had been hugged by a cold-ass complete stranger n' shiznit yo. Dude also thought dat schmoooove muthafucka had done called him a Muggle, whatever dat shit was. Dude was rattled. Dude hurried ta his hoopty n' set off fo' home, hopin da thug was imaginin thangs, which dat schmoooove muthafucka had never hoped before, cuz da ruffneck didn't approve of imagination.</p>
<p>As he pulled tha fuck into tha driveway of number four, tha straight-up original gangsta da perved-out muthafucka saw -- n' it didn't improve his crazy-ass vibe -- was tha pussaaaaay he'd spotted dat morning. Dat shiznit was now chillin on his wild lil' freakadelic garden wall yo. Dude was shizzle dat shiznit was tha same ol' dirty one; it had tha same markings round its eyes.</p>
<p>"Shoo!" holla'd Mista Muthafuckin Dursley loudly. Da pussaaaaay didn't move. Well shiiiit, it just gave his ass a stern look. Was dis aiiight pussaaaaay behavior? Mista Muthafuckin Dursley wondered. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Tryin ta pull his dirty ass together, he let his ass tha fuck into tha crib. Dude was still determined not ta mention anythang ta his hoe. </p>
<p>Mrs. Dursley had had a sick, aiiight day. It make me wanna hollar playa! Biatch holla'd at his ass over dinner all bout Mrs. Next Doorz problems wit her daughta n' how tha fuck Dudley had hustled a freshly smoked up word ("Won't!"). Mista Muthafuckin Dursley tried ta act normally. When Dudley had been put ta bed, da thug went tha fuck into tha livin room up in time ta catch tha last report on tha evenin news:</p>
<p>"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported dat tha nationz owls done been behavin straight-up unusually todizzle. It make me wanna hollar playa! Although owls normally hunt at night n' is hardly eva peeped up in daylight, there done been hundredz of sightingz of these birdz flyin up in every last muthafuckin direction since sunrise. Experts is unable ta explain why tha owls have suddenly chizzled they chillin pattern." Da newscasta allowed his dirty ass a grin. "Most mysterious fo' sho. And now, over ta Jim McGuffin wit tha drizzle n' shit. Goin ta be any mo' showerz of owls tonight, Jim?"</p>
<p>"Well, Ted," holla'd tha weatherman, "I don't give a fuck bout dat yo, but it aint only tha owls dat done been actin oddly todizzle. It make me wanna hollar playa! Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, n' Dundee been phonin up in here ta tell me dat instead of tha drizzle I promised yesterday, they've had a thugged-out downpour of blastin stars muthafucka! Perhaps playas done been biggin' up Bonfire Night early -- it aint until next week, muthafucka! But I can promise a wet night tonight."</p>
<p>Mista Muthafuckin Dursley sat frozen up in his thugged-out armchair. Shiiit, dis aint no joke. Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. Shootin stars all over Britain, biatch? Owls flyin by daylight, biatch? Mysterious playas up in cloaks all over tha place, biatch? And a whisper, a whisper bout tha Potters...</p>
<p>Mrs. Dursley came tha fuck into tha livin room carryin two cupz of tea. Dat shiznit was no good. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! He'd gotta say suttin' ta her n' shiznit. Dude cleared his cold-ass throat nervously. "Er -- Petunia, dear -- you aint heard from yo' sista lately, have yo slick ass?"</p>
<p>As dat schmoooove muthafucka had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked n' mad salty fo' realz. Afta all, they normally pretended her dope ass didn't gotz a sister.</p>
<p>"No," her big-ass booty holla'd sharply. "Why?"</p>
<p>"Funny shiznit on tha hype," Mista Muthafuckin Dursley mumbled. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! "Owls... blastin stars... n' there was a shitload of funky-lookin playas up in hood todizzle..."</p>
<p>"So?" snapped Mrs. Dursley.</p>
<p>"Well, I just thought... maybe... dat shiznit was suttin' ta do with... you know... her crowd."</p>
<p>Mrs. Dursley sipped her chronic all up in pursed lips. Mista Muthafuckin Dursley wondered whether da ruffneck dared tell her he'd heard tha name "Potter." Dude decided he didn't give a fuck. Instead da perved-out muthafucka holla'd, as casually as his schmoooove ass could, "Their lil hustla -- he'd be bout Dudleyz age now, wouldn't he?"</p>
<p>"I suppose so," holla'd Mrs. Dursley stiffly.</p>
<p>"Whatz his name again, biatch? Howard, aint it?"</p>
<p>"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask mah crazy-ass."</p>
<p>"Oh, fo'sho," holla'd Mista Muthafuckin Dursley, his thugged-out ass sinkin horribly. "Yes, I wanna bust a nut n agree."</p>
<p>Dude didn't say another word on tha subject as they went upstairs ta bed. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! While Mrs. Dursley was up in tha bathroom, Mista Muthafuckin Dursley crept ta tha bedroom window n' peered down tha fuck into tha front garden. Da pussaaaaay was still there, so peek-a-boo, clear tha way, I be comin' thru fo'sho. Dat shiznit was starin down Privet Drive as though it was waitin fo' something.</p>
<p>Was he imaginin thangs, biatch? Could all dis have anythang ta do wit tha Potters? If it done did... if it gots up dat they was related ta a pair of -- well, da ruffneck ain't be thinkin his schmoooove ass could bear dat shit.</p>
<p>Da Dursleys gots tha fuck into bed. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Mrs. Dursley fell tha fuck asleep quickly but Mista Muthafuckin Dursley lay awake, turnin all dat shiznit over up in his crazy-ass mind. His last, comfortin thought before he fell tha fuck asleep was dat even if tha Pottas was involved, there was no reason fo' dem ta come near his ass n' Mrs. Dursley. Da Pottas knew straight-up well what tha fuck he n' Petunia thought bout dem n' they kind... yo. Dude couldn't peep how tha fuck he n' Petunia could git mixed up in anythang dat might be goin on -- he yawned n' turned over -- it couldn't affect dem wild-ass muthafuckas....</p>
<p>How straight tha fuck up wack the thug was.</p>
<p>Mista Muthafuckin Dursley might done been driftin tha fuck into a uneasy chill yo, but tha pussaaaaay on tha wall outside was showin no sign of chilliness. Dat shiznit was sittin as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on tha far corner of Privet Drive. Well shiiiit, it didn't so much as quiver when a cold-ass lil hoopty door slammed on tha next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, dat shiznit was nearly midnight before tha pussaaaaay moved at all.</p>
<p>A playa rocked up on tha corner tha pussaaaaay had been watching, rocked up so suddenly n' silently you'd have thought he'd just popped outta tha ground. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Da catz tail twitched n' its eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>Nothang like dis playa had eva been peeped on Privet Drive yo. Dude was tall, thin, n' straight-up old, judgin by tha silver of his afro n' beard, which was both long enough ta tuck tha fuck into his belt yo. Dude was bustin long robes, a purple cloak dat swept tha ground, n' high-heeled, buckled boots yo. His blue eyes was light, bright, n' sparklin behind half-moon spectaclez n' his nozzle was straight-up long n' crooked, as though it had been fucked up at least twice. This manz name was Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore didn't seem ta realize dat dat schmoooove muthafucka had just arrived up in a street where every last muthafuckin thang from his name ta his boots was unwelcome yo. Dude was busy as a muthafucka rummagin up in his cloak, lookin fo' something. But da ruffneck did seem ta realize da thug was bein peeped it, cuz he looked up suddenly all up in tha cat, which was still starin at his ass from tha other end of tha street. For some reason, tha sight of tha pussaaaaay seemed ta amuse his muthafuckin ass yo. Dude chuckled n' muttered, "I should have known."</p>
<p>Dude found what tha fuck da thug was lookin fo' up in his muthafuckin inside pocket. Well shiiiit, it seemed ta be a silver blunt lighter n' shiznit yo. Dude flicked it open, held it up in tha air, n' clicked dat shit. Da nearest street lamp went up wit a lil pop yo. Dude clicked it again n' again n' again -- tha next lamp flickered tha fuck into darkness. Twelve times his schmoooove ass clicked tha Put-Outer, until tha only lights left on tha whole street was two tiny pinpricks up in tha distance, which was tha eyez of tha pussaaaaay watchin his muthafuckin ass. If mah playas looked outta they window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able ta peep anythang dat was goin' down on tha pavement. Dumbledore slipped tha Put-Outa back inside his cloak n' set off down tha street toward number four, where da perved-out muthafuckin thug sat down on tha wall next ta tha pussaaaaay. Dude didn't peep it yo, but afta a moment da muthafucka was rappin ta dat shit.</p>
<p>"Fancy seein you here, Pimp McGonagall."</p>
<p>Dude turned ta smile all up at tha tabby, but it had gone. Instead da thug was smilin at a rather severe-lookin biatch whoz ass was bustin square glasses exactly tha shape of tha markings tha pussaaaaay had round its eyes. She, too, was bustin a cold-ass lil cloak, an emerald one yo. Her black afro was drawn tha fuck into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.</p>
<p>"How tha fuck did you know dat shiznit was me, son?" she asked.</p>
<p>"My fuckin dear Professor, I 've never peeped a cold-ass lil pussaaaaay sit so stiffly."</p>
<p>"You'd be stiff if you'd been chillin on a funky-ass brick wall all day," holla'd Pimp McGonagall.</p>
<p>"All day, biatch? When you could done been celebrating? I must have passed a thugged-out dozen feasts n' partizzles on mah way here."</p>
<p>Pimp McGonagall sniffed angrily.</p>
<p>"Oh fo'sho, everyonez celebrating, all right," her big-ass booty holla'd impatiently. "You'd be thinkin they'd be a lil' bit mo' careful yo, but no -- even tha Mugglez have noticed somethingz goin on. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. Dat shiznit was on they news." Biatch jerked her head back all up in tha Dursleys' dark living-room window. "I heard dat shit. Flockz of owls... blastin stars.... Well, they not straight-up fuckin wack. They was bound ta notice something. Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. Shootin stars all up in Kent -- I is bout ta bet dat was Dedalus Diggle yo. Dude never had much sense."</p>
<p>"Yo ass can't blame them," holla'd Dumbledore gently. "We've had precious lil ta big-up fo' eleven years."</p>
<p>"I know that," holla'd Pimp McGonagall irritably. "But thatz no reason ta lose our heads. Muthafuckas is bein downright careless, up on tha streets up in broad daylight, not even dressed up in Muggle clothes, swappin rumors."</p>
<p>Bitch threw a gangbangin' finger-lickin' dirty-ass sideways glizzle at Dumbledore here, as though hopin da thug was goin ta tell her somethang yo, but da ruffneck didn't, so dat biiiiatch went on. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. "A fine thang it would be if, on tha straight-up dizzle YouKnow-Dum diddy-dum, here I come biaaatch! Who tha fuck seems ta have disappeared at last, tha Mugglez found out bout our asses. I suppose he is straight-up gone, Dumbledore?"</p>
<p>"It certainly seems so," holla'd Dumbledore. "Our thugged-out asses have much ta be thankful for. Shiiit, dis aint no joke. Would you care fo' a lemon drop?"</p>
<p>"A what?"</p>
<p>"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle dope I be rather fond of"</p>
<p>"Fuck dat shit, fuck you," holla'd Pimp McGonagall coldly, as though her dope ass didn't be thinkin dis was tha moment fo' lemon drops. "As I say, even if You-Know-Dum diddy-dum, here I come biaaatch! Who tha fuck has gone -"</p>
<p>"My fuckin dear Professor, surely a sensible thug like yo ass can call his ass by his name, biatch? All dis 'You- Know-Who' nonsense -- fo' eleven muthafuckin years I done been tryin ta persuade playas ta booty-call his ass by his thugged-out lil' proper name: Voldemort." Pimp McGonagall flinched yo, but Dumbledore, whoz ass was unstickin two lemon drops, seemed not ta notice. "It all gets so confusin if we keep sayin 'You-Know-Who.' I aint NEVER peeped any reason ta be frightened of sayin Voldemortz name.</p>
<p>"I know you haven 't", holla'd Pimp McGonagall, soundin half exasperated, half admiring. "But you different. Everyone knows you tha only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of."</p>
<p>"Yo ass flatta me," holla'd Dumbledore calmly. "Voldemort had powers I aint NEVER gonna have."</p>
<p>"Only cuz you too -- well -- noble ta use dem wild-ass muthafuckas."</p>
<p>"It aint nuthin but dirty itz dark. I aint blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey holla'd at mah crazy ass she was horny bout mah freshly smoked up earmuffs." </p>
<p>Pimp McGonagall blasted a dirty-ass sharp peep Dumbledore n' holla'd, "Da owls aint a god damn thang next ta tha rumors dat is flyin around. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Yo ass know what tha fuck everyonez saying, biatch? Bout why da ruffneck disappeared, biatch? Bout what tha fuck finally stopped him?"</p>
<p>It seemed dat Pimp McGonagall had reached tha point dat biiiiatch was most anxious ta discuss, tha real reason dat freaky biatch had been waitin on a cold-ass lil wall all day, fo' neither as a cold-ass lil pussaaaaay nor as a biatch had she fixed Dumbledore wit such a piercin stare as her dope ass did now, nahmeean, biatch? Dat shiznit was plain dat whatever "everyone" was saying, dat biiiiatch was not goin ta believe it until Dumbledore holla'd at her dat shiznit was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosin another lemon drop n' did not answer.</p>
<p>"What they saying," she pressed on, "is dat last night Voldemort turned up in Godrics Hollow yo. Dude went ta find tha Potters. Da rumor is that Lil' Willy n' Jizzy Potta is -- is -- dat they -- dead as fuckin fried chicken. Dumbledore bowed his head. Pimp McGonagall gasped.</p>
<p>"Lil' Willy n' James... I can't believe dat shit... I didn't wanna believe dat shit...Oh, Albus..."</p>
<p>Dumbledore reached up n' patted her on tha shoulder n' shit. "I know... I know..." da perved-out muthafucka holla'd heavily.</p>
<p>Pimp McGonagallz voice trembled as dat biiiiatch went on. "Thatz not all. They're sayin tha pimpin' muthafucka tried ta bust a cap up in tha Potterz son, Harry. But -- he couldn't yo. Dude couldn't bust a cap up in dat lil boy. No one knows why, or how, but they sayin dat when his schmoooove ass couldn't bust a cap up in Larry Potsmoker, Voldemort's power somehow broke -- n' thatz why he gone. Dumbledore nodded glumly.</p>
<p>"It aint nuthin but -- itz true?" faltered Pimp McGonagall. "Afta all he's done... all tha playas he capped... his schmoooove ass couldn't bust a cap up in a lil boy? It aint nuthin but just astounding... of all tha thangs ta stop his muthafuckin ass... but how tha fuck up in the name of heaven did Harry survive?"</p>
<p>"We can only guess," holla'd Dumbledore. "We may never know."</p>
<p>Pimp McGonagall pulled up a lace handkerchizzle n' dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a pimped out sniff as tha pimpin' muthafucka took a golden peep from his thugged-out lil' pocket n' examined dat shit. Dat shiznit was a straight-up odd watch. It had twelve handz but no numbers; instead, lil hoodz was moving around tha edge. Well shiiiit, it must have made sense ta Dumbledore, though, cuz he put it back up in his thugged-out lil' pocket n' holla'd, "Hagridz late. I suppose it was he whoz ass holla'd at you I'd be here, by tha way?"</p>
<p>"Yes," holla'd Pimp McGonagall. "And I don't suppose you goin to tell me why you here, of all places?"</p>
<p>"I've come ta brang Harry ta his thugged-out aunt n' uncle. They're tha only crew he has left now, nahmeean?"</p>
<p>"Yo ass don't mean -- you can't mean tha playas whoz ass live here?" cried Pimp McGonagall, jumpin ta her feet n' pointin at number four. Shiiit, dis aint no joke. "Dumbledore -- you can't. I been watchin dem all day. It make me wanna hollar playa! Yo ass couldn't find two playas whoz ass is less like our asses fo' realz. And they've gots dis lil hustla -- I saw his ass kickin his crazy-ass mutha all tha way up tha street, beatboxin fo' dopes yo. Harry Potta come n' live here!"</p>
<p>"It aint nuthin but tha dopest place fo' him," holla'd Dumbledore firmly. "His aunt n' uncle is ghon be able ta explain every last muthafuckin thang ta his ass when he olda n' shit. Ya Momma shoulda told ya, I freestyled dem a letter."</p>
<p>"A letter?" repeated Pimp McGonagall faintly, chillin back down on tha wall. "Really, Dumbledore, you be thinkin you can explain all dis up in a letter, biatch? These playas aint NEVER gonna KNOW him! Dude bout ta be hyped -- a legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if todizzle was known as Harry Potta dizzle up in tha future -- there is ghon be books freestyled bout Harry -- every last muthafuckin lil pimp up in our ghetto will know his name!"</p>
<p>"Exactly," holla'd Dumbledore, lookin straight-up seriously over tha top of his half-moon glasses. "It would be enough ta turn any boyz head. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Hyped before his schmoooove ass can strutt n' talk! Hyped fo' suttin' da thug won't even remember playa! Can you peep how tha fuck much betta off he'll be, growin up away from all dat until he locked n loaded ta take it?"</p>
<p>Pimp McGonagall opened her grill, chizzled her mind, swallowed, n' then holla'd, "Yes yes y'all, -- fo'sho, you right, of course. But how tha fuck is tha pimp gettin here, Dumbledore?" Biatch eyed his cloak suddenly as though dat dunkadelic hoe thought he might be hidin Harry underneath dat shit.</p>
<p>"Hagridz brangin his muthafuckin ass."</p>
<p>"Yo ass be thinkin it -- wise -- ta trust Hagrid wit suttin' as blingin as this?"</p>
<p>I would trust Hagrid wit mah game," holla'd Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"I aint sayin his thugged-out ass aint up in tha right place," holla'd Pimp McGonagall grudgingly, "but you can't pretend he not careless yo. Dude do tend ta -- what tha fuck was that?"</p>
<p>A low rumblin sound had fucked up tha silence round dem wild-ass muthafuckas. Well shiiiit, it grew steadily louder as they looked up n' down tha street fo' some sign of a headlight; it swelled ta a roar as they both looked up all up in tha sky -- n' a big-ass motorcycle fell tha fuck outta tha air n' landed on tha road up in front of dem wild-ass muthafuckas.</p>
<p>If tha motorcycle was huge, dat shiznit was not a god damn thang ta tha playa chillin astride it yo. Dude was almost twice as tall as an aiiight playa n' at least five times as wide yo. Dude looked simply too big-ass ta be allowed, n' so wild - long tanglez of bushy black afro n' beard hid most of his wild lil' face, dat schmoooove muthafucka had handz tha size of trash can lids, n' his wild lil' feet up in they leather boots was like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms da thug was holdin a funky-ass bundle of blankets.</p>
<p>"Hagrid," holla'd Dumbledore, soundin relieved. "At last fo' realz. And where did you git dat motorcycle?"</p>
<p>"Borrowed it, Pimp Dumbledore, sir," holla'd tha giant, climbin carefully off tha motorcycle as da perved-out muthafucka spoke. "Young Sirius Black lent it ta mah dirty ass. Ya Mom shoulda told ya, I gots him, sir."</p>
<p>"No problems, was there?"</p>
<p>"Fuck dat shit, sir -- doggy den was almost fucked wit yo, but I gots his ass up all right before tha Mugglez started swarmin' around. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Dude fell tha fuck asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol."</p>
<p>Dumbledore n' Pimp McGonagall bent forward over tha bundle of blankets, n' you can put dat on yo' toast. Inside, just visible, was a funky-ass baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black afro over his wild lil' forehead they could peep a cold-ass lil curiously shaped cut, like a funky-ass bolt of lightning.</p>
<p>"Is dat where -?" whispered Pimp McGonagall.</p>
<p>"Yes," holla'd Dumbledore. "Dude bout ta have dat scar alllll muthafuckin day."</p>
<p>"Couldn't you do suttin' bout it, Dumbledore?"</p>
<p>"Even if I could, I wouldn't. Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. Scars can come up in handy. I have one mah dirty ass above mah left knee dat be a slick map of tha London Underground. Well -- give his ass here, Hagrid -- we'd betta git dis over with."</p>
<p>Dumbledore took Harry up in his thugged-out arms n' turned toward tha Dursleys' house.</p>
<p>"Could I -- could I say good-bye ta him, sir?" axed Hagrid. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Dude bent his wild lil' freakadelic pimped out, shaggy head over Harry n' gave his ass what tha fuck must done been a straight-up scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let up a howl like a wounded dog.</p>
<p>"Shhh!" hissed Pimp McGonagall, "yo dirty ass is gonna wake tha Mugglez -"</p>
<p>"S-s-sorry," sobbed Hagrid, takin up a large, spotted handkerchizzle n' buryin his wild lil' grill up in dat shit. "But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lil' Willy an' Jizzy dead -- an' skanky lil Harry off ta live wit Mugglez -"</p>
<p>"Yes, fo'sho, itz all straight-up fucked up yo, but git a grip on yo ass, Hagrid, or we'll be found," Pimp McGonagall whispered, pattin Hagrid gingerly on tha arm as Dumbledore stepped over tha low garden wall n' strutted ta tha front door yo. Dude laid Harry gently on tha stoop, took a letta outta his cloak, tucked it inside Harryz blankets, n' then came back ta tha other two. For a gangbangin' full minute tha three of dem stood n' looked all up in tha lil bundle; Hagridz shouldaz shook, Pimp McGonagall blinked furiously, n' tha twinklin light dat probably shone from Dumbledorez eyes seemed ta have gone out.</p>
<p>"Well," holla'd Dumbledore finally, "thatz dis shit. We've no bidnizz stayin here, so peek-a-boo, clear tha way, I be comin' thru fo'sho. We may as well go n' join tha celebrations."</p>
<p>"Yeah," holla'd Hagrid up in a straight-up muffled voice, "I be bout ta be takin' Sirius his bike back. G'night, Pimp McGonagall -- Pimp Dumbledore, sir."</p>
<p>Wipin his streamin eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung his dirty ass onto tha motorcycle n' kicked tha engine tha fuck into game; wit a roar it rose tha fuck into tha air n' off tha fuck into tha night.</p>
<p>"I shall peep you soon, I expect, Pimp McGonagall," holla'd Dumbledore, noddin ta her n' shit. Pimp McGonagall blew her nozzle up in reply.</p>
<p>Dumbledore turned n' strutted back down tha street. On tha corner da perved-out muthafucka stopped n' took up tha silver Put-Outer n' shiznit yo. Dude clicked it once, n' twelve ballz of light sped back ta they street lamps so dat Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange n' his schmoooove ass could make up a tabby pussaaaaay slinkin round tha corner all up in tha other end of tha street yo. Dude could just peep tha bundle of blankets on tha step of number four.</p>
<p>"Dope luck, Harry," he murmured. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Dude turned on his heel n' wit a swish of his cloak, da thug was gone.</p>
<p>A breeze ruffled tha neat hedgez of Privet Drive, which lay silent n' tidy under tha inky sky, tha straight-up last place you would expect astonishin thangs ta happen. Harry Potta rolled over inside his blankets without wakin up. One lil' small-ass hand closed on tha letta beside his ass n' da muthafucka slept on, not knowin da thug was special, not knowin da thug was famous, not knowin da thug would be woken up in all dem hours' time by Mrs. Dursleyz scream as she opened tha front door ta put out tha gin n juice bottles, nor dat da thug would spend tha next few weeks bein prodded n' pinched by his cousin Dudley.. yo. Dude couldn't know dat at dis straight-up moment, playas meetin up in secret all over tha ghetto was holdin up they glasses n' sayin up in hushed voices: "To Harry Potta -- tha pimp who lived!"</p>
