Even without access to the man’s memories, the raw magical energy coming from him was a dead giveaway.</p><p>‘Um, sorry to intrude, but could you please make a decision already?’ the hat hesitated; it would be rude to deny the request of such a man but …</p><p>‘I can’t,’ it felt the disbelief and continued, ‘the one defining characteristic you have is magic, you are born and bred of it, and there is no house that caters to that.’</p><p>‘So once again my “destiny” keeps me from living a normal life? I cannot even attend a school properly I’m so strange?’ the voice was polite on the surface, but underneath it sounded irritated and tired.</p><p>‘I’m afraid so, your magic is just too strong for any of the normal houses characteristics to have much sway on the decision.’</p><p>‘So what do I do?’</p><p>‘I don’t know,’ the hat said softly.</p><p>The school was very surprised with the length of time the hat took to sort the boy, Emrys, into a house; rumour was that he had broken the record for the longest sorting. Eventually the hat seemed to make a decision. ‘GRYFFINDOR!’ he shouted.</p><p>No one would ever know that Merlin had chosen that house purely because he liked the colours, they reminded him of home.</p>
