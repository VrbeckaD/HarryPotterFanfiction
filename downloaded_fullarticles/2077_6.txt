  <i>Late September, 1992</i>
</p><p>Severus Snape was patrolling the hallways long after curfew when he heard the muffled whimper.</p><p>His skin prickled, and the scent hit him next. <i>Omega,</i> his nose told him, and then, <i>Child. Distressed child.</i></p><p>The child in question was in false heat, by the smell of it—a simulation of estrus without eggs being released that omegas experienced during early puberty. From what Severus understood, it could be very painful, with all the cramping of heat but none of the sexual aspects, including the ability to find release or satisfaction.</p><p>Omegas weren’t rare, but their parents usually chose to homeschool them until they were old enough to find mates. There was only one omega in the student population at present—and she was years past puberty.</p><p>So who was this?</p><p>He turned the corner and came to an abrupt stop, seeing a pale face and a very familiar head of unruly black curls.</p><p>Potter. Why did it always have to be Potter?</p><p>The boy was sitting in a dark alcove with his legs drawn up and his head bowed against his knees. A gray cloak that Severus recognized with a frisson of outrage was tied around his shoulders, but it had fallen open. His eyes were squeezed shut, his breathing ragged, the cuticles of his thumbs ripped and bleeding from where his fingernails had dug in.</p><p>Severus inhaled and exhaled, trying to decide how best to proceed. The arrogant little whelp was breaking curfew again. He had no respect for rules or authority, just like his father.</p><p>But he was also in considerable pain.</p><p>He hadn’t yet noticed Severus approaching. “Potter,” the professor said in a tone of warning.</p><p>To the boy’s credit, he snapped his wand into his hand faster than most adults Severus had dueled.</p><p>Severus doubted he was capable of sounding comforting at the moment, so he attempted a neutral tone. “Put that away. I’m not going to harm you.” </p><p>“Snape.” The boy glanced into the darkness surrounding them quickly, though whether looking for allies or simply as a reflex, Severus didn’t know. His voice was low, strained. “Something’s happening to me.”</p><p>“You’re an omega.”</p><p>Potter gave no sign of recognizing the word.</p><p>“You will be able to bear children,” Severus clarified.</p><p>Potter inhaled audibly, and his forehead wrinkled in confusion. “I’ll get pregnant? But…I’m a boy.”</p><p>“Nevertheless.”</p><p>Potter continued to stare up at him through those absurd glasses, looking confused and suspicious and so damn young.</p><p>“It means that you will have certain instincts that will attempt to direct your actions. You will need to learn to recognize them for what they are and make your peace with them. Ignoring them entirely would be fruitless—but giving in to them without a struggle would make you less than yourself.”</p><p>“I don’t understand.”</p><p>Of course he didn’t. Severus sneered slightly, then smoothed it over. Antagonizing Potter was at cross-purposes to what needed to happen right now. </p><p>“Can you walk?”</p><p>The little twit rose to his feet, then promptly swayed and started to double over in pain again.</p><p>He would have cracked his head against the stones if Severus hadn’t caught his arm in time. “It appears that you cannot,” Severus informed him curtly. “I’m going to carry you to the infirmary.”</p><p>“What? No!” The boy wrested his arm away and backed up, running into the wall. He looked like he wanted to draw his wand again, but also like he was seconds away from fainting.</p><p>Severus’s patience was fraying. “Would you rather be levitated?”</p><p>Potter bristled and glared some more, but eventually raised his arms slightly and allowed himself to be hoisted up.</p><p>Severus frowned. The brat was far too light for his age.</p><p>He shook himself and considered his next move. Potter’s nutrition was something to investigate at another time.</p><p>It was unlikely that they’d wander into anyone else at this time of night, but every portrait had eyes—and he suspected that Albus was going to say it was crucial to keep Potter’s newly discovered secondary gender a secret for as long as possible.</p><p>“I’m going to wrap this wretched garment around you,” he said, giving the edge of Potter’s—James Potter’s—invisibility cloak a tug. <i>And then I’m going to confiscate it</i>, he added to himself, feeling far less satisfaction at the prospect than he would have expected.</p><p>“All right,” the boy muttered. </p><p>The last thing Severus saw before he disappeared were Lily’s eyes, blinking up at him in mistrust.</p><p>Those eyes. It had been such a shock, seeing those eyes for the first time.</p><p>It was imperative that he keep Potter safe—in Lily’s memory, if not for Albus’s schemes and whatever that fucking Prophecy had meant. </p><p>As Severus made his way down the corridor, his thoughts continued to churn. There was already far too much resting on the boy’s fragile, troublemaking shoulders—and life would be incrementally harder on Potter because he was an omega. He was going to need potions—potions to suppress his heat, potions to make him blend in with the other students without alphas being able to tell his gender by smell, as Severus had just done.</p><p>Lost in his racing thoughts, it took Severus much too long to feel the brush of a nose against his neck, to realize that the invisible child in his arms was scenting him.</p><p>It tickled.</p><p>“Potter, cease that at once,” he said in a low murmur.</p><p>The scenting stopped. “Sorry,” came the reply, muffled because of the invisibility cloak’s hood. “I didn’t mean to—I don’t know why I—”</p><p>“Instincts,” Severus said shortly. Poppy would explain it to the boy in more detail. For his part, Severus would rather swallow rusty nails than explain alpha and omega dynamics to a twelve-year-old, the child of his long-ago best friend and most hated enemy. </p><p>Potter was silent, and Severus was grateful for it. </p><p>As they turned into the infirmary corridor, though, Severus felt a weight descend on his shoulder, the press of a high cheekbone and the feathery tickle of messy curls against his chin. </p><p>“Potter,” he muttered, giving the boy a small shake. But this time there was no response.</p><p>Having reached their destination, Severus pushed through the door of the infirmary and was already groping to tug the cloak off the child.</p><p>It took very little time for a sleep-rumpled Poppy Pomfrey to appear, slippers on her feet and her nightcap askew. “Severus?” she wondered, her voice tight with worry. Severus sympathized: nothing good came from being woken in the middle of the night. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“It’s Potter,” Severus explained tersely. “He’s going into pre-estrus.”</p><p>The matron blinked once, then looked around in confusion. “Where—”</p><p>Severus had finally managed to find the tie that held the cloak in place. The garment shifted to the side, revealing his charge.</p><p>Mouth snapping closed, the infirmary matron blinked again—twice this time.</p><p>With his arms still looped around Severus’s neck and his nose buried in the crook of his professor’s throat, Potter had fallen fast asleep.</p>
