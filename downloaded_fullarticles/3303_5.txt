    <p>He came aware of himself through the pain in his ankle as his toes skidded and skipped over the rough-hewn stone of the dungeon hallway. His ankle and left forearm throbbed brightly with each bump, and Harry winced with the realization that the ankle was probably broken. He didn’t bother to lift his head- if he showed that he was awake, they may make him walk. Asleep, he was much less amusing, and regardless he had little chance of escaping. He recognized the feeling of iron bands around his wrist, knees, and chest as the <em>mobilicorpus</em> spell, which meant that at least one wizard had a wand trained on him, and he was unarmed.</p><p>His forward momentum stalled, and he heard a second wizard fumble with a band of keys, unlocking the door to his cell. The doors of the dungeon where enchanted to be impervious to magic (and THAT was a paradox that he had considered many times as he went slowly insane from lack of stimulation in the small cell), and as such locking and unlocking spells were useless. The door swung open, and Harry floated forward, wincing as his left toe caught on the stone sill and pulled painfully.</p><p>“Finite.” The spell holding Harry up broke, and Harry caught himself with the heel of his right hand as he collapsed forward, coming to rest roughly on his shoulder and hip on the ground. He groaned deep in his throat, the sound erupting into a rasping cough that shook his body and aggravated the left side of his rib cage, which held ribs that were either broken or bruised. A fresh flood of coppery blood rose between his teeth as he tensed his entire body against the pain, and he only moved again once the inclination to cough was firmly trapped in the back of his throat.  He swallowed down the blood grimly- no sense to lose the only liquid he had. When he glanced through the bars of the door, there was no sign of the wizards who had escorted him to his cell. It had been almost three weeks since he arrived at Malfoy Manor, and apparently he was old news. He determinedly did not think about what could be occupying their time now.</p><p>With a sigh, he carefully sat up and wiped his bloody hand on the ruin of his robes, carefully cradling what remained of his left forearm to his chest to protect it, and then began the painful process of inching his way across his cell one-handed to the least wet and drafty corner. Scraped into the rough stone of the wall were several sets of tick marks from the different people who had been trapped in this pit. He pushed the oily, dirty mess of hair back from his eyes and took a moment to trace the marks with a finger, and then lifted the loose stone at the base of the wall and chipped a line at the end of his own marks. Twenty one days. He went back and counted, a chill coming over him that had little to do with the stone-cold of the dungeon. Twenty one days since his capture put tonight at the night of the new moon, where no moon would be visible in the night sky. Tonight was the night. Hermione had been clear. If they absolutely had to use their last ditch effort, it had to be on the night of the new moon. She had made him promise that he would only do it if it were the only option. He smiled briefly, his dry lips cracking open and spilling more blood onto his tongue.</p><p>“I promised, Hermione.” He whispered, looking up at the ceiling of his cell. “But now I have to do it. If this is the cost to protect everyone from Voldemort, if this is the best way, then why wouldn’t I do this now?”</p><p>He stared for a moment, almost expecting a whisper to come back, a response, something telling him that he didn’t have to do this. But nothing came.</p><p>He took as deep a breath as he could with the pain in his ribs, settled himself into the most comfortable position he could, and closed his eyes. The pit in his stomach slowly hardened from fear into resolve. If this was the last night, then he better make it count. He let their faces play through his mind, and let the resolve grow to fill his entire body. His mother, Lily, what he could remember of her voice, and that green flash. His father, James Potter. Sirius, how he looked right before he went through the veil. Myrtle, and all that she could have done if she had survived that night. Hagrid’s broken wand, and Cedric's funeral, which was at least as much Voldemort's fault as it was his own. Dumbledore's death flashed before his eyes, the memory still a raw wound. And beyond the personal, beyond the faces he knew, to all the people who had died in the first war and all the people who could die in the second. He whispered under his breath “Purgate inflagare.”</p><p>He brought his friends to mind, Hermione with her thirst for knowledge and her aggressive mothering, making sure that all her friends were taken care of. Ron, with his sheepish grin and brilliant mind for strategy, and all the times they stood with him. Ron’s family, so eager and willing to take him in, and all his classmates, who deserved a world free of Voldemort and the shadow he cast over the world. He imagined his resolve growing into a shield to protect those he loved, and all of wizardkind with them. “Purgate inflagare.” He murmured again.</p><p>He took another deep breath, the pain in his body fading, and focused on Voldemort. Hermione had been very clear on this part. “You have to focus your thoughts on Voldemort, but you can’t feel any negative feelings, at all. You have to be pure, to accept him for who he is, and show the magic that in your purity, you are striking him down. You can’t do it out of hate, or revenge, or even dislike. You have to do it with love.”</p><p>He thought of the pensieve memories that Dumbledore had shared with him, the images of little Tom Riddle as a child being abused and bullied. He thought of him lying in bed at night, wondering who his mother was and why his father abandoned him, and he thought of a young orphan discovering his power and clutching it as the one thing that set him apart, the one thing that made him different and special, and he allowed the little spark of kinship that he felt for Voldemort to grow and blossom. He felt the spell grow and shift with new intent, the shield turning to focus on Voldemort. “Purgate inflagare.” He said, his voice growing louder.</p><p>He thought of himself and what he was doing. Who he was, and what he could be. He thought of being an auror, or possibly a curse breaker like Bill. He thought of marrying Ginny, and of little red-headed, green eyed children. He thought of flying on his broom above the Quidditch pitch while the golden snitch darted in front of him, and he thought of sharing one last embrace with Hermione and Ron, and with a deep breath he let it go. He didn’t allow it to weigh down his heart, and he didn’t allow himself to mourn for what could be. Instead, he opened his eyes, staring through stone and across distance to where he knew Voldemort was, pacing the stone floor in front of a sumptuously appointed bed that hadn’t been slept it, and he imagined lighting his future on fire.</p><p>“Purgate INFLAGARE!” He shouted, and his will burst into flame.</p><p>He felt it take root in the core of his magic and spread out amongst his veins, bubbling under his skin with scorching heat. He threw his head back and screamed, tears squeezing from his eyes, only to instantly evaporate in the heat of his magic.  As his eyes squinted in the smoke and heat, he saw through the stone and across the distance that Voldemort, too, had sunk to the floor, his mouth open in a scream, fire growing from the beds of his fingernails and the corners of his eyes. Even further away, Harry saw the remaining horcruxes burst into flame as well. He had a moment for one last smile for Hermione, the brightest witch of her age, who had figured out how to stop this war, and then his world became flame and sacrifice, and he allowed the love and protection that he had summoned to engulf his soul as the magical flames roared up around Voldemort and began to eat away at Malfoy Manor.</p><p>.xOx.</p><p> Hermione wiped sweating palms on the sides of her robe as they approached the site of the conflagration. The fire had finally burnt out after three days, and now this great stone hulk was all that remained of Malfoy Manor. Areas of the stone were unnaturally smooth or cracked from where the fire had grown hot enough to melt it, and the greenery for almost 100 yards surrounding the wreck was wilted and brown from the excessive heat. She felt tears rising in the back of her throat, and her eyes felt hot and sore. Ron stepped up next to her, his broad shoulder brushing against hers. They stood for several minutes, just gazing at the last place that Harry was alive.</p><p>“We don’t have to be here, you know.” He offered, his own voice rough and low. “There isn’t much we can even do- we’re just two sixth year students who were about to go on a quest for Horcruxes. This place is crawling with Unspeakables and Aurors.”</p><p>Hermione nodded, waiting a moment before replying. When she spoke, her voice only wavered slightly. “I owe it to Harry.” She stopped for a moment. “He used the spell I found. The Wizard’s Last Strike, do you remember?” She looked at Ron. “If I hadn’t taught him that spell...” Her eyes filled with tears. Ron swung around and gripped her by the shoulders. “No, Hermione.” He said. “You gave him the means to save everyone.” He said. “He chose to use the spell. And remember what you told us about it? It couldn’t even be used if the caster had any doubt at all. Harry was completely willing to sacrifice himself for us, and that was his choice.”</p><p>Hermione nodded miserably, and hid her face in Ron’s shoulder for a moment before clearing her throat and raising her head, surreptitiously dashing away tears with the sleeve of her robe. She turned and marched forward into the ruins, pausing at the entryway. All the wood of the building had burnt away in the fire, all the precious metals boiled away. The ceilings had caved in and great slabs of stone had fallen in the heat, and so the great stone ruin was open to the sky above. Ashwinders coiled and hissed in hallways and under the stone slabs, their trails of ash indistinguishable from the general ash and debris from the fire. Hermione kept walking, striding through the ruin and past the different ministry employees. Ron hurried to keep up with her, not bothering to ask what she was looking for. He felt the same grief as she did, the hope that if they just looked under one more slab or around one more corner that Harry would come rushing out, glasses crooked and hair wild as he grinned and waved at them to wait up. He coughed to dislodge the lump rising in his throat.</p><p>The bright morning sunlight left no shadows, and no matter where they looked, all that was left was ashes and stone. Hermione kept moving quicker and quicker until she was running headlong down the hallways, ash puffing up with each step, and Ron sprinted after her, keeping the distraught girl in sight. An elderly auror moved to stop them, but a nearby Order of the Phoenix member stopped him, whispering in his ear, and he stepped aside to let them pass.</p><p>Hermione ran until her tears and the ash combined to choke her, and she collapsed, coughing and crying. Ron panted up next to her and sat down, wrapping the witch in his arms.</p><p>This was how Kingsley found them, occupied by their grief and huddled in the ashes. He sat slowly on the nearby slab, waiting for them to come up out of their shared grief. Hermione looked up, wiping tears away with her sleeves, and only succeeding in smearing ash all over her face.</p><p>Kingsley spoke slowly, removing a leather bag from his coat. “According to legend, when a person makes a great sacrifice for the good of others, that act of goodness calls to magic. And in return, magic creates a being of purity and magic." He opened the top of the sack and lifted out a bright reddish-orange egg that glowed from within. The surface roiled and twisted, somewhere between the flickering of a coal and the leaping of a fire. “The Unspeakables think that this is Phoenix egg, created by Harry’s decision to sacrifice himself for us. They wanted to study it, but I think that nobody deserves to look after it so much as you.”</p><p>He reached down and placed the egg into Hermione’s hands, then stood and walked away. Hermione clasped the egg to her chest. It radiated a soothing warmth that somehow eased the ache of grief inside her heart. Ron reached over and laid a hand on the egg as well, and they shared a tremulous smile.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
