          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry was honestly surprised at Hermione. It wasn't like her to suddenly decide to make a trip to Muggle London. Nonetheless, he had agreed when she asked him.</p>
<p>She walked into the small, cramped shop that was tucked away in the little alley. Harry sighed and followed her inside.</p>
<p>A ringing sound greeted him as he opened the door, and he realised it had come from one of the old fashioned bells that hung above the door.</p>
<p>He found it was an antique shop, filled to the hilt with curios from all ages and places.</p>
<p>"Why are we here again?" he whispered to Hermione. The store reminded him a bit of his cupboard under the stairs, and he decided he didn't want to stay any longer than he needed to.</p>
<p>"To buy a gift, of course! Luna's birthday is next week, and I know she is looking for a very specific book."</p>
<p>Ah, Harry thought. A book. That made a bit more sense.</p>
<p>"And you think we'll find it here?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure. I wanted to try all the same," Hermione replied.</p>
<p>An old man waddled up to the dusty counter, his wooden cane knocking against the floor as he did so. On seeing Harry and Hermione, he smiled widely.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Mr Potter, Ms Granger."</p>
<p>Hermione frowned.</p>
<p>"How do you know who we are?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I know many things, young lady, though I do not have magic like you," came the response, accompanied by a subtle smile.</p>
<p>Hermione decided to not press it further, choosing to keep quiet as the old man continued. Harry could see Hermione was still a bit suspicious.</p>
<p>"I know, for example, what you are here for." His eyes twinkled in a way that reminded Harry of Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"Do you have it then? Professor Vondek's journal?" Hermione inquired, expression changing from suspicion to eagerness.</p>
<p>The shopkeeper nodded, and began to rummage in the shelves behind him, revealing a few magical objects that were hidden behind the Muggle antiques. He placed a few of the items on the counter, among them a sparkling necklace. Hermione gasped, realising she'd read about it before. Unable to control her curiosity, she touched the stone at the centre of the piece. It let out a bright silver light that morphed into the shape of a small otter, but the little creature disappeared a fraction of a second later.</p>
<p>"Did you see it? It was brilliant!" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Harry was still a bit dazed, but he nodded.</p>
<p>"Was that your Patronus?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. It's supposed to reveal your Patronus once you touch it. There's only one of these left in the world, I believe. The charm must be wearing off. The ppatronus is supposed to last longer."</p>
<p>Harry had to admit, it was quite interesting. He was just going to ask about the oddly-shaped seashell on the counter, when the old man put down a large book in front of him with a loud thump.</p>
<p>Hermione was practically glowing with excitement as she flipped through the pages, pausing every so often to look at the beautifully intricate illustrations.</p>
<p>"I didn't know half of these creatures even existed!"</p>
<p>Harry simply smiled in response.</p>
<p>Once they had paid and wrapped the book in some paper, they headed back out into the alleyway.</p>
<p>Harry noticed Hermione was cradling the book like a little child, looking at it with adoring eyes. He sighed.</p>
<p>"Are you sure you want to gift it to Luna? If you want to keep it, we can always get her another gift..." he began.</p>
<p>Hermione shook her head resolutely.</p>
<p>"She's wanted this for a long time."</p>
<p>"Alright," Harry said, not sounding entirely convinced.</p>
<p>"But," Hermione added, after a long pause.</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"We're going back to that shop tomorrow."</p>
<p>Harry smiled.</p></div>
