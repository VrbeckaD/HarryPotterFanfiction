  <strong>:  This story could be canon, but canon doesn’t say much about Abraxas Malfoy, either when he died except that it was before 1996 or anything about his wife.  In this story, Lucius is thirteen, and Abraxas as well as Lucius’s unnamed mother is still alive.  I have created the heir ritual for this story.  I have rated this story teen because thirteen-year-old Lucius is permitted, under the supervision of his parents, to drink a glass of wine.  I am not encouraging underage drinking or the breaking of the law.</strong>
</p>
<p>            It was the summer of his thirteenth year.  Lucius Malfoy, home from Hogwarts, was preparing to join his father and mother for the evening meal.  It was a formal affair, as always, but today, Abraxas had left orders with the house elves that Lucius was to wear his formal robes, the set of robes reserved for only the most ceremonial occasions.  Lucius, as befitting a pureblood heir, showed his surprise by merely raising a pale eyebrow and taking even greater care with his dressing than usual.  Neither of his parents were people to be cajoled, and he was far too old to wheedle them in a quest to satisfy his childish curiosity.  He would know in their good time, not his own, what the occasion was.</p>
<p>            A house elf escorted him to the dining room and announced his presence.  Upon being seated, Lucius noticed a marked change.  His crystal wine glass, which had held sparkling fruit juice from the time that he had been old enough to take his place at the family table, was now filled with what he immediately realized was the same wine that his parents drank. </p>
<p>            Lucius looked up and politely caught his father’s eye.  Abraxas nodded.</p>
<p>            “My son, today you shall take up one of the most visible signs of your manhood and your family line, and as a sign of your new maturity, you shall now join us in having wine at supper.”  Of course, he did not smile, but the grey eyes softened minutely.  “Sip it carefully and slowly, as you have seen your mother and I do.  It can be overwhelming for one who has never imbibed before.”</p>
<p>            “I understand, Father.  I am honored.  Thank you,” Lucius said gravely.  Manners had been ingrained in him from the cradle on.  Of course, it was also a given that no Malfoy would be so uncouth as to gulp their wine.</p>
<p>            They touched glasses, Abraxas allowing Lucius to offer the toast for the first time, and settled down to their meal.  Lucius noticed that all his favorite foods were on the menu, even the strawberry tart that his parents did not care for since they thought it too sweet.  As always, Lucius did not speak as he ate while his parents discussed inconsequential matters.  Pureblood children knew that they were meant to be seen and not heard.</p>
<p>            However, Lucius was startled when Abraxas directed a question at him.  His father had left several documents in his room for him to read the previous night, documents dealing with a bill that was being discussed in the Wizengamot.  Lucius had dutifully read them and made sure that he was prepared to report on the contents of them.  It was understood that, on the occasions that his father provided reading materials, Lucius must immediately render himself ready to be examined as though they were material for school.  What Lucius had never expected was the question that his father asked him.</p>
<p>            “Lucius, what is your opinion of the bill under consideration?  Do you believe it would advance our pureblood interests or hinder them?”  Abraxas’s face was blank, but Lucius noted just the slightest gleam of calculated interest flash in his father’s eyes before it was gone again.</p>
<p>            Lucius calmed his breathing, recalled his pureblood training, and did his best to offer a coherent answer.</p>
<p>            “I think it goes without saying, Father, that any bill restricting the employment of those of lesser status would serve to advance our interests.  However, restricting employment opportunities too much might result in a shortage of workers for menial tasks.  We must remember that not all businesses and establishments have the means to acquire house elves, and there are occasionally tasks that the elves are unsuited for,” Lucius said.  He dropped his eyes to his plate immediately, properly demurring to his father and resisting the urge to watch for signs of approval on his father’s aristocratic visage.</p>
<p>            For a moment, there was silence.  Lucius was beginning to think that Abraxas had found his answer unsatisfactory, in which case his punishment would be swift. </p>
<p>            “Lucius, look at me.”  Lucius looked up, meeting his father’s eyes.  He almost bit his lip to keep from smiling because the look in Abraxas’s eyes was approving.  Lucius carefully let out the breath that he had been holding, making certain that he did not mar his perfect pureblood mask with evidence of his former anxiety.</p>
<p>            “That was very well done, my son.  That is exactly what I would expect you to say as my sole heir and a credit to the Malfoy family.”  Lord and Lady Malfoy stood, and Lucius stood as well, following his parents into the parlor.  Abraxas gestured to his son to stand in front of him as his mother retrieved a black velvet box from a hidden compartment in the wall.  When she placed it in his hand, Abraxas did not waste time.</p>
<p>            “Kneel, my son.  Kneel and receive my blessing and this token of your familial line,” he commanded. </p>
<p>            With supreme self-possession, Lucius gathered his robes and knelt at his father’s feet.  For one of those very rare times, Abraxas reached out and took his son’s head in his hands.  His father’s hands were smooth, the hands of an aristocrat who had never known manual labor.  They were soft and cool upon his skin, and Lucius secretly treasured his father’s rare touch as he waited for the ritual words.</p>
<p>            “Upon my life and upon my magic, I do recognize you, Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, my son by blood, as the sole heir to the Malfoy family line and all attendant lineages and inheritances thereof.  As I have sworn it, so mote it be,” Abraxas intoned.</p>
<p>            “So mote it be,” echoed Lucius and his mother, and Lucius repressed a shudder as the magic of his father’s blessing, patriarch to heir, enveloped him.</p>
<p>            As Lucius recovered himself, Abraxas opened the box and removed the Malfoy heir ring.  It gleamed in the light as Abraxas took his son’s right hand and slid the ring onto his son’s ring finger.  There was no need for a resizing charm.  It fit perfectly.</p>
<p>            “Receive this ring, Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, and wear it as a token of your familial obligation and your position as my only son and heir.  Let it be to you a remembrance of this day, and let it serve as a constant reminder that you stand as a representative of the Malfoy family.  Let nothing besmirch the name of Malfoy!”</p>
<p>            Abraxas took Lucius’s hands and pulled him to his feet.  For several moments, they stared at each other.  It was the longest time that Lucius had ever been allowed to look his father in the eye since he had been a small child.  Pureblood children learned early on that one must show proper deference to one’s parents.</p>
<p>            And then, Abraxas smiled at Lucius. </p>
<p>            It was brief and fleeting, but Lucius felt for a moment that his heart might fly from his chest.  The last time his father had smiled at him, he had been a toddler successfully managing his first solo flight on a training broom.  But Abraxas was smiling at him now.</p>
<p>            Lucius tasted the wine on his tongue, felt the ring on his finger, and smiled back. </p></div>
