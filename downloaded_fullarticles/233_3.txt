    <p>The compartment door slid open after a quiet knock and no answer. A tiny head peeks into the compartment, curious and cautious. Little eyes see a young girl, working diligently and single-mindedly at the thing in her hand. There are fabrics and spools of thread all around her, pieces of fluff thrown about, and a small collection of tiny dolls and stuffed animals on the seat across from her. No one else was in there with her. </p><p>The little eyes stare, captivated by the movements of her hands, of watching the needle and thread dance in her palm, in and out and around the fabric she holds. He stares, fixated and trapped where he was, unable to look away. </p><p>She completes her task, sighing as she does so. She moves to get started on the next piece of her self-imposed puzzle, and sees the little eyes, the little jewel colored eyes, staring at her from the door. She tilts her head, stares with her own jewel colored eyes for a moment, and smiles softly. </p><p>The owner of the little eyes jolts, he’s been caught. He starts to lower his eyes and close the door, cause there is no way the pretty girl will welcome him. She seemed much older than him, and starring little boys are creepy and unwanted. His Aunt said so. </p><p>(But his Aunt had been wrong before, hadn’t she?)</p><p>“You can come in, if you want.” The girl almost whispered her words, her voice soft and gentle like the wind. It stops the boy in his tracks, captivated once more. “You can stay too, if you don’t mind me crafting for most of the train ride.” He looks back up, and finds her pretty face smiling gently and invitingly at him. His jeweled eyes looked into her own, cautious but longing. </p><p>“Would-“ He paused, not liking how scratchy his voice was compared to her’s. So he lowered his voice, and began to speak slowly. “Would you mind helping me get my trunk up? Or me asking you questions about Hogwarts?” He looked at her hopefully. </p><p>She smiled, and stood. “I wouldn’t mind helping you or answering your questions.” She beckoned him in, and he opened the compartment more and began to drag his trunk in. “Just keep in mind, that I won’t have the answer for everything. But I’ll try my best to answer them truthfully and without bias unless you ask for my opinion.” </p><p>The boy froze. </p><p>(The train started moving.)</p><p>He was in shock, and it showed on his face, in his eyes. The girl continued to put his trunk away, ignoring his shock and continuing with her task. When done, the boy had recovered from his shock and was staring at her with a piercing and … look on his face. The girl smiled again, and motioned for him to sit with her completed dolls and stuffed animals. </p><p>The boy stared at them for a bit, then began to rearrange them. He moved the dolls closer to the door, then the stuffed animals, to make room for himself by the window. </p><p>The girl had sat back down in her seat, with just a short pile of fabric between her and the window. “Do you know your first question?”</p><p>The boy stared at her from his seat, contemplative. “How many years have you been at Hogwarts?”</p><p>“Just the one.”</p><p>His head tilted, curious. “Just the one? So, you're a second year?”</p><p>“Yes, I am.” She continued her sewing. </p><p>“Would you tell me about the Houses? Like, how they get along with each other, and… what their common traits are?” </p><p>She looked up at him. He was on the edge of his seat. </p><p>(She had said that she would be as unbiased as possible. That she would only give her opinion if it was asked for.)</p><p>(He had not asked for her opinion. This was a test.)</p><p>(Will she keep her word?)</p><p>She smirked, amused, eyeing the boy across from her. He smirked back, eyes challenging and excited, wanting, longing. </p><p>“Hmm. Well, as you might know, there are four Houses. Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Slytherin, and Gryffindor. The badger, the eagle, the snake, and the lion. The clan, the flock, the den, and the pride.</p><p>“Hufflepuff is the house of the badgers, the clan. The house colors are yellow, for wheat, and black, for soil. Students from this house are known for valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members. It was founded by Helga Hufflepuff, one of the four founders of Hogwarts. It is said that when the founders were discussing what types of students would go to their house, Lady Hufflepuff had said that she would “take the lot”. This makes Hufflepuff the most inclusive, tolerant, and accepting of the houses. </p><p>“Ravenclaw is the house of the eagles, the flock. The house colors are blue, for the sky, and bronze, for eagle feathers. Students from this house are known for their wit, intelligence, wisdom, and learning capabilities. It was founded by Rowena Ravenclaw, the most academically inclined of the Hogwarts founders. As such, this makes Ravenclaw the most academically inclined house of the four, where all the students there are academically motivated and/or talented in some way.</p><p>“Slytherin is the house of the snakes, the den. The house colors are green and silver, and there are no clear-cut symbolizations behind them though there are a lot of theories. It’s founder was Salazar Slytherin, the Hogwarts founder who is said to have ordered the sorting hat to place students with certain characteristics into his house. Those characteristics included cunning, resourcefulness, ambition, and self-preservation. This is the most political house, as it is mostly comprised of Purebloods and has the lowest Muggleborn intake of all of houses.</p><p>“And lastly, Gryffindor is the house of the lions, the pride. The house colors are red and gold, but again, doesn’t have any clear-cut symbolism tied to it. It’s founder was Godric Gryffindor, the last founder, who is also said to have ordered the sorting hat to place students of certain characteristics into his house. In Lord Gryffindor’s case, he had wanted students who were courageous, brave, determined, and chivalrous to be in his house. This is the most athletically inclined house, and it's students are known for excelling more at practical school work than the theoretical side of things.”</p><p>The girl took a break, having to catch her breath. The boy stared at her with wide, bejeweled eyes that sparkled with… something that neither of them could identify. </p><p>(Several people had opened the compartment door during her explanation. Both of them had ignored them, and they had all gone away.)</p><p>(One of them was a red haired boy, who had only seen and heard the girl. He had closed the door immediately. After all, there was no way that the boy he was looking for would sit through a lecture from someone just a bit older than them.)</p><p>The boy was thinking, cataloguing everything the girl had said and comparing it with what he had heard others say. He formed questions in his mind that he wanted answered, that he wanted her opinion on. But he wasn’t going to interrupt her and miss something important, he could tell she wasn’t done yet. </p><p>(He had been oppressed his whole life. He had never been allowed to be smart before. No one had ever wanted to answer his questions before. He wasn’t going to let this chance pass him by.)</p><p>The girl looked to the boy who stared at her with wide, little eyes. Who was waiting oh so patiently for her to speak. She smiled, and continued. </p><p>(It felt nice to be listened to, to be heard, to be…)</p><p>“The relationships between the houses are both simple and complicated. What you must keep in mind is that children are cruel beings that learn from watching and experiences. While what I say is true for most, it won’t be true for all or for you. And that while some choose to act this way, not all do and may or may not be acting in this way in a bid to fit in with their house and not be bullied by their own housemates.”</p><p>She stared at the boy long and hard, until he nodded to her with his own serious look on his face. She nodded, and continued.</p><p>“Hufflepuff is the second easiest to explain. The students of this house are seen as the “duffers” of Hogwarts since there haven’t been many famous people to come from them. They are bullied by all the other houses and treated as deadwaits most of the time. As a consequence of this, Hufflepuffs have become extremely protective of each other and have no problem lying to professors or beating up bullies to protect their own. And as Hufflepuff is seen as the honest and most trustworthy house, most professors will believe them over everyone else and they will get away with it. It is both a curse and a blessing to be in this house, as you can always count on someone to try to bully you and on someone to try to protect you.</p><p>“In Ravenclaw, you can almost guarantee to be left alone by the other houses most of the time. Ravenclaws are mostly seen as bookworms and brainiacs by the rest of the houses, and are only sought out by them if they want notes or study tips. They are not as badly bullied by the other houses, but there is still some bullying from outside and inside of the house. Ravenclaws are the most solitary of the houses and you can not rely on them to have your back unless you have their complete loyalty. This counts for whether you are in their house or not, it doesn’t matter to them. They see each other as rivals academically more than family, like the Hufflepuffs or Slytherins do. </p><p>“And speaking of, Slytherins are neck and neck with the Hufflepuffs for being the most collectively bullied and for having the most solidarity between them. You will never see a Slytherin by themselves, they will always have at least two other people with them, no matter where they are. And just as Hufflepuff is seen as the most honest and trustworthy, Slytherins are seen as the most dishonest and untrustworthy house of Hogwarts, and all the other houses will be believed before them, no matter the evidence. Because of this, Slytherins have become defensive and cautious of all other houses. And while it's true that Slytherin is the most intolerant and traditional of the houses, they are also the ones that are the most discriminated against.</p><p>“And where Slytherin is the most traditional, Gryffindor is the most liberal of the houses. But both are just as intolerant. Gryffindor has the most unintentional and intentional bullies among the houses, and are the most favored of the houses. The others know this and stay away from most Gryffindors, you will hardly ever see one hanging out with someone from another house. Gryffindors also typically only interact with those from their own house and won’t venture out unless necessary. They will always believe themselves to be right until forcefully proven wrong. </p><p>“And yes, there is a Slytherin/Gryffindor rivalry. It is convoluted and unnecessary, and both sides go to the extremes to “win” and prove themselves superior to the other. It is exhausting to just watch.”</p><p>The girl sighed, seemingly exhausted from just thinking about it. The boy eyed her and sat back, contemplative. </p><p>They sat in silence for a few moments, contemplative and content.</p><p>(People had been by the door again, some had opened it, but they had all left eventually.)</p><p>The boy looked up at the girl from where he had been staring at his hands. He stared at the girl as she worked on the plushy in her hand. He just stared for a moment before speaking. </p><p>“Why does Hufflepuff’s and Ravenclaw’s colors have clear-cut symbolism and not Gryffindor’s or Slytherin’s? What are the theories behind their colors symbolism? What do you believe they are?”</p><p>The girl looked up at the boy with an appreciative gaze. </p><p>“The reason that Gryffindor’s and Slytherin’s colors don’t have clear symbolism, unlike Hufflepuff’s and Ravenclaws’s, is because the symbolism keeps changing and the history behind it has been corrupted by those I call “house politicians”. People who have tried and succeeded in using their house, and people’s preconceived notions of that house, to further their political career. These people will sometimes exclusively wear their house colors and put their own meanings behind them. This adds up to years of different people giving their house colors different symbolism to the point that the original symbolism becomes lost to time. This happens most often with Gryffindors and Slytherins, so Hufflepuff’s and Ravenclaw’s colors have kept their original symbolism.</p><p>“The theories behind the lion’s and the snake’s colors has a little to do with another theory. This theory says that each of the founders specialized in one elemental magic and that that is reflected in the colors that they chose for their houses. For Lady Hufflepuff, it was said that she had complete mastery over the earth and nature. So her colors were yellow and black for wheat and soil. For Lady Ravenclaw, it was said that she had excelled in wind or air magics. So her colors were blue and bronze for the sky and eagle feathers. For Lord Slytherin, it was said that he was a master potioneer and alchemist that excelled in all magics that even had the slightest to do with water. It is theorized that he chose green to symbolize the water of the Great Lake, and silver to symbolize liquid mercury or purity. For Lord Gryffindor, it was said that he was a master swordsman with complete master over fire. It is theorized that he chose red and gold to symbolize fire itself. </p><p>“I, personally, believe that the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw colors are accurate to history and appropriate for those houses. I also believe that Slytherins colors do symbolize water and purity. For Gryffindor’s colors, I’m not entirely sure. Red could have meant courage or nerve or fire, and gold could have meant chivalry or the sun. I could never know for sure.”</p><p>The boy looked intrigued and nodded with the girl’s explanation. He looked back to his hands and nodded to himself. He asked in a soft voice, not quite looking at the girl. </p><p>“What house do you belong to? Are you happy there? Do you wish you were placed elsewhere? Do you feel like you fit in there?”</p><p>The girl froze. </p><p>Then relaxed. And spoke.</p><p>“I’m in Ravenclaw. I wouldn’t say that I’m happy there, more so that I am content and satisfied. I don’t have many, or perhaps any, friends as I prefer long moments of silence and peace to work on my crafts and hone my skills. I do feel like I fit in there, as I am continuously learning and honing old and new skills. I was bullied for a time by my own housemates and some Slytherins, but I quickly learned how to defend myself and to retaliate with just enough force to scare them off.”</p><p>At this, the boy’s head looked up sharply at the girl. His jeweled eyes looked at her, searching her for something. She looked directly into his eyes, and he nodded. She continued.</p><p>“I will admit that I aimed to hurt and scare. I wanted them to leave me alone and to never mistake me as someone that they can take advantage of. I taught them to carefully choose where and who they bully, cause anytime after that I found them bullying someone else, I caused them pain. They should be prepared to take pain if they are prepared to deliver it. That is one of my philosophies.”</p><p>The boy stared at her with sparkling eyes, mouth agape. She smiled at him, and went back to sewing.</p><p>(He had never heard of such a thing, had never contemplated it. It was eye opening to hear someone say something like that. It was like something had clicked in his mind, like those words had just echoed throughout his body, like it had been ingrained into his mind and soul.)</p><p>They sat in silence again, the boy contemplative and the girl satisfied. The boy spoke soon enough though.</p><p>“Am I bothering you? Would you mind if I sought you out in Hogwarts? What house do you think I would fit into?”</p><p>The girl looked up at the boy with sparkling jeweled eyes, smiling softly. </p><p>“You don’t bother me, I find you presence to be quite soothing, actually. And I would love it if you sought me out in Hogwarts, if you don’t mind me taking the liberty to teach you some of my skills.”</p><p>The boy smiled and nodded his head rapidly. </p><p>(He was so, so happy that there was someone that didn't mind his presence. Who finds him soothing and not intrusive like others. He would do anything to keep that. Anything…)</p><p>The girl smiled and nodded.</p><p>“I think that you would do well in Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff. You are inquisitive and have wit. I also get the impression that you are extremely loyal and hardworking. I also believe that you could be placed in Slytherin, because I can see that calculative glint in your eye when I talked about the houses’ relationships with each other. I can see your cunning and self-preservation when I told you about the bullies and bullied. I also believe that all of your traits would be refined and strengthened within Slytherin, and that you would learn a lot more from the people within that house than you would in any other.”</p><p>The boy was staring at her in blank shock now, his mouth agape again. She smiled at him sadly, knowingly. His expression closed off and he looked away from her. Her eyes softened. </p><p>(He was in shock, because she had said the direct opposite to what everyone else had said to him since he entered this world. He was also scared, because she had seen straight through his mask, the facade that he’s perfected over years of practice.)</p><p>(Was he really so transparent?)</p><p>(Why was he so happy? So excited? So… elated?)</p><p>They sat in silence for what seemed like forever. The snake trolley came by, they had both bought some snakes for themselves, and it left. Others came by the door, and they left too. </p><p>(One of them was a frizzy haired girl looking for a toad. She had gotten an answer, been ignored, and left in a huff.)</p><p>(One of them was a pale blond boy with two lackies. He had been ignored. He had only seen the older girl.)</p><p>Finally, the boy seemed to come to a decision. He looked at the girl with hard, sparkling, determined eyes. The girl met those eyes head on with a warm smile and kind eyes. Then the boy spoke.</p><p>“My name is Harry Potter. Do you believe that I will become what is best for myself if I were sorted into Slytherin?”</p><p>The girl grinned widely at the determined boy, not surprised in the least. She stared hard into his toxic, emerald green eyes that glowed with a determined light. And she spoke.</p><p>“My name is Clara Beldom. And yes, I believe that you have the best chance of becoming what is best for yourself if you are sorted into Slytherin.”</p><p>The stared into each other’s jeweled eyes, toxic emerald to icy amethyst. They grinned at each other, one hidden beast to another, and knew. </p><p>Knew that this day would someday be legendary. A day of chance where one beast broke the shackles off of another through unbiased honesty. A day where a beast was born. </p><p>They spent the rest of the train ride trading topics and Clara teaching Harry different crafting skills. It ended with Clara giving Harry a handmade, leather wand holster for his belt and a shield pendant to wear underneath his shirt. </p><p>(Elsewhere, a Phoenix sings. Elsewhere, an ancient being laughs. Elsewhere, a crystal orb shatters on its pedestal. Elsewhere, an egg hatches. Elsewhere, a creature is born.) </p>
