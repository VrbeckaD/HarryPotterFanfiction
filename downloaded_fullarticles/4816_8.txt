    <p>Draco Malfoy was jealous. From the first day at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and he had been rejected, he had been jealous.<br/>
Draco had meant to be the one everyone at Hogwarts was fascinated and impressed by, not him.<br/>
Draco had meant to be the Quidditch star of Hogwarts – he wasn’t going to let his mother’s training go to waste, or the chance to impress his father – but then no. Of course he had to go and become the youngest seeker in a century and all that.<br/>
He had annoyed Draco so much that he had sought out his attention from the first time they had met.</p><p>But it was always worst out on the Quidditch pitch. Like today, the last Quidditch match of the Hogwarts season: Slytherin versus Gryffindor. The tension between the two houses – between Draco and Harry themselves – had been worse than usual, it always was between the to opposing houses for the final match. Draco hadn’t had time to re-create his Potter Stinks badges from last year, but jeering and taunting would have to do. In Potions, Draco had sat deliberately close to Harry so that he could nudge him, putting him off his potion making, remind him that Draco had no trouble getting under his skin. Harry was adorably easy to annoy, Draco couldn’t help but to rile him up.<br/>
There they were, facing each other behind their teammates, glaring at each other – Draco was reminded of their duel in their second year, “Scared, Potter?” And the retorting, “You wish,” Even second year Draco had been taken aback by how much sexual tension had charged those words.<br/>
“I want a good clean match to finish the season with – no foul play from either side, thank you,” Madam Hooch’s amber eyes narrowed at the Slytherin team as Flint cracked his knuckles. “On my whistle,” Everyone mounted their brooms, legs tensed as they waited to kick off.  Draco and Harry’s eyes were still locked on each other’s – grey on green – Harry’s in a determined glare, and Draco’s in a smirk, as they kicked off the ground sharply at Hooch’s whistle.<br/>
Draco soared into the air, taking the opposite end of the pitch to Harry. He flew high, below Harry, eyes scouring the pitch for that telltale flash of gold. Draco looked up at Harry for a second, a smirk on his lips as he looked at the opposing Seeker.<br/>
He scoured the pitch, zigzagging across the pitch searching for the little golden ball that would win Slytherin the House Cup. Soaring higher, the two seekers drew together.<br/>
Harry rose to fly above the sun, obscuring it, but still allowing it to hit him in an unfair way. It didn’t matter if he was blocking out the sun because it was as if he could be the sun - it shone through the emerald of his eyes, playing tricks with the winter landscape before them, making everything scream spring; his already tanned skin positively bronze, his profile unfairly structured and almost regal.</p><p>Draco suddenly felt warm, starting to get agitated up in the air, not helped by how Potter suddenly shot past him, eyes tunneling at something. Forcing himself to focus, Draco’s gaze caught the same glimmer of gold Potter must have. He started to dive, too – remembering his mother’s teaching of how to best anticipate the Snitch’s seemingly random buzzings and to try and corner it.<br/>
By keeping his form as stream-lined as possible, Draco managed to zip up alongside Harry’s Firebolt, feeling satisfied as the other boy threw him a frown – no other broom should have been able to keep up with the Firebolt.<br/>
They both lay flat just against their brooms, arms inching up the handles, both of their hands outstretched towards the tiny fluttering ball buzzing just out of their reach. Their hands brushed and Draco felt a spark run through him. Harry looked at him, his face unreadable. Their positions, perfect mirrors of each other, reminded him of a dream he’d had the other night, of Draco and Harry being neck and neck for the snitch – just like they were now - until their hands had simultaneously clasped around the tiny golden ball and the two Seekers had started to fall from the sky, the hands clasped together, for the snitch had melted away. They had tumbled closer together until Harry’s mouth had been at Draco’s ear, his breath tauntingly hot against Draco’s skin before his lips had found his skin at last and Draco had let out a sigh of relief. Finally.<br/>
“Finally! He’s done it again! Potter catches the snitch and that’s one hundred and fifty points of Gryffindor, winning them the match!”<br/>
But this time Draco and Harry didn’t tumble out of the air, locked together – Harry caught the snitch and pulled up sharply, brandishing the little golden ball victoriously. Draco pulled up also, scowling at the Gryffindor seeker. He wouldn’t admit that it was his own fault, getting distracted by his opponent.<br/>
He flew gracefully to the ground, meeting the rest of his scowling team. “What the hell was that, Malfoy?” Captain Flint rounded on him as soon as Draco’s feet were back on solid ground. Draco just frowned at him, choosing to ignore him and dust himself off. “You spent half the match looking at Potter than you for the snitch!”<br/>
Draco had honestly thought he was being more subtle about it.<br/>
“It’s not my fault this school is riddled with favourtism and that freak has an international leveled broom!” It also wasn’t Draco’s fault that stupid Potter was so stupidly pretty, either.<br/>
Draco turned, feeling something akin to what being hit with a concentrated beam, to see Harry staring at him, frowning, not unkindly. It didn’t look unkind, like most of the looks they shared, but curiously calculating. Draco held his gaze, matching his intensity. Amongst the flood of people, his teammates and friends, at his time of victory, Potter was staring at Malfoy.<br/>
But as soon as their gazes locked, Harry looked away, going back to grinning with his friends at Gryffindor’s victory. Draco turned back to his own team.<br/>
“Get it together, Malfoy,” Flint gave him a long look before stalking off, the rest of the team in his wake.</p><p>_______</p><p> </p><p>Gryffindor had secured yet another Quidditch House Cup win for the third year running. And for the third year running Draco had received an invitation to the end of season dinner, celebrating the Cup’s winners and the fantastic playing of all the Houses during this year’s season. Draco wanted to vomit.<br/>
But it seemed something held been left unfinished between himself and Potter on the Quidditch pitch even after Potter had caught the snitch and won the match. Draco couldn’t help but to pursue it.<br/>
Draco straightened his blazer, rolling his shoulders back before entering the fifth floor room where the dinner was being held. Slytherin may have lost, but that didn’t mean Draco would submit to the shame.<br/>
(He gave them something to talk about other than bumming off of the Gryffindors’ win.)<br/>
Everyone else had already arrived, raising their eyebrows as Draco entered, head held high, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle, watching him swagger through the party with barely concealed surprise in their eyes. People hadn’t expected any of the Slytherin team to show up (even if they hadn’t really lost, having still beaten the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs) – but here Draco was, of course fashionably late, giving the people something to talk about other than congratulating the Gryffindors. And plus, the party could do with some classing up. And who better to do that than Draco Malfoy?</p><p>Draco did his loop of the room, making comments as he passed by conversationalists and setting people on edge as he surveyed them from where he mainly stationed himself by the refreshments table. People would glance Draco’s way, Crabbe and Goyle hovering near him, nervously before turning back to their conversations but he could feel a more intense stare fixed on him. Draco scanned the room before his eyes came to rest on the purveyor of the intense stare.<br/>
Of course.<br/>
Potter.<br/>
Draco raised a glass to him with a smirk, a mock congratulations on yet another fantastic win. Potter’s eyes narrowed at that and he turned back to his conversation with Professor McGonagall, who no doubt was congratulating him on another great season Potter, we can expect great things from you in the future, Potter! Oh, and take fifty points for Gryffindor for being just so charmingly handsome, Potter! Draco rolled his eyes, going to circle the room once more.<br/>
As Draco drifted from one boring conversation to the next, he could still feel Potter’s eyes on him almost constantly. The intensity of the other boy’s stare, the concentration of his attention on Draco, made the hair on the back of his neck stand up, sending tingles through him.<br/>
Feeling his job of representing Slytherin done, Draco turned to leave; he could still feel Potter’s eyes fiercely fixed on him. Just to tease the boy, Draco turned in the doorway, Potter’s eyes already on him, and raised an eyebrow, pausing a moment to let the silent dare to follow sink in before turning back to leave.</p><p>Draco wandered down the corridor, straining his ears for the sound of following footsteps. He turned into an empty classroom a little ways down the hall from where the dinner was still going on, crossing the room to wait.<br/>
Leaning against the wall, one leg crossed behind him, arms folded, a smirk playing across his face when he saw Potter emerge in the classroom doorway.<br/>
“You just can’t resist sticking your nose in, can you, Potter?”<br/>
He just stayed in the doorway, silent. Draco licked his lips and continued, trying to rile him up, “Could never resist following me, huh? Always had to know what I and everyone else is up to. I thought you’d get your little fanclub to do your dirty work for you by now,”<br/>
A feeling of self-satisfaction riffled through Draco as he watched Potter slowly walk closer to him with every word, those green eyes piercing in the dim room. His words seemed to fuel Harry’s movements, so Draco kept talking, kept pushing.<br/>
Soon the space between them was almost completely closed – Draco had a perfect, up-close and personal view of Potter’s clenched jaw, the small flecks of dirty bronze in his eyes, the slight chap of his lips.<br/>
“Are you going to run back to your little party and tell a teacher on me for loitering?” Draco could feel the heat, the tension building between them. He knew it would only come to an end with a kiss or a fist. “What are you going to do now, Potter?” His voice was low, an invitation, a challenge. Harry had followed him here for a reason and Draco wasn’t exactly pulling out his wand for a duel, so what else did Harry think? Kiss or fist. It was Harry’s move.</p><p>Draco opened his mouth to speak again but then Harry’s lips were on his and he forgot everything else. It was nothing more than lips locked on lips – though it was Harry Potter’s lips – but the point of contact between them was like fire and Draco had been starved of this new kind of ferocious warmth his whole life. They broke apart, Harry’s eyes wide with shock at what he had just done.<br/>
But then Draco pulled him back in, Harry seeming to go willingly. Their lips burned against each other, until their mouths opened up to each other, letting Draco drink the taste of him in.<br/>
This boy, who had frustrated him since he had denied his proposition of friendship, who he had spent years trying to get his attention, to keep it,<br/>
Harry Potter had frustrated Draco since the day he had rejected his friendship, the boy whom Draco had spent years trying to get his attention and keep it now had his hands clutched in Draco’s hair, his tongue moving languidly against Draco’s own. He didn’t kiss anything like he flew. Harry flew with grace but he was kissing ferociously, more concerned with kissing his lips raw than any kind of finesse. (Not that Draco was complaining, mind.)<br/>
Draco had wanted things before. Had wanted x and y before but nothing had set him on fire the way Harry kissed, the way he wanted him closer. Draco gripped his own hands around Harry’s waist, drawing him closer and re-angling himself to lick further into Harry’s mouth. He relished in how Harry’s grip tightened in his hair. That combined with how Harry pressed him into the wall, pinning him under his touch, made him moan into the other boy’s mouth.<br/>
Harry was a little shorter than Draco, but Draco was happy to melt under him, sliding his hands up the Potter boy’s shirt. The skin underneath was feverishly hot, and firm as Draco ran his hands up and down the boy’s torso. Harry shivered at the touch and Draco grinned into the kiss, putting pressure against where his hands were at the small of Harry’s back, rubbing at the hot skin, pushing his hands further up the boy’s spine. He grazed his nails against the skin the action prompting Harry to begin kissing at Draco’s neck. If he hadn’t melted already, Draco was pretty sure he was a puddle, held together only by Harry’s lips and tongue grazing across his skin; Draco then tilted his head back, allowing him more access, moving a hand to Harry’s own head, pressing him in, the other hand maintaining pressure at the base of Harry’s back, pushing the shirt further and further up, growing eager for it to be off.<br/>
Harry clawed at Draco’s own dress shirt, pulling it open and biting at his collarbone. A tiny part of Draco’s mind should be pissed off at that – it was a nice shirt, the Potter boy should take care, but he was too momentarily caught up in the heat of Harry kissing down his shoulder.<br/>
It was that that probably woke Draco up to what they were doing – with whom he was doing it. He reveled in that knowledge, that Harry bloody Potter was currently sucking at his collarbone, his hand clenched sharply in his hair before bringing his other hand round to Harry’s abdomen, about to push his hand lower, to the boy’s belt-line, before pushing him away.<br/>
Not like this. Not now.<br/>
He instantly regretted it. Not even a second away from Harry and his body was already experiencing violent withdrawal symptoms from his touch. Harry took a moment to process that he wasn’t kissing at Draco anymore and gave him a confused, almost annoyed look.<br/>
Draco tried not to laugh – Harry was completely at Draco’s mercy, silently asking if they should continue. But Draco pushed Harry further away, his whole being screaming what are you doing?! He slipped from where Harry had had him, rightening his blazer, Harry’s eyes on him and his gaze far more intense than anything previous.<br/>
If they carried on now that would be it – here, there was a silent promise of something more.<br/>
Draco somehow managed to tear his eyes away from a disheveled-looking Harry, turning fully away from him and walking out of the classroom.</p>
