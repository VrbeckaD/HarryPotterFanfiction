          <div class="userstuff"><p>Tom's hand was shaking. His tight control was unwinding, and as much as he tried to quell the trembling, he knew from the soft pleading look in Harry's eyes that it was too late. His body had betrayed him.</p>
<p>"I want to hurt you," he paused to take in another breath. Tom could barely breathe; the air seemed excessively<em> thin</em>.</p>
<p>"I <em>will</em> hurt you," Tom meant it more as a promise, but he could hear in his voice the wounded cry of an animal. Cornered, frightened, bearing its teeth and hissing in a false show of strength. </p>
<p>And Harry just stood there. Palms raised in the air, unarmed, unmoving, eyes unwavering from Tom's own. Harry was defenceless, and Tom had the upper hand. HE should be trembling, not Tom.</p>
<p>"It's what I do, as you know. <em>Hurt people</em>. All I'm good for." Tom pressed his wand harder into the side of Harry's neck, and through his shaking, he could feel the rapid beat of Harry's heart pulse through its wood. And it reassured him then that Harry's confidence and patience was all show. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He <em>was</em> scared.</p>
<p>Harry was scared.</p>
<p>'<em>Good</em>,' Tom thought to himself. A curling sense of satisfaction that tasted more like dread in the back of his throat unfurled within him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry swallowed, "That's not true. You know that's not-"</p>
<p>"Take back what you said," Tom wouldn't tolerate more <em>lies</em>. More nonsense filler utterances. More useless words Harry <em>thought</em> Tom wanted to hear.</p>
<p>"Never."</p>
<p>Tom's frustration built to uncontainable levels. The outcry that left his lips, as his wand tore away from Harry's neck and pointed towards the wall behind Harry's head, shocked him more than the reverberating sound of his curse hitting the castle. Tom's chest heaved as Harry recovered from an instinctive flinch, and Tom yearned for that missing sense of pleasure. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>'Why was this so painful? </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Isn't this what I want?'</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Take. It. Back." Tom returned the wand to Harry's neck and watched as Harry winced. He wondered then if the wand was hot from his rage, still cooling from the residual magic of the blasting curse. Tom held himself from inching back. From accidentally tending to any discomfort he may have caused. From showing Harry that he <em>cared</em>.</p>
<p>Harry exhaled in what could have been sigh or a prayer for more patience. This was probably the most he'd ever been forced to use, "No. Now stop this Tom, I already told you that I-"</p>
<p>"STOP," Tom shouted. He stomped his foot like a child and embarrassment crept up his neck, hot tears gathered clouding his vision. His resolve was fast draining, and with tears down his cheeks and his voice breaking, he begged,</p>
<p>"<em>Please</em> stop."</p>
<p>His next inhale was spluttering and wet.</p>
<p>"You are <em>not</em> in love with me."</p></div>
