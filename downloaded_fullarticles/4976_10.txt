  <span>Remus sat at his desk, eating a sandwich and reading over a stack of third year essays, when he heard the pecking of an owl’s beak against his office window. Bracing himself against the chill of early November, he opened the pane enough for the bird to enter. It perched itself upon the edge of his desk and stared longingly at his food. </span><br/>He removed the letter bound to its leg, then offered it a bit of the roast beef from his sandwich. With a snap of its sharp beak, the bird took the proffered meat before taking flight out the window back to wherever it had originated.<br/>
  <span>After pushing closed the stubborn window, Remus turned to the letter on his desk. It had begun to unroll of its own accord, now loosed from the twine binding it to the messenger’s leg. He could see that it was a short message in his wife’s familiar print. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Remus--</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>I have something important to talk to you about when you get home. Which is to say, you shouldn’t stay late tonight.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>--Dora</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>He sat back against his desk chair and rubbed his jaw in thought. </span><span><br/></span><span>To say that the letter was a bit worrying would be a massive understatement. </span><br/>Of course, Remus was a bit of a worrier. <br/>Before he had a chance to become too worried, though, a chiming sound and the chattering of fourth years entering his classroom forced his attention back to work.</p>
<p>
  <span>However, this was not to last. </span><br/>Shortly after he had set the class’s assignment, a Ravenclaw girl in the back row shot her hand up, “Professor Lupin! There’s an owl at your window!”<br/>
  <span>“Thank you, Nadine,” he said, nodding as he made his way back to the window in question, where a different, smaller owl was pecking at the glass. </span><br/>Remus opened it and the owl hopped inside; he removed the note from its leg as it watched him carefully. <br/>“I don’t have anything to give you,” he said in a voice, firm but with a hint of apology. The owl gave a dejected hoot before turning and flying away.<br/>
  <span>As Remus shut the window, he took a look at the even shorter note in his hand.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em></em>
    <span>P.S. It’s nothing bad, I promise.<br/></span>
  
  <em>
    <span>Because I know you and I know you were worried.<br/></span>
  </em>
  <em></em>
  <span>So don’t.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>--N.T.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He rolled his eyes and stuffed the note into the pocket of his robe.<br/></span>
  <span>This woman would be the death of him.</span>

<p><br/><span>Remus pushed open the door to his family’s small Hogsmeade cottage and called, “Dora?” <br/>The answer came by way of a thump followed by a hushed, “Not yet, Teddy!”<br/></span><span>“Dora?” he called again, hanging his cloak and scarf on the coat rack by the door.  <br/></span><span>“Just a moment!” she called back.  <br/></span><span>As if her letters hadn’t worried him enough, this certainly was concerning. <br/>He made his way across the front room toward the hall. Remus’s feet had barely left the carpet beneath the sofa when he heard her shout, “Just wait on me out there!”<br/></span><span>Remus closed my eyes tight and sighed.<br/></span><span>“Sit down!” she called again, “and stop worrying!”<br/></span><span>“Forgive me if I have trouble doing that, love,” he shouted back before sitting down on the edge of a chair.  </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>After a few tense moments, Remus heard his wife walk down the hall. He looked up at her leaning against the doorway. <br/></span><span>“You had something to say?” he asked.<br/></span><span>She answered with a rather Sirius-like smirk; it must be a Black family trait.  <br/></span><span>“You’re up to something.”<br/></span><span>“Aren’t I always?”<br/></span><span>Remus frowned, “Yes, but it doesn’t usually worry me quite this much.”<br/></span><span>Her dark eyes twinkled mischievously and she called, “Alright, Teddy, come see your daddy.”<br/></span><span>Remus’s eyes remained on Dora, still concerned, as their three-year-old son’s feet padded down the hall.  </span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>“Da!” Teddy shouted as he lept up into his arms.<br/></span><span>“Hello, Ted,” Remus said, smiling, as he wrapped his arms around the small boy and pulled him into his lap.<br/></span><span>“Show Da your shirt, Teddy,” Dora instructed. <br/></span><span>Remus pulled away from his son as he grabbed the sides of his blue t-shirt, urging his father to read the black writing on it. <br/></span><span>‘Big Brother in Training’ it read.<br/> Remus read it over two or three times before he looked up at his wife, “D-dora? Do you mean– Y-you’re?”<br/></span><span>Dora’s hair flashed to an electric blue and her face split in an ear-to-ear grin as she nodded.<br/></span><span>Remus still couldn’t manage a complete thought, “You’re– W-we’re– We’re having a-another–”<br/></span><span>“Another baby,” she said, grin spreading from her hair to her face into her voice.</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Remus picked Teddy up, holding him on his hip, as he cleared the room in a few long strides. <br/>His free arm moved to pull his wife as close as possible. He pressed his lips to the side of her head and he was certain that she could feel his smile.<br/></span><span>“So, you’re excited?” she asked, “You’re happy?”<br/></span><span>“Happy? Dora, I’m…I’m elated. I’m ecstatic.”<br/></span><span>“Because last time–”<br/></span><span>“Last time was a war, Dora. Last time we didn’t know how…my condition– but now we have Ted and we know,” he explained.<br/></span><span>“No repeats of your reaction?” she asked in a way that sounded more like a warning.<br/></span><span>Remus kissed her intently before promising, “Never again.”</span><span><br/></span><span><br/></span><span>Teddy wiggled between them and began squirming in an attempt to get down. <br/>Remus stepped away from Dora and helped Teddy to the carpet. Before his father could say a word, he scampered away down the hall toward his room. <br/>Remus returned his attention to Teddy's mother, “When did you find out?”<br/></span><span>She smiled, “Today. I was at St. Mungo’s for a check-up after the trouble with that jinx last month.”<br/></span><span>“Everything’s still alright from that, isn’t it?”<br/></span><span>Dora nodded, rolling her eyes slightly at what she percieved as over-protectiveness.<br/></span><span>“Do you know how far along you are?” Remus asked.<br/></span><span>She paused for a moment, trying to remember, “About six weeks.”<br/></span><span>He did some math in his head, “So…July? August?”  <br/></span><span>“Somewhere in there,” she said smiling.<br/></span><span>Remus couldn’t fight the smile that returned to his face, “I just can’t believe it. Another baby. Merlin. Just….wow.”<br/></span><span>“I know, right?” she said, draping her arms over her husband’s shoulders.  <br/></span><span>His hands moved to her waist and he kissed her again and again. <br/></span><span>“Did you tell Teddy?” Remus asked. <br/></span><span>She gave him a look like he was oblivious.<br/></span><span>Remus shook his head, “Right. The shirt. Did he understand?”<br/></span><span>She nodded, “As well as he can understand. One of his friends at nursery just had a baby sister, so…it’s not a completely foreign concept to him.”<br/></span><span>“And everyone else? Molly, Harry, your mother? Do they know?” <br/></span><span>“Well, Lex knows,” she shrugged, “She was with me when they did the tests at St. Mungo’s.”<br/></span><span>He nodded. “When are you planning on telling the others?”<br/></span><span>“We’re going to a dinner for Bill’s birthday at Molly and Arthur’s this Saturday. We could tell them then,” she mused aloud. <br/></span><span>“And your mother?”<br/></span><span>“We’ll go there before Bill’s birthday.”</span><br/>Remus sighed happily, "I love you so much, Dora."</p>
