    <p>Hermione was going through books in the restricted section when everyone else was waiting for the Hogwarts express for the end of the first semester. Normally it was impossible for a first-year witch to get the permission from her professors, not to mention her head of the house was the famous overprotective Minerva McGonagall. No professors weren't able to get her into the restricted section, but a certain twinkling headmaster can smuggle her in without notifying anybody. After confronting Albus Dumbledore with her question about philosopher stone, she was able to search in the restricted section for an hour before the train departs and take the book back home during the break.</p>
<p>She scanned through one bookshelf to another, disappointed that none of the books were at least related to the philosopher's stone.</p>
<p>On her way here, there was a shelf labeled as “magical stone”, but it was, unfortunately, empty. With the clock ticking she decided that it was the end of her journey.</p>
<p>Returning, she came across the magical stone shelf again. “I must have missed that book last time.” She muttered under her breath with her gaze locked on the only red-white book lying on the not-so-empty bookshelf.</p>
<p>“At least I have something to read during Christmas.”</p>
<p>&lt; </p>
<p>“Hermione! you nearly miss the train! you surely get something worthy!” once Hermione entered the cabin on Hogwarts expert, her friends were already in the cabin.</p>
<p>A redhead figure rose and yelled, barely hiding excitement and impatient in his tone. Harry Potter helped Hermione lifting her luggage, focusing gazes on her as well.</p>
<p>“Be quiet, Ron.” Hermione slipped the door shut and cast a quick silencing charm on it. “You are attracting whole train's interest!”</p>
<p>“what makes you so long anyway?”</p>
<p>Seeing the boy was not going to lower his voice until she took out the book, she sighted and sited across the boys with her bag placed on the table. “This.” Hermione pulled out the book and lay it out for Ron and Harry to see. The line of words was written neat handwriting, blood-red letters attracted everyone's attention once it entered their sight.</p>
<p>
  <em>The Grimoire of Alice</em>
</p>
<p>“Merlin's beard!” Ron Weasley never ceased yelling, “You didn’t get a book, you got a freaking grimoire!”</p>
<p>“Wait, what? what's the difference?”</p>
<p>Hermione asked in confusion while flipping the book open to a random page and scanning cross the content, but later shocked by the words written inside. They were not written in English, Latin, or Greek; or the runes she caught a glimpse in high year textbook. Staring at those letters her mind started to drift and her sight dazzled.</p>
<p>When she started to faint, Ron snatched the grimoire from her, knocking Hermione out of dizziness.</p>
<p>“It's too dangerous for us, young wizards, to read a grimoire. It links to the writer's mind, spirit, and magic. It will backfire if the reader cannot endure the willpower within the lines.” he tugged the grimoire into Hermione’s bag carefully and said “I really don't suggest you bringing this back your home and into the muggle world. If a muggle read it, they may be dead in an instant.  You should return it to the headmaster.”</p>
<p>Hermione sighted “I guess that remain in the restricted section for a reason, but that is the only promising book I can find on the magical stone bookshelf. Do you think professor Dumbledore wants me to get that book? Headmaster gave me a portkey he said I can use it if I finish reading and wish to return, he surely wanted me to finish something.”</p>
<p>“If the book...grimoire, is that dangerous, Hermione, I don't believe headmaster will even let you near the book. You know, it’s the headmaster's job to protect students, right? He must be unaware of the grimoire. Someone must purposely place it there, most likely Snape.”</p>
<p>“Professor Snape, Harry. And you are being unreasonable! why would he expect me, a first-year student, enter the restricted section?”</p>
<p>“Well, perhaps he overheard your conversation with headmaster...”</p>
<p>The sudden erupt of noise coming from the corridor ceased the discussion. Everyone in the cabin looked at each other in confusion, the silencing spell blocking the sound from penetrating had somehow ceased working.</p>
<p>Ron turned his head toward the window and shouted, “the train stopped!”, attracting other's attention. With everyone turning their head toward the window, the bag and grimoire fell to the ground without catching anyone's notice.</p>
<p>“What has happened?” Hermione asked, “Do Hogwarts expert normally stop in middle?”</p>
<p>“Definitely not normal.” Ron stated “My brothers never tell me Hogwarts expert has stopped in middle in the past. Even Fred and George's explosions won't stop the train.”</p>
<p>“Why are we so special?” Harry murmured under his breath, “We better stay in the cabin then.”</p>
<p>“Sunlight disappears” Ron, who kept staring at the window, stated “It's a bright day, at noon, but we don't have any sunlight sprayed into the cabin. Something bad must be happening.”</p>
<p>“And now I started to feel cold, is it some sort of dark magic? Slytherins, I know it was them, they live in dungeons and love snakes after all.” Harry spat.</p>
<p>I can't cast magic now!” Hermione gasped, flicking her wand like mad trying to perform another silencing spell, but nothing happens. “Wingardium Leviosa! Lumos!” She tried other spells, but effortless as well.</p>
<p>The wizards draw their wands and did their own trying, yet none of them can create even the slightest spark from their wands.</p>
<p>Harry snapped “Great! now they disable our magic as well, I wonder when they will come in and slaughter us all!”</p>
<p>“Don't be ridiculous harry” Ron turn his attention to the table, “If Slytherins know this kind of dark magic, he-who-must-not-be-named would have won the war a decade ago. Something else causes this, where's the grimoire?”</p>
<p>Hermione’s sight swept across the cabin, unexpectedly finding the grimoire laying near the door, place where no ordinary book can reach by itself, flipped to a random page. She walked to the grimoire, noticing the temperature dropped prominently near it. When she attempted to reach it, a black sphere suddenly appeared and expanded, embracing Hermione within a second.</p>
<p>The wizards remained seated and gapped in shock. Harry tried to figure out a spell he could use, and he soon realized they can do nothing without magic in hand, even escaping was a mission impossible.</p>
<p>The sphere stopped expanding once it covered Hermione. Harry didn't place his faith in others, wizards born in magical society tended to freak out once they lost their power. What can they do without magic? Harry had spent enough time in the non-magical world, knowing flipping wands is not the only solution. With a spark in mind, he snatched his broom under the table, and stabbed it into the sphere, hoping it can disrupt the whatever magic the grimoire was performing, or Hermione can grab it.</p>
<p>Instead of stabbing the book, he stabbed onto some soft tissue. So, the sphere was not destructive, he thought. Subconsciously he retrieved the broom, afraid that he may hurt Hermione, and the sphere shrunk in the process.</p>
<p>The first to be revealed was Hermione’s body. She was dazzle and slumped to the floor when Ron dragged her back to safety.</p>
<p>“Do you know what that was?” Ron asked.</p>
<p>“I have no idea.” Hermione was still recovering from the shock, “I need to return this book to the headmaster at once, see you around.” Grabbing the grimoire from the ground, without another word, she portkeyed away with the lemon drop Dumbledore given her.</p>
