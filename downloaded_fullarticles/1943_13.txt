    <p>October 15, 1979</p><p>Albus Dumbledore, Leader of the Order of the Phoenix and the supposed “Light Lord”, chuckled darkly in his head when he was informed of his eavesdropper Severus Snape. He had known that Tom Riddle, the current Dark Lord, would send someone to try to weasel their way into his good graces. It was why he had staged the interview for the new Divination teacher here at the Hog’s Head, his despicable brother’s tavern. He’d already interviewed the daft woman once in his office and the prophecy that had poured from her mouth had angered him to no end. Still, he had a use for her and for the eavesdropper that had been caught by his oaf of a brother. In a way, Severus was the perfect choice for a spy from Tom. Plus, he only served to further along Albus’ own plans. When Tom got word of the “Prophecy”, he would scour the whole of Britain to find the child that would be his end. Albus laughed internally again when he thought of the lines he’d forced out of the mouth of Trelawney: <em>The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches...born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies…</em><br/> That was all that was needed apparently as Severus left quickly, but not quick enough for Albus to miss the gleam in his eye. It would take some convincing on his spy’s part to force Tom’s hand to act which would send Severus scuttling his way like a rat. In the meantime, he had to force Trelawney’s compliance which meant keeping her under the Imperius curse. He couldn’t afford her spilling the true prophecy to anyone. Though if he played his cards right, he would have the ‘Vanquisher’ in his hands to mold like putty. It was almost too easy, not as easy as betraying his lover and taking his wand but easy enough.</p><p>    Once back in his office, Albus took the memory of the real prophecy from his mind and stored it in an unbreakable crystal vial and labeling it. He placed it on the shelf of a nearby cabinet with all the other memories he’d removed from his head over the years but didn’t bother locking the cabinet. He was the only one who came in this part of his office. He still fumed over the audacity of Trelawney for speaking such a thing. His head hurt just thinking of the thing: <em>The birth of the true Dark Lord draws nigh...born to those who shall thrice defy the Fallen Lord, born as the seventh month dies… He shall set to rights the unbalance and claim the immortal throne...his army shall be legion, and Death shall be his Servant… The lily and the stag watch over him and the Wolf and Dogstar nurture him...The cat shall guide and the Serpent train him...Marked by the Lady's Own Hand...The birth of the true Dark Lord approaches...born to those who will thrice defy the Fallen Lord…</em><br/> While Albus wasn’t certain who the Prophecy referred to, he could take a guess. The Potters (James and Lily) and their ilk matched the descriptions perfectly. By sending Tom their way, he would remove the annoyance that was the prime Marauders. He had had plans for them once upon a time but now he just found them annoying. He could manipulate the fourth man, Peter Pettigrew, into acting as a spy for him and that was why he referred to the other three as the prime Marauders. Those three would never back down from a fight, they had an astonishing amount of talent and intelligence between the three of them, and they were fiercely loyal. Overall, they embodied the House they had been Sorted into. Peter, on the other hand, was more of a tag along than anything else and he knew it which was why it was so easy to manipulate him to his own needs. Peter craved recognition and power, wanted to be known for something other than being the friend of James Potter and Sirius Black. Remus Lupin, though not as popular as his friends was still quite as well-known. He tutored plenty of the Gryffindor students and was most assuredly the brains behind the Marauders’ exploits, of that Albus was certain. Peter though was just there. He was often the fall guy and served most of the detentions that were issued. He wasn’t all that smart nor was he in anyway attractive. Albus believed that the only reason that the others kept him around was out of pity.<br/>      Nevertheless, it provided the perfect opportunity for Albus as all he’d had to do was compliment the stupid lad and Peter was falling all over himself. Add in a couple of compulsion charms and a loyalty potion and Albus had himself the perfect follower. Peter did everything that was asked of him and more. Now, Albus would be able to get rid of the biggest threat to his rule and the annoying Marauders, all in one swoop. Laughing manically, he sat at his desk and started planning.</p><p>November 1, 1981</p><p>     All Albus could think of, as he lay the dark-haired brat on the doorstep of his relatives’ house, was that even though not everything had gone to plan he was still ahead of Fate. By placing a compulsion charm to abuse the Brat-Who-Didn’t-Die on the letter left to the couple, Albus ensured that the boy would be indebted to him for giving him an escape. The boy would do what was asked of him and would be sure to sacrifice himself for the “Greater Good”, a cause that he, himself had made up to justify himself. With Sirius in Azkaban for ‘betraying’ the Potters (Albus had been the one to set the Fidelius Charm and knew who the true Secret Keeper was) and Remus in France looking for work, he left the boy unprotected. A glee that he’d known only once before rose up in him and he fought to keep it down inside in front of Minerva and Hagrid, both who would question such a reaction. When Tom rose again, for he would rise again, and the young Potter died defeating him Albus would gain all the wealth that the Potters had. After all, Dumbledore would be named the number one beneficiary in the boy’s Will. He would then proceed to kill off Tom and be lauded as a hero and the savior of the Wizarding world. If the Potter brat managed to defeat Tom though, he would have him named the next Dark Lord and locked up somewhere. After all, only someone equally Dark would be able to defeat the Dark Lord. Once the brat was put away, he would seize control of the Potter vaults from the goblins and become the most influential wizard in Britain in the process.<em> Yes</em>, Albus thought to himself, <em>this is most certainly the best possible outcome of the night.</em></p><p>     What Albus couldn’t have counted on though was the truth of what had happened that night and what it meant. If he had thought about it, he would have felt the darkness that oozed from the scar on the young Potter’s forehead. Had he even been the least bit concerned that his downfall was laying in front of him, he would have just finished the job instead of thinking about future wealth. By the time the boy was old enough to start school, it would be too late to regain control of him. Albus hadn’t counted on the true Prophecy being recorded in the Department of Ministries instead of the one he fed them.</p>
