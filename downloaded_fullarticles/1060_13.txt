  <em>
    <span>“Please, please, please….” my voice is breathless and I’m not sure what I’m begging for. All I knew was that if the hands-on me didn’t move soon, I was going to burst into frustrated tears. A low chuckle has my head falling back and a moan leaves my lips as the searing hot kisses to my chest migrate lower.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“You beg so beautifully.” is murmured against my skin, and I whine again. My legs are nudged apart, and I move willingly, molding to how he wanted me. I was splayed out on a bed, soft and silky sheets underneath me. I was sitting up, but my head was thrown back and I wasn’t focused on anything but the body before mine nad the torture they were trying to inflict on me.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“What is it you’re begging for though?” is mused as those lips skim lower, over my hip and dangerously close to where hip meets groin. Something brushes my straining erection.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Fuck, please! I don’t- I can’t-” my sentences are broken as I try to focus, even with the hands crawling up my thighs and the warm breath teasing over me.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Please? Please, what? Do you want me here?” there’s a pause as a hand latches onto the base of my cock suddenly, making me jump up with a yelp at the sudden fierceness of it. When I land on the bed again I’m sprawled on my back.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Or maybe you want me here?” the other hand trails up as the other begins a slow, rhythmic moving. I moan again but still as the hand moving reached my face, then my mouth, and then two digits thrust in against my tongue. They begin moving along with his other hand around my shaft and I moan and whine around them. This is easily the most arousing thing I’d ever done. Sucking on the two calloused fingers in my mouth while my hips rolled to fuck up into his hand. His face looms over me and he’s smirking, but his eyes are blown wide and as he presses closer I can tell how excited he was. Suddenly he clamps down on the base of my cock again, obviously realizing I was going to come from this action alone. There's a few moments of him just hovering, watching my face as I moan around his fingers , before the fingers move from my lips. The trail down my throat, leaving a damp path that makes me shiver.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Or maybe, perhaps…” the hand travels farther, swirling around my navel.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“The little kitten is begging for me to pay attention?” he starts stroking again and I let loose the loudest moan yet, making his smirk brighten again. His fingers trail past my cock and his other hand and I spread my legs wider and buck my hips again, getting a small laugh.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Just maybe, you want me to fuck you?” he murmurs as the first finger circles my entrance. I whine pitifully but nod, eager and willing for whatever it was he was trying to throw my way. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Is that it baby? You want me inside you? Fucking you raw until you can’t even walk down the stairs to have dinner with my parents?” the voice is right at my ear, nipping at it as one finger roughly enters me and sends me over the edge.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I bolt upright in alarm, panting and sweaty. I glance frantically around, but Ron is still asleep. I thank god for small miracles and rush to the washroom across from the door. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Good fuck, I’d done it again. At least three times a week I woke up like this,  either needing a cold shower or needing to clean up. I felt dirty and wrong every time but while in my dream….</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Is that it baby?</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I shudder at the echo of my dream and my bodies valiant attempt at an erection. I was too exhausted though and only got an over-eager twitch before I settled down again. I head back to Ron's room, rolled over onto my side, and tried to go back to bed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I’d been having dreams like this since I was 13 and realized that, much to my surprise, my best friends older brother was hot. I’d been scandalized, and embarrassed, and then resigned. I was two years younger than them, a year behind them in school. There was no way that they were going to even glance in my direction. On top of that, he had taken Kate Bell to the dance my fourth year, and they seemed close enough to make it clear that he was into birds and not blokes. This year, their seventh year, they were so focused on the joke shop with their brother and quizzes that I doubted I’d even see them in the common room. I was over the fact I would never have him, but my imagination was only getting better as I grew up. And after a curious, drunken run-in with Seamus at the beginning of the fifth year- well, let's just say experience made it even easier to conjure up all sorts of thoughts when sleeping.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Now that I was 16, everyone was talking about courting, and presents and letters and my head was spinning. Sirius had explained to me that it was a tradition that even Muggleborns still took part in. you could date up until you was 16, but after that, if you liked someone you had to go about it properly. A formal letter to the parent or guardian- of which, I’ve heard, Sirius was having a gleeful time denying every single one sent his way so far- if denied, you had to wait 6 months. If accepted, you had to acknowledge that was only from the parent or guardian and that the person could deny them, too. And then there was the possibility that they may not like the role that you suggest them in. especially in gay couples. They took on a dominant and more submissive role dynamic, though some were purely only in writing and didn’t care much either way. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was all very confusing. There were rules on what you could give as gifts, when you could meet, when you were allowed to go out and where, and at any time the parents could go no, you’re no longer a good match and pull the courting. Your parents could also send </span>
  <em>
    <span>out</span>
  </em>
  <span> offers, which was something Sirius wanted to do with me later today. I was dreading it.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Harry, you need to eat up! You’re too skinny.” Molly’s voice has me glancing up and smiling wearily. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sorry. Just not looking forward to meeting up with Sirius today.” I murmur, obediently biting into a piece of toast.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Nonsense, it’s exciting! Sending out offers is always thrilling.” She chides me, pouring more juice into my glass as she walks by. I roll my eyes and send Ron a help me look, and he just shrugs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mums already sent mine out.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And she took George and I’s list and sent our yearly ones out too.” Fred pipes up as he walks in, a distracted look on his face as he looks over a paper in his hands.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re not- I thought you were with Angelina and Kate?” I ask in shock. He focuses on me then, and he’s got a small, funny smile on his face.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“We’re just good friends. Neither one of us are picky, but George prefers guys and I prefer…. Well, she’s not of age yet, so I just give mum one or two names I know won't reply a year.” he says with a wink. I’m floored by this information, but for the first time in years, hope is nearly bursting through me. George preferred men. Preferred men and wasn’t already in a courting. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fuck, did I have a chance here?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“None of my of age kids are in courting contracts dearie,” Molly says, obviously ignoring Fred's last sentence.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh. Bummer. I was going to ask for some advice before I left.” I cover, trying to look as bored as I had been before. Fred goes back to his piece of paper, and Ron is too busy eating to notice. I get about halfway through the food when George walks in, half asleep and half-dressed. His pajama pants are dangerously low and the dark red hair smattered over his chest and his head was in disarray, obviously having rolled out of bed before coming down. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Heya Harry. Have you gone through your contracts yet?” he asks, a look I’m not sure about on his face.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sirius is. He says he has five for me to go over with him and the rest are denied. He also said I had to bring a list with me today in case I didn’t agree with any of the five.” I can feel my nose scrunching in distaste and Molly chuckles.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did you make a list?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No.” I practically whine, putting my fork down and losing my appetite completely.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hush, hush. It’s not a problem, we can help you,” she exclaims.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sure, yeah. Keep eating, tells us what you’re looking for and who are hard nos and we can help you with the list.” Fred encourages as he folds the paper and tucks it away. George is more focused on getting coffee at this point, and when I shoot Ron a pleading look he shrugs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They could help.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t want to make a list though.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It could make you realize who you want faster.” Molly disagrees. A quil and a piece of paper appear next to Fred's plate and he gives her a thankful smile before turning his attention on Harry. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay well, preference?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Tall males,” Ron says slightly dryly, and I gap at him. He laughs.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You didn’t think I would notice? You eye up any handsome guy over 5’10. And don’t think I didn’t catch you sneaking out of Seamus’ bed one-time last year.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I go to retort but there is a loud crash and a yelp from George, who is now wearing his coffee. His skin is turning pink where the liquid had hit him and he’s blushing furiously.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I didn’t think it was that hot!” he exclaims as he frantically wipes it off and Molly repairs the mug that had hit the floor. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right. So you want Seamus, Dean, and Neville on there?” Fred asks after giving his twin an exasperated look.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not Seamus no.” I disagree. It had been fun but I had felt extremely guilty for using the redhead.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hmmm. well, Lee can go on there, and Krum, I know you still talk to him. Zabini isn’t that bad, we discuss products sometimes…. Diggory, I know you got on with him. What about finch-fletchley or Macmillan?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, to either of them. They’re assholes.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Language Harry,” Molly says from the stove. I make a face but shake my head no still.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right well. This is a short list but a list. Everyone else is either in a contract already or into women.” he murmurs to himself before sliding the list over to me. I fold it without looking, nodding, and slide it into a pocket.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sirius will be calling in five minutes, are you ready?” Molly calls up the stairs. I had gone back to Ron's room to do some reading before I had to go to Grimmauld. I place my bookmark and move down to the fireplace. When it turns green I give Molly a wave and step through to my godfather's study, where I’m wrapped into a huge hug.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hello Siri,” I laugh, hugging him back.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I can’t believe it! Remus is in a perpetual state of grouchy because of all the birds coming in.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Huh? How many requests have you gotten?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, easily several thousands,” he says brightly. I feel my face whiten.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thousands?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t worry, I only saved five for you. Did you bring a list?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Er, yeah, Fred helped me go over it this morning,” I tell him wearily. His eyes narrow as he leads me towards a cozier room where Remus was reading a book. When he looks up his face brightens and he stands to hug me too.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You don’t sound thrilled about any of this.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m not,” I admit softly to Sirius. He looks surprised, and then his posture deflates.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not everyone wants to start courting immediately. You could wait a few years, and just send out generalized, I’m not receiving until I’m x years old type things. I just thought-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, not like that. I just… I found out today that someone I’ve liked for a really long time is still refusing contracts. So I wasn’t thrilled about making a list since I kind of only really wanted one person on it.” I admit. They exchange a look before steering me to a seat by the fire that wasn’t lit.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Care to share?” Remus says after a silent moment. I feel my face light up. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Er, well… I’ve kind of really, extremely, annoyingly, have had a bad crush on George. A bad, bad crush, since I turned 13. I just kind of woke up one day and went down to breakfast and my brain just kind of, I dunno. It felt like a confundus had washed over me, and all I could focus on was his sharp cheekbones and how he had a mole under his eye and Fred didn’t and how his nose was slightly hooked to the left instead of the right like Fred and that he was, well, gorgeous. And I’ve kept it quiet because I thought he was in a contract with Kate Bell but I found out today that none of the Weasleys are in a contract and he actually does prefer men and- that’s great, but what if he doesn’t like me?” I feel out of breath and Remus is rubbing my back soothingly. They share a look before Sirius sits on the coffee table in front of me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay, so this is what we are going to do. We’re going to go over the contracts that I have. If they are a maybe, I’m going to write to them and tell them that you would like an open courtship to cancel at any time. If not, I’ll send the veto. After that we can focus on this very short list of yours.” he tries to make a joke and I’m grateful.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay, fine, whose on this list?” I murmur. He moves away from me for a moment and when he’s back, the red paper of the courting contracts is in front of me. They were straight forward fill in the blanks. Generic, but worth it. State your name, what role you want in the relationship, and what you’re willing to give- usually the answer wanted here is time, and love, and affection, over money or other materials. The first one was Viktor, which was surprising. At least, until I read the ‘give’ portion. </span>
  <em>
    <span>A friend who knows what it’s like to be in the spotlight. A partner who can handle pressure well.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sounds like things he wants, and not me. I shake my head and Sirius snatches it away, replacing it with another one.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Cedric?” I ask in surprise. Last I heard he was courting Chang. I skim the paper. Again, the ‘give’ portion gave it away.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Nothing serious. An opportunity to get to know you better and a chance at happiness.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Chang had left him or something had happened. I shake my head no again and I get to one from a name I’m not familiar with.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Who's this?” I ask in surprise.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sanguini is a vampire. I know that you don’t know him, but I figured you had a right to know that the king of the last vampire line thought that you were impressive enough to consider courting.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>‘Hmmm. add him to the maybe pile then.” I suggest, and he nods. The fourth one I had never heard of either, but Remus explained patiently that it was a woman who was the seventh year last year and they had just wanted to make sure that I hadn’t known her. Finally, on the last one, Sirius's lips twitch.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This one I’m sure you’ll be excited about.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Huh?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just read, Pup,” Remus says with an eye roll.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>I, George Gideon Weasley, am asking permission to court the one, Harrison James Potter. I am hoping to become the stable, dominant, caring hand that is needed in his life. I am also hoping that he can be the strong, unwavering, gentle light I know he is in mine. I hope to give patience and care. I also hope to give my wand, and hopefully one day my heart, in protecting him in his years to come.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Legally signed and accepted:</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>George G. Weasley</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>________________</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>There was a blank where my name would go, and I”m floored. George was sending the letter out to me? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m really glad he took the initiative. Otherwise, I might have had to hit them.” Sirius jokes into my stunned silence. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"He… I didn't think he was interested!" I exclaim in surprise. Remus chuckles then and I shoot him an annoyed look.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>" no-no, it's just, I knew when I was teaching you that you would be getting an offer from him st some point. He couldn't keep his eyes off of you." He explains his laughter and I feel myself blush.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"I…"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Do you know what he means here? The whole, hand to guide and light of life thing? It's not how it's traditionally written, it's a lot more romantic than normal, but..."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"That's the uh, traditional way of courting right? The whole, truly dominant and submissive." I stutter out. I did not want to get into a bird's and bees- was it bees and bees in this case?- with these two. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Well yes, but do you know what that means?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"I do yeah. Believe me, I'm aware." I feel my face flaming and Remus makes a surprised sound.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Well I didn't expect that, but there's nothing wrong with it." He murmurs, giving me a reassuring look.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Expecting what?" Sirius demands with a Frown.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Nothing, just, Harry is naturally submissive it seems. He was probably giving off indicators before getting a contract." Remus explains. Those were rare-usually the submissive role was in writing early, as I had thought earlier. I did know that that wasn't what I wanted but I also didn't know that they would pick up on it quickly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Oh, so you're going to be okay with it," Sirius says a little surprised. When I nod he grins.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Well then let's sign it and you need to write the formal agreement. After the 48 hour wait, you can go back to the burrow." He says cheerfully. I want to groan. I had forgotten about that rule.</span>
