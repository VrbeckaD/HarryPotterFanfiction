    <p>She pulled at the hem of the crimson fabric, just trying to find something to do with her hands. She'd never been a fan of the color red, but the memo said to wear your house colors. So here she was, a flowing red gown on, matching with shimmering gold jewelry.</p>
<p>	"You look so--b--beautiful." Ron slurred next to her, slumping onto her shoulder. His breath lingered in her ear, wreaking of bourbon and whiskey.</p>
<p>	"Merlin." She sighed weakly, half-heartedly pushing him off. "You smell like regret." She murmured, almost to herself.</p>
<p>	"Oh yeah babe." He pulled out a small flask, taking a pull from it. "That's me. Your big giant regret." he hissed, barely able to stand up.</p>
<p>	She wanted to fight back, but she really just didn't have the heart. It wasn't like he was wrong. He was right, and they both knew it.</p>
<p>	"You need to go home." She muttered, pulling out her phone, ready to call him a cab.</p>
<p>	"No!" He lazily snapped, gently pushing her away. "I'm--m--I'm gonna find Harry." He stuttered, walking away. Normally, she would go after him, for fear he would hurt himself, but she didn't want to. Not this time. Not at their class reunion. And not when she was in front of everyone she knew. She already felt like a disappointment to her year, marrying a washed up drunk like Ron, on top of the fact that she decided to work for The Ministry. Working there was a giant waste of her potential, and she knew it. She wanted to do visionary work, she'd wanted to lead--to make a difference. And here she was, a foreign dignitary. Or as Ron liked to call her--a glorified translator.</p>
<p>	She walked to the bar, needing something to take the edge off. Normally she wasn't a drinker, but tonight, she felt like she deserved it.</p>
<p>	"Vodka martini. Extra dry." She sighed, the bartender nodding casually.</p>
<p>	She looked around The Great Hall, remembering all the great times they'd had in here as adolescents. All the great times, and all the bad times. She remembered the first ball they went to, even then, Ron had a jealous streak. She also remembered after the Battle of Hogwarts, when hundreds of wounded students laid on this floor. Some of them never got up.</p>
<p>	Everyone else seemed like they were having a great time, and just for once, she wished she knew someone who was as miserable as her.</p>
<p>	And just like that, she'd spotted Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>	He was sitting at the edge of the bar, sipping a drink all alone. </p>
<p>	She hadn't spoken to him since they were 17, and even then, it wasn't a pleasant conversation. But if the gossip she'd heard was true, his wife, Astoria Greengrass, was very sick--on the verge of dying sick.</p>
<p>	She studied his frame for a moment. He was paler than she remembered, his under-eye bags almost grey. He looked like a hollow shell, and she couldn't help but feel bad. </p>
<p>	And in an odd stroke of courage, she stood from her stool, walking over to him.</p>
<p>	He barely moved his head, just staring at the brushed wood of the bar. Before she could get a word in, he spoke.</p>
<p>	"Granger." His voice was raspy and tired. It took her a minute to recover from his tone. This was far from the confident, cocky, charismatic young man she used to know. His voice lacked the edge and scrutiny that it used to have.</p>
<p>	"Hello, Draco." she murmured. "Mind if I sit?" she asked, trying to keep up a positive tone.</p>
<p>	"Well, my night can't get worse, so I suppose I could take a gamble on your company." He sighed, taking another sip of the drink. There was a hint of the Malfoy she remembered, pessimistic and anti-social. So, she sat down.</p>
<p>	"So, how have you been?" She asked, and he finally looked up at her. His eyes were an alarming slate green, almost grey. </p>
<p>	"I'm breathing air, I have a job, and I have a home. I'm fine." He muttered, not holding her gaze for long.</p>
<p>	"Those things aren't mutually exclusive." She smiled weakly, searching for his gaze again.</p>
<p>	"Granger, don't try to be a therapist. You're much too logical for it."</p>
<p>	"Some would argue that the best therapists are actually the most logical."</p>
<p>	"Those people would be wrong. The best therapists give peace of mind, which sometimes means entertaining the patient's illogical ideas."</p>
<p>	"But sometimes a logical mind is the only one who can offer tranquility to a person. Giving people facts and not fiction can sometimes be very reassuring." She finished, a small smile on her face.</p>
<p>	"Granger. Still as stubborn as ever." He murmured, and she swore she saw a ghost of a smile on his face, his eyes with a very small light behind them. </p>
<p>	They sat in silence for a moment, just enjoying a comfortable silence.</p>
<p>	"You look like you could use a dance." She added, a playful smile on her face.</p>
<p>	"Us two? We'd look like a Christmas float." he pointed to his forest green suit, motioning from it to her dress.</p>
<p>	"Come on." She smiled fully now. "It'll be fun."</p>
<p>	He let a smile slip on his face, just staring at her.</p>
<p>	"You're really gonna forget how horribly I treated you, and everything that I did to all your friends, and ask me for a dance? Perhaps you should be wearing yellow if you're going to be that forgiving." He breathed, leaning in a little. </p>
<p>	Suddenly, the air around her got colder, goosebumps rising up her arms. She felt his eyes on her, not like before, but different now. His eyes were analytical, piercing, possessive. She felt uneasy, but she shook it off, setting her jaw and leaning in towards him.</p>
<p>	"You were practically a child--in very unfortunate circumstances. I am willing to forgive for the price of only one dance." She muttered back, a smirk settling on her features. She didn't know if she meant what she said, but he looked like he hadn't had a good time in several years. He deserved this.</p>
<p>	There was a pause in his expression, like he was having trouble deciding what he should do.</p>
<p>	Suddenly, she stood, grabbing his hand and pulling him from the stool.</p>
<p>	"Granger." He let out a breath, looking almost nervous. "You're certainly in rare form tonight." He snickered, smiling again.</p>
<p>	She pulled him onto the floor, the string quartet just beginning another sonata. </p>
<p>	They were surrounded by couples that they remembered well, all gliding across the floor gracefully.</p>
<p>	"You still remember the dance lesson from McGonagall?" She laughed, taking his hand in hers.</p>
<p>	"I only remember Potter having to dance with her." he laughed, standing up tall and pulling her closer.</p>
<p>	Slowly, he snaked an arm around her waist, gripping her with an unfamiliar confidence. He looked down at her, beginning to lead her across the floor. His eyes were still cold, but they were kinder--like an abused animal that just didn't have the heart to bite.</p>
<p>	They began to attract attention, other couples stopping to watch the fabled foes. </p>
<p>	Draco didn't care though, just continuing to gracefully turn her and pull her across the ballroom floor. </p>
<p>	They moved like two swans gliding across the loose waves of a lake. She couldn't stop staring into his slate green stare--intense and never wavering. Like lighting a match deep in her chest, a fire began to burn.</p>
<p>	She felt her breath catching in her throat, almost like she couldn't breathe. She was getting caught up in the moment, beginning to have wild thoughts and feelings for her once sworn enemy. The music seemed to speed up, and she felt like she couldn't follow. Her face must have shown it, Draco's expression twitching just slightly into one of concern. Suddenly, she tripped over her own feet.</p>
<p>	There was a collective gasp in the room as he leaned in, and she fell squarely in his taught embrace.</p>
<p>	Claps began to ensue as they just stared at each other, seemingly out of breath. Draco quickly pulled her up, a loose smile on his face.</p>
<p>	"Not bad, Granger. Not bad at all." He grinned, Hermione's face beginning to blush a dark pink.</p>
<p>	Almost as if he was cued, Ron stumbled forward, pushing Draco back firmly.</p>
<p>	"The hell you think you're doin', mate?" he grumbled, as Hermione pushed him back.</p>
<p>	"Ron!" She hissed, standing between the two men.</p>
<p>	"What do you want, dirtbag?" Draco snapped, trying to square up.</p>
<p>	"Oi! Watch who you're calling a dirtbag--you--d--dirtbag!" Ron stuttered between burps. Draco rolled his eyes, crossing his arms over his chest.</p>
<p>	Hermione heard snickers coming from people in the room, and she clenched her teeth tight, anger flushing her features. </p>
<p>	"Babe--is--is this douche bothering you?" Ron stammered, falling into Hermione's arms. Quickly she pushed him off, letting him fall to the floor. Now, people began to laugh out loud, whispering under their breath. </p>
<p>	Hermione looked around her, seeing the amused smile on everyone's faces, feeling tears build up in her eyes. She tried to hold it back as best she could, for fear of making it worse.</p>
<p>	"Ron, we're leaving." She grimaced, practically dragging him out of the ballroom. </p>
<p>	She shot one last glance over her shoulder, catching the apologetic and guilty eyes of Draco Malfoy. </p>
<p>	And for some reason, she longed to see him again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>	The next morning, Hermione was making herself a bowl of cereal, watching news on their television. She heard groans coming from the bathroom, but she couldn't care less. For the embarrassment he'd caused last night, she hoped he never recovered from this hangover.</p>
<p>	But alas, he walked out of their suite, slowly trudging into the living room.</p>
<p>	"Good morning." She muttered, not even looking up from the TV.</p>
<p>	He mumbled something incoherent in response, walking to get a water from the fridge before sitting down across from her.</p>
<p>	"I heard you crying last night." he spoke honestly, which was the one thing she knew he could be.</p>
<p>	She barely looked up from the TV, just glancing over for a moment.</p>
<p>	"Well, you caused a scene last night in front of everyone I care about. Sorry if I was a little upset." She shot back with an icy tone, taking in another spoonful of the cereal.</p>
<p>	"It wouldn't be a big deal if this was the first night you'd been up crying."</p>
<p>	"Ron, you don't know what you're talking about."</p>
<p>	"To hell I don't know! I can't sleep with you sobbing right next to me!"</p>
<p>	"The least you could do is roll your ass over and comfort me!"</p>
<p>	"What do you want me to do?!" He shrieked, finally topping her volume. "Honestly, Hermione, what do you want from me? I've tried to comfort you and you push me away, you don't want me around, we never just hang out anymore, and you're embarrassed to take me ANYWHERE!" he finished, becoming red in the face.</p>
<p>	"I don't love you, Ron." She murmured, almost inaudible. </p>
<p>	"What did you just say?" His tone was low and dangerous as he inched his way towards her.</p>
<p>	"I don't love you, Ron." She spoke with confidence this time. "I don't love you." she shot him an icy glare, watching as his face went from shocked to furious. "I resent you. I resent this marriage. And I resent myself for ever letting you marry me." she spat, standing up. </p>
<p>	For a moment, she was afraid Ron would hit her, but he just deflated, like an inflatable with no air. He slumped into his own frame, silently retreating back to the bedroom.</p>
<p>	She sighed heavily, still buzzing from her statements. Then, she checked her watch, cursing the fact that she was supposed to be at The Ministry in an hour. </p>
<p>	Quickly, she dressed, flooing from the fireplace to The Ministry's large entrance.</p>
<p>	Her heels clicked down the halls, rushing to her office.</p>
<p>	"Mrs. Weasley." Someone spoke behind her, and she almost didn't respond to that name. But luckily, she turned around quickly, seeing her boss.</p>
<p>	"Mr. Xavier. I'm so sorry I was late, I promise it won't happen again." She apologized, setting her bag on her desk.</p>
<p>	The man looked at her with disdain, shaking his head.</p>
<p>	"That's not why I came. I need you to run some paperwork down to the Ministry of Defense." he sighed, setting a stack of folders on her desk.</p>
<p>	"Mr. Xavier, isn't this Maggie's job?" She asked carefully. Maggie was the secretary for the office, and this just seemed like something that was below Hermione's pay grade.</p>
<p>	"I'm asking you to do it." He hissed, shutting the door heavily behind him. </p>
<p>	She swept the stray hairs out of her face, and gathered up the folders, heading back down the halls towards the Ministry of Defense.</p>
<p>	She approached the front desk, setting the heavy stack down.</p>
<p>	"Hello, this is from Commissioner Xavier at the Ministry of Foreign Relations." She smiled down at the woman behind the desk, and the woman nodded. </p>
<p>	Hermione looked up, catching a nameplate on the plaque of associates. Right in front of her face, the name stood out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>	Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>	"Excuse me?" she asked the receptionist, walking back over to the desk. "Could you tell me where Draco Malfoy's office is?" </p>
<p>	She knew she shouldn't investigate, she should just turn around and go back to her job, but this--him--it was so enticing. </p>
<p>	"It's down that hall to the left." the receptionist motioned, and Hermione took off in that direction. "Wait, you can't just go in there, you have to schedule an appointment." the woman barked at Hermione.</p>
<p>	"Watch me." Hermione spoke, flashing her badge at the other woman. </p>
<p>	Hermione was never like this. She would always make appointments, and follow rules. But something about the encounter last night just begged her down the hall, pushing her right up to his door.</p>
<p>	As luck would have it, there was no one in there, just Draco, reading a paper and drinking brandy.</p>
<p>	She rose her hand to knock, but hesitated for a moment. </p>
<p>	What the hell was she doing? Why was she here? They were both married, and she should be focusing on fixing her relationship with Ron instead of running away and finding comfort in someone else's company. Stupid, god she was so stupid. </p>
<p>	She turned to walk away, when his voice came from behind her.</p>
<p>	"Granger?" He sounded a little surprised, but not as much as he should. They hadn't ever been friends, and they hadn't spoken in 8 years. She was a damn stranger to him, and here he was, just casually addressing her.</p>
<p>	"Oh, um, Malfoy. Hello." She stammered, turning to face him. As soon as their eyes met, his expression turned guilty again.</p>
<p>	"I--I wanted to call after last night. I wanted to make sure you were--um--and I didn't have your phone number. So. Sorry?" He barely got the words out, he was so flustered. She just nodded slowly, trying to make sense of his babbling. "Would you like to--come in?" He offered awkwardly, and she nodded again.</p>
<p>	The office was clean to a fault, every single case labeled and put away in a filing cabinet. It smelled like disinfectant, and was abnormally grey and dreary. It was the opposite of her office, which was yellows and earth tones, with a vanilla candle burning, everything in piles, in a sort of organized mess.</p>
<p>	"Wow." she mumbled, sitting in one of the chairs across from his desk.</p>
<p>	"What?" He asked, sitting down behind the desk.</p>
<p>	"It's just--super clean." She gave him a tight-lipped smile, putting her hands in her lap.</p>
<p>	He went back to sipping on the brandy, staying silent.</p>
<p>	"Isn't it a little early for a brandy?" she chuckled, and he smiled lightly.</p>
<p>	"Is there any other way to deal with the vultures in this department?" he joked, a smirk gracing her expression.</p>
<p>	There was another long silence, just the two of them sitting in verbal limbo.</p>
<p>	"Are you okay?" He asked earnestly, barely able to look up at her.</p>
<p>	"Yeah--I'm--I'm sorry about last night. Everything got a little out of hand and i--" she stumbled over the words, Draco stepping in.</p>
<p>	"When everyone started laughing, I wanted to maul your husband. With all due respect." He murmured, looking at his glass intently. </p>
<p>	"I wanted to maul my husband too." She snickered, sighing lowly.</p>
<p>	"You didn't answer my question. Are you okay?" he asked again.</p>
<p>	"Yeah, I'm fine. I always am." she muttered, looking away from him. </p>
<p>	"So why are you here?" he asked knowingly, standing up and walking around to the side of his desk, sitting down on it slowly.</p>
<p>	She stood from her spot in the chair, matching his height.</p>
<p>	"I don't know." She whispered. "After last night, I know it's stupid and I know it's wrong, but I had to see you." she finished, leaning in a little closer to him.</p>
<p>	"Granger, I've been thinking about you every second since last night." he breathed, slipping an arm around her waist, just as he had the night before.</p>
<p>	She made the first move, grabbing him at the nape of his neck and pulling his lips towards hers. With her free hand, she moved his left leg over, grabbing at the knit fabric roughly. She stood between his legs, shoving him down towards the surface of the desk.</p>
<p>	Hands were everywhere, moving too fast for her to register. They ripped the clothes off each other, Draco pulling her hair out of the loose bun and letting it fall around her shoulder. He slowed, only for a moment, just taking in the view.</p>
<p>	"You're so beautiful." He murmured, a smile creeping up onto both of their faces.</p>
<p>	For the first time in years, Hermione felt loved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	They were both panting, laying lazily on the floor of his office.</p>
<p>	"Not bad, Granger. Not bad at all." He laughed, as she let a free laugh escape her chest.</p>
<p>	"Well, Malfoy, you weren't so bad yourself." she smirked, beginning to get up and get dressed, Draco doing the same.</p>
<p>	"Listen, if you want to do this again, maybe we could go out to dinner or something?" He asked, a smile on his face.</p>
<p>	"Maybe we can figure something out." She snickered, buttoning her top.</p>
<p>	There was a pounding knock at the door, making them both jump a little. </p>
<p>	Draco hurried to put his jacket on, practically shoving Hermione behind the desk. He walked to answer the door, Hermione watching from a hole in the bottom of the desk. </p>
<p>	"Mr. Malfoy." She recognized the voice immediately. Mr. Xavier. </p>
<p>	Panic surged through her veins, as she struggled to keep her breathing quiet.</p>
<p>	"I'm looking for Mrs. Weasley. She came down to your office about an hour ago. The receptionist told me I would find her in your office." Mr. Xavier hissed, Draco sighing nonchalantly. </p>
<p>	"I'm sorry Commissioner Xavier. I haven't seen her." Draco lied with expert skill. </p>
<p>	"Well, Mr. Malfoy--she is my employee, so if you've seen her you need to tell me." He looked Draco up and down, taking in his disheveled hair and jacket.</p>
<p>	"Xavier, I'm sure I don't know what you're trying to imply." Draco began, a sickening smile on his face. "But might I remind you that you're my subordinate." His tone became lower and darker. "So next time you walk into my office unannounced, you'd better use a more professional tone. I have no problem writing you up to my superiors, considering you apparently can't keep control of your employees." Draco groveled, and for the first time in her life, she saw shock and fear on Mr. Xavier's face.</p>
<p>	"Mr. Malfoy--I--" he tried to recover, but Draco stepped in.</p>
<p>	"Get out." Draco snapped, sending Xavier practically running down the hall.</p>
<p>	As soon as the door was shut, they both broke out into laughter.</p>
<p>	"That was incredible!" Hermione chuckled, standing up, fixing her hair back up.</p>
<p>	"He's a douchebag." Draco sighed, helping her with her bag.</p>
<p>	There was a long silence where they just smiled at each other, holding an intense stare.</p>
<p>	"Well--um--I should go." She murmured, turning away from him. Just before she opened the door, he grabbed her wrist, gently pulling her into his chest.</p>
<p>	He leaned down, his lips ghosting over her own.</p>
<p>	"I want to see you again." he whispered. She nodded slowly.</p>
<p>	"I'll leave you my number." She breathed, pulling away.</p>
<p>	She scribbled her number on a stray piece of paper from her purse, leaving it for him with a smile.</p>
<p>	She bounced down the halls of The Ministry, a grin plastered on her face. As soon as she walked into the Foreign Affairs office, Xavier busted out of his office, red in the face.</p>
<p>	"Where the hell have you been?" He growled, and she didn't even look at him.</p>
<p>	"Got lost. Maybe next time, you should send Maggie." She grinned, shutting her own door behind her.</p>
<p>	She felt different after her little--situation--with Draco. She was bold, she was fulfilled, she was--happy?</p>
<p>	The rest of the day breezed by, Hermione with a unfamiliar spring in her step. She waltzed through the office, brushing off the mundane and miserable stares sent her way.</p>
<p>	Just before heading home, she felt her phone buzz, pulling it out of her purse.</p>
<p>	"Hello?" She answered quickly, not bothering to check the caller ID.</p>
<p>	"Hermione?" Harry asked, confused. "You never pick up that quick." </p>
<p>	"Oh--um--I'm waiting on an important call." She didn't lie, she just wasn't tell the whole truth.</p>
<p>	"Well, Ginny and I want you and Ron to come over for dinner." He offered, and she slumped. She hadn't thought about Ron all day, and all at once, the guilt hit her like a freight train.</p>
<p>	What had she done?</p>
<p>	"Sure thing. What time?" She continued on, trying to push the thoughts away.</p>
<p>	"6." He responded curtly. </p>
<p>	"We'll be there." She hung up the phone, gathering her things and heading down the corridors towards the floo fireplaces.</p>
<p>	She couldn't push all the thoughts out of her head, images of the past 48 hours flashing in her mind.</p>
<p>	She'd just cheated on her husband, someone she'd pledged her life to four years ago. She'd promised in front of his family, their friends, and God that she would never leave his side, and she would always be faithful to him.</p>
<p>	And yet, she'd given into the sudden temptation of Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	"C'mon sweetheart--kiss me." Ron murmured, as she turned her head away slowly.</p>
<p>	They were standing on the steps of Harry and Ginny's flat, Hermione had just knocked.</p>
<p>	Ron rolled his eyes, sighing heavily.</p>
<p>	"You can't blame me for trying, Hermione." He grumbled, both of them slapping fake smiles on their face when Ginny opened the door.</p>
<p>	"Hermione! Ron!" She chirped, hugging them both excitedly, ushering them in the door.</p>
<p>	Hermione immediately noticed the small changes in the household. Things from the upstairs office had been moved down in the living room, crowding the small space a little. She darted her eyes around the dining area, seeing the large boudoir that she'd grown fond of to be missing. Hermione was nothing if not observant, and she had to wonder what was going on here.</p>
<p>	Then she looked at Ginny, still just as beautiful as she'd always been, but there was something different. She was paler, if that was even possible, and she looked like she'd lost weight everywhere but her middle. Hermione noticed the loose fitting dress Ginny had on, and the way Harry's arm snaked protectively around her waist.</p>
<p>	Merlin's beard. This was Hermione's worst case scenario. Ron had been bugging her for years to have kids, but she knew it was a bad decision. Ron was on the verge of depression every two minutes, and he refused to get any help for it. He was a rowdy alcoholic, and above all, Hermione didn't want children. She thought they were utterly useless, and for the amount of love they provide, there were at least 35 scenarios in which they were way too much of a hassle. The means don't meet the ends.</p>
<p>	But now that Harry and Ginny were having a baby, she could only imagine the car ride back home that evening. It would be one of their many screaming matches that would end in Ron drinking himself to sleep in the basement, while Hermione did work and went to bed upstairs. </p>
<p>	Sometimes she wondered what would happen if she filed for divorce. Last time she'd tried, nearly a year ago, Ron sobbed and said he'd kill himself. He had desperation in his eyes, and Hermione felt like she had to stay.</p>
<p>	But look at them now. No physical contact, sleeping in separate beds. No conversations, nothing good at least. They were practically already divorced. Ron just didn't want to come to that realization.</p>
<p>	"Hermione?" Ginny asked, a grin on her face.</p>
<p>	Hermione snapped out of her thoughts, seeing Harry and Ron staring at her.</p>
<p>	"Yes, um, sorry." Hermione apologized awkwardly.</p>
<p>	"Did you hear what I said?" Ginny asked, Hermione shaking her head. "Harry and I are having a baby!" She squealed, and Hermione tried to muster a great reaction.</p>
<p>	"That's incredible!" Hermione smiled, but Harry and Ginny weren't buying it.</p>
<p>	"You already knew, didn't you?" Harry asked, and Hermione blushed a little.</p>
<p>	"Well, I might have clocked some small differences and made up my own conclusion." She laughed, Harry and Ginny smiling. "But nonetheless, congratulations." </p>
<p>	Dinner carried on, an uncomfortable silence settling between her and Ron. And when it was time to leave, Hermione was the first one out the door, Ron close behind. </p>
<p>	They sat in silence in the car, just listening to the low whispers of the random radio station. Hermione watched the road run away from her in the rear-view mirror, slumped over the ledge of the car.</p>
<p>	"You okay?" Ron asked eyes trained tightly on the road, and she perked up slightly.</p>
<p>	"Yeah, I'm fine." She sighed, and he stayed quiet for a moment before breaking the silence again.</p>
<p>	"Did you mean what you said this morning?" he asked bluntly, bring everything back up.</p>
<p>	"I don't regret this marriage." she murmured, trying to find the right words to express her feelings. Did she love Ron? No. Had she at one point? Yes. "It just seems like this marriage is over. We fight every moment we're together. And if we're not fighting, you're drinking."</p>
<p>	"You can't blame me for drinking. You can't even stand to look at me, Hermione." Ron shot back quickly, trying to keep his temper low.</p>
<p>	"Don't be dramatic." She huffed, Ron's anger erupting.</p>
<p>	"I love you, Hermione! I'm fighting over here, barely hanging on to something that was dead on arrival." He snapped, Hermione surprised at his admission of feeling. "I'm making it so obvious that I need help and that I am two inches from totally over the edge. I mean--bloody hell." She looked analytically at his face, studying the familiar bumps and ridges. Tears began to well up in his eyes, as he sniffed frantically. "You're all i've ever wanted, Hermione. And I just need to know--before this goes any further than it has--if you still want me. Do you want me?" He was practically begging with his tone. </p>
<p>	She couldn't feel any more guilty in this moment. </p>
<p>	Ron put nothing above Hermione, but their marriage had been doomed from the start. They just weren't meant to be together. </p>
<p>	And earlier this same day, she'd broken her vows, and given in to some stupid urge.</p>
<p>	Deep down, she knew it was more than just a stupid urge. She'd been ignoring stupid urges her whole life--she was nothing if not focused. Draco was more than just an urge. He made her feel lighter than she'd ever felt in her entire life. </p>
<p>	And then there was Ron. She felt weighed down by him, drained, smothered.</p>
<p>	"I don't want to be married to you anymore, Ron." She murmured, unable to look him in the eyes.</p>
<p>	He didn't lash out like she thought he would. He was silent, taking it in.</p>
<p>	"Ok."</p>
<p>	Hermione was shocked. That's all he had to say?</p>
<p>	"That's it? Ok?" She asked hesitantly, afraid he would bubble over and get furious.</p>
<p>	"Hermione, I'm tired of fighting. Both of us are still young, we can lead new lives. Start over. And maybe someday, we can be friends again." He whispered, Hermione seeing a few stray tears slipping down his red-tinted cheeks in the moonlight. </p>
<p>	He shot a nervous glance over at her, a small smirk on his face.</p>
<p>	"Does that sound good?" He asked, sniffling only a little. Hermione couldn't help the tears that unexpectedly began streaming down her face.</p>
<p>	Ron put the car in park as she stared at him.</p>
<p>	"That sounds good, Ron." She spoke slowly, smiling sadly and pulling him into a tight hug. They cried into each other's shoulders for what seemed like an eternity, car just sitting silently in the driveway.</p>
<p>	Memories flooded her mind--happy memories. She remembered that it hadn't always been like this. She remembered when he'd proposed to her, and how happy she'd been. She immediately started planning the wedding with Molly and Angelica and Ginny. She cried when she put on her wedding dress for the first time. She sobbed when Ron read her his vows. She laughed as he carried her over the threshold of their home for the first time. She smiled when they had movie marathons with Harry and Ginny, and she would snuggle up in his arms. She'd loved Ron. She'd experienced every beautiful thing in her young adult life with him. And before that--they were best friends. And for the life of her, she didn't know what happened.</p>
<p>	But now--it was officially over.</p>
<p>	They had both given up.</p>
