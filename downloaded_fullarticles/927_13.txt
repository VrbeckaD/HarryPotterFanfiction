  <span>“Draco! Darling! You’ve got to see this!” Pansy grabs Draco’s arm and drags him towards the telly before he can protest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Jeez, Pansy, don’t manhandle me! What is it?” Draco says, ripping his arm away as he looks at the television. The headline reads: </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’m a Git.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It’s Harry– no, it’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>Potter,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Draco thinks bitterly. He </span>
  <em>
    <span>used</span>
  </em>
  <span> to be Harry, but </span>
  <em>
    <span>now</span>
  </em>
  <span> he’s Potter. His.. ex, Draco supposes. They had a chance to come out to the Wizarding World, but Harry kept delaying it for months at a time without giving Draco a reason. Eventually, he got fed up, feeling like he was Harry’s dirty secret instead of his boyfriend.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco stares at television-Potter; he looks sad. He’s got this expression on his face that makes Draco realize that </span>
  <span>Harry’s</span>
  <span> Potter’s nervous. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Erm, hi,” Television-Potter says as he looks at the crowd of reporters. “I know you’re all wondering why you’re here. I messed up. I don’t really know how to fix it, but I know this’ll get your attention.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Potter looks at the screen then, and continues, “I know I made a mistake. But how can I fix it if you won’t answer? I miss you. You deserve someone who’s sure of what they want. I’m sure now. I was scared before but.. I want </span>
  <em>
    <span>you,</span>
  </em>
  <span> no matter what people say. I’m here, if you still want me. Come home to me, Draco. Please, come home.”</span>
