    <p>It was Monday morning, and Luna was zoned out staring at a picture of Ginny she taped into her book. It may be creepy, but Luna doesn’t care what anyone else thinks. “Luna!” Luna heard Raven’s voice across the Ravenclaw common room. “Are you staring at that picture again?” Raven said a little quieter. “N-no!” Luna stuttered. Raven raised her eyebrows and said, “Tell me the truth.” Luna gave up and said, “Fine...I am...” Raven playfully rolled her eyes and whispered,”You have to tell her at some point. She feels the same y’know.” Luna gasped and muttered “How would you know...?” Raven winked and said, “You think you’re my only friend? Ginny told me.” Luna sighed and said, “I’m going to bed..” Raven rolled her eyes and muttered, “night.” \(OwO)/ (A/N) how’d I do on my first fic?? Please be nice about it.</p>
