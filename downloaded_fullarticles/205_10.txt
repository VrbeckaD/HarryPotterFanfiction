    <p>James stood in the kitchen, wearing nothing but an apron and flannel pants, flipping pancakes and sipping on his mug of earl grey. His eyes lit up as Albus’ owl flew through the window, and threw it a few treats before ripping open the letter. It read:</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Dear James, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I was right about Alice. You can give me the Galleons when we have dinner at your flat. Scorp says hi. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Cheers, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Albus </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I could get used to this.” said Teddy, from the doorway. James turned and smirked at him before setting his mug and letter down, and turning off the stove. He stepped over the threshold and into Teddy’s arms, inhaling the scent he had after a shower; sweet lavender soap and rosey shampoo, mixed with the sharp scent of his sandalwood aftershave and an underlying scent of something that smelt of <em> Teddy </em>.</p><p>When they kissed, Teddy tasted of toothpaste and James of tea, tongues mingling in each other’s mouths, just enough to finish waking James up for the day. No matter the fact that they had slept next to each other the night before, that they had seen each other not thirty minutes ago, they still  basked in each other’s presence.</p><p>Teddy loosened his grip on James as James pulled him towards the breakfast table, setting down a tray of pancakes and eggs. They ate in relative silence, playing footsie under the table and talking about their plans for the day. James was going to the Pitch for self-regulated practice for an hour or two, and then he was going to Diagon to meet with his teammates for ‘bonding’. Teddy was taking a portkey to Romania for the day, working with Charlie on their litter of Nifflers. </p><p>James left first, flooing to the Puddlemere Pitch, which left Teddy to carry out his actual plans for the day. He threw out the old boot that James thought was his ‘portkey’, grabbed his car keys, and drove to the Potter’s house. He was greeted by Ginny, palms sweating, and explained his plans to her. She nearly burst into tears, gave him her blessing, and sent him back out the door. His plan was in action. Now all he had to do was execute it. </p><p>James was tired. He was sore from practice, wiped out from walking around Diagon all day, and annoyed at his teammates for being rude to their fans. He stepped through the fireplace, expecting to have to make himself pot noodles before falling asleep on the sofa waiting for Teddy’s portkey home. What he saw surprised him. Teddy was standing in the kitchen, stirring a pot on the stove, humming along to the wireless.</p><p>“Ted?” James asked. Teddy turned round and smiled. He put down the spoon and pulled James into an embrace. When Teddy pulled back, James was smiling. “I didn’t think you’d be back until late.”</p><p>Teddy smiled. “I caught an early Portkey home. Thought I’d make dinner.” He gestured to the stove. </p><p>“What did I do to deserve you?” James sighed.</p><p>They sat next to each other on the couch, enjoying bowls of home-cooked pasta and meatballs, James laid his head on Teddy’s shoulder, Teddy pressed occasional kisses to James’ hair, and they sat there, wondering how they ever got so lucky. They fell asleep like that, tangled together on the couch, dirty bowls on the coffee table, dreaming of what was to come. </p><p align="center">~✨~</p><p> </p><p>Teddy’s palms were sweating. This was possibly the most nervous he’d ever been. What is he said no? What if he left Teddy? What if he hated the idea? There were so many possibilities.</p><p>The space behind Greenhouse Three was lush, sloping, green hills that backed up to the forbidden forest. When they were first together and Teddy was living in Hogsmeade, they would come here, to walk, or have picnics, or meet with Al and Lily. It became their spot. </p><p>It was back there that they had said their first ‘I love you’s. That they had first kissed. There were so many memories packed into those hills, from their time at Hogwarts spent apart, their time dating spent together, it seemed only right to Teddy that he should propose there. </p><p>After making sure that no students were lurking behind the walls, and that Professor Longbottom would make sure that no one went back there, Teddy aparated to the edge of the forest when James was waiting for him. They grasped hands and walked in relative silence, boots crunching on the gravel of the winding path. Once they reached the greenhouse however, Teddy started talking. </p><p>“Jamie,” he started. “You’ve been a constant in my life since I was six years old. Even when our age gap seemed to stretch on for an eternity, you were always there, in some corner of my life, making everything just a bit better. And, these past few years, being with you, it’s only reminded me that I can’t live without you. You’ve shown me that someone as mixed up and messed up as me could fall in love. You proved to me that true love does exist. And I don’t think I could exist without you.”</p><p>James had tears in his eyes. Teddy took a deep breath and continued. “James, you mean everything to me. Will you marry me?” </p><p>James’ tears broke free from his eyes and he launched himself at Teddy, yelling. “YES! Yes,  yes, of course yes!” </p><p>James’ latched his arms around Teddy’s neck, and they fell into each other, stumbling and kissing, an emotional mass of limbs and tears. With that, Teddy pushed the ring onto James’ finger and Al, Scorpius, Lily, Alice, Harry, Ginny, and Professor Longbottom exploded from inside the Greenhouse, and pressed the couple into an enormous hug. </p><p align="center">~✨~</p><p> </p><p>He was close. An inch, maybe two. One second more, then:</p><p>“Potter gets the snitch, winning the cup for England with a score of 796 to 654!” The explosion of sound seemed to press down on James as he circled the pitch, his teammates came crashing down on him with incredible force, and they hit the ground in a tangle hug, sweat mixing with tears.</p><p>The player’s families were streaming onto the field, mediwizards and coaches following close behind. Ginny had tears streaming down her face, Harry was yelling himself hoarse, Lily and Alice were jumping up in the air and screaming, Albus and Scorp were possibly crying harder than Ginny, the Weasleys were all screaming. James was pulled into the mass of his family, crushed in an innumerable amount of hugs, and clapped on the back so many times that he was sure he’d have a bruise there tomorrow. </p><p>He stuffed his gloves into his pocket to shake hands with his Aunt Hermione, (As the minister) and finally, finally, he saw Teddy. He was standing in the back of the crowd, his smile incredibly wide, his hair a blazing turquoise blue. James stumbled into his arms, letting Teddy’s warm limbs and familiar scent envelop him. </p><p>“We won,” James whispered, tears streaming down his face. Teddy brushed a finger across his cheek.</p><p>“Yeah,” he smiled. “We won.”</p><p>When they kissed, James’ gloveless hane exposed his ring, shining brightly in the sun, visible against Teddy’s blue hair. They didn’t care about the cameras going off, didn’t care that the whole country would know about their engagement by the next morning. They couldn’t care less.</p><p>
