    <p><em>This schoolboy crush is getting out of hand, </em>Draco thought to himself with a frown. There had been loads of signs for it too, though he had ignored all of them. It wasn’t <em>just </em>that Draco had taken to researching the mechanics and physics of skateboarding as well as multiple tricks, in order to somehow impress Harry with his knowledge. Should the two somehow ever be in the same vicinity long enough and Harry somehow <em>ask </em>Draco anything to do with skateboarding. Nor was it even the fact that Draco had taken to studying the meaning of the constellation tattoo that took up much of Harry’s right arm. <em>Sirius. </em>It wasn’t even that Draco had taken to learning Harry’s favorite choice in alcohol, <em>vodka, </em>or even his favorite brand of cigarette <em>Camel </em>(though he would take whatever he could get). No, none of these had been clear enough indicators that Draco was just a touch obsessed with Hogwarts High’s resident bad boy; the true indicator that he was in trouble and too far gone was when he had received a pop quiz back from his history teacher (one of the few classes he happened to share with Harry no less) to find he had received a D.</p>
<p>Draco stared at the quiz, certain there was some sort of mistake. He had never had a D before. He always did well in all of his classes, especially something as simple as history. But there it was, the answers he had circled right next to the clearly correct ones. He groaned and eyed the date trying to remember if it held any significance in terms of Potter-related knowledge. November 1st. Nothing in particular came to mind, although that <em>was </em>the day after Halloween. Harry had come in plastered out of his skull that Halloween, and he’d clearly been hungover the day after. Draco had been worried, not that he could <em>say </em>as much. He had wanted to offer some form of comfort, even in the form of an aspirin, but therein lied the trouble. Harry and Draco weren’t friends. They had never been friends. Harry didn’t even know that Draco existed, let alone that he was terribly smitten with the other boy. Draco was fairly certain if pressed Harry wouldn’t even know his name. He had hoped against hope that somehow the bad boy might need a tutor, but as it turned out Harry was rather smart himself, he just didn’t care enough to show it. He always got decent grades on his own tests and quizzes, though he rarely handed in any work of his own. Draco sighed. He was going to have to be more clever going forward, he decided. More subtle and less, obsessed. He could ill afford another D besmirching his record. Draco was nothing if not a smart boy, surely he could handle this crush with more intelligence than he had shown thus far.</p>
<p>By his sixth-period gym class, Draco had taken to his usual routine, skipping the mile in favor of sneaking towards the back of the school where Harry and his friends liked to skate and smoke. Draco remained tucked away, just far enough that he could remain unseen by the group, but close enough that he could almost make out the timber of Harry’s laughter. He couldn’t help but imagine what it might feel like for Harry to bestow some of the laughter on him. Not at his expense as others had, but because of something amusing Draco had said. The very thought warmed Draco to his core. He leaned over, trying to get a good look, as Harry hopped onto his board and began a series of intricate tricks. Each one more interesting than the last. Leaping into the air, Harry’s board flipped beneath his feet landing perfectly on its wheels just as he landed back on the board. <em>A perfect kickflip</em> Draco thought impressed. He had learned the terms well enough, and though he was certain he could never hope to recreate them, watching Harry gave him no end in joy. Beside Harry, a girl with blood red hair and a stud in her nose, threw her head back in a laugh at something her pink haired girlfriend had said. Actually, Draco wasn’t certain they were dating, they were merely close friends. If he was honest with himself, the rumor seemed to be that Harry and the girl with blood red hair, Ginny, were dating. The thought stabbed at Draco’s heart more than he could bear to say. Harry did another trick, this one, Draco wasn’t sure he knew the name of. For a brief moment, Harry’s board wobbled and Draco thought he might fall. Not for the first time Draco watched helplessly, and nervously. At the last moment Harry righted himself on his board and Draco let out a quiet sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“What have we got here then, eh?” said a voice from behind Draco. Draco turned on his heel, his heart racing in his chest when he saw Ron Weasley standing behind him. Ron was Harry’s best mate, and very protective of him. Draco swallowed.</p>
<p>“I… erm…”</p>
<p>Ron grabbed his arm and dragged him out of his hiding place, shouting over to Harry and his group, “Look here boys, we caught ourselves a rat!”</p>
<p>Draco groaned. He wished he had taken his father up on the offer for self defense lessons, it seemed undignified at the best of times, but given the fact that Ron was currently dragging him towards what felt like his certain doom as suddenly all eyes were locked on him, he wished more than anything that he could get away. With a hard shove in the back, Draco fell to his knees in front of Harry, Ginny, and several other of Harry’s friends, most of whom Draco didn’t know the names of yet.</p>
<p>“Why were you spying on us?” Ginny demanded. Draco couldn’t bear the thought of seeing the hatred in Harry’s eyes so he merely stared down at the ground, awaiting his fate.</p>
<p>“Seems like he’s trying to get us in trouble,” shouted one of the boys.</p>
<p>“We should teach him a lesson!” shouted another. Draco swallowed, squeezing his eyes shut, waiting for the first blow, but it never came. He waited tensely, his heart pounding in his ears, the only sound he could hear at present, certain his beating was coming at any moment. After what had felt like an eternity, Draco squinted an eye open and looked up at Harry, who was standing over him, his arms folded across his chest. Draco looked around, Ron had gone, as had several of the other boys, and Ginny. Draco looked up nervously, realizing then that he was the most alone he had ever been with Harry Potter, and he was still on his knees. He swallowed hard. Many a fantasy had started like this, but he had the sneaking suspicion this would not end like they did.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” Harry demanded, coldly. Draco sighed.</p>
<p>“I was just… watching,” he said, barely above a whisper.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I…” Draco swallowed. He didn’t dare reveal his true feelings for Harry. “I like watching you skate,” he said. Harry stared down at him, somewhat confused, and Draco carried on, it was as close as he could get to the truth. “It looks… cool. I don’t… father would never permit me to do such a thing. So I like to watch you guys. You all look so… free,” he hadn’t realized until the words had come out of his mouth why exactly he was so fascinated with it. Yes, Harry was a large part of his obsession, but there was something else there too. Something about Harry and how carefree he always seemed. He was always smiling, always laughing with his friends, as though he hadn’t a care in the world. As though he didn’t have so many family expectations on his shoulders. Harry frowned then.</p>
<p>“Would you…” he scratched the back of his neck then. “Would you care to join us?”</p>
<p>Draco’s eyes snapped up from the floor up to Harry’s. He looked, so earnest, so kind, Draco thought he might faint. “I wouldn’t know the first thing about skateboarding. I’m not even sure I’m well balanced,” he tried not to laugh at how true that statement felt these days.</p>
<p>Harry smiled, one of those warm smiles that Draco had only ever dreamed of having directed at him. “I could show you,” he said. “It’s really not that hard. Once you get used to it.”</p>
<p>Draco swallowed, Harry held out his hand then and Draco took it, letting Harry help him to his feet. He was a lot stronger than Draco had expected, and it was all he could do not to fall straight into Harry’s arms. <em>There</em><em>’ll be time for swooning later, </em>Draco told himself. He barely wanted to let go of Harry’s hand as he got to his feet. Harry smirked, and in that smirk, lay the promise of a friendship Draco had never expected.</p>
