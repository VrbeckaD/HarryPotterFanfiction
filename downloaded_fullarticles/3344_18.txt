    <p>From the beginning, it was readily apparent that of the trio, Hermione Granger was the smartest of them. Hell, she was the smartest of all of them. </p><p>Harry, of course, was the quiet, brave one. The dark horse. The one with the power to defeat the dark lord. The Boy Who Lived. The legend.</p><p>It is to be noted, however, that Ronald Bilius Weasley, often written off as The Other One, the best friend, or That Other Weasley, was also very smart. Just...not Hermione smart. </p><p>This is the story of Ronald Weasley, and his not insignificant amount of brains. </p><p>***</p><p>When Ron first met Harry, he first noticed the scar. The he noticed his judgement and bravery in standing up to Malfoy, that inbred loon. Then, he noticed his kindness over their shared every flavor beans. </p><p>After their first week, he noticed that Harry was not able to defend himself against loons like Malfoy. </p><p>“Harry, there’s something that I’m going to teach you,” Ron said one day. “It’s very important. I was taught this by my brother before me, and he by his brother before him. Since you have no brother, I will teach you how to throw a punch.”</p><p>Harry was an eager student, even if Hermione scoffed and muttered about silly boys, always hitting things. Ron just clicked his tongue and looked pityingly at Hermione. </p><p>“It’s because you don’t have a brother either. Brothers are supposed to teach you these things. Don’t you want to learn how to punch?”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes lit up at the word ‘learn’, and just like that, Ron had his first two pupils. </p><p>***</p><p>Later in the year, Harry remembered Ron’s lessons and punched Quirrell in the privates, and thus saved the philosopher’s stone. </p><p>Harry’s final thought before passing out was that Ron was going to be so pleased when he heard about the knockout punch that felled Quirrelmort. </p><p>***</p><p>“Do you really think that I could be the heir of Slytherin?” Harry asked Ron quietly one night.</p><p>Ron hoisted himself up on his elbows and looked critically at Harry. “Nah. But if you’re ever going to be evil, tell me in advance so that I can plan our escape, yeah? And Hermione, we’ll have to bribe her with so many books to convince her to run away from school.”</p><p>Harry chuckled weakly. “Thanks Ron.”</p><p>“Goodnight, mate. We can hiss at some Slytherins in the morning.”</p><p>***</p><p>“Ron, I can hear these awful voices threatening to rip and tear-,” Harry whispered agitatedly.</p><p>Ron patted Harry on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, mate. It’s probably just me thinking about chicken dinner on Wednesdays.”</p><p>“-and kill!” </p><p>“Probably me thinking about Malfoy. Sometimes the lake looks so tempting, y’know?”</p><p>It was enough to startle Harry into giggles, and Ron smiled and shelved his concern away for a later date, when Harry was feeling better. Right now, Harry was alright, and it was enough.</p><p>***</p><p>“With Sirius Black after you, Harry, I was thinking that you need some more training,” Ron remarked one evening. </p><p>“What with?”</p><p>“Here,” Ron said, standing up, “this is how you knee a bloke in the nuts...”</p><p>***</p><p>Sirius was sore, but still happy at seeing his godson hale and hearty, and strong enough to fight dirty.</p><p>“Just like me,” he said, wiping a tear of pain that had escaped his eye. “A chip of the old block. Moony, did you see?”</p><p>“Sigh.”</p><p>***</p><p>Harry kicked Peter Pettigrew in the gonads and aided in his successful capture. He tried to kick a dementor too, but found out that they didn’t have gonads.</p><p>***</p><p>Ron felt his jealousy ebb away as Harry sniffled miserably, his knees tucked up under his chin. “I hate this. I just want to have a normal life.”</p><p>Ron had a brainwave. “Aw, it’s alright, mate,” he said, slinging an arm around Harry’s shoulder. “We can totally rebel. That’s a normal teenage thing to do.”</p><p>Harry smiled tearfully at Ron. “Really? How?”</p><p>“I dunno,” Ron confessed, “but I’ll ask Fred and George.”</p><p>***</p><p>“Potter’s being called for the weighing of the wands, sir.”</p><p>“Fine,” Snape spat. “Potter, take your things and get out of my sight.”</p><p>Ron nudged Harry frantically. “Now! Rebel!”</p><p>“Actually,” Harry said, standing up, “I’d rather stay and finish my potion, sir,” he declared boldly. “I choose to rebel against this farce of a tournament and focus on my education instead.”</p><p>Ron sighed. He’d have to teach Harry how to rebel properly. Meanwhile, Hermione and the Ravenclaws were looking up at Harry as though he was their messiah. </p><p>Even Snape looked taken aback. “Well,” he said at last, “it seems that my efforts to normalize you have successfully deflated your big head, Potter,” he grinned. “You may stay and finish your potion. Creevey,” he directed the boy at the door, “you heard him. Go away.”</p><p>Harry sat back down and several Ravenclaw hands reached out to touch him or stroke him adoringly. Hermione beamed like a proud hen. But Harry only had eyes for Ron, and looked askance at him. </p><p>Ron smiled and nodded, despite his friend’s newfound swotty admirers. As long as Harry was happy, it would have to do.</p><p>***</p><p>“I can’t believe that that stupid Skeeter can get away with publishing this tripe!” Harry seethed at the latest article, proclaiming that Harry was a heartbreaking casanova, stringing along four girls including Hermione (blergh) to take to the Yule Ball. </p><p>Ron thought about the issue and not upon an idea. “I have an idea, mate. Just play along.”</p><p>***</p><p>“Yes, Harry and I are very happy together,” Ron said to Xenophilus Lovegood, and made a show of holding Harry’s hand. “We’re in love and are shocked at the tripe that that Skeepter woman puts out.”</p><p>Lovegood scribbled on his notepad furiously, eager to get the relevant inside scoop for once. “Is this true, Mr Potter?”</p><p>Harry nodded eagerly. “Oh yes, Ron and I are very much a couple. In fact, we’re going to the Yule Ball together. We’re even doing a robe swap just so that we can show how much we love each other. Ron,” he said soulfully, turning to his best friend, “I’m so lucky to have you.”</p><p>Ron was choked up at Harry’s dress robes swap plan. He was really an awesome friend. “Same here, mate. Same here.”</p><p>***</p><p>Mrs Weasley sent an emotional owl to the pair of them, telling them how proud she was and how Harry would be her little boy regardless of whatever happened. </p><p>Rita Skeeter was shamed, and Xenophilus Lovegood managed to earn a Wizarding Pulitzer for his hard hitting, truthful account of two boys finding love despite all odds. </p><p>Sirius sent a crass, congratulatory letter to Harry, with a reasonable postscript from Lupin, who wrote about how proud he was regarding their emotional maturity, you could learn a thing or two, Sirius.</p><p>Despite all of these good things, there were consequences.</p><p>***</p><p>“Potter, Weasley, stay behind,” Snape grunted after class one day. Ron and Harry waddled over to his desk nervously. </p><p>“Yes sir?”</p><p>Snape sighed heavily. “Madam Pomfrey is occupied with treating the stomach flu that has spread around the school that has even struck down your head of house. As such, the Headmaster has somehow made it my responsibility to tell you this.</p><p>“Potter,” Snape said severely, “you are fourteen years old. You are not to bed Weasley, is that clear?”</p><p>Harry squeaked in horror. </p><p>“They are a fertile family,” Snape continued, “and it will not do for the Hogwarts champion to fall pregnant in the middle of the tournament. Unless you want your abdomen to play host to a dozen squalling ginger infants, you will stay clear away from your partner’s...appendages, until you are of age.”</p><p>Snape’s eyes took on a sharp gleam. “Your newfound academic prowess has been reflected in your improving grades, and I will not be pleased if your youthful dalliance breaks this new streak, is that clear, Potter?”</p><p>“Yessir,” Harry mumbled. “Stay away from Ron’s yoohoo until we’re adults or have a lot of Weasley babies. Got it, sir.”</p><p>Snape nodded. “This has pained me as much as it has you. Now go away, Potter. I will speak to Weasley alone.”</p><p>Harry looked up at Ron with tortured eyes. “Ron, I’ll wait for you!”</p><p>“Harry, be safe, mate! Run!”</p><p>Snape sighed. Why was this his life. “Potter, out!” He said, banishing Harry from his classroom. He turned to face Ron. “Now, Weasley, we will speak of The Two C’s. What are they?”</p><p>“Er...cocks, and...cuddling?”</p><p>Snape wanted to cry. “Contraception and consent. Take a seat, Weasley.”</p><p>Ron paled, but did as he was told. Anything for Harry.</p><p>***</p><p>Later, Ron was finally back in the Gryffindor common room, and Harry came running up to him. “Oh, Ron! You’re back! Was it horrible?”</p><p>Ron steeled himself for his best mate. “I survived,” he said stoically. Then he looked at Harry. “Harry, if this was too much for you, then I’ll understand if you want to break off our fake relationship.”</p><p>Harry’s eyes gleamed emotionally. “It was never fake for me, Ron.”</p><p>Ron’s heart thudded in his chest. “Me too, mate. Me too.”</p><p>Hermione was scoffing with as much phlegm as she could muster at the two oblivious idiots finally realizing their love for each other. Fred and George tried to do the heimlich maneuver on her and were jinxed for trying. </p><p>***</p><p>When they showed up at the Yule Ball, Dumbledore gave Harry ten points for his fantastic fashion sense. Malfoy nearly died on the spot. </p><p>It was the happiest day of Ron’s life. </p><p>***</p>
