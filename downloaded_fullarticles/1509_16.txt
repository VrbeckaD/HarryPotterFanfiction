    <p>“What do you think Potter would do this time around?” Fred asked you and George whilst popping a red jelly bean in his mouth. He sighed in delight – it was cranberry-flavoured.</p><p>While the twins were opposite to you in the train cabin, taking turns in tasting all the Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans you have bought for them, you let your eyes wander outside the frosted glass window. “Something idiotic. That’s for sure.” You moaned.</p><p>While being best friends with the most notorious pranksters in Hogwarts came with a bit of trouble, it doesn’t compare to what the Golden Trio has gotten into for the past two years. You thought this school year wouldn’t be different.</p><p>“Oh, cheer up, love. We both know you’re just jealous you’re not part of the action.” George winked at you. While technically correct, you were more exasperated than jealous at the trio’s doings.</p><p>You playfully shoved George. “Come on, Georgie. They could have easily avoided all that trouble with Quirrell and the Basilisk if they stopped to ask for help from the other professors. I hope Potter comes to his senses somehow before Sirius Black finds him.”</p><p>“Ah, but where is the fun in that?” Fred cheekily replied. You rolled your eyes at them and continued watching the trees pass by.</p><p> </p><p>You asked yourself time and time again why you have decided to put up with the two rascals. Ever since you talked your way out of getting Fred and George in trouble with Professor McGonagall on your very first day in Hogwarts, the twins have been by your side ever since. It didn’t matter to them that you were sorted into Slytherin or that they were 2 years older than you. You fit together like three peas in a pod. You smiled at the memory.</p><p>Suddenly, the train came to a stop. You noticed the frosted window turned to ice from the increasing cold. You instinctively grabbed your wand from your pocket. “Stay here. I’ll go check on Potter.”</p><p>“Say no more,” George replied as the twins were shooing you away. “Because, obviously, he’ll definitely be in the middle of whatever trouble this is.”</p><p>You gave a small chuckle. Although you were only a third year, only the ignorant would ever doubt your abilities as a witch. While Granger was a contender in terms of test-taking, you had far superior knowledge and understanding of magic all due to how you were raised. Your parents made sure you knew of the Dark Arts at a very young age and only recently you understood why. You exhaled deeply. That thought was definitely for another time. After you came to your senses, you straightened your back and braced yourself for what was to come.</p><p> </p><p>You slowly opened the door and checked the hallway. It was complete darkness. Since you were situated in the very last cabin, you had nowhere to go but forward.</p><p>“Lumos.” You whispered. A small light glowed from the end of your wand as you walked along the hallway. You saw heads peaking from a few of the doors. “Best if you stayed in your cabins while we sort this matter.” You smiled at them. While the younger ones bashfully followed the request, the higher years were a little more hesitant.</p><p>“Shouldn’t you follow your own advice?” A girl from a few cabins away asked with a hushed tone. Judging from the red lining on her robes, she was a Gryffindor.</p><p>As you were about to answer, someone from her cabin placed a hand on her shoulder. “Katie, if anything, she’s more than capable to <em>sort the matter</em>.” You can almost <em>hear</em> the man rolling his eyes. You smiled at that.</p><p>“It’s Wood, right? I’ve heard a bit about you from Fred and George.” You stated as you approached.</p><p>The man, Wood, blushed. “Aye. All good things I hope.” You smirked at that which made him blush even more. The girl, Katie, was the one to roll her eyes this time.</p><p>You knew you were beautiful. You could see it in many men’s and, occasionally, women’s eyes when you walk along the halls in Hogwarts. However, that doesn’t mean you have ever acted on it. How could you when your parents have reminded you all your life to find a rich man to marry once you graduate. Again, a thought for another time.</p><p>You were about to answer back when you heard a commotion a few corridors down.</p><p>You excused yourself and rushed to the scene where you found yourself in front of a dementor shielding itself from a light coming from someone else in the cabin. You could see other dementors behind it wanting to enter the cabin as well. Before the dementors' effects crept up to you, you quickly let yourself immerse in your happiest memory – the Weasley twins testing another one of their inventions in front of you by the Gryffindor Tower’s fireplace, a place you deemed your home away from home even if you had to sneak in. You flicked your wand as you spoke, “Expecto Patronum.”</p><p>A fox with nine tails appeared from the tip of your wand and charged at the dementors, driving them away into the open train doors. You put down your wand and slowly exhaled, thankful that it was over. After you made sure the dementors weren’t coming back, you checked the cabin in question.</p><p> </p><p>While your instincts were right to think the cabin belonged to the Golden Trio, you were surprised to see a much older man tending to a now awake Potter.</p><p>The older man offered Potter a chocolate bar from his pocket. “Chocolate. Eat. It’ll help.”</p><p>“What was that thing?” Potter asked. You decided to make your presence known. “Dementors from Azkaban, I presume. Don’t worry. they’re all gone from the train.” You said from the cabin door. The older man’s eyes shot to you and appraised you critically. While you should have have been doing the same, alas, you couldn’t help but notice how incredibly green his eyes were.</p><p>While Granger and Weasley expressed their gratitude, Potter frowned in confusion. Granger explained, “It was searching the train, Harry, for Sirius Black.” Potter widened his eyes at that.</p><p>The older man tore his eyes away from you to talk to the three in the cabin. “I need to have a word with this young lady. Excuse me.” He pointed to the chocolate Potter has in his hand. “Eat. It’ll help.”</p><p> </p><p>He closed the door and ushered you to follow him away from the cabins. He was impressed, to say the least. He knew he couldn’t conjure a full Patronus lest his secret might be discovered. Though it was enough to repel the Dementor from Harry, he was relieved that you arrived and drove all the others away. His relief, however, did not overcome his surprise knowing his knight in shining armour was none other than a beautiful, young, Slytherin girl.</p><p>He shook his head. His first day as a professor and his first thought was how beautiful one of his students was? If he wasn’t destined for hell, he certainly was now.</p><p>Once you were away enough, he turned to you and assessed you again. “I believe I have you to thank for helping me drive out those dementors?”</p><p>You nodded. “Those pesky things shouldn’t even be on the train. I must have a word with the driver.”</p><p>His green eyes twinkled with mirth. “Yes. I believe so, too. I–” He paused and wondered if he’ll say anything more. “–I must say, the Patronus Charm is a difficult spell to master but you had no trouble in conjuring it. It was impressively done, especially at such a young age.”</p><p>You looked at him with a quizzical brow. Judging from the way he carried himself, he seemed intelligent. You chose your next words wisely. “There were quite a few dementors at Potter’s heels and yet you chose to cast an incorporeal one. It begs me to question why, but, then again, we all have our secrets. Don’t we?”</p><p>He slightly widened his eyes but schooled his features in an instant. You knew you hit a soft spot. He forced a smile. “Well, it would be no secret by the time we get to Hogwarts that I will be your new DADA professor.” He offered his hand. “I am Professor Remus Lupin. And you are?”</p><p>You took his hand and shook it. “I am a concerned student who would still like to speak with the driver. Please excuse me.” You chuckled as you went around him to make your way to the driver.</p><p>He looked on in disbelief as you strutted along the hallway. He looked up to the ceiling and said to no one in particular. “I don’t think I have prepared well enough for this, Albus.”</p>
