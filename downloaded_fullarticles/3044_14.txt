  <strong> <em>Rainy days were his favorite. He loved to sit in the cavity of the window in his bedroom, book on his lap and a hot cup of tea in hand. He loved the sight of the droplets that ran down the window, and the sound of the fire that crackled in the fireplace. And yet he could never be truly happy, nor enjoy it. Thoughts took him over, disrupted his sleep. He sighed deeply again and placed his book down beside him. He knew he had to distract himself, knew he had to stop making himself go crazy. However, it did not help when he turned his head, eyeing the the package</em></strong>
  <strong><em> on his bedside table. Day in and out living with that pain. But he will get better. He was supposed to. Maybe not for himself, but for the person most dear to him. </em> </strong>
</p>
<p>Soft knocking echoed on the front door, late that evening. Vermillius Demont looked puzzled at his watch, not expecting that someone would like to have a conversation with <em>him</em> at this hour.</p>
<p>He stood up, bit staggering, but remained calm. He didn't want it to happen again. Vermillius opened the small hatch in the door, not knowing to expect anyone else than a creep or a wanderer. But it was anything but that as he saw the dark shape of a woman, recognizing the yellow stripes on her jacket. A police woman. He furrowed his brows a little in concern. What was a muggle doing at his door, at this hour?</p>
<p>"Good evening, Madam" He decided to approach her casually, cold, but not too unfriendly. A police woman like that, didn't see them often. Certainly not for him, because he wasn't much  embroiled in the muggle life, remaining close to this position.</p>
<p>"What brings you here so late?" He asks casually, leaning against the door jamb.</p>
<p>The woman, not bad looking for Vermillius taste, cleared her throat. “Good evening, sir Demont. Im here to bring you some information about a case. Unfortunately, I have some bad news to bring."</p>
<p>"Just like the weather?” He joked.</p>
<p>The woman remained serious and formal, shaking her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>"Would you allow me to come inside?" She asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Vermillius swallowed for a moment. Letting a muggle inside his house… where he had stalled all his pots and potions, his wand… he knew it wasn't a smart move to let her in. On the other side; he couldn't just shake her off. What if it really was that important? What if it was about…  </p>
<p>He nodded. They couldn't stand out here in the porch. It is and remained a porch, and that old man next to him was everything except an easy neighbor. That he wasn't allowed to use magic for private purposes, otherwise he had changed that old piece of crab in a sour plum. Exactly what that damned muggle deserved. "But of course." Vermillius stepped aside. The woman entered the small house and looked a bit around. Vermillius was slightly ashamed about the mess. Not that it was fair, he hadn't expected any visitors that evening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>He makes room for her as he stacked some newspapers and gestured manly she could take a seat. "Something to drink ma'am? Glass of wine?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The woman sat down and looked at him. "No, thank you sir, but unfortunately I can not consume when I'm on duty."</p>
<p>"After working hours?” His mouth curled in a playful grin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The woman smiled. "Perhaps. But first things first, sir. Im here for a reason.” She said, while looking around as if she wanted to say; <em>where the hell can you have a seat between this junk?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em></p>
<p>Vermillius chuckled apologizing and found some place at the end of the couch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>"Well then, tell me but what someone like you brings me at this time of the day.” He says, himself a glass of wine in his hand. He moved the drink inside his glass, anxiously waiting for the muggle to speak up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>She cleared her throat and laid her hands neatly onto her lap. “I am here with regard to Idris Demont and his daughter.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Vermillius looked up from his glass and leaned forward. He got a bad feeling, he was always worried about his brother and his niece. Left by the mother figure, disappeared out of nowhere.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong> <em>He couldn't believe it when he closed his front door slowly, eyes still wide of shock. But he had to shove it aside, needed to pick his stuff as fast as he could. He had to fight off the tears as he scrapes his stuff together, reminding himself to stay calm. He grabs his bag, opens the door and runs into the deep rainy night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em> </strong>
