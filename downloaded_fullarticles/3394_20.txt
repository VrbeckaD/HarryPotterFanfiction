          <div class="userstuff"><p>They’d been happy for a short time. A love no one could have predicted. A love that shouldn’t have been.</p><p>But when the war came, and the Dark Lord reigned victorious. She had hoped she would be allowed to keep her pet. Instead she saw her die. Her Lord made an example of her, making Bellatrix be the one to make the light drain from her lovers eyes. <em>Love</em> was a weakness after all.</p><p>Voldemort soon grew sick of his lieutenant’s misery and banished her to Black Manor. Narcissa visited often to try and help but Bella would just sit and stare blankly. Gone was the fire, gone was the mad woman they had known. Until one day Severus brought her a gift. The resurrection stone.</p><p>Weeks went by and the witch didn’t leave her room. Hermione had been returned to her. The girl now always smiling, always happy. It soothed Bellatrix, for a while at least.</p><p>
  <em>And I would have to pinch her</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Just to see if she was real</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Just watch smile fade away and see the pain she’d feel</em>
</p><p>Soon the girl she loved turned cold. Her skin turned grey and she smiled nomore. So, neither did Bellatrix.</p><p>They got their happy ending eventually. When Bella couldn’t stand to see her love in pain any longer. Death appeared to her, as if a friend. And so, the Dark Lords most feared lieutenant joined the brightest witch of her age in the grave.</p><p> </p></div>
