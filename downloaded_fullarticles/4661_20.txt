    <p>The moment Newt steps out of the boat he misses his friends in New York. But he needs to finish his book and find someone interested in publishing it before returning to America.</p>
<p>He thinks about visiting Theseus and staying with him at their old house, but he doesn't want to bother him, not after what happened with Grindelwald... His brother must know by now that he made quite a disaster back there, he probably doesn't want to see Newt right now.</p>
<p>But he's wrong.</p>
<p>He realises that when he tries to take a step and two strong arms wrap around him. He manages to look back and see the familiar face before said face buries itself in his neck.</p>
<p>"How did you know I was coming back today?" Newt asks, curious.</p>
<p>"Anything is possible when you are the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement." Theseus looks up again and winks.</p>
<p>Newt fights back the temptation of rolling his eyes because his brother is somehow right. He's a senior auror at the Ministry and a war hero, which means that everyone respects him. Even though he looks like he's joking, Newt knows he has a strong influence and power inside the Ministry.</p>
<p>"One letter, are you serious?" His brother protests then and although he steps back enough just to look at him, his arms are still firmly pressed around him. "Just one letter to explain everything that happened? I was worried."</p>
<p>"I know," Newt breathes. "I'm sorry... I-I just thought you'd be... You wouldn't be happy with me. I didn't want to disappoint you."</p>
<p>But there's no disappointment on Theseus' face, there's just that worried expression of his and a familiar sadness.</p>
<p>Then there are fingers brushing the curls on his forehead.</p>
<p>"Newt... I'm proud of you. I'm happy you have managed to be what you really wanted," he explains and takes his face in his hands to make Newt look up at him. "Listen, I know our parents didn't treat you fairly... They were traditionalists and they didn't understand you as well as I do. And you must know... I'm not like them, okay? I love you and I'm proud of you."</p>
<p>There are tears coming from his eyes, but his heart is warm and happy. Theseus smiles back and wipes off the tears on his cheeks.</p>
<p>"C'mon, let's go home, little brother."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Theseus not only welcomes him home, but he also helps him to feed and take care of his creatures.</p>
<p>He's so tired by the end of the day he thinks he'd be able to avoid nightmares and bad memories. But the moment he closes his eyes there's Grindelwald's face trying to hurt him, trying to kill Tina and all his friends.</p>
<p>He wakes up with a jolt. For a terrifying moment he forgets where he is and jumps out of the bed in panic. He doesn't manage to calm down till he sees the case under the bed and reminds himself he's in Theseus' house.</p>
<p>He rolls over the bed a couple of times, trying to sleep again, but he's still afraid of looking at Grindelwald again. His eyes lay on his room's door thinking that Theseus room is just across the hall. No, he's not five anymore he can defeat his demons alone. He doesn't need to bother Theseus.</p>
<p>But he's so tired and even though he fights to stay awake his eyes close for a second. And a second is enough to make him gasp and shake in terror.</p>
<p>He must have screamed because suddenly Theseus is in the room, kneeling next to his bed.</p>
<p>"Newt, are you okay?"</p>
<p>He nods, but his body betrays him because he's sobbing and his hands are trembling.</p>
<p>He doesn't want to be weak.</p>
<p>"It's alright to be afraid, you know..." Theseus says like he just heard Newt's thoughts. "Tell me... What is it?"</p>
<p>"I-I had a nightmare," he explains and feels ashamed just to say it. He bites his lip and looks down.</p>
<p>Theseus rises and for a moment Newt thinks he's going to leave him, but then a hand reaches out to him.</p>
<p>Newt takes his hand and lets his brother pull him into his arms. They both reach Theseus' room and he hesitates for a moment when he sees his brother laying on the bed.</p>
<p>"I don't want to be a bother," he whispers.</p>
<p>"You're not," Theseus assures and opens his arms to him. "Come, little bird."</p>
<p>Newt giggles and crawls into bed next to Theseus and his brother puts his arms around him.</p>
<p>"You need to sleep,"</p>
<p>"I don't want to," Newt protests and he definitely doesn't pout.</p>
<p>He feels Theseus' body shake with laughter.</p>
<p>"Fine," he kisses his forehead and Newt relaxes in his arms almost immediately. "You know I wouldn't let anything happen to you, right?"</p>
<p>"I know," Newt smiles back. He can't see him and then he realises his eyes are closed so he opens them.</p>
<p>"I don't want to sleep," he mumbles.</p>
<p>"Then don't," Theseus tells him and Newt can hear the amusement in his voice.</p>
<p>Why is his brother amused? Is he singing a lullaby? He's not sure because his eyelids are heavy and he can't keep his eyes open.</p>
<p>Theseus mutters something, but he's not sure what because that's the moment he falls asleep.</p>
