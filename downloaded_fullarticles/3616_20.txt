    <p>“I’m looking for a gift for my, uh, friend Draco.”</p>
<p>If Hermione didn’t find herself cursed into oblivion, Ron and Harry owed her. They owed her so much. Because it was one thing for the three of them to crowd under Harry’s invisibility cloak and follow Draco Malfoy down Knockturn Alley. It was another to wander into Borgin and Burke’s and start inquiring after dark artifacts that might interest the little weasel. And considering plenty of people knew Hermione — especially after the horrid Skeeter woman’s reporting during fourth year — it took plenty of nerve to walk into a store frequented by Death Eaters. </p>
<p>Not that Hermione was particularly focusing on all those details at once, but they were certainly in the back of her mind.</p>
<p>Mr. Borgin looked at her questioningly, as if he doubted she would ever be a friend of Draco Malfoy’s — an assumption that was surprisingly not too far from the truth. Still, never one to lose a potential customer, Borgin slowly made his way from behind the store counter and led Hermione over to a shelf filled with various knickknacks and whatnot. Something silver caught her eye in the back and while Hermione knew better than to touch anything in Borgin and Burke’s she reached for it. </p>
<p>“Oh, and Borgin — Granger, what are you doing in here?” Draco scowled as he breezed back through the door. Hermione’s fingers had barely grazed the silver object on the shelf before she turned.</p>
<p>“A customer’s a customer, Mr. Malfoy,” Borgin chortled. “And it seems the young lady has found something of interest.”</p>
<p>“It just so happens I have,” Hermione sniffed. </p>
<p>Draco glared down at her and Hermione reached for whatever the silver object was as soon as Borgin had shuffled off. Much to her surprise, it was a time turner. However it didn’t look quite like the time turner she’d been issued during her third year; the one she’d just found was silver instead of gold and lacked a chain. </p>
<p>“Didn’t anyone ever tell you not to touch anything in this store?” Draco snarled at her before grabbing the time turner from her. “Of course they didn’t, filthy little mudblood.”</p>
<p>But Hermione didn’t even react to his abrasive use of the familiar slur. Her attention was firmly fixed to the silver time turner that had, apparently, started to smoke as soon as Draco touched it. Draco didn’t even notice until the two of them had been circled by the swirling grey smoke, which soon enveloped them. </p>
<p>“What did you do to it?” Draco shouted at her as the smoke had begun to swirl around them violently like s tornado. </p>
<p>“Nothing!” Hermione shouted back. </p>
<p>The swirling vortex spun faster and faster, blurring their view of the outside world. But just as the cyclone seemed to reach top speed, it disappeared into thin air. Even though their feet had been planted firmly on the ground the entire time, both Hermione and Draco fell down as if they had been traveling by portkey. </p>
<p>As Hermione surveyed their surroundings, everything seemed quite normal at first.</p>
<p>“Well that was the stupidest curse I have ever seen,” Draco huffed as he got to his feet and dusted off his dark robes. “It’s a time turner and we didn’t even go anywhere!” </p>
<p>But Hermione wasn’t so sure they hadn’t. </p>
<p>“Draco, follow me,” she stated, turning toward the door.</p>
<p>“What? Why—”</p>
<p>“Unless you want to explain to Borgin how you appeared in his shop without the bell ringing, do you have a better option?” Hermione snapped as she pivoted back toward him. Draco sulked slightly as he followed her out the door and down Knockturn Alley. As they walked, Hermione noted some startling differences. “Draco, was that shop open before?” she motioned toward a bookstore with a pentagram painted on its sign.</p>
<p>“Merlin no,” he replied. “That shop hasn’t been open since my grandfather was our age.”</p>
<p>Hermione broke out into a full sprint toward Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>Draco struggled to keep up, tripping once or twice over his robes, but when he finally caught up with her she was purchasing a copy of the Daily Prophet from a young boy who was clearly baffled by her muggle ensemble of jeans and a jumper. She held up the front page so Draco could see and when they read the date they both went pale.</p>
<p>23 August 1943</p>
<p>“1943?!” Draco exclaimed. “Bloody hell, Gran—”</p>
<p>“Shh,” Hermione dragged him away from the newspaper stand. “I’m shocked too, but we can’t draw any attention to herself.” Draco looked her up and down as if to say she’d already drawn attention to herself. “Fine. You’ve got a point.” With a little bit of work (and attempting to remember photos of her gran during the forties), Hermione transfigured her nineties clothes into more appropriate trousers and a summery blouse. “There. Better?”</p>
<p>“They’re still muggle clothes, but I guess,” Draco snarked. Hermione rolled her eyes and snatched the time turner from his hand. A chain had appeared, so she undid the clasp and put it around her neck. </p>
<p>“Come on. We have to find someone who will help us.” While it was still illegal for her to apparate, Hermione understood the concept and pictured where she wanted to go.</p>
<p>The two disappeared and when they reappeared in Hermione’s chosen destination, Draco promptly emptied his stomach onto someone’s rose bushes. Hermione wrinkled her nose but focused her attention on the next house over. </p>
<p>“Where are we?” Draco questioned.</p>
<p>“Godric’s Hollow.”</p>
<p>“Why?” </p>
<p>“There’s only one person who could possibly help us in this sort of situation,” Hermione explained as she began to approach the unassuming little cottage she’d been focused on. </p>
<p>“Please tell me we’re not going to ask—”</p>
<p>But it was too late for Draco to stop Hermione, as she had knocked on the door. There was a moment of silence before they both could hear footsteps on the other side. Slowly, the door opened and Draco cringed at the familiar, albeit younger, face that stared at them.</p>
<p>“Professor Dumbledore!” Hermione exclaimed in relief. </p>
<p>“I don’t know who you are or why you are here,” the professor in question began. “But you two have thirty seconds to explain yourselves and why you know who I am and where I live.”</p>
<p>“Well, professor, it’s a bit difficult to explain,” Hermione began. “But... we’re from the future. We got sent back to 1943 because of this.” She held the time turner out so Dumbledore could see it. “We were hoping you would recognize it and know how to send us back.” </p>
<p>Dumbledore seemed to recognize the object responsible for their great leap through time.</p>
<p>“Where did you find that?” he questioned.</p>
<p>“In Borgin and Burke’s,” Hermione replied, a bit sheepish to admit where she had been. </p>
<p>“Come inside, quickly,” he instructed. “I will help you both as well as I can, but I’m afraid that returning you to your time will prove rather impossible.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Draco frowned as he followed Hermione inside.</p>
<p>“Because, Mr... Malfoy, I presume? You look just like Abraxas,” Dumbledore assumed. Draco nodded in confirmation. “Because, Mr. Malfoy, that is no ordinary time turner. That is Salazar Slytherin’s time turner.”</p>
