</p><p> </p><p>The drawing room of Malfoy Manor was the grandest room in the house. The vaulted ceilings were decorated with hand-painted gold leaf and anchored two majestic chandeliers. A long ornate table filled one half of the room and a fire with a large marble mantlepiece and an intricately designed gilded mirror above lay at the other.</p><p>However, what was inside the room was anything but beautiful. Death Eaters swarmed the room, some sat at the table, others gathered around the fire. The attention of all was directed at the person suspended like a grotesque puppet in the centre of the room, blood slowly dripping from their extended fingers.</p><p>Draco Malfoy gazed over the scene with glassy eyes. The Dark Lord had been depositing people at the Manor for several weeks now. At first, he had thought that they were to be tortured for information, but an offhand comment from the Dark Lord had suggested that he had finished with them. Thus, their torture was purely to sate the sadistic pleasures of the current occupants of the house. He went to turn away in disgust, but his mother caught him with a look and a jerk of her chin telling him to remain still. Although it was covert, Fenrir Greyback saw it with his heightened senses.</p><p>Once the many <em>Crucio</em> spells had been cast and Bellatrix had been allowed to use her knife, it was a miracle the woman – or at least Draco thought it was a woman – was still alive. A muttered spell from somewhere made her drop like a sack of potatoes, the only sign of life being the small groan that forced itself past her lips.</p><p>“Wormtail!” Bellatrix shrieked. “Take this trash back to the cellar!”</p><p>“No,” barked Greyback with a malicious grin “Make the Malfoy runt do it.”</p><p>Bellatrix nodded absently and jerked her head at Draco, her attention already on other things. With a furtive glance at his mother, he walked over to the crumpled mess of a person and grabbed her by the upper arm. He fervently wished he had stayed at school this Christmas, even if it meant working more on the cabinet, but with no other choice available, he began to drag the woman out of the room.</p><p>When they reached the cellar, Draco dropped her arm whilst he fumbled in his pocket for his wand. He became aware of a rasping noise coming from by his feet and thought she must be choking on the tangle of hair in her face. With the tip of his wand, he pushed it back and realised that she was trying to speak. He glanced around and seeing no one bent down to better hear her.</p><p>“What? I can’t hear you.” He muttered, only half trying anyway. When he did hear her cracked words, he froze.</p><p>“…help…me…please…”</p><p>He stood abruptly, feeling incredibly uncomfortable. Without ever looking at her again he unlocked the cellar door, shoved the woman through it with his feet and slammed it shut again. He bypassed the drawing room in favour of going straight to his room and collapsed on the bed. He had been surprised to learn, at first, that being surrounded by the Death Eater movement was quite exhausting and once the thrill wore off – approximately 2 minutes after the first person was deposited at the Manor – he did not enjoy it quite as much as he thought.</p><p>Draco covered his face with his forearm and dozed for a while until a faint scraping and rattling sound drew his attention. He sat up and looked around for the annoyance but saw none and surmised that more entertainment must be happening downstairs. He decided to forego supper and with a wave of his wand changed into his pyjama pants before climbing into bed. He had just closed his eyes when an almighty CLANG from inside his room made his heart stop. He wrenched his eyes open and quickly sourced the sound.</p><p>Igor Karkaroff stood beside one of his large bay windows gazing balefully at the Manor grounds. Draco was just about to burst out how his room was off limits when something stopped him. As his sleep-muddled mind roused itself, he realised there were chains wrapped around Karkaroff’s body and trailing onto the ground. It looked to Draco as though Karkaroff were doing his best Bloody Baron impression. And that’s when it hit him. Karkaroff was dead. Bellatrix and a few others had tracked him down not long after the Dark Lord’s return and killed him for treason.</p><p>“Karkaroff…you’re a ghost?” Draco breathed.</p><p>As though noticing him for the first time, Karkaroff glanced over his shoulder at him then returned his gaze to the window and let out a heavy sigh.</p><p>“I have been stupid.” His heavily accented voice swirled through the room. “I did not want to be a Death Eater anymore.” Draco thought that much was obvious but decided to keep his thoughts to himself. “When I met the Dark Lord, he spoke of such wonderful things. I thought we were the heroes of wizarding kind. I was wrong.”</p><p>Draco rubbed his eyes, hoping he was seeing things. He didn’t think he could cope with a dead and regretful Igor Karkaroff in his bedroom right now.</p><p>“Right…well…er…” Draco started.</p><p>“I fell in love with a woman at Durmstrang!” Karkaroff declared.</p><p>“Oh…er…lovely…” Draco tried, but the ghost wasn’t listening, he wasn’t even sure Karkaroff knew he was there.</p><p>“She gave me purpose in life again and when the Dark Lord called, I didn’t want to leave her.” He continued mournfully. “When they found me, they murdered and debased her while I watched. I was too afraid to do anything. Now I carry these chains as penance for her and all the others I have wronged.”</p><p>“Right…well…good for you?” Draco cursed his bad luck and thought about just going back to sleep when Karkaroff turned and swooped so close to Draco’s face he could have sworn he felt his breath.</p><p>“Draco Malfoy!” Karkaroff cried. “What I wouldn’t give to be you!”</p><p>“Me?” Draco spluttered.</p><p>“You have the chance to change your mind! The time is now, young Malfoy. If you don’t change, you <em>will</em> become me!” With a wail, Karkaroff flew backwards and disappeared through the wall to the en-suite. Draco held his breath and listened, hoping that the ghostly professor wasn’t now hanging around in his bathroom. When he heard no more rattling, he let out a sigh and sank back into his bed. He thought on the bizarre encounter he’d had but then shrugged his shoulders and snuggled down more underneath the blankets.</p>
