  <strong>Prologue || For The Greater Good</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p>     The door opened and James walked in. Lily was tucking the nearly 1-year-old boy to sleep. The redhead saw James and stood up to what was wrong when James already beat her to it. "Lily, we need to talk," James said as he left to the sitting room. Lily followed unsurely at how her husband was acting. She took a seat and waited for James to say what he had to. "You won't hate me for what I'm about to tell you, right?" James asked expectantly. "Of course, I wouldn't. I could never hate you!" Lily said in bewilderment, she was nervous about what James is about to say based on his actions. "How about Harry? Will you hate him after I tell you the truth?" James once again, waiting for Lily to answer. "I could never hate Har-bear! And what do you mean by 'the truth'?" Lily asked, why would she hate Harry? He was everything to her. "Is there something I should know about?" She added. James took a deep breath and said,</p><p>"Harry isn't your son."</p><p>     It was as if lightning struck her and all she could do was just ask, "What?" She blinked her eyes a couple of times as if to see if she was just dreaming, but she wasn't. "How?" She asked in disbelief, James must have had a reason for this, it can't just be that easy. She knew she was pregnant, where was her child? "I-I fell in love with someone else." He explained and Lily immediately understood. After all, their marriage was just arranged by his parents, he could love anyone he wants. "Who's the mother?" She asked slowly, she had many questions that needed answers. James gave her a look and her jaw dropped open in shock. She heard about male pregnancies and their rarity (it was uncommon but not rare), but she never saw him with a large bump on his stomach. Then again, men do not have a womb like women do. "Who's the father?" Lily asked, internally patting herself on her back for taking everything calmly. "Padfoot." The raven adult said softly, and Lily's eyes softened at the tone. She knew James and Sirius were close, but she never noticed how close they could be. "It's just that, Harry's brother was stolen." James chocked out and Lily made a face full of horror, who would do such a thing? "What?! How dare that person! A child should never be separated from its mother, whether newborn or not!" She shrieked as James tried to calm down. "We'll find him, James." She soothed the silently crying man.</p><p>     Suddenly, he grabbed both her shoulders firmly and Lily looked at him in shock. "Run." He said, his voice raspy as Lily stared at him confused. "Run away. <em>Dippet</em> is coming, he wants to kill you." James said, summoning Lily's luggage which was already full of her clothes. He left out the part that he was included and so was Harry. The single name answered all of Lily's question. Why Dippet would do anything to get rid of her and James. He kept going on and on about the Greater Good but honestly, she, James, Sirius, and Remus knew he was just manipulating everyone. He even manipulated Peter to become a Death Eater and a spy. She grabbed her scarf and took hold of her luggage, </p><p>"What's your child's name?"</p><p>"Henry. His name is Henry, Henry Sirius Potter-Black. Beautiful."</p><p>She went over to the door and left without looking back, saying a few words that made James have hope.</p><p>"Tell Harry I love him even if he isn't my child. I'll find Henry for you, goodbye."</p><p> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>"James, my boy, do you take me for a fool?"</p><p>     "No, Headmaster," James said standing in front of Harry's crib. "Then imagine my surprise when I found out that he isn't Lily's child. What a fool I have been." The figure said as he discreetly grabbed his wand from a pocket in his hideous yellow robe. James' eyes flashed dangerously as his low voice filled the hollow room, "Surprise? What surprise? You planned this from the start, did you not? I might be reckless but I'm not stupid, Headmaster. I see the way your eyes analyze us with the fake twinkle. You can't-fool me."</p><p>     "My boy, how bold you have turned to be. You must watch your mouth, or I will have to force you down." The figure taunted, waving his wand in front of James' face. "Force me down?! Why don't you do it now?! I knew you would do anything to get us into your pockets, but stealing my child was not necessary!" He snarled at the man, tempted to punch the God damn wrinkly face with its usual fake twinkle. Tears fell down on his eyes as he sobbed in front of the man he loathed the most, "He's just a boy."</p><p>     "Petrificus Totalus!" The figure shouted to James as he froze, with a snap of his hands James was transported somewhere else. He looked at the boy with silver-grey eyes (they were supposed to be green, not grey! How annoying, he had to put a temporary glamour on the boy's eyes!),</p><p>"For the Greater Good, my boy. The Greater Good."</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">
