  <em>Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, England</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The conference room felt stifled, at contrast to the wide windows letting in warm sunlight from an otherwise chilly spring day. The room itself was simple and modern in design, following the aesthetic standards most new architecture took to before the dawning of the Eve Wars.</p><p>Une wondered for a moment, what insignia adorned the walls of this room during the war. From what she recalled, only a handful of OZ bases had been located near the British Isles. They’d been destroyed in the first wave of the war, at the hands of a recently-descended Gundam Heavyarms. As far as Une remembered, no battles had hit so far inland, so this small town would have remained damage free. Looking over the conference room now, Une thought perhaps Hemel Hempstead wasn’t the only one to survive the war untouched.</p><p>Fifty-four people occupied the conference rooms, an eclectic mix for this small town. Of course, no one was a native of Hemel Hempstead, not even the two nominally-British men. The conference table stretched the length of the room, 28 occupied seats surrounding it. Separated desks manned the walls, 24 in total, the majority of which were occupied as well. Une didn’t look but knew her Preventers were stationed in advantageous positions around the room, ready to intervene at the first sign the tension turned into something hostile.</p><p>ESUN President Noel sat at one end of the conference table, her normally gentle features pulled into an austere expression. Seated next to her was Vice Foreign Minister Darlian, the youngest individual in the room by far, but Une privately thought her eyes showed wisdom beyond many others present. Seated along the conference table, twelve on each side, were the reasons why conference was being undertaken in the first place.</p><p>Magic exists.</p><p>At first, Une had thought it absurd. Then baffling. Then, after more and more evidence appeared before her eyes, Une was forced to adapt, and so she did; she did not survive the war to die from shock because the Secretary of the British Isles admitted to the existence of a mysterious, seclusive minority.</p><p>British Secretary Samuel Reid had explained as best he could to the head of Preventers what he knew of the Earth Sphere’s magical communities. What Preventers had learned had led to a secret but intense investigation across the global sphere, meeting with ESUN representatives to discover who among them knew of these magical communities. They’d narrowed it down to 24 representatives from what had been formerly autonomous nations before national borders had been dissolved during the Eve Wars.</p><p>According to these representatives, only the topmost official of the ‘nation’ was informed of the existence of these magical communities. Magic users operated under an international code of secrecy, wherein they did not interact with their non-magic counterparts. Most of the representatives did not even have a way to contact their magical peers, aside from a select handful. In order to even hold this conference, Une had to have the Mongolian Secretary contact her magical counterpart to arrange a meeting.</p><p>The magical contingent were introduced as the International Confederation of Wizards, the only global intergovernmental organization these magical communities had outside of sports and special interests. Just getting them to agree to a meeting had been its own hurdle; they continually tried to snub their non-magical peers, clearly wanting no part in politics involving them. Considering what happened when seclusive, autonomous groups gained power and weren’t held accountable on a galactic scale, Une had <em>forced</em> the issue: come to the meeting or have your laws decided <em>for</em> you. Then she’d sent them stills of their magical landmarks.</p><p>Vice Foreign Minister Darlian had not been amused by the tactic, and ESUN President Noel had shaken her head with a sigh. Both politely pretended not to know about it, however, as the ICW agreed to a conference with their non-magical counterparts.</p><p>The consistent and repetitive message given from all 24 magical representatives for the last couple hours: wizards will not interfere with muggles, and vice versa.</p><p>‘Muggles’ meant those who could not use magic. The compiled reports of the Preventers agency had been force-fed to the present ESUN representatives, which covered wizarding vernacular and laws. Squibs and Muggleborns had contributed the most knowledge to these documents; instead of falling under the surveillance of their wizarding peers, they’d entered the Muggle community. And, more importantly – they’d entered the war. Loyalty was decided by who you would fight for, and they’d fought in the <em>Muggle</em> war.</p><p> “Wizards and witches are considered citizens of the Earth Sphere,” President Noel reiterated, as she had been doing since the start of the meeting. It was as if the magical contingent did not understand this very simple fact, their expressions always twisted into something vaguely contentious. “At the conclusion of the Eve Wars-“</p><p>“The <em>Muggle</em> war,” the wizarding delegate of Transylvania interjected dourly.</p><p>“Representative Constantin,” Supreme Mugwump Dumbledore – <em>Magic users had the most ridiculous titles,</em> Une thought. – chastised mildly.</p><p>“Autonomous nations no longer exist on the Earth Sphere,” President Noel forged on. “There are no national borders, nor citizens of individual sovereign nations. Those of the Earth Sphere share one citizenship.”</p><p>“A fascinating but definitively Muggle decision,” the American wizarding delegate replied. “Wizards had no role in the Eve Wars, and were not part of the decision to dissolve national borders. As tradition, magical communities remain separate from the non-magical realm.”</p><p>They’d been going in circles for hours now. Perhaps the previous heads of Earth Sphere nations had taken one look at the gaudy robes the wizarding folk so favored and washed their hands of the whole affair, recognizing a headache when they saw one.</p><p>“Our communities will have no effect on Muggle lives nor interfere in Muggle politics,” the French delegate spoke up. “And we would appreciate the same courtesy.”</p><p>“Surely you jest, Representative Beaumont,” French Secretary Marseille responded, voice dry. He was the second youngest politician in the room, seated at the desk just behind his magic counterpart. “Or perhaps you forget your consistent utilization of memory erasure on ESUN citizens?”</p><p>“Memory charms are used only when necessary, to keep our communities hidden,” Beaumont snapped back, affronted.</p><p>“Decided by you, independent of due process!” Marseille retorted hotly. “You supersede the boundaries of citizenship and law, acting as judge and jury without input from the community you claim to not be part of!”</p><p>“Allowing Muggles who have witnessed magic to leave freely risks the health and well-being of all wizardingfolk,” the Bulgarian wizarding representative stated, his even tones cutting through the budding ferocity. “Memory charms are deemed a necessary evil.”</p><p>“As was explained to your predecessor,” Beaumont added, turning to glare back at Marseille.</p><p>Marseille matched the look. “President Laurent, <em>my predecessor</em>,” he intoned frostily. “Died in the, as you say, <em>Muggle</em> war. If memory serves me correctly, his office exploded while he was in it.”</p><p>Beaumont gaped unseemly in reply.</p><p>“<em>Enough</em>,” President Noel interrupted. “Secretary Marseille, Representative Beaumont.”</p><p>The ESUN Head turned to Une, who sat at the other end of the table and had been watching the proceedings with careful eyes, and then to Dumbledore. “As stated, this meeting is meant to build a relationship between the magical communities of the Earth Sphere and the rest of the world and colony communities.”</p><p>Dumbledore nodded. Strange title aside, Une found Dumbledore to be one of the more level-headed members present; he listened with equal parts diffidence and interest. He’d earned brownie points for being respectful to those non-magical present, as well as showing interest in their goals.</p><p>“By ‘colony communities,’ are you perhaps referencing the star colonies?” Dumbledore asked.</p><p>President Noel nodded. “In accordance with galactic law, the magical communities of the Earth Sphere will be subject to the laws that govern relations between ESUN and the space colonies,” she explained.</p><p>“Wizards don’t go into space,” German Representative Heinrich said.</p><p>Another interesting point in the Preventers reports on magical communities. Their magic simply <em>didn’t work</em> in space; somewhere during ascension from the Earth Sphere’s ozone, their abilities to cast magic dissipated until eventually stopping altogether. It had apparently caused quite a frenzy when mass emigration to space first began under a hundred years ago. Magical communities had at first forbidden their citizens from space travel, then heavily restricted it. Those who had lost their magic abilities while in space found it returned to them, usually weeks after their return to the Earth Sphere. As many wizards felt closely tied to their magic, a vast majority do not risk it and so wizards actually going into space dwindled to such low numbers that the space colonies were seen as only Muggle.</p><p>“Then there should be no issue agreeing to follow the terms of the agreement between ESUN and the space colonies,” President Noel said. “Copies should have already been provided to you prior to the meeting.” There was a general murmur of agreement. It was the first sign that this meeting was finally getting somewhere.</p><p>“It was very interesting, though I must admit many of the terms were unfamiliar,” Dumbledore stated.</p><p>Minister Darlian smiled in understanding. “Given that it governs the boundaries and locations in space and across the whole Earth Sphere, it can be hard to understand without a strong background in astronautics- I’m sorry, Muggle science fields,” she explained. “As your communities do not seem inclined to space travel, those laws will not be of much concern to you. The main concern are the rights of individual citizens, specifically those of the colonies and the non-magical Earth Sphere.”</p><p>“Your concerns about memory charms are not unfounded,” Dumbledore responded. “But this is a point we cannot negotiate on. History has taught wizards that Muggles do not always respond favorably to magic users. While I hope this will some day change, I’m afraid we cannot risk the well-being of our people at this time.”</p><p>“And we understand that,” President Noel replied, ignoring the scoffing of some of the wizarding contingent. “We also do hope to facilitate a change where your communities can become an open part of the greater world community, but we know that this change is not something to be taken suddenly or in haste. We intend to respect your communities’ needs for secrecy.”</p><p>“Then what is the purpose of this meeting?” the Swiss representative asked, rubbing his temples. “Considering you are familiar with wizarding aversion to space travel, magical compliance to galactic relations will not be an issue. The only interaction wizards will have with Muggles in the space colonies are those who come to Earth.”</p><p>“And you stated you understand the necessity of memory charms on Muggle witnesses,” the Australian representative reminded them mildly.</p><p>President Noel turned her attention to Une with a smile. “If you would, Madame Une,” she nodded.</p><p>Une stood, garnering the attention of all present. She’d been introduced at the beginning, of course, along with the Preventers organization. There was no magical equivalent to the Preventers organization but the wizards present managed to understand through several minutes of concentrated effort and explanation. For the most part, they had not seem enthused by the idea of a international, galactic peacekeeping force.</p><p>“Everyone is subjected to galactic law,” Une started, keeping to her clipped, professional tones that just dared any present to interrupt her. “At the conclusion of the war only two months ago, ESUN and the space colonies worked together to found the Preventers.</p><p>“The Preventers mission is to maintain peace among the Earth Sphere and space colonies.” Une paused, eyes moving from one magical delegate to the next. “The Eve Wars were devastating. I am not sure you quite understand the sheer magnitude.”</p><p>Dumbledore’s face was lined with the weary wisdom of age. “Magical communities were rarely affected, but even we understood the gist. The casualties were severe,” he responded gravely.</p><p>“One percent,” Une replied. “<em>One percent</em> of the entire galactic population died in the course of the Eve Wars. That is around <em>sixty million people</em>.” The magical communities, to their best estimate, totaled to only about one million people. Losing sixty times the entire wizarding population was a sharp wake-up call to their magical counterparts.</p><p>“We have moved into an era of peace, and we are committed to it,” Une continued. “With the creation of Preventers, we have established an organization whose very mission is to prevent conflicts from escalating and mediating efforts in the reconstruction, when needed.</p><p>“Two main tenants of the Preventers effort that may directly affect those of you in the magical communities, are those of possible incidents of terrorism and the Family Reconstruction Act.</p><p>“The Family Reconstruction Act is meant to reunite families broken apart by the war. It is <em>mandatory</em>,” Une impressed upon them. There were the starts of objections but they were stifled under a raised hand by Dumbledore. “You claim magical communities were not affected by the war, but there are magic users born to non-magic lines – Muggleborns, I believe you call them? And Muggles were most assuredly affected by the war.”</p><p>“What does the Family Reconstruction Act entail?” the Brazilian representative asked.</p><p>“Citizens submit to a DNA– a blood test, which is entered into a system to identify close familial matches,” Une replied. “Families are missing fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters, daughters and sons; the FRA seeks to remedy this situation. It is a major part of the reconstruction effort.”</p><p>“What happened to your stance against impugning individual rights?” the American representative asked. “Forcing blood tests on a populace…”</p><p>“You’ll get your blood back, in a sense,” the US Secretary responded blandly. “Which is more than can be said for those subjected to Memory Charms.”</p><p>Sensing possible derailment, Une forged on. “The second tenant is that of reporting possible terrorism,” she continued. “Preventers are meant to prevent escalation of conflict, but we cannot do that without cooperation from the greater community.”</p><p>“So we are to report <em>what</em> exactly?” the Russian representative inquired.</p><p>“Possible terrorist activity, including those of organized crime,” Une answered. “We have received reports that magical communities will sometimes see the rise of magic users hostile to either or both Muggle and wizarding communities.”</p><p>“Dark Lords and Ladies,” Supreme Mugwump Dumbledore termed.</p><p>Une nodded. “These are generally precipitated by suspicious activities, such as the gathering of sympathetic followers or unsettling messages made directly to the public,” she explained. “Preventers also help in subduing such terrorists, aiding local forces to eliminate the threat.”</p><p>The Transylvanian delegate snorted. “What can Muggles do against wizards?” he demanded testily.</p><p>“For one, drop a space colony on you,” British Secretary Reid replied scathingly. “Which <em>almost happened</em>.”</p><p>Horror flashed over the faces of the magic users. Une made another mental note; the magic communities really were far removed from the non-magic ones. They’d have to rectify that, through education if nothing else.</p><p>“B-But Muggles <em>live</em> on those! You’d be killing your own!” Beaumont cried out.</p><p>“Yes, we’re clearly quite good at that too,” the Japanese Secretary returned evenly.</p><p>“Muggles have developed their own methods of handling conflict, but we are now entering a stage of total pacifism,” Minister Darlian interrupted. “Preventers are the sole military force of ESUN, trained in advanced combat. They can be relied on.”</p><p>“Thank you, Minister Darlian,” Une nodded. “But this does bring me to a new point…”</p><p>Une glanced behind herself to the two Preventers agents standing nearby. Both men saw her look but only one moved forward, coming to her side to stand at attention. The male to her right side was a flax-haired young adult, lean in build. The one standing guard by the door was a male with his smooth red hair styled into a blunt-bang bob cut, having taken full advantage of Preventers lax rules regarding appearance which Une had to do just to get certain individuals under employment.</p><p>“This is Preventers Agent Papillon,” Une introduced. “He was born and raised in the space colonies. He arrived here only a few days ago, and this is his first time stepping foot on the Earth Sphere.” Finding these exact specifications to rule out any possible arguments had been difficult, but they were fortunate that Agent Papillon was assigned to this mission in the first place for his special skills.</p><p>“Agent Papillon, if you would,” Une ordered.</p><p>The flax-haired male relaxed from attention at her call. With cautious gait, a reflex from surviving an OZ attack, he raised his right arm, palm up. A breath later, a partly-translucent blue form bloomed in the palm of his hand, unfurling to reveal a blue Monarch butterfly. It fluttered up from his hand, revealing another shape blooming just underneath it.</p><p>Within seconds, more than half a dozen blue Monarch butterflies fluttered over the length of the conference table. Their translucent qualities diminished, gaining solid blue and black in color but emitting a soft blue glow.</p><p>“Impossible,” came the barely-audible murmur from one of the wizarding delegates.</p><p>“We call them Newtypes,” Une answered the unvoiced question. “The magical communities of the Earth Sphere are their closest equivalent. They display abilities that cannot be emulated by their, in your own terms, Muggle peers.”</p><p>She was greeted with dumbfound silence. This was news to the ESUN Secretaries as well, but it was only fair, as Minister Darlian had said: the Earth Sphere had wizards, the space colonies had Newtypes, and now they all knew it.</p><p>“Preventers have found that Newtypes are capable of recognizing your communities’ magic,” Une continued on. Her Newtype Agents were capable of recognizing each other, and mentioned that Earth Sphere wizards bore similar auras. Stronger Newtypes had been the ones to identify magical landmarks, which was how Une had been able to blackmail the ICW into the meeting in the first place. “But it seems their magic manifests a bit differently from your own.”</p><p>Silence met this as well. If she wasn’t so set in her goal for this meeting, Une would have been highly amused she managed to strike an entire room of politicians silent.</p><p>“Some Newtypes are capable of highly-specialized skills, such as Agent Carmine,” Une indicated to the Preventers agent by the door. “He is able to heal at an abnormally fast rate. A paper cut is gone within seconds; a grievous laceration in minutes,” she explained. Only Agent Papillon would be showing his special skill today, though, because Une was not going to injure her own agent to further stun a room full gobsmacked politicians.</p><p>Even then, she was not going to elaborate in just how specialized her Newtype agents had developed their ‘magic’. Une severely doubted the room would remain quietly amazed if she revealed that Agent Papillon hadn’t just released a kaleidoscope of butterflies into the room, he’d actually sent a swarm of butterfly-shaped <em>magic wards</em> that neutralized all other magic spells in their proximity.</p><p>“The space colonies have wizards,” Dumbledore said, voice full of wonder.</p><p>Une smiled, “Shall we discuss galactic relations now?”</p><p> </p><hr/><p>

  <strong>End Chapter 1</strong>
</p><hr/><p> <strong>A/N</strong>: This was kind of a prologue but it was necessary to set the stage. You will see the developments and results of this meeting as the story progresses. And I think you can figure out who is talking at the end of the chapter yourselves, lol.</p><p>
  <em>STORY NOTES:</em>
</p><p><strong>Characters</strong>:</p><p>-Please see the character tags to see who is part of the main cast. The OCs will be minor and background, so don’t be too worried about them.</p><p><strong>Main Pairings</strong>:</p><p>--Volleying between 1x2 or HarryxDuo.</p><p>--The Gundam Pilots are <em>close</em>. Like so close that it freaks out some people. But not actually 1x2x3x4x5.</p><p>--<em>Definite</em>: 3x4, 6x9, RonHermione</p><p><strong>Timeline</strong>:</p><p>-AC 195 = 1994 A.D./CE; AC 196 = 1995 A.D./CE</p><p>-GW Timeline: In order to fit into the story, Endless Waltz had to be dropped. <strike>I’m sorry, Mariemaia</strike>. Presumably, someone slapped sense back into Wufei. Probably Sally, but it could have been Heero.</p><p>-HP Timeline: This chapter takes place in March 1995, so during the Triwizard Tournament. The main time period of the story takes place during the events of Harry’s fifth year at Hogwarts.</p><p><strong>AU elements</strong>:</p><p>1) Newtypes. As far as I could glean from the Gundam Wiki, Gundam Wing was exempt from the Newtype/Innovators thing that occurred in some of the Gundam series. In Gundam canon, Newtypes are “the next step in human evolution.” In this story, they are the space colony equivalent of wizards. They have some very distinct differences from wizards, though, which you will see as the story progresses.</p><p>2) The International Confederation of Wizards (ICW) is HP canon, but I couldn’t find a lot of detail about them. Supreme Mugwump is the head, but I wasn’t sure what to call the others, so they were titled Representative or referred to as delegates. There are 24 member wizarding nations that are part of the ICW, and as stated in the HP Wiki, these nations don’t necessarily fall on the same national boundary lines as their non-magic counterparts. (As Transylvania doesn’t exist in the Muggle world, and in the present timeline, sovereign nations in the Earth Sphere don’t exist at all.)</p><hr/><p>Thank you for reading.</p><p>
