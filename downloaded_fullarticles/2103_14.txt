    <p>Arya huffed and slammed her copy of <em>Intermediate Transfiguration</em> shut, earning a glare from Madam Pince. This piece of parchment explaining how to perform the vanishing spell just was not happening. She was in the library on a Saturday night <em>trying</em> to catch up on work. The library was practically empty and the sound of the book echoed through the old walls. Nope, this piece of parchment was <em>definitely</em> not happening. Not when her mind kept drifting to that blasted quidditch match.</p><p>Arya ran her hand through her short, brown hair, then moved her hand to rub her face and groaned. Gryffindor had a reputation of being one of the top teams and to lose against <em>Hufflepuff</em>… that was just embarrassing. She had let her entire team down all because she let herself be distracted for two stupid seconds by that stupid boy. That stupid black-haired boy who everyone just <em>loved </em>because he was handsome and friendly. Infuriatingly handsome and friendly. He'd done it on purpose, she knew, he purposely distracted her so that she wouldn't catch the snitch.</p><p>Arya was chosen to be seeker as soon as she tried out; she was a natural. She had a talent for observing and seeing, her instincts were sharp and nobody could deny her speed. Arya could see how nervous Edric Dayne, Hufflepuff’s seeker, had looked when he went to shake her hand before the match and she didn't blame him. Arya took pride in her quidditch skills and worked hard at it. Her brothers and father were proud of her talents but her mother, Catelyn, preferred her to focus on her studies, especially now since her O.W.L.s were coming up. Arya was good at her schoolwork but compared to her sister older Sansa, who had been in Ravenclaw, she wasn’t good enough. So what if she had no intentions of becoming a professor or a healer or a snooty Ministry official. Arya enjoyed quidditch and she was good at it. Fantastic, really. It was her dream to play professionally, to one day win the world cup and have thousands of people in the crowd chanting her name as she caught the snitch. There was nothing she would rather do. Well, maybe being an auror and fighting dark wizards.</p><p>It had been 15 minutes into the game and Gryffindor was in the lead. Arya was keeping an eye out for the snitch. She was sitting on her broom, watching the pitch for any sign of the golden ball while keeping an eye on Edric to see if he would find it.</p><p>Flashes of red and yellow were flying by her at full speed. She dodged a couple of bludgers and stayed on her broom, calm and balanced. She repeated the mantra in her head. <em>Swift as a deer, quiet as shadow, quick as a snake, calm as still water…</em></p><p>Finally, that flicker of gold caught her eye and she was racing. The snitch sped around the court and she followed behind, trying to catch up. Just as she noticed that Edric was coming up behind her, she blocked out all of her senses. She would do this every match; it was just Arya and the snitch. She didn't focus on what Edric was doing, so long as she was in front. She was getting closer and closer when suddenly a strong weight slammed into her back, making her jerk. She lost her focus and the snitch was gone.</p><p>"Sorry about that!" yelled a voice coming from in front of her. She snapped her head up to see Gendry Waters, a Hufflepuff chaser, smiling at her. She glared at him in return and just as she was turning to find the snitch again – as Edric had lost sight of it too – her eyes got caught on the dimple in Gendry's cheek. It seemed like time stopped and she was stuck looking at his sky blue eyes and the way his black hair fell into them. Everything else around her was drowned out and the sound of his laugh was ringing in her head until she was finally brought back into focus when a teammate was shouting at her.</p><p>"ARYA, CATCH THE–"</p><p>But it had been too late. A mass of yellow rose from the stands and the cheers were deafening to Arya's ears. She whipped her head around and saw Edric holding the snitch up in one hand. He was grinning and fisting his hand in the air as the crowd chanted his name. She could hear the Gryffindors in the crowd booing and she couldn't bear to look at her teammates. She did, although, catch the eye of Gendry. He was smirking but then his expression softened and he looked almost sympathetic. Arya felt embarrassment and shame choke her up so she flew off down to the ground and marched straight off the pitch and into the change rooms without so much of a 'congratulations' to the winning team.</p><p>She didn't speak to anyone for the rest of the day and now she was in the library, trying to forget and failing. She closed her eyes and took in a deep breath.</p><p>"You look like you're having fun."</p><p>She snapped her eyes open and internally groaned. Of all the people she didn't want to see right now, Gendry had to be at the top of the list. It didn't help that he was looking even more attractive now, in the candlelight that was making his eyes twinkle.</p><p>"Go away." She snapped. Instead of leaving he took a seat right next to her and opened up his charms textbook.</p><p>"Sorry, m'lady, but I've got to study." He said, flicking through the pages of his book and rolling out a piece of parchment. Why was he so stubborn?</p><p>"Study somewhere else." She said, rather loudly and Madam Pince shot another glare her way. Arya ignored it.</p><p>"Why would I want to do that?" He said and chuckled when Madam Pince sent a warning glare to him as well.</p><p>"You're insufferable." Arya said coldly, getting up and gathering her books. She had no intentions of putting up with this stupid bullheaded boy. As she was turning around she felt something take hold of her wrist. His hand. She looked down and stared at it for a while, his fingers wrapped around her.</p><p>"Wait, Arya, I wanted to say that I was sorry about the game. You looked really disappointed but I'm sure you'll catch the snitch next time." His eyes looked earnest but she knew better. She yanked her wrist from his grasp.</p><p>"Oh, of course you're sorry," She spat sarcastically. "If you were going to be sorry then maybe you shouldn’t have intentionally averted my attention from the snitch."</p><p>"Intentionally?" Gendry asked, confused. But then he began to smirk. <em>Shit. </em>He wasn't intentionally distracting her at all. But why was he affecting her so much? Arya never had any interest in boys before and never expected to have any interest in the future either. She felt heat rise to her cheeks.</p><p>"I'm leaving." She said quickly and turned in haste to the exit of the library.</p><p>"Wait!" Gendry called out, getting up from his seat.</p><p>"I'm going to have to ask you to leave." Madam Pince hissed at him but he paid no mind. He gathered his books and jogged over to Arya.</p><p>"Maybe we could practice together some time? You're a really good flyer and I could use some tips." He asked, following her as she walked out of the library and through the corridors.</p><p>"Forget it." Arya scoffed and kept walking, moving out of the way of a random ghost that was floating around the hall.</p><p>"How about on the next Hogsmede trip I'll buy you a Butterbeer, then?" He asked and stopped walking when Arya halted to a stop and turned to look at him. He was smiling down at her and she couldn't help but feel her heart flutter for a second. Not letting him see the vulnerability, she rolled her eyes.</p><p>"Fine, whatever. Goodbye, Waters." She managed to sputter out, finally reaching the two paths where they would part to get to their common rooms.</p><p>"I'll see you soon, Stark."</p><p>Arya was glad that she turned too quickly for him to see the blush that rose on her cheeks and she hurried down the hall, the quidditch match completely forgotten.</p>
