    <p>Emily Thibault had been a medi-witch for a very long time. The job had grown and stretched around her, and she loved every minute of it; it drove her mother crazy, since it was always meant to be a temporary placement, and that was just an added bonus. She was good at what she did, and people trusted her. The patients liked her because she wasn’t loud or brash, and she still got them what they need. The Healers liked her because she would guide them with a gentle hand, remembered each of their weird quirks and habits, and yet remained fully in charge. They knew it, and they respected her for it.</p><p>Over the years, she had seen many a class of trainees come and go. She’d been there for marriages and babies, successes and failures. She had watched so many people come in and out of St. Mungo’s that the other nurses all counted on her judgment of the incoming classes; they made a game of predicting who would make it to the end. She was a very good judge of character, and telling the good Healers from the bad was no exception. She could tell instantly who was going to finish the program and flourish, and who was going to flounder under the stress and fail.</p><p>But Emily had been very wrong about Harry Potter.</p><p>She remembered watching him come in with his group of fresh-faced kids, just out of school and just itching to muck up her hospital. She had seen a dozen like him; high praise all the way through school, bolstered by natural talent and early fame, never working hard. He’d been unimpressive to look at; thin and wiry, with a mass of curly, unkempt hair and sheer terror in his eyes. She was immediately convinced he wasn’t going to last.</p><p>When the others had asked her, she’d just scoffed and said, ‘he’s trading on his name. He won’t make it through his first year. Just watch.’ After all, they all knew what had happened with Harry Potter during his Auror training.</p><p>The first week, she had been justified in her judgement. He was always late for rounds, never seemed to look professional. He seemed confused half the time, and kept ending up in the wrong ward when he was called to a case. She had been harsh and unforgiving with him, and he had never once snapped back.</p><p>The second week, though, everything had changed. Harry Potter arrived the second week of his shifts a changed man; he found his feet. He was quiet, but his presence commanded respect. He was powerful, but he was kind. He handled patients with calm finesse well beyond his years; he charmed old ladies, joked around with the lads, and spoke with confidence to parents worried about their children. Most importantly, he took his time. He stopped trying to rush and was a better Healer for it. He wasn’t flashy with his casting, always choosing the conservative and well-thought out treatment options. He wasn’t trying to prove anything, and his healing showed restraint and care.</p><p>Emily had already decided she might have been wrong when Harry Potter decided to be everything she respected in a Healer. His first overnight shift, the one that usually caused the Trainees to be intolerably grumpy while they made mistake after mistake, Potter had ended up with an emergency case. A small girl had come in, looking much younger than her eleven years, transferred from Hogwarts with the worst case of boils Emily had ever seen. Her mother was abroad, and no one had managed to get a hold of her. The child entered screaming and crying, generally terrified and inconsolable.</p><p>Potter hadn’t even paused; he sent nurses off to find the girl’s mother, began casting charms to relieve the child’s pain, and then calmly put on gloves and a mask. He sat down in a chair beside the little girl’s bed, and refused to move for six hours. He spoke soothing words until she fell asleep, played games with her when she woke up, gave clear, concise directions to Emily when she asked if she could help. When the girl’s mother finally appeared, he’d calmly left, accepting only the pat on the shoulder from the exhausted mother, as though he hadn’t just been selfless all night long.</p><p>Yes, Emily had been wrong about Harry Potter. She wasn’t too proud to be able to admit it. The problem was, admitting it had made her like Potter, and liking Potter had led to an obscene amount of time spent worried about the young man.</p><p>He had sailed through training, and acquired a position immediately afterwards on the emergency ward, where he buzzed and flew, efficient and organised. One year in, he’d started a research project, trying to create new detection spells that would capture more information when patients first arrived. Professionally, he was a superstar, poised to become unit head by thirty.</p><p>Emily wasn’t worried about Healer Potter, but she worried continuously about the man attached to the name. Harry had a sadness about his eyes, a sort of permanent exhaustion, an expression that looked like he was just a tiny bit disappointed all the time, even when he was laughing. He had filled out since those first few years, grown into a man instead of a boy, but she sometimes caught him hunched and introspective, a frown that was well beyond his years plastered on his face. He was lonely and he was afraid. He had good friends, she knew, who took good care of him. He was proud of his work and enjoyed the hospital. Emily was pretty sure Harry wasn’t actually aware of his loneliness. But she saw it, and watched as it ate away at him.</p><p>Emily also knew exactly how long Harry had been carrying on with Mr Malfoy, because she could place the day when his face had changed. There had been a sudden jolt in his step, a tiny wistful smile she had never seen before. He spent the next few weeks wavering back and forth between that smile and a complicated frown that she didn’t understand.</p><p>All of this knowledge meant that she approached the lab with caution, hoping that she wasn’t about to destroy a carefully built web of background encouragement and care. Young men were a delicate breed; they required firm yet invisible guidance, and opening this particular door would be hard to reverse. She was actually a little nervous, which was ridiculous. She took a deep breath and knocked.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Healer Potter?”</p><p>“Emily,” Harry sighed. “I’m just...It’s really not a good time, and—”</p><p>“I am aware that you are hiding in here, Potter, but… we have a…”</p><p>Harry waited</p><p>“A situation,” Emily finished with a curiously nondescript expression on her face.</p><p>Harry massaged his temples and officially gave up on his research for the day.</p><p>“Alright, lead the way.”</p><p>The hospital was actually pretty quiet, a sure sign of everything going to shit at any possible second. Emily was moving in her efficient shuffle, and Harry was trying his best to keep a leisurely pace behind her, in a quick step he’d perfected over the past three years as an apprentice healer.</p><p>“He came in an hour ago,” Emily explained. “The diagnostics team still hasn’t determined what he’s taken, but he wouldn’t stop asking for you. Got very belligerent and then bit one of the nurses. We figured it was probably just easier to come get you.”</p><p>She handed him the folio and he skimmed it quickly, finally landing on the patient’s name. He always read this last so that he remembered it when he reached the patient.</p><p>“You have got to be—“</p><p>“Yes, we thought you might react that way,” Emily sighed, pulling back the curtain of the bed they had reached.</p><p>“You found him! Good job, pion. Nice to see someone in this place can do something right. Potter! You found me. Well done. That’s not easy.” Malfoy’s tone was thick and swimming in an unnatural lisp.</p><p>Harry narrowed his eyes. “Malfoy?”</p><p>“The one and only. Well... okay, not really, but the only one who... Wait, where’s that other one? The nurse with the ginger hair?”</p><p>“Malfoy, what did you take?” Harry asked carefully.</p><p>Malfoy was splayed across the bed, the regulation hospital gown not closed and barely covering him. He kept wriggling and writhing, and sitting up suddenly.</p><p>“I dunno, Mr Solve All the Problems. You’ll have to figure it out,” Malfoy sneered.</p><p>“Listen, you need to just tell us, so we can—”</p><p>“Dunno, dunno, dunno!” Malfoy sang, standing suddenly on the bed.</p><p>“Mr Malfoy! You need to lie back down!” Emily shouted.</p><p>“Emily, I’m sure you have a million other things to attend,” Harry said through gritted teeth. “Why don’t you leave this patient with me.”</p><p>Emily looked nervous, but did scurry off. Harry grabbed Malfoy by the arm and dragged him back down onto the bed.</p><p>“Oh, careful now Potter. I know you like it rough, but you’re at work,” Malfoy crooned.</p><p>“What the fuck are you doing here? And what is wrong with you?” Harry hissed, still holding Malfoy’s arm.</p><p>“Hm, can’t I visit you at work,” Malfoy pouted leaning very close to Harry’s face.</p><p>“You bloody well know you can’t, you idiot,” Harry took a deep breath and forced himself to be a healer. “Okay, Mal-Draco. Can you tell me the last thing you remember eating or drinking?”</p><p>Malfoy scrunched up his nose, “Well. I left your flat this morning, and got a coffee at that ghastly little place up the road, and took a sandwich with me.”</p><p>Malfoy wriggled out of Harry’s grasp and tapped his chin.</p><p>“Only then, I got to work and had a glass of pumpkin juice that tasted quite... off. Probably should have thrown it out,” he mused.</p><p>“Okay, well, now you’re at Mungo’s and not... acting yourself. We are running some tests to see what it might be.”</p><p>Malfoy flung himself on the bed with an exasperated sigh and flung a dramatic arm over his eyes as Harry retreated.</p><p>Several hours later, of course, Harry’s patience had disappeared completely. They were no closer to figuring out what Malfoy had ingested, and in the meantime, he was getting increasingly frustrating to be around.</p><p>“Harry... psst, Harry.” Malfoy said for the fifteenth time. “Come sit by me.”</p><p>“Malfoy, no, we’re fine right where we are,” Harry said, a hand on his face.</p><p>Malfoy crossed his arms and pouted, which did not help with the fact that Harry wanted to leap across the bed and smother Malfoy with his body. He was pretty sure he would have felt that way even if he and Malfoy hadn’t been sleeping together for six months. Exasperating, needy Malfoy was exactly how he’d ended up in that particular mess, and he was no less turned on by it now.</p><p>“Harry,” Malfoy said, his voice quiet and distant instead of the strange whining it had been for the past hour. Harry looked up. “Can I tell you a secret?”</p><p>“Um,” Harry said. “I guess so?”</p><p>“You have to come here, though. It’s a secret. I have to say it quietly.”</p><p>Harry sighed again and stood up, moving toward the bed. Malfoy reached over and pulled his head down to be level with his. He whispered in Harry’s ear, and the air made his skin prickle and his breath snap in his lungs.</p><p>“I still like you,” he whispered. “You should stop sleeping with me and date me instead.”</p><p>“S-still,” Harry stammered, his hand unconsciously running through Malfoy’s hair.</p><p>“I’m scared, Harry,” he murmured. “I know who gave me the potion.”</p><p>“Who, Draco? You can tell me.”</p><p>“I can’t!” Draco said, leaning his forehead against Harry’s. “You’ll be mad at me.”</p><p>Harry sighed and pulled away long enough to settle down on the bed beside Draco, who now had tears running down his face. Harry wrapped an arm around him. It was a very bad idea, to be doing this in the hospital. But it was also midnight and quiet, and he was tired.</p><p>“Shh,” he soothed. “We’ll figure it out. You don’t have to tell me.”</p><p>When Emily came back around the corner carrying the report from the potions team, she found Healer Potter wrapped around Mr Malfoy, both of them asleep and looking content. She pulled the curtain closed; Malfoy had only taken a bad batch Veritaserum, and he'd be fine in the morning anyway.</p><p>She knew that Potter could do with some peaceful sleep.</p>
