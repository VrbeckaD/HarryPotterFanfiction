    <p>‘I have a five page essay due in tomorrow and my laptop’s at three per cent, and you’re sitting in front of the only plug socket in this entire place, so I don’t care how intimidatingly attractive you are, I’m sitting here’</p><p>‘That sounded less terrible in my head’ the black haired boy added as an afterthought, before sliding into the coffee shop booth opposite Draco, plugging in his laptop and beginning to type.</p><p>Draco had no idea what to say to this, so he said nothing at all. The black haired boy seemed to engrossed in his work to notice that he hadn’t said anything, so it didn’t seem to matter.</p><p>Draco took advantage of his absolute obliviousness to the world, and studied the boy in front of him. He had black hair, messed from him running his hands through it- a habit that Draco immediately picked up on. His eyes were a dark green, with flecks of brown, and lined faintly with black. His eyebrows were perfect, and his cheekbones were so subtly highlighted that Draco almost didn’t realise. He was wearing a pale pink hoodie and black ripped skinny jeans, and Draco estimated him to be over six foot tall. From the way he had spoken so confidently earlier and his appearance, Draco would peg him as the social type, a charmer, and practically the definition of an extrovert. The complete opposite of Draco.</p><p>The boy still seemed to be completely focused on his essay and apparently hadn’t noticed him staring, luckily for Draco. He decided to ignore him unless contact was initiated from the other side. He took a gulp of his coffee, then turned back to his book.</p><p>---</p><p>About half an hour later, Draco was startled from his reading trance by a large groan from the boy opposite him. He had pushed the laptop into the centre of the table to make space for his head, which was now resting on folded arms on the table.</p><p>‘Uh- um… What’s the essay about?’ Draco asked tentatively. He was almost painfully unable to converse with strangers, and his social anxiety didn’t really help either. Talking to anyone outside of his friendship group was difficult for him, and usually very awkward for anyone involved. Draco knew that he was terrible at social interactions, and could not start, or hold, a conversation with strangers, and therefore tried to avoid it whenever possible. He had no idea what had prompted him to talk to a stranger (and one who had called him ‘intimidatingly attractive’ no less).</p><p>‘Some stupid Shakespeare play. I hate Shakespeare. I hate bloody plays.’ The black haired boy lifted his head out of his arms to look at Draco with a piercing gaze, but stayed resting on the table. </p><p>Draco actually loved plays, and Shakespeare, whilst he was not Draco’s favourite playwright, was undeniably talented. He loved English in general- the freedom of expression was so much more appealing than maths or sciences.</p><p>‘Can I read it?’ Draco asked hesitantly. He wasn’t sure if he had stepped over the line of what was deemed normal conversation, but the boy nodded.</p><p>‘Yeah sure…’</p><p>There was a short silence in which Draco had the chance to read the introduction, before he was interrupted by the black haired boy again.</p><p>‘I need a nap. Wake me up at some point will you?’ he asked, then dropped his head back onto the table.</p><p>If asking to read a half finished essay was overstepping, then this was a giant leap over the line, but the black haired boy seemed totally okay with it.</p><p>Draco started to have a mini panic. What if he was supposed to be somewhere at a certain time and Will let him sleep past it? What if he woke him up too early and the boy got annoyed? What if someone tried to steal his laptop? Should Draco go after the guy or wake up the boy? Draco was not comfortable with this situation at all.</p><p>He ignored the terrified screaming going on in his brain and focused on the essay in front of him.</p><p>
  <em>Just think about the essay, Draco. It’ll be fine.</em>
</p><p>The black haired boy was asleep by now, in a position that did not seem comfortable at all, and in a crowded cafe relying on a complete stranger to look after his stuff and to wake him up at some point.</p><p>
  <em>Just ignore him. Read the essay. Don’t think about it. It’ll be fine.</em>
</p><p>And so he took his own advice, and started to read.</p><p>---</p><p>His essay was ok, but it wasn’t great. Draco made a few adjustments while he was reading, mainly to spellings and grammar mistakes. When he was done, he looked at the boy in front of him, still asleep.</p><p>Currently the essay was at two pages, and it was 3.49pm. Draco didn’t know whether to wake the boy. The coffee shop closed at 5, which was plenty of time to write three more pages. The boy had even produced a plan for him to work with. Yes, it only consisted of about twenty words, with an average of two describing each proposed paragraph, but it couldn’t be that hard, right? And so Draco began to type.</p><p>---</p><p>Harry was shaken awake about an hour later. He looked up to see a young and apparently terrified barista nudging him gently.</p><p>‘Oh- uh- sorry sir, I didn’t want to wake you, but, um, we’re closing soon…’ she said, looking at her shoes.</p><p>Oh fuck. The essay.</p><p>‘Oh no, it’s fine, don’t worry about it. I’ll just get my stuff together and I’ll get going.’</p><p>Harry saw his laptop, closed on the table in front of him. His copy of Romeo and Juliet was next to it. The cup of tea he had ordered about two hours ago, and only drunk half of before falling asleep, was finished. He shoved his laptop and book into his bag and got up to go. He smiled at the waitress on the way out, then hopped on the bus home.</p><p>---</p><p>Sitting on his bed, Harry tentatively opened his laptop. Stuck to the black screen was a bright pink Post-It Note, with a message written in a small, neat hand.</p><p>‘I hope you don’t mind that I finished your tea. Good luck with the essay :) -Draco’</p><p>Hmm. His name was Draco. Cute.</p><p>Harry peeled the note off his screen, and turned it on. He plugged in his headphones, found some music, and opened up his google docs. He read through what he had already written, but it seemed different. Less… terrible.</p><p>He was pretty sure he had written two pages in total, but the essay kept going, with things that he didn’t remember writing. There were five complete pages, in his style of writing (except better), which he had not written.</p><p>He picked up Draco’s note again, and reread it.  ‘Good luck with the essay’ he had written, with a smiley face.</p><p>Damn.</p>
