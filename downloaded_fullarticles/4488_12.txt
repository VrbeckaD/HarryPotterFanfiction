    <p>Hadrian Peverell, Lord of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Peverell and Magical Britain’s ambassador to the Vampiric Race, was and has been for some time now; a vampire. After the defeat of the Dark Lord Voldemort Harry assumed his lordship and went about correcting the many deficiencies in his mind and body. Through the convenient wonder of nutrition potions (in addition to many other medical concoctions) and complete access to the Peverell estate’s extensive libraries, Harry became one of the most influential and powerful members of the Wizarding World. He was seen as “Dumbeldore’s permanent substitute” due to his sheer magical strength and acumen. This persevered even after he was bitten by an Elder Vampire and thus became the first wizard to not only be bitten by a vampire and retain his or her magic, but to have their magic augmented by the bite. So atop his existing roles of a lord of the Wizengamot and Chief Creature Liaison, he also became Ambassador to the Vampiric Race. </p><p>Harry opened his eyes feeling extremely neutral as always he always does after any activity, even the fake sleeping he was just participating in. Beside him in the sprawling bed of Peverell Palace’s master bedroom was another faceless lover. At a very young age, Harry discovered that he had a distinct like for men and as such that is why there is presently a man next to him in bed. To him, this man meant nothing; as every vampire had a mate so would he. With this in mind (as it almost always is) he sprung out of bed and initiated his morning ritual.</p><p>“Flopsy!”, Harry called without a hint of irritation or anger. Flopsy appeared with a silent pop, “How can Flopsy be helping Master Hadrian?”. He requested that the man in bed be returned to his home with one of the gift hampers he requested be prepared and thank him for his services. Harry always felt the need to express his gratitude to his bed partners for weathering the insatiable lust of a vampire. With this done, an owl glided through the open window in the breakfast room he was currently dining in. Retrieving the letter from it’s talons, it read:</p><p>	To Lord Hadrian Peverell,<br/>
We, the Volturi, feel obliged to inform you that at 6:34pm yesterday one Ms.Bella Swan<br/>
made multiple attempts to bewitch the vampire Edward Cullen of Forks through use of a<br/>
Befuddlement Charm. This information was acquired after limited investigation and as<br/>
such we request that you, as Ambassador to the Vampiric Race, remedy the situation at<br/>
hand in an effort to prevent further attempts of this nature.<br/>
Professional Regards,<br/>
Aro, Caius, and Marcus</p><p>After sending off a curt “Yes of course”, Harry departed for what would be yet another monotonous intervention. Donning his ministry robes and ambassador’s pendant Harry apparated to Cullen household. The Cullen’s were always involved in some dispute, none of them their doing, but all of them somehow including at least one of their number. At least, this is what he’d been told by Aro at one of their quarterly afternoon teas. Afternoon teas where he cant stop himself from trying to recruit Harry to the Volturi due to his extensive skill set and unrivalled knowledge. Sadly, Harry’s knowledge was unrivalled because of the death of so very many people during the Second Wizarding War. Almost all of Harry’s friends and acquaintances had fallen to either a death eater or Voldemort himself. The only one to survive was Luna, and he was thankful for that small instance of mercy the universe seemed content to supply. Appearing outside their Forks residence, Harry approached the modern abode. He would have completed this approach if not for a blond vampire spraining from the near by forest, tackling him, and finally licking his neck while murmuring “Mate”.</p>
