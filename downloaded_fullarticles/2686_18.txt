I'm not just a Hufflepuff like my name."</p><p>Godric stated, "No, you're fierce, funny, smart and a hell of a lot braver than me at the best of times."</p><p>Helga smirked. "You're a lot braver than me, Ricky."</p><p>Godric smiled. "Maybe I exaggerated a tad, but you're right. I'm more than just a Gryffindor."</p><p>Helga beamed, "You're the bravest man I know, but you're also extremely sensitive and smarter than me."</p><p>Godric teased,Â  "But almost everyone is smarter than you, Hel."</p><p>Helga grinned. "Oh I know. I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed."</p><p>Godric replied, "But I love you anyway."</p></div>
