    <p>Chapter One</p><p>Ivy grinned down at her babies they were three-week's old and one was sleeping and one was awake she had twins with her husband Blaise. Her daughter Amara was awake looking around she had a caramel skin tone and had dark brown almost red hair she looked like Blaise but acted like her. Her son Leonardo on the other hand was her little double he had tan skin and red curly hair but he was sleeping and he was like his father the silent type he would sleep all the time and when he was awake, he just watched everything like a tiny Slytherin. Ivy looked up when the RV door opened, they were traveling the United State's they wanted to get away from the media back home. Blaise smiled at her and Ivy walked over and Blaise kissed her on the lips. Ivy wrapped her arms around her husband's neck he put his hand on her lower back.</p><p>Ivy had red curly hair that reached her waist and an hourglass figure with tan skin from being out in the sun for a week Blaise had dark brown skin and short buzz cut he was 6''2 Ivy had just turned 19 and Blaise 20. Ivy had gone to receive training in healing she had also read every medical book that she could get her hands on. Blaise on the other hand had gone into Warding and curse-breaking after school. When Ivy had married Blaise the Weasley's had totally abandoned her except for the twin's they had excepted her to marry Ron. Blaise had mended his friendship with Draco and Draco was Leo's godfather Luna was his godmother. George was Amara's godfather and Angelina George's wife was her godmother. Fred and Katy had called being their next child's godparents. Ivy and Blaise were Roxanne's godparents she was George and Angelina's daughter she was a year old. Luna and Neville had a little boy who was 9 months older than the twins.</p><p>Ivy moaned when Blaise kissed her neck and she said ''Wait a minute Blaise look''</p><p>Blaise groaned ''Ivy you know I don't like Muggle TV.'' Ivy turned him around and he watched as what looked like an Inferi started to attack a policeman.</p><p>It had ''Hoax'' underneath the picture Ivy whispered ''It's not a hoax Blaise.''</p><p>Blaise said ''The magical government will take care of it'' he reached out for her.</p><p>He touched her arms and she was shaking she whispered ''It's going to get much worse Blaise.'' Blaise said ''Okay if you think so then we prepare and we go home alright'' he turned her to face him and lifted her chin and said ''We go to a magical ally and raid some store's okay''</p><p>Ivy nodded and she looked at her husband and said ''We will be okay.'' Blaise said ''You go to the store's and I will head to the magical alleys.''</p><p>Ivy nodded and she said ''You want to take Amara and I'll take Leonardo''</p><p>Blaise nodded and he put on the chest baby carrier and put her against his chest and Amara put her head to his chest and cooed softly and looked up at him and Blaise chuckled and said ''Hello my Slytherin Princess''</p><p>Ivy said ''She's going to be a Gryffindor Blaise''</p><p>Blaise smirked and said ''Would you like to bet on it?''</p><p>Ivy hummed and said ''Okay betting with what''</p><p>Blaise hummed ''When I win, I want to see you in a nursing uniform the muggle kind not the healer kind''</p><p>Ivy hummed ''When I win, I want you to dress as a Gryffindor well maybe just the robe and tie.''</p><p>Blaise shivered in disgust just thinking about it. He said ''I'm going to win''</p><p>Ivy hummed ''Okay then'' and she picked up her son and said ''Come on little one let's go be bad.'' Leo opened an eye and looked up at her and smiled a baby smile. Blaise apparated with their daughter and ivy walked out of the RV and locked up she went to the road and hailed a Taxi. She said ''Could you take me to the nearest Mall please''</p><p>The man said ''Lenox Square Mall.''</p><p>He started driving to the mall Ivy smiled down at her son Leo blinked up at her slowly and grinned up at her and she cooed ''You're the cutest baby ever.'' He closed his eyes again and then fell asleep again. She put him in the baby wrap that sat the baby against her breast. She looked and saw they were pulling up to the mall the driver said ''29.09.''</p><p>Ivy handed him a two American 20's and she got out of the car and the driver said ''Hey lady you gave me 40 dollars.''</p><p>She turned and said ''I know'' and she walked away and the driver's eye's widened and he drove away. She walked into the mall and looked at the mall directory. She hummed ''Baby Gap first or bath and body work's'' she looked at her son. He was gripping the edge of the baby wrap still sleeping. Ivy hummed ''Baby Gap you and your sister will need clothes.'' She shivered when a cold breeze whipped her hair to the side. She turned and saw a dark figure next to the pillar. A group of teen's walked by and the figure was gone. She frowned and looked at her son to see if he felt the cold wind and his eyes were open, she said ''You saw that too right'' all she got was a soft smile from her son and he closed his eyes back.</p><p>Blaise apparated to an alley way he walked to the brick wall and he put his hand on the wall and it went right threw he mumbled ''Interesting.'' Blaise looked at his daughter who was wide awake sucking on a newborn pacifier. He walked through with his daughter and the alley was way different then Diagon Alley that's for sure it looked like any other muggle run establishment except there was magic all around. He went to a trunk shop and he went to look around he looked at the expensive trunks and read the sign under an cherry oak one he mumbled ''four bedroom's and bathroom's kitchen's with an indoor green house and magical creature habitat.''</p><p>A woman walked over and said ''She's so beautiful''</p><p>Blaise said ''Thank you how much for the trunk and could you give me a trunk for just food and storage also including this one.'' The woman said ''Of course that will be 500 gallon's and the standard trunk with five compartment's for food storage and item storage is 100'' Blaise nodded and paid for the trunks and the woman shrunk them down for him and Blaise put them into his pocket.</p><p>3 hours later</p><p>Blaise walked into their RV and he looked and saw the floor covered in item's shoes baby thing's food frozen and canned snacks. Blaise said ''Wow''</p><p>Ivy said ''I'm planning on going to a Walmart tonight after they close.''</p><p>Blaise said ''Then you better get some sleep'' he put Amara in her crib where the bunk beds were, they had made them into a crib and the top bunk was for the baby's thing's. Amara's tiny hand went to her brother's and she held onto the hand. Leo smiled in his sleep Ivy walked over and stood in front of her husband. He kissed the side of her head and said ''Let's get some sleep before robbing some muggle store's.'' Ivy smiled at him and lead them into their room and Blaise flicked his wand and ward's around the RV went into lockdown.</p>
