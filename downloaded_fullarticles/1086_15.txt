    <p>The duel was amazing.</p>
<p>Hermione and Neville traded spells with ferocious intensity. Hermione, perhaps surprisingly, was the more aggressive of the two. Her preference seemed to be for concussive attacks, utilising Reducto, Confringo and other concussive spells, which can be found on the HP Wiki, with gusto and true intent.</p>
<p>"Man, she's a scary bitch," whispered Ron.</p>
<p>"I know she is," replied Harry, just as quiet. "Do you remember the time she 'jinxed' that contract and it completely ruined Marietta's face for like a month? I read up on jinxes and none I could find would have that effect. I swear to Merlin or whatever relevant Wizarding deity that she cursed it."</p>
<p>"Well, yeah. She's insane. And that happened liked two months ago. Also, didn't you say that you wanted to get with Marietta because 'at least her scars will distract from mine'?"</p>
<p>"...Yes, I did. And I stand by it, Ronald. Now let's focus and see how Neville returns serve."</p>
<p>The duo shifted their focus back to the match. Amazingly, Neville was holding up quite admirably. In fact, he looked...almost.......<em>coooooooooooll. </em></p>
<p>"Miss Granger, I'm sorry. But your attacks ain't gonna stop me." A quick pirouette followed by a Petrificus Totalus forced Hermione to back flip over the spell. While in mid air, she fired off an Incendio, screaming, "BURN! YOU BASTARD."</p>
<p>"Ain't got time to burn, sweetie," opined Neville, making the hearts of every girl beat faster and the pants of every male beat harder.</p>
<p>He flicked back his James Dean like hair and said, "I'm gonna take this serious, girly." </p>
<p>He removed the leather jacket, showing off his 'Witch Which is Which Witch?' shirt. The swoons intensified.</p>
<p>Hermione smirked and started laughing.</p>
<p>"Hahahahahhahahahahah, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAAHHA. MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAAHAAHAHA. AHAMUAHAHAHAHAHAH."</p>
<p>She smiled and wiped the tears of mirth from her eyes.</p>
<p>"I'm going to fucking kill you."</p>
<p>"You can try, sweetiebabepie."</p>
<p>"OK, this is very out of character for both of them," whispered Ron.</p>
<p>"YOU WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT BEING IN CHARACTER IS," angsted Harry, who then winked. </p>
<p>"That relax you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, thanks Harry. The world is a simpler place when you whine like a bitch. A basic bitch, at that."</p>
<p>Just then, Harry frowned. He watched as Hermione ran up the wall and back flipped off, firing Bombarda with relish. He observed Neville do a one handed back spring into a twisting spin flip, shooting back an Impediment jinx in mid-air. He perceived Hermione kip up, land, do a front flip, then cartwheel to the left, blasting another Incendio when she landed. Finally, he watched as Neville side stepped the Incendio and <em>smouldered.</em></p>
<p>"Actually, Hermione is sort of in character, just exaggerated greatly."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Hermione is very competitive. She's focused, goal-oriented and highly-driven. However, as the Edgecombe incident shows, she also has a massive mean streak, along with the centaur thing. Have you read about what centaurs do? <em>She would have. </em>We know she's assertive, she scared the shit out of Grawp, though that might be a mixing of two separate canons. She has also pretty much got us to submit to her and we're both pretty stubborn, opinionated arseholes."</p>
<p>"True. I sometimes argue with the mirror when it says "You have dirt on your nose dearie" and I don't want to admit I do, even when I can clearly see it. I'm literally looking in the mirror."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I've had that argument about my messy hair, really because I can. But anyway, she's got us both cowed. We also know she is inclined to violence. Remember when she punched the shit out of Malfoy?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, but you've done that as well."</p>
<p>"Did you hear me whisper "Oh golly, that made me so darn wet" after I punched him?"</p>
<p>"No. No, I did not."</p>
<p>"When we were Time Turnering, I heard her say that. And after, which was actually chronologically before, when we weren't Time Turnering, she kept shifting her thighs a lot, which, in my admittedly limited understanding, implies either her balls were sticking to her inner thighs or her undies were sticking to something else."</p>
<p>"<em>Girls don't have balls!"</em></p>
<p>Harry winked his eye and said, "Bingo. So, she is a highly driven, magically talented witch who has a massive mean streak and seems to garner some form of sexual pleasure from violence. She has an assertive nature that has successfully cowed a giant and two, even by the standard of teenage boys, stubborn teenage boys. Consequently, in my mind, it is likely she would go out of her way to learn gymnastics to allow her greater maneuverability in the event she had to have a duel. She would use more destructive spells, fueled by her lust for violence. And she would proclaim her desire to kill and destroy, as she is, most of all, <em>competitive as all get out. </em>And this competitive drive, all encompassing, would be the foundational basis for her highly aggressive behaviour in this duel."</p>
<p>"Wow, that was fairly loquacious for you. Also seems like a fairly large load of rubbish."</p>
<p>"Quite. I reckon it's just to make this go longer."</p>
<p>"What longer? Oh, like when you use padding in your undies to make your willy look larger?"</p>
<p>"Exactly! Or when you use filler in an essay to reach the word count."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, All to reach the conclusion that could really have been reached about 1000 words ago. Stupid Snape and his two foot essays. On that note, what about Neville?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he's just acting really weird. Anyway, let's watch. We've missed at least seventeen flips, Hermione summoned a dragon, Neville countered with a Kraken, to which Hermione replied with Ono Jiro, to which Neville defended by throwing a cow him, to which Hermione countered by throwing a PETA member at the cow, to which Neville replied by Banishing both to the Shadow Realm."</p>
<p>Both combatants stood across from each other. The match was in the final stages.</p>
<p>"Miss Granger, you fought well. But I ain't got no more time to waste, girlie. I gotta get going and get this finished, gal."</p>
<p>"I'm going to castrate you and make your stupid toad eat it."</p>
<p>"God Hermione, what the hell?" whispered her two best friends, who were slowly reconsidering their position on that. The two warriors launched at each other. Hermione fired a Confringo.</p>
<p>
  <em>And Neville. Moonwalked. Out. Of. The. Way.</em>
</p>
<p>"AW, SHHEEEEEEIIIIIITTT, SON," screamed Draco, who was there, also.</p>
<p>Hermione looked shocked. Neville smirked and said, "Now it ends, my sweet baby."</p>
<p>Hermione tried to recover but was unable.</p>
<p>Neville smoothly raised his wand.</p>
<p>"Baby, <em>Expelliarmus."</em></p>
<p>Hermione's wand flew from her hand, straight and like an arrow. </p>
<p>Neville lit his cigarette and started smoking, his leather jacket back on.</p>
<p>He raised his hand and said, "Checkmate."</p>
<p>He missed catching the wand, being about six inches off it.</p>

  <em>Kwwweeiiiicch squelch</em>
</p>
<p align="left">"Oh, nah, Neville's in character."</p>
<p align="left">"Yeah, he'd do something dopey like that."</p>
<p align="left">"Anywho, everyone, let's get Neville to the Hospital Wing. He needs to get that wand out of his eye."</p>
