    <p>
  <span>On Christmas Eve, the Golden Trio finally gave up on their Wizard’s Chess tournament when Ron almost fell asleep while defending his queen. As much as his friends teased him for it, it was true that most of the household had been embroiled in Quidditch matches all day, and Ron had been brutally destroyed in terms of Keeping ability by Oliver Wood. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mum will probably barge in and wake us up early, anyhow,” Ron yawned, checking the time.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s early to you, Ron? Noon? Two in the afternoon?” Hermione laughed, elbowing her best friend. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll have you know, I work the night shift almost every weekend. I’m used to sleeping in,” Ron defended himself. Hermione had no doubt that Ron’s night shift schedule at the joke shop was a result of their new employee, Verity Stewart, but chose not to say anything. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry had a different approach. “Getting real busy on the night shift, eh? Hope you’re turning off those security cameras, or Fred and George would have quite the show.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I won’t have you spreading rumors. If I was seeing anyone - which I’m not - I would have brought them here, wouldn’t I?” Ron turned around, starting to get ready for bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, are you implying we could have another guest next Christmas, Won-Won?” Harry stood up and followed Ron, dancing around him and causing Hermione to laugh loudly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mate, I’m not the one getting married at 22,” he retorted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That didn’t seem like a ‘no,’ Ron,” Hermione joined in on the teasing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron turned to Hermione, ready to change the argument. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hermione is still single! Can’t we all joke about that?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ron, how dare you mock my very good friend, Hermione,” Harry said in a very serious tone before breaking into a smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Soon, Ron and Hermione were both laughing as well, and all three said goodnight. It was a nice reminder of their time back at Hogwarts, just staying up late playing board games and talking about their lives. Hermione missed it, with all of them getting so busy in their careers. By next Christmas, she knew that everyone would be in a different place and she wished that she didn’t feel like she was falling so far behind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry and Ginny had been dating for years, and in the new year, would tie the knot right in the back field at the Burrow. In fact, on the same grounds as the Quidditch match earlier that night. Ron, officially single but definitely not telling all, was exactly the kind of young man who would either find a girl by next Christmas or be matched up by his mother. Hermione was glad to avoid that circus, after their sweet but failed romance in sixth year. It had been the most awkward three weeks of her life, and Harry had never stopped giving her grief over the aborted attempt at joining the Weasley family. But where would Hermione be a year from now? Promoted at the ministry? Still living with Crookshanks in central London? At the Burrow as her parents went skiing? She shook her head, dismissing the thoughts to another year away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione slowly descended the stairs of the Burrow. After years of coming to the house, she had gradually figured out that all the Weasley men were intensely deep sleepers. In fact, the only people she risked waking were Gabrielle, George’s fiancée, a known insomniac, and Ginny, who had avoided the Weasley curse of being dead to the world as soon as the sun went down. Fred’s fiancée Angelina was a 50-50 shot, so Hermione watched her step carefully as she went past the third floor. She paused, heard no sounds from inside the room on the left, and continued down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She figured a quick cup of tea would soothe her enough to fall asleep, passing by Ginny’s room and hearing her friend’s soft snores from behind the pink door. When she rounded the corner and entered the living room, Hermione was surprised to see anyone still up past 11 p.m. after such an exhausting day, especially when that person was deeply engrossed in a Jane Austen novel.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Percy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Percy had just passed the disastrous first proposal by Mr. Darcy and was trying to hold in a gasp when he heard his name from the stairwell. Looking up, he saw Hermione, still in her purple Christmas sweater and jeans, evidently surprised to see him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Miss Granger?” He echoed her surprised tone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do I have to get you out of that habit again, Percy? It took months for the first time to get you to stop calling me that,” Hermione whined. She continued to the kitchen, cheating with her wand to make a quick cup of peppermint tea. “What are you reading, another Ministry file?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Actually, it’s an obscure Muggle book Dad bought at a sale last year. It’s called </span>
  <em>
    <span>Pride and Prejudice,</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Percy said, showing Hermione the crinkled cover while keeping his hand inside the book to save his page. “It’s quite good.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione snorted, “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Pride and Prejudice </span>
  </em>
  <span>isn’t obscure, Percy, it’s one of the most famous books in the Muggle world.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Defensively, Percy held the book closer to him, pushing up his horned rim reading glasses as he did so. She couldn’t believe that he still wore the same glasses that he had when they were in school. “Well, I wouldn’t know that, would I?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione sat down in the armchair nearby Percy’s couch, looking at him with an expression asking permission and receiving a casual shrug from the middle Weasley child. She sipped her tea again and put her feet up on the coffee table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been meaning to ask, what happened at that meeting with Shacklebolt last Friday?” Percy asked, brushing his fingers through his coppery hair. “The one you had to cancel lunch for.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione frowned slightly, apologizing, “Sorry again about lunch. You know our Friday lunches are the highlights of my week. We do get a fair amount of work done.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re not a bad conversationalist, either. I do occasionally consider ourselves friends,” Percy chuckled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Err...of course,” Hermione grinned awkwardly back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She knew that Percy definitely enjoyed the lunches, seeing as he usually ate at his desk, in his father’s office, or on occasion, not at all. Their Friday lunches had become a bit of a tradition, starting out as a committee assignment and then becoming a comfortable routine as the two old friends shared bits and pieces of what was going on in their lives, debated over bills currently in the Wizengamot, started a Muggle literature club, and occasionally, went to a bakery for dessert. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The Minister asked me to go visit Hogwarts with a message from the Ministry. McGonagall is always a bit more receptive when I’m the one sent over,” Hermione added. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He seems to forget I was once Head Boy, and a Gryffindor,” Percy rolled his eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was Head Girl,” Hermione replied. “And I think everyone knows you were almost a hatstall.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Percy squinted his eyes, sitting up and putting the book down on the table before replying to Hermione’s not-so-subtle comment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I should never have mentioned that to you,” he shook his head. “I do believe that conversation is why we banned wine from Friday lunch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry Perce, I’m confident in saying you wouldn’t have made a decent Slytherin, the Hat probably just wanted to tease you, given you were the third Weasley in less than five years,” Hermione laughed. “I’m a near-hatstall too, and you witnessed that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But Ravenclaw and Gryffindor aren’t that different,” Percy bemoaned. “The Hat threatened to put me in every single house except Hufflepuff. Basically, I’m an intelligent, ambitious and brave individual who is absolutely shit at loyalty.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sounds about right,” Hermione laughed, causing Percy to hold up the book like he was going to throw it at her. “So, the book! What part are you at? Should we add it to the list?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s so bloody romantic,” Percy admitted. “I’ll probably read ahead before you get a copy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione laughed, knowing Percy to be the ultimate bookworm. “And for the new year,” Hermione asked, “any goals?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I suppose I’d like to finish my bills on broom regulation before the Quidditch World Cup,” Percy said, looking up to remember his to-do list. “I’m trying to get Shacklebolt to put me on the list of dignitaries for the event, because my boss already said he’s visiting Greece that week.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, and I need to buy a few new suits, since I’ll be going to so many weddings,” he added.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hard to believe Ginny and Harry are getting married,” Hermione said, smiling sadly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Percy looked confused, but was always game for a change in the conversation.  “I suppose it is, you’re all so young,” Percy replied, crossing his left leg over his knee and frowning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You aren’t that much older than the rest of us, you’re only 3 years older than I am,” Hermione reminded him. Percy was definitely more casual than he had been during their time at Hogwarts, but he never lost that uppity attitude.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“3 years wiser and more experienced,” he proclaimed, sitting up with a smirk on his face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wiser?” Hermione scoffed. “I can see how you never ended up in Hufflepuff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I do seem to recall getting two more O.W.L.s than you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Only because divination is a joke, and I didn’t have time to fit in other classes,” Hermione muttered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After a few moments of silence, Percy returned to their previous conversation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, are you...er…bringing anyone to the wedding?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, I couldn’t think of anyone else to bring that Harry and Ginny weren’t already inviting. I can’t believe how many guests there will be!” Hermione rambled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nervous about seeing Viktor Krum again?” Percy asked cautiously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione and Viktor had broken up two years earlier, deciding long distance was always going to be too much and neither was willing to move. Hermione had gotten quite tipsy at Friday lunch that week and declared herself to be a spinster forever. Percy had to Apparate her back to her flat that night before confiscating her owl to prevent any wayward messages to Bulgaria. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s married,” Hermione smiled wistfully. “And we’re good friends now.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What about you? Any secret girlfriend you’ll pop up with?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m, err….” Percy hesitated. “I’m content.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Haven’t got a cat, though,” Percy added, causing a raucous laughter on both parts. Hermione was happy to be down in the living room with Percy, as tired as she was getting. He made good company, more than most people assumed he did. </span>
