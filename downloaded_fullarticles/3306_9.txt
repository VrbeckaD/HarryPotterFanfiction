          <div class="userstuff"><p>Remus looked at his husband with lust in his eyes. They’ve been married for nearly a decade and Harry was now working with George and Ron in the joke shop. “You know,” Remus started as Sirius walked over and placed a cup of tea in front of him. “You’re growing more attractive every day.”</p><p>“I didn’t think it was possible.” Sirius smirked as he sat next to Remus at the table. “I thought it was impossible for me to become more attractive.”</p><p>“Oh, Sirius.” Remus smirked. “You’ve got ‘sin’ written all over you. And if it weren’t for the impending visit with Harry and Ginny, well, I’d take you right here on this table.”</p><p>“You’re the devil.” Sirius grinned wickedly as he sipped his tea. “After the guests arrive and leave, you’re all mine.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t have it any other way.”</p></div>
