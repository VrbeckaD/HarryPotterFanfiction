aha! 5 minutes ago .. i was arguing whit a RELIGIOUS FANATIC , INDOCTRINATED BRAIN .. on the making babys theme .. inside their brains.. the sex act is for making slaves.. sorry, babys . no! absolutly not. having a carnal pleasure is for sport, health and bragging. no way for making a trilion babys, and destroying them , because lets be real.. education costs .. the world is allready full of tupidity ... noo the man must use the condom.. all on the man .. why the fuck , the man cant enjoy sex and the woman can ? because that shit of a cunt of a cock plastic bag , doesent helps the man pleasure .the modern medicine can prevent making slaves .. by circling around females .. why dont use that .. you say .. "drugs" .. fuck you and the ugly way .. the simple fact that you smoke , or take a aspirin, its allso a drug so fuck you underage child, if you trie to dogma me whit your visions and perceptions .. and yes im angry on this world . and i have solid reasons on keeping that anger , much more solid then my srew driver, was when was fixing the electric connector </p><p>..ema watson whit a sex transplant .. huh i wold wish that every day , even if she hasnt massage melons .dont know the corect terminology , i could learnit, but i dont want too .. but what i know is that i like swicthes :) turn the lights on .. turn the lights off</p>
