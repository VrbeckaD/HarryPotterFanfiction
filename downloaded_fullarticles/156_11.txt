    <p>
  <span>One cat ran through the corridors of Hogwarts School for Magic. Barreling up the stairs that led into the schools headmaster's office. The cat mid jump transformed into an ageing woman named Minerva McGonagall. In her hand was a letter. The other four occupants of the room stopped their arguing when they heard her say two words they had long since given up on hearing. “Harry's alive.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The letter was promptly ripped from her hand and read aloud. “Harry James Fenton nee Potter. Daniel Fenton's bedchambers, second floor of Fentonworks. Amity Park, Illinois. United States of America.” The reader, one recently proven innocent, Sirius Orion Snape-Black was near tears at finding out that his godson was alive.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts stood from his desk. Since the loss of god-grandson, Harry, he had started to look and feel his age. With renewed hope and slightly renewed strength he looked at each of them. “Sirius, Remus, Severus. The three of you will accompany me to deliver this letter and explain what is to come and why he was not able to be brought to the school sooner. Minerva will stay here and finish up the letters and anything else that is needed while we are gone. I will acquire paperwork and an international portkey for us and then we will leave to Harry as quickly as possible.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The four nodded and each left to their quarters to pack what would be needed and a few things extra for Harry. They missed thirteen years of his life they had lots of things to give him once they saw him once more. They didn't want to leave anything behind. Severus Snape-Black, Hogwarts Potions Professor, being the sensible of the four packed what he knew the others would forget in their haste to pack. Once he was done he made sure his passport and all needed documents for Wizarding International Travel was in his satchel. He also made sure his emergency potions bag was fully stocked and it's paperwork within his satchel as well.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sitting down in his chair in his and Sirius’ living Chambers he snapped his fingers. A pop was heard before a small house elf in a black frock cloth appeared. “Nibbly, I'd like tea for myself and the mutt. After that make sure to tell Lupin that I would like to see him here once he finishes packing for dinner.” The house elf bows and popped away soon returning with tea and having delivered the message.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus proceeds to watch his spouse run around like an idiot for an hour. He sighed. “Sirius if you do not stop running around like that I will hex you. Calm down and we can make a proper list of what needs to be done and packed.” At hearing this Sirius stopped running and smiles loopily at Severus. He moved to crawl on to the others lap with said smile only to have a cup of tea placed in his hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Two hours later Sirius, Severus, and Remus sat at a table going over an unnaturally long parchment. Severus held it and scratched lines as he read them off and was told and proven to be packed in one of the three's trunks. “Wands.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Upon hearing this Sirius paled. “Uh, mine are in the bedroom still.” He admitted with a red tint to his cheeks and ears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus glared at his husband. “Accio Sirius’ wands.” He said flicking his hand. It was only know to seven people that he was able to do wandless magic. Albus, Remus, Sirius, Lily and James Potter, Lucius Malfoy, and his godson Draco Malfoy. Once the two wands were in his hands they were quickly stuffed into his satchel. Sirius just pouted when he realized he wasn't getting them handed over until needed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At nearly midnight that night Severus’ personal floo started ringing. He heard Sirius grumble about annoying people interrupting their sleep. Sitting up and slipping out of the bed he sighed and wrapped a robe around himself. He then proceeded to walk to their floor and check whom it was. He sighed and allowed Albus to stick only his head through. “What could be so important that it couldn’t have waited till an appropriate time?” He growled out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Albus smiled at him with a twinkle in his eye that looked quite weird when only a head was floating in his green fireplace. “Well, my boy, I have acquired the documents needed and we shall be leaving tomorrow morning. I already contacted Remus but it seems he is not home so I was hoping you could inform him and Sirius of the time. Our portkey leaves and ten if the three of you could meet me just outside the school wards?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus nodded and looked across the living room. “Lupin is currently asleep on my couch so I’ll tell him when morning comes. If you need nothing else i’ll be returning to bed.” He said ending the floo call. Tomorrow would hold so much for them he knew it.</span>
