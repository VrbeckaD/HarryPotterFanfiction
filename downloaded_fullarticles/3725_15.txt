    <p>The new shop across the street had been doing fairly well considering it was such a small place. Fred looked out the window at the soft blue and bronze colors that were painted on the sign for Ravenclaw Coffeehouse. He had thought about going over there several times but the thought always brought butterflies to his stomach. The girl had purchased the building a few months back but it had been opened only recently.<br/>Part of the reason Fred had never ventured over there was the guy Fred assumed was her boyfriend. Lanky fellow with red hair similar to his own, he thought that the guy didn’t really seem like the girls type. She seemed to be the bookish type, with toned arms probably from carrying loads of books and fuzzy brown hair that normally wouldn’t be attractive, but on her it somehow seemed perfect. She deserved someone who was on the same intellectual level as her and Fred doubted her current man had that capability.<br/>His thoughts were interrupted by his twin brother George. “…there mate.”<br/>“What?”<br/>“You must’ve been in some pretty deep thought there brother,” George laughed. “I said go on over there mate. It’s pretty quiet here and I won’t need you for a while.”<br/>“You sure about that?” Fred did want to go over there he just didn’t want to feel like he was abandoning his brother for a girl whose name he didn’t even know.<br/>“Yep I’ll be perfectly fine without you. Now go get her tiger.” George playfully shoved his brother’s shoulder as he left. Fred shouldered his coat on and ventured out into the autumn wind.<br/>*      *      *<br/>With each step that led him closer to the coffeehouse, and closer to the girl, the butterflies in his stomach fluttered more and more. When Fred opened the door, the tinkling of bells announced his arrival and the smell of melted butterscotch greeted him. He looked around the shop but no one was there, not even a person behind the counter. Approaching the register, he looked at the menu. ‘I have to have a reason to be here’ he thought, ‘so I might as well order some coffee.’ Looking at the menu he noticed something called butterbeer. ‘That must be the butterscotch smell. Maybe I’ll try it.’<br/>“Can I help you with anything?” The girl’s voice startled him; he thought he would have heard her come in. “We’re actually closed right now,”<br/>“Oh, umm, I’m sorry I didn’t notice. I’ll come back later,” he mentally kicked himself. Of course it was closed that’s why no one was here ‘Great first impression, idiot.’<br/>As he turned to leave, he heard her speak again, “Actually if you wouldn’t mind staying I could use some help unloading stuff.” He looked back at her, only to notice that her face was bright red. She rushed to explain herself, “I mean you don’t have to if you don’t want to, it’s just my boyfriend Ron left me a couple days ago and he just finished moving his stuff out and…” she stuttered to a stop, not being able to hold tears back any longer. Fred rushed forward to attempt to comfort her.<br/>“Shhhhh, it’s okay, you didn’t have to explain yourself or anything, I was going to help. I’m sorry he left you, must have been a real jackass to do that to a girl like you.”<br/>“Yeah,” she started to laugh just a little, “You’re right he is a jackass.” Wiping at her eyes she apologized for her outburst of crying. “Do you want to come in the back and have a coffee or tea or something?” Fred nodded. “Oh and I’m Hermione.”<br/>“Fred.” He smiled, ‘Hermione. I like the name.’</p>
