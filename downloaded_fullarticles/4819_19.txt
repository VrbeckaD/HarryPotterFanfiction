          <div class="userstuff"><p>Dear Harry</p>
<p>You seemed sad today. Is everything alright?<br/>
It must be hard right. After all this.<br/>
How do you do it. I can't.<br/>
And I didn't do anything.<br/>
Just made it worse. </p>

<p>Dear Anonymous<br/>
Thanks for writing. I wish you would tell me who you were<br/>
I wouldn't care.<br/>
I would like to tell you everything was fine<br/>
But you seem like the kind of person who would see straight through that<br/>
I dont do it. I can't either. I don't think anyone can.<br/>
I think it will get better </p>
<p>Love Harry</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear Harry<br/>
I didn't expect you to reply at all, let alone this fast<br/>
You would think people would change after something like this<br/>
But so many don't. They choose to keep hating.<br/>
I wish I never had<br/>
I hurt so many people<br/>
I don't know who I really am any more</p>

<p>Dear Draco<br/>
I don't know who I am either<br/>
Maybe we could find out together</p>
