    <p>
  <span>Remus had at first been excited for Harry to meet Sirius, his grandfather who had escaped from Azkaban and had managed to get a trial he never got and prove his innocence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He and Harry had managed to form a bond when Remus had started to teach at Hogwarts. He and Harry had talked about his parents and it made Remus glad that he could tell Harry things he did not know about his parents. Nothing felt better than seeing Harry smile. He strangely wasn’t someone who smiled a lot. Which confused Remus. He may have had a hard time at school but he had a support system in his friends, Remus, and the Dursleys.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Although Harry did say that him in the Dursleys didn’t really get along, when Remus tried to pry about it Harry would get tight-lipped and change the subject. The only thing Remus knew was that Harry was roomed in the cupboard under the stairs which Remus was sure the Dursleys had a good reason for.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At least Dumbledore thought so.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Anyway, things had been going great. Remus had bonded with his best friend's son and he found out his other best friend wasn’t truly a traitor. Well unless he counted Peter but they had never been that close, to begin with. Rats and wolves didn’t get along.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry and Remus with everyone else was gonna stay at number twelve Grimmauld Place for the summer. After the catastrophic events of Harry’s fourth year, they needed to plan for the fact that Voldemort was back fully and no one but them believed it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Right now Remus was on his way to the Dursleys to pick up Harry and bring him to Sirius’s home. He was excited, to say the least mostly because Sirius’s excitement to meet his godson was contagious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus just hoped for Sirius’s sake that he’d understand Harry was not the type to immediately trust and bond with someone. It had taken months for Remus and Harry to have a full conversation without Harry looking completely uncomfortable. Remus also hoped Sirius wouldn't be offended by Harry’s aversion to touch, Sirius was an affectionate person and Harry was not.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sometimes Remus wondered why Harry had a massive aversion to touch, sometimes Remus swore he could smell the fear coming off of Harry when someone attempted to touch. It wasn’t all that different from how Sirius acted when they were just becoming friends.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Although Remus quickly dismisses that idea because Sirius was being abused at that time Harry wasn’t.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When Remus pulls up to the outside of the Dursleys house he sees Harry sitting on the porch with his trunk and Hedwig on his shoulder. When Harry sees him he jumps up excitedly and rushes to the car Remus is in. He throws his trunk in and rests Hedwig in his lap as he sits down in the seat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You don’t want to say bye to the Dursleys before we go?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No,” Harry says quickly, buckling his seatbelt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Remus says, his eyes lingering on Harry for a moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He shrugs and drives back to the wizarding and to an excitedly waiting Sirius’s house.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When they pull up to the grim-looking house Remus turns to Harry “you remember when I told you about Sirius your godfather and that he’s actually innocent, etc,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry nods</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well this is his house and he is very excited to meet you,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He is?” Harry nervously asks, his eyes moist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus nods at Harry, he wants to pat his back to comfort him but he knows Harry will only recoil from him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry suddenly opens the door of the car and steps out. Remus quickly follows as Harry grabs his trunk and allows Hedwig to rest on his shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They walk into the house and Harry is greeted by his friends that cause Hedwig to fly away disgruntledly. They talk until Harry stops paying attention to them. Remus watches them turn to see what Harry is distracted by. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius is leaning against the wall with his arms crossed loosely as he watches them interact. Sirius back at Harry as he stares at Sirius.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus can understand his hesitation to approach Sirius. He was probably expecting a ragged, tired, and approachable man. Instead what he gets is a young-looking man who doesn't look like he was imprisoned for years the only sign he was is the slight bags under his eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius was an intimidating man. Remus could admit that Sirius was tall, had an array of tattoos, piercing in his ear, longish hair put in a bun, and he had black eyes ringed with gold. Probably the most intimidating thing about Sirius if you didn’t count the wild aura coming off him in waves.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus knew it was due to his close bond with his animagus form but Harry and many others did not, in fact, know that. So Sirius came off very unsettlingly. It didn't help that he didn’t show he breathed or moved much and he had a pension for staring unwaveringly. All things Remus knew he developed these ticks while in Azkaban. Nothing was more unsettling than an unmoving barely looks like he’s breathing man with a staring problem.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus is snapped out of his thoughts when Harry moves to put his trunk down. He boldly walks towards Sirius and Remus watches him stare at Sirius unwaveringly. They have a staring contest until Harry says something.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you Sirius, my godfather,” Harry asks</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius nods</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>To Remus’s surprise, Harry suddenly wraps his arms around Sirius in a hug that Sirius returns strongly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus figures they need some time to themselves so he rushes the others out of the room. They go to the kitchen where Molly is cooking burgers. While waiting for the burgers to be done and for Sirius and Harry to arrive. Remus can’t help but be a little confused, why did Harry hug Sirius so easily when he flinched when someone tapped his arm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus tries to ignore the fact his real problem is he doesn’t understand why Harry isn’t like that with him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They had bonded, right?</span>
</p><p> </p>

  <span>Remus is sitting across from Sirius as Harry sits next to Remus. Harry and Sirius are talking with each other and getting to know one another, Remus has silently been counting the amount of time Sirius has managed to make Harry laugh in the last twenty minutes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He has so far managed to count twenty one and a half times (half because he snorted) it’s- </span>
  <span>nineteen more times than Remus has managed.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Wonderful Sirius can manage to make Harry laugh. It was totally not grating on Remus because he was totally </span>
  <b>not </b>
  <span>thinking about the fact that Sirius always managed to befriend and bond with people way better than Remus has ever managed to do. (it was definitely grating on him)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus tears a bite out of his burger as he denies his irritation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When Harry is halfway through his burger he makes an announcement “me and Sirius are gonna retire early so Sirius can tell me stories about my parents,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No one tries to refute that, who are they to stop Harry from hearing about his parents. So everyone nods and watches the two of them walk away to wherever.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus continues to devour his burger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had been excited at first for Sirius to meet Harry; he wasn’t excited anymore.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>******</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Okay, Remus was ready to admit he was kind of miffed Harry and Sirius managed to bond so fast. He knew he was being irrational when he worried Harry didn’t bond with him so fast because he was a werewolf. But low self-esteem and insecurity was a bitch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He knew his irritation could come off kind of weird but it wasn’t anything creepy. He had just felt a duty to take care of his passed away best friend's son. He had failed to take Harry in when he had been orphaned, he felt it was his responsibility to be the person Harry could and would always go to first when needed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He had been that for a while and it made him happy to finally not have failed Lily and James, but now Harry was slipping from his fingers and Remus felt failure in waves.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Anyway, it had been about two weeks since Remus and everyone else had settled into Sirius’s home. Remus had been busy helping Dumbledore regather members of the Order of the Phoenix. It was kind of hard but also not that hard because a lot of former Order of the Phoenix members heavily believed Voldemort was back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Which Remus was thankful for. Sirius was also helping out with it and getting information on the plans. Although he only popped up when he wasn’t spending basically every waking moment with Harry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They spent all their time together and it was always away from everyone else. Remus had at first been worried Harry would end up pushing his friends away and it worried him because he cared greatly for Harry and wanted what was best for him. Remus felt like he was the friend uncle that was always there for his ‘nephew’.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So he did what any caring uncle would do and asked Harry’s friends how they felt about Harry being gone all the time and to his surprise they didn’t mind. To them it wasn’t a big deal they understood Harry was just excited to get to know his godfather and Harry occasionally popped up to talk to them so they didn’t mind it at all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus was relieved until one of them mentioned something about Sirius teaching Harry different kinds of Magic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What kind of magic,” Remus asked worriedly. He knows despite the way Sirius’s parents used to use magic, Sirius was not averse to using dark magic, grey magic, and light magic in any way he wanted. Sirius didn’t believe the colour of someone’s magic proved if they were a bad person or not. It was a dangerous way of thinking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Like dark magic and stuff,” Ron says</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione elbows him and he looks at her clearly confused. Fred leans over and quickly whispers into his ear. Ron jerks up when Fred stops talking to him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh I meant like grey magic not dark definitely not dark who said dark I didn’t say dark did you say dark,” Ron asks in a rush</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione glares at him harshly “no I didn’t say dark,” she says deadpan.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron doesn’t say anything else because George drags him away and the other two follow quietly scolding him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus watches them walk away as his mind runs at a thousand miles per hour.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius was teaching Harry about Dark magic the evilest form of magic there was. Remus can feel himself getting angry. How dare Sirius teach Harry dark magic when Lily and James died fighting against it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus strides quickly through the house and makes his way to the Black family library. He knows Sirius is in there with Harry because he can smell their scents mostly heavily there. He opens the doors to the library and interrupts the study session Harry and Sirius were in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can I talk to you,” Remus flicks his eyes towards Harry, “alone,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius furrows his eyebrows before smoothing his face out “yeah,” he looks at Harry “we can finish this tomorrow okay,” he says fluffing Harry’s hair</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Harry says giggling at the hair fluffing</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hi Remus,” Harry says as he walks out</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hi,” Remus says in return</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus watches Harry walk out of the library before he closes the doors tight and throws up a privacy shield.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s going on Remus,” Sirius asks sitting down on his desk</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s going on is I found out you’ve been teaching Harry dark magic,” Remus says hotly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius sighs “look I know we have differing views on dark magic and whatnot, but it is not your business what I teach Harry when he willingly wants to learn about it,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It is my business Harry is my business so of course, I’m going to be angry that you're teaching him something so evil and trying to make it seem good,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“One, I don’t tell Harry dark magic is good I give him unbiased information and let him come to his own conclusion and Two, did you not hear the part where I said he wants to learn it,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I heard you, I just don’t care he shouldn’t be learning it and he won’t be learning it. I don’t care that he wants to learn it. I know what’s best for him and what's best for him is that he only learns about light magic,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So now you're saying he can’t make decisions for himself, that what he wants doesn’t matter, you're taking away his choice, his anatomy! that's fucked up Remus he has rights,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“ He’s a child he’s not old enough to make his own decisions,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s fifteen not five!” Sirius yells frustrated </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It’s quiet for a moment before Remus speaks again “he’s my responsibility Sirius I will do what is best for him. I know what Lily and James would and wouldn’t approve of, this is something they would not like,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You think you know what they wouldn’t or would approve of Remus? If that’s the case why did they make </span>
  <b>me</b>
  <span> his godfather and not you,” Sirius says coldly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus has nothing to say to that he doesn’t know why they chose Sirius. They knew about Sirius’s views on magic and they never disagreed with it. At least Remus never heard them disagree, if they didn’t want that around Harry Sirius wouldn’t be his Godfather.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius sighs after Remus hasn’t said anything for a moment “look Remus I have nothing against you or your views. I don’t judge you so don’t judge me, I’m not doing anything harmful I’m just telling Harry what he wants to know. Is that really so bad to you,” he says softly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know,” Remus mumbles</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He really doesn’t know. He still thinks dark magic is evil, but he doesn’t think Sirius is evil. But then again Sirius had been in Azkaban for years there was no guarantee he was the same person. Azkaban was a mind-breaking place the strongest people broke in the first month and yet somehow Sirius was still sane after years of being in there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It made Remus suspicious, at this point in time he just really didn’t know if Sirius could be trusted. And until it could be proven Sirius could be trusted Remus didn’t want Harry around him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus walks out of the library without saying anything to Sirius.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When he walks out he sees Harry walking down the hallway back towards the library </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you guys are done talking,” Harry asks</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“yeah, but I need to speak to you real quick,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They walk into one of the random rooms and Remus has Harry sit down on the couch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, I know you're not going to like this but I don’t want you to talk to Sirius anymore until he can prove he’s trustworthy,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What,” Harry asks confused</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I found out he was teaching you dark magic. Dark magic is evil Harry and I’m worried the many years Sirius spent in Azkaban might have changed him for the worst,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t believe that Sirius is great and he tells me the truth and lets me make decisions for myself. He’s supportive and a good person. I </span>
  <em>
    <span>know</span>
  </em>
  <span> him, Remus,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, you don’t know him you’ve been talking for two weeks and you're not old enough to make your own decisions,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me,” Harry says standing up “I am fifteen, of course, I can make my own decisions. And I do know Sirius maybe not as well as you do but I know enough and unlike </span>
  <b>you,</b>
  <span> he doesn’t stifle and coddle me. I’m not a baby so don’t treat me like I am,” Harry says his voice cracking </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Harry-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stop,” Harry says his voice thick with tears, “I thought you were different,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry runs out of the room before Remus can stop him. Remus stands there frozen in shock before he moves so he can try to explain his reasoning to Harry. Remus finds Harry only to see him wrapped up in Sirius’s arms as he cries.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius looks over Harry’s shoulder and looks right at Remus, he shakes his head warning Remus that Harry doesn't want to speak to him. Sirius closes the library doors with his magic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus sighs, he hopes he didn’t completely ruin their relationship. He’ll just have to talk to Harry later.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus knows Harry will eventually understand what he’s saying and will side with him. It would just take time.</span>
