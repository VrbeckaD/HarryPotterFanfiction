    <p>The air in the Girls’ Dormitory was stifling as Lily Evans settled herself into her bed. She was cranky and had left for bed early, not having even bothered with staying for the end of exam party that had been thrown in the Gryffindor Common Room. That had been two hours ago, and her comrades had come up to join her not long after that, but Lily found that it was too hot to sleep. She grumbled and kicked her blankets to the end of the bed, leaving just the sheet on top of her body.</p><p><br/> As if O.W.Ls weren’t bad enough, that afternoon had sealed the deal. Severus had been her oldest friend. Even now she felt the hurt stabbing at her. Not just because of what he had said down at the Lake, though that had been the final straw for Lily. But Lily also felt the pain of what she knew she had to do. Cutting ties with a friend—even for a good reason—wasn’t easy, and Lily thought that it would take every ounce of strength she had to be able to go through with it. Compared to this her exams seemed easy. Not that her exams had been much of a challenge—Lily had always excelled at school.</p><p><br/> Lily grumbled again, as she found her upper body was now too cold, and she just could not get comfortable. For the first time since her first year at Hogwarts, Lily was looking forward to going home for the summer holiday. No amount of disdain Petunia could throw at her could compare to the hell that had been the last few weeks. There were more than a few faces she was ready not to see every day.</p><p><br/> As if on cue, or maybe because the universe hated her, Mary MacDonald broke the silence by barging into the Dormitory, an impatient scowl on her face.<br/> “Your Slytherin friend is squatting outside the portrait hole.” She said.</p><p><br/> Lily groaned. So much for peace and quiet. “I’m not interested in anything he has to say,” she replied. “And you should be happy to know that he is not my friend anymore.”</p><p>“While that statement does bring me immense joy, I am afraid it’s going to be short-lived. He claims he is going to stay out there until you speak to him. He’s even threatening to sleep out there.”</p><p>Lily drew the curtains of her four poster closed around her, determined to shut out Mary and the rest of the world. This was the last on a very long list of things she wanted to be dealing with at the moment. “Tell him to leave.”</p><p>“Don’t you think I’ve tried that, Lils?” Mary growled. “He won’t take the hint. It’ll have to come from you.”</p><p>“For the love of Merlin, I just want to sleep.” Lily groaned.</p><p>“So would the rest of us Evans, so would you please do us a solid and just go deal with him?” Dorcas Meadowes poked her head up from her own bed.</p><p>“Fuck. Fine.” Lily stood up, put on her dressing gown, and exited the dormitory. She paid little attention to any other Gryffindors who were still in the Common Room as she marched her way to the portrait hole.</p><p>True to tale, Severus Snape was sitting cross legged outside of the portrait hole looking determined to wait as long as it took for Lily to speak to him.</p><p>“You better have a damn good reason for being out here after hours,” Lily said. “Speak, and do it quickly, because I have half a mind to just give you detention.”</p><p>Snape stood. “I’m sorry.” He said.</p><p>“I’m not interested.”</p><p>“I’m sorry!” he repeated emphatically.</p><p>“Save your breath.” Lily growled. “I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep out here.”</p><p>“I was. I would have done.” Snape replied. “I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just—”</p><p>“Slipped out?” Lily finished for him. She was so tired of having this argument with him. “It’s too late for that. I’ve made excuses for you for years! None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. I’ve been pretending for so long, believing you were different than your precious little Death Eater friends!”</p><p>When Snape said nothing in response to her accusation, she plowed on. “You see, you don’t even deny it! You don’t deny that’s what you’re aiming to be! You can’t wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?”</p><p>Snape opened his mouth, then closed it without speaking. Lily sighed, she was both relieved and hurt to know she was right.<br/> “I can’t pretend anymore.” She said. “You’ve chosen your way, I’ve chosen mine.” Lily made to go back through the portrait hole, but before she had the chance</p><p>Snape grabbed her hand.</p><p>“No!” he said. “Listen, I didn’t mean—”</p><p>“—to call me Mudblood?” Lily growled, yanking her hand out Snape’s grasp. She could barely stand to look at him, let alone allow him to touch her. “But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different?”</p><p>Snape struggled to say something but couldn’t. Lily glared at him for a moment, then turned and climbed back through the portrait hole.</p><p>The Common Room was almost completely deserted with the exception of Remus Lupin who was reclined sideways in an armchair by the fire, a book in one hand and a mug of hot chocolate in the other. He never even looked up from his book as Lily slammed the portrait of the Fat Lady behind her.</p><p>“So I take it you heard all that,” Lily grumbled, inclining her head back towards the portrait hole. “Were you going to do anything about it?”</p><p>Lupin said nothing but shrugged his shoulders a bit.</p><p>“You’re a prefect, Remus.”</p><p>“So are you.” He replied.</p><p>“You could have handled this, made him go back to his own Common Room instead of squatting outside of ours!”</p><p>“Lily, I think I know you well enough by now to know that you would have hated me fighting your battles for you.”</p><p>Lily slumped into the chair opposite Remus, defeated. “I suppose you’re right.”</p><p>Again Lupin said nothing in reply.</p><p>“So what are you doing down here, Remus?” Lily prompted.</p><p>Lupin cocked a single eyebrow as he gestured with his book hand. “I’m reading, Lily.”</p><p>“Yes I can see that,” she replied coolly, “but what are you really doing here?”</p><p>Lupin sat up in his chair and took a long swig from his mug before speaking. “Look I know James was being a bit of a prat today—”</p><p>“James is always a prat.” Lily said, cutting him off. She did not want to deal with this now.</p><p>“You’re not wrong, but he was on another level today, and he wanted me to tell you that he’s sorry.”</p><p>Lily was quickly moving from cranky to cross. This was rich. “James Potter sent you to apologize? For his behavior?”</p><p>“Well yes and no.”</p><p>“Well which is it: yes or no?” Lily’s voice was raising, she was on her feet. The low simmering rage she had felt all day had finally come to a boil.</p><p>“Lily—”</p><p>“Because if James was really so remorseful he would have the bollocks to apologize to me himself! You tell James Potter that if he really wants to apologize he’ll have to stop hiding behind his friends!”</p><p>Remus snapped his book closed and set it on the end table. “Lily, James really isn’t that bad—”</p><p>“He is a bully!” Lily shrieked. “He may not have been the one to call me a Mudblood, but he’s the whole reason that it happened in the first place.”</p><p>“Lily, Snape should not have called you Mudblood at all.”</p><p>“He was frightened and angry, and it was your friend’s fault!”</p><p>Lupin was on his feet as well and he had a hand on each of Lily’s shoulders. He slowly eased her back into her seat. “You’re right, but the way I see it is this: If someone uses slurs like ‘Mudblood’ in moments of heightened emotion, especially against someone trying to offer them help, then they are probably too comfortable using it in casual conversation. You don’t know the kind of language he uses when you're not around.</p><p>“I know that he’s used that word before. Maybe not to describe me, but I know he uses it.” She stole Remus’ mug and took a long gulp of hot chocolate. “He tells me that I’m ‘different,’ that’s just as bad because I know I’m no different than the other Muggle-born witches or wizards.” She scoffed. “Not that you have to worry about my opinions on him anymore. Severus and I are no longer friends.”</p><p>“Lily, I have my own opinions of Snape. While I personally don’t think that he’s a good person, it gives me no pleasure to know that you lost a friend.” Remus conjured a second mug and poured hot chocolate into it from a tureen that was sitting on an end table. He handed the mug to Lily in exchange for his own. Lily let the warmth calm her ever thinning nerves.</p><p>“You must see the way he behaves, why do you make excuses for James Potter anyway?”</p><p>Remus sighed, “Probably for the same reasons that you make excuses for Sniv—for Snape.”</p><p>“That’s not an excuse.”</p><p>“No, it’s not Lily. It’s not an excuse, but everyone has moments where they’re not bathed in the best light. I bet even you have something you regret doing in your past.”</p><p>Lily scowled. She had a few that she could think of. “But he’s such a—”</p><p>“A prat?”Lupin offered. “I think we’ve covered that. And yes he does have a way of putting his foot in his mouth—”</p><p>“That’s an understatement. He never thinks of the consequences of his actions, and he thinks any attention that he is given is good attention.” Lily filled her mug again. “how is it even possible to live with an ego that big?”</p><p>Remus laughed softly. “Search me.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Lily said earnestly. “I know he’s your friend and all, but I just can’t see past—I mean you heard what he said to Severus. ‘It’s more the fact that he exists.’ How can you hate someone for just existing?”</p><p>“I don’t think James meant it that way,” Lupin argued.</p><p>“But you understand what that sounds like right? The blood purists who think that people like us: half-bloods, muggle-borns, that we don’t deserve to live. How can you condone that?”</p><p>Remus sat for a moment, head in his hands. He was searching for the right words to say. “I don’t think James understands the privilege his Pureblood status earns him. That doesn’t make what he said okay—” he said, as Lily had opened her mouth to argue. “But with him, I know he doesn’t actually mean it.”</p><p>Lily didn’t speak again, so Lupin went on. “The reason I think that you’re hanging on to this idea that James is a bad person, is because you were wrong about Sniv—about Snape. And if you were wrong about Snape being a good person, then you have to entertain the notion that you were wrong about James being a bad person.”</p><p>Lily sank in her seat. Remus was right, and right now she hated him for it.</p><p>“There was a time where I was tormented for my clothes, my scars, for my health—I’m sick a lot in case you haven’t noticed. James was the first person to show me kindness in a time that no one else would.”</p><p>Lily looked at Remus, really looked at him. She had never really taken notice of his scars, because she had never thought that it was her business to look. She had never noticed how much his scars aged him. He seemed older and more world-weary than a boy of sixteen. Beneath his quick wit and genuinely kind heart, there was a deep seated sadness that Lily could never understand. She felt an overpowering desire to protect and take care of Remus like she had never known.</p><p>“Severus lives in the next town over from me.” Lily said. Her voice was barely above a whisper. The hurt over losing her friend was still raw in her chest. “He was the first person to explain magic to me, he was there when I learned I was a witch. Looking back I don’t know if we would have been friends if I had had anyone else to tell me about magic—he loves to lord it over me that ‘there are things in the wizarding world I just don’t understand,’ but those first few years that we were friends were nice. We were all each other had.”</p><p>“This is going to sound a little hypocritical of me, but you shouldn’t have to remain friends with someone out of obligation. You’re allowed to change, and sometimes that means leaving old friends behind.”</p><p>“So where does that leave you and James?” Lily asked.</p><p>Lupin smiled. “Well I guess I haven’t outgrown his friendship. James is still there for me. No matter what.”</p><p>“That sounds nice.”</p><p>Remus leaned forward in his seat, his eyes on Lily. “Can I confide something in you Lily?”</p><p>Lily gave a quick nod. “Of course you can.”</p><p>“And if I tell you everything that I need to make you understand, you promise to keep it a secret from anybody else?”</p><p>“If you’re trying to tell me that you’re gay, Remus I already know that. I mean unless you want to stick with the story that you and Black were really just ‘playing chess’ in that broom cupboard.” It was a terrible attempt to break the tension, but Remus smiled anyway.</p><p>“No. Well, I mean I’m bi, but that’s not the point… or what I need to tell you.”</p><p>Lily drew a cross over her heart. “I swear on everything I find sacred that your secrets, whatever they are, are safe with me.”</p><p>Remus refilled his mug for a third time and held onto it like a lifeline. His whole body was shaking. “So you know that the Whomping Willow is only a recent addition to the school grounds, yeah?”</p><p>“I’d heard that.” Said Lily.</p><p>“And as we’ve already discussed, I’m ill quite a lot. And my…my condition, it’s not something I can just go to Madame Pomfrey to remedy. I become…violent, and dangerous. I have no control over my actions during that time and so the willow was planted for me in order to distance me from the rest of the students during this time.” Remus paused for a moment to take another drink, then resumed. “The willow guards a secret passage out of Hogwarts that leads to that old ruin on the outskirts of Hogsmeade.”</p><p>Lily struggled for the right words to ask him what she already suspected. How many times had Severus raved at her about Lupin being “off” or “wrong?” Lily bristled at that thought, but she wanted Remus to continue talking. “When you say ‘dangerous’ Remus, what do you mean by that?”</p><p>Remus shifted slightly in his seat, his knuckles white against the armrests. “How much do you know about lycanthropy?”</p><p>There it was: the bomb was dropped. The secret that she and Severus had always suspected—well Severus had suspected, and Lily had been the voice of reason—was true. Because of Severus’ obsession, Lily actually knew quite a bit about lycanthropy. Suddenly, Lily found herself unable to look Remus in the eye.</p><p>“A bit.” She said to her lap.</p><p>“Then you know what all the books say about werewolves.”</p><p>Lily thought back to everything she and Severus had ever looked up on werewolves. She remembered reading about the Ministry’s ineffective policies concerning lycanthropes, and the wizarding world’s own biases against them. Even without reading about werewolves, she had heard whispers in the halls about people’s irrational fears concerning them. While Severus had taken everything from the books as gospel, Lily had found most of it rather hard to believe.</p><p><em>“He disappears every month on the full moon, Lily.”</em> Lily could practically hear Severus screaming in her ear. <em>“Every month on the full moon. C’mon it doesn’t take a Pureblood to know that Lupin is a werewolf. And if that’s the case then they shouldn’t even allow him in school. A werewolf in school, what’s he going to do? Learn how to play fetch? Ha. If anything he’s just looking for more young witches and wizards to taint with his half-breed filth.”</em></p><p>That particular thought made Lily angry all over again. “I know the books in the library give a rather backwards and antiquated perspective on lycanthropes and their prospects for a happy and normal life.”</p><p>Lupin scoffed. “God, I hate that word. ‘Normal.’ My parents have tried so hard to give me a ‘normal life.’ Making sure I always had everything I wanted, like spoiling me was going to erase the fact that we had to move halfway across the country after I was bitten, so the villagers wouldn’t find out my parents didn’t kill me, which is still what the Ministry suggests for bitten children.” Remus was doubled over his hands fisted in his hair. Lily could tell that he was crying, but didn’t want to say anything about it.</p><p>“I mean I get what they’re trying to do, but it doesn’t negate the shame of having to lock myself up once a month. ‘Being normal’ doesn’t help that if I let anyone near me during that time I could risk killing them or worse turning them. That’s not even bringing up the fact that I will probably never be able to have a family of my own.”</p><p>Lily thought back to one particularly vile book on lycanthropy that Severus had poured over for hours. Though common knowledge of lycanthropes lead to the discovery that during the full moon, werewolves lose all sense of human morality, Professor Picardy took this theory even farther to claim that once a werewolf is turned there is nothing human left in them. Werewolves were all wolf all the time, and merely wearing a wizard’s robes.</p><p>
  <em>Though they may wear the skin and the faces of the witches or wizards we love, they are not to be trusted or treated as such. For there is no way of knowing when or where the wolf may rear its monstrous head to devour more of our friends and loved ones. In the case of the werewolf there is only one solution: complete eradication.</em>
</p><p>Lily had scoffed at that. Where was the proof that there was no trace of humanity left? From everything she had seen, Remus was just as much of an ordinary wizard as anyone. He just had a little problem once a month. Who was Picardy or anyone for that matter to determine whether or not Remus deserved to live or have a family? After that she had left Severus to drool over Picardy’s text while she looked for literature of a more progressive nature. Though there was no known cure, there had been many developments regarding spells and remedies to help ease the transformation process.</p><p>“There have been so many advances though, Remus.” Lily protested. “Have you heard of the Wolfsbane Potion?”</p><p>“The Wolfsbane Potion hasn’t been proven effective yet.” Remus answered. “Though aconite does help stave off some of the pain I experience during transformation.”</p><p>Lily thought back to what she had read about werewolf transformation. Due to the wolf’s physiology, the turn is agonizing. Everything about a wolf’s physical makeup is smaller, so in order for the internal organs to shrink and reform, they first have to fail; a simultaneous heart attack, liver, lung, and kidney failure. The bones are broken and shredded in order for the wolf to appear. In short the human must die for the wolf to live. But instead of dying, the curse keeps the human alive and conscious for every excruciating second. A lump grew in Lily’s throat. What kind of life must Remus have known: going through this torture once a month for who knows how long?</p><p>“I’m so sorry Remus.” She reached forward and squeezed his hand. “That must be so lonely. I never knew.”</p><p>“That’s the thing though, Lily. Because of James, I’m not lonely anymore. You have no idea what he has done for me, how much he has risked—is risking, just so I don’t have to be alone.”</p><p>Remus was leaning forward, his forearms resting on his thighs. “The price of dealing with his ego is a bargain for everything he’s risked for me. How many people do you know who would willingly be friends with someone like me?” He sighed and ran a hand through his hair, a gesture reminiscent of James.</p><p>“I don’t deserve the kind of loyalty and friendship he’s given me; I will forever be grateful to James Potter.”</p><p>“This sounds like a James Potter I could be friends with,” Lily admitted. “I’d really like to meet the James Potter you see through your eyes.”</p><p>“I’m sure he’d like that too.” Lupin replied with a smile. He moved to get up, but Lily stopped him.</p><p>“Wait!” she said. “There’s one thing still bothering me. So werewolves have to be alone during the full moon in order to prevent themselves from hurting anyone else, yeah?”</p><p>“You know the literature as well as I do, Lily.”</p><p>“So how is it that James and the others help you during the transformation without you hurting them? I mean if the whole point is to be alone—”</p><p>“Let me put it to you this way,” said Remus. “The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.”</p><p>Lily was dumbstruck, he couldn’t possibly mean.</p><p>Remus sensed the horror in her voice and became suddenly more alert. “No!” he said, “No. not like that. Definitely not like that! God what kind of monster do you—”</p><p>Realization dawned on Lily. “Oh God, Remus I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean to assume!”</p><p>“That I would be so awful as to turn my best friends? You know how awful this curse is Lily, how could you even think so little of me to think I could do something like that to an enemy, let alone my own best friends?”</p><p>“I didn’t! I swear I didn’t! It’s just you used the word ‘pack,’ and—”</p><p>“No Lily, it’s fine.” Remus said sharply. “I know you didn’t mean it the way it came out.”</p><p>“But you have every right to be upset with me!” Lily wailed. “How can I get upset about people making assumptions about me because of my birth, when I go around doing the same thing?”</p><p>Lily was up on her feet, pacing in front of the fireplace. She was such a hypocrite. How could she possibly think that Remus of all people, could be capable of something so vile? Remus was one of the nicest people she had ever met, and here she was assuming the worst of him just because of a condition that he has.</p><p>And then Remus was there, gripping her shoulders and forcing her to stand still. His amber eyes bore into hers.</p><p>“Lily.” His voice was firm and steady. “I’m not angry at you. I know you didn’t mean it that way. I chose the wrong words to use.”</p><p>“But,”</p><p>“No buts, Lily. I accept your apology. To answer the question that is currently burning in your eyes: No. I didn’t turn my friends in that way. But they are in a sense, my pack.” Remus loosened his grip on her shoulders but guided her back to her armchair and sat her down before returning to his own seat. “Now finish your hot chocolate.”</p><p>Lily snickered. “Yes, Mum.”</p><p>Remus laughed too. “You sound like James.”</p><p>“I. Do. Not.” Lily replied, pretending to be offended.</p><p>“Okay fine. You don’t sound like James, but he always likes to say that I’m the motherly type of our group.” Remus leaned forward conspiratorially, “sometimes</p><p>I think they’re useless without me.”</p><p>Lily laughed for real this time. “It’s probably true though.” She took one last swig of hot chocolate and stood.</p><p>“Well I guess my plans for peace and quiet are all shot to hell now,” she stretched and headed towards the staircase that led to the Girls’ Dormitory.</p><p>“Goodnight Remus.”</p><p>“Goodnight Lily.”</p><p>Lily ascended the staircase with a newfound enthusiasm to read up on anything and everything she could find about werewolves, packs, and the properties of the Wolfsbane Potion.</p>
