    <p>“What have you done?” Hermione shouted and looked at the small red haired child sitting on the counter of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes in shock.</p><p>“Mione!” The small boy shouted with glee and tried to jump down to run towards her. George was able to hold him back with fast reflexes and looked at Hermione pleading.</p><p>“Thank you for coming. I can't work with him behaving like a 4 year old.” The adult redhead tried to cash a costumer and offered his brightest smile to the witch while he still held the child back with one hand.</p><p>“Please take him, just till I close. The potion should wear off soon. At least it should. We are still testing it. He wasn't supposed to act like a child, just look like it.”</p><p>“You tested your potions on yourself again? Not knowing what it did?” Hermione’s tone was deadly, and George just smiled at her, as he tucked his small brother in her arms.</p><p>“Sorry gorgeous, I’m alone with him out of order. There are costumers to attend.” </p><p>Just like that he vanished into a throng of Hogwarts students, not far from the cashier, looking at the patented Daydream Box.</p><p>“Hello and welcome at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. I'm George and I'll answer any and all questions.” The rest of his speech was lost in the small indoor firework going off and the small boy in her arms squeal of glee.</p><p>She let him down and grabbed his hand, leaving the shop shaking her head. She would have a word with the twins, once this insane situation was over. George was just lucky she had visited the shop to begin with, not knowing that he needed her for babysitting. His owl had dropped a small slip telling her to rush over for an emergency and she had prepared for the worst, dropping her work on her desk. In her rush she had told her secretary she would leave work early and asked to cancel all her meetings for the day. Had she known why he called her, she would have stayed at work, finished her paper and met with the Auror department, corresponding about the next raid. </p><p>“Mione! I want ice-cream!” Fred called from beside her and smiled at her in a way that let her know he wasn't above begging.</p><p>“It's freezing outside.” Hermione tried to reason. “How about a hot chocolate?”</p><p>Fred pouted at her, but then thought better of it and smiled even bigger. “With Marshmallows!”</p><p>“With Marshmallows.” Hermione agreed and followed the jumping kid out onto the streets. </p><p>It was already nearing Christmas, and most shops had joined in on the challenge to be brighter, more daring, and sadly, louder than the others. Thought no one was able to beat the Weasley twins, with their advertisement, they still tried. </p><p>A huge replica of the twins shouted “Hohoho!” whenever a child passed their shop and handed out candy, after asking them if their had been good. Even the small version of Fred got his hand on a green one, before Hermione had time to react.</p><p>In the shop window the fireworks could be seen in a mini version and a punch telescope hit a doll every other minute, making the kids in front of it giggle.</p><p>“Lets go Fred.” Hermione tried to pry her small charge away, but smiled when she saw how much his younger version adored his own inventions.</p><p>“Hermione!” Someone called from behind, when they started to walked along Diagon Alley and she turned around to see who it was.</p><p>“It's been so long since I last saw you!” </p><p>Hermione could keep herself from rolling her eyes and managed another smile. Lavender Brown had seen her just last week, when they had met to discuss an article about Hermione's current bill for the Daily Prophet, where Lavender published.</p><p>“Lavender.” Hermione retorted and hugged the woman back, trying to keep an eye on Fred.</p><p>“Watching the kids, are you?” Lavender said and smiled down at Fred. “Such a cutie, and the typical red hair to. Must be a Weasley!”</p><p>Without giving Hermione a change to respond she droned on.</p><p>“It's cute to see you practice, but I still hope I can write an article about your own kids soon. I know, I know, work is important to you, but maybe next year? Would be a shame if you grow to old to have any. You know what I mean. Anyway we are witches, we still have some years, don't we? I, for once, will let you know, that you can count on me. Just send a letter when it happens. I'll take care of you!”</p><p>Looking at a small clock around her arm Lavender gasped.</p><p>“It was nice to see you, but my next appointment starts soon. A scandal is blooming at the Malfoy house. Read it in tomorrows issue. See you!”</p><p>Just like she had appeared, Lavender vanished, without giving Hermione the time to enter even one word into the conversation. </p><p>Shaking her head, she turned around to take Fred's hand again. Instead of a small red head she encountered nothing. </p><p>Turning around her own axis, she tried to find the small boy, but there were to many people around.</p><p>Cursing under her breath, Hermione vowed to have him pay her back for this and took out her wand.</p><p>“Appare Vestigium“ She muttered and watched a golden mist emanate from her wand. It circled around her and showed her Fred, who was standing next to her, until something drew his attention on the other side of the street.</p><p>Following the mist Hermione found the small boy in front of a cage with a rare Bowtruckle inside.</p><p>When she joined him he looked up at her and smiled.</p><p>“Can I have one?” He asked with childlike innocence, completely ignoring that he had ditched her a few moments before.</p><p>“Not today Fred. We wanted to get some hot chocolate, didn't we?” Bribing him with their promise from earlier, she got him away from the shop, to walk towards the Leaky Cauldron. She planned to use the floo over there to get them home to her flat. Normally it was just a small walk of twenty  minutes from here, but this wasn't the first child she watched over. </p><p>Just the small five minutes trip from the WWW to the Leaky took more than a quarter of an hour, because Fred had to stop at every shop window to look inside. To pry him away from them was a huge effort.</p><p>When they finally reached the Leaky, Fred was talking non stop about the awesome brooms, pets and hats he had just seen. Hermione was astonished how much energy such a small body held and wished for a hot chocolate with something stronger in it. Hopefully he would be back to normal soon.</p>
