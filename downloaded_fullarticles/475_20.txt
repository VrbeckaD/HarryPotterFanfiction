    <p>Harry stood over the empty cot. His eye caught on the movement of the snitches flapping lazily on the blanket Molly had given them when James was born. He swayed gently in place, moving almost unconsciously at the thought of holding James, swaddled in that blanket, rocking back and forth with him, shushing him, singing to him.</p><p>He closed his eyes and bowed his head, remembering the feel of his son in his arms, the softness of the downy black hair against his cheek as he breathed in the smell of him, let his lips brush over him.</p><p>Harry hummed, a broken, raw sound, a sound that told of screaming and raging and smashing for hours on end. But now, as he stood over his son's empty cot, it was a twisted parody of comfort as he tried to remember.</p><p>Those times between dusk and dawn had been his times, in the quiet of the night. His time to tell James stories, to whisper to him of the magic of the world he had been born into, the wonders he would see. With James in his arms and Ginny fast asleep, Harry had spoken softly, almost silently, of the pains as well, the losses. </p><p>He'd found himself slowly, as his baby got heavier week by week, month by month, beginning to pull some of those pieces back together, close some of those long-unhealed wounds. The nightmares eased, ever so slightly. The insomnia turned into occasionally needing to wake to James' cry.</p><p>The progress he had made, the tiny steps at last towards getting better seemed laughable, now. Obscene in the face of this.</p><p>He put an arm around his middle, pressing against the bare skin of his stomach as he breathed in, imagining the soapy smell of James' hair after he'd had a bath. For a second he could almost feel the weight of his baby in his arms again, feel the clumsy touches of James' fingers against his skin as he poked the tattooed images weaving their way up and down Harry's arms and across his chest. The ghost of that touch and the moment of flaring, heart-stopping relief brought him back to his senses. </p><p>He let out a small cry, forcing himself to stop the rocking movement, the humming comfort. Instead he hunched in on himself, fingers gripping hard around the glass he held in one hand, reaching blindly for the side of the cot with the other. The brutal reminder that it wasn't real—that it would never be real again—twisted through him. He felt flayed with the intensity of it, stripped raw, as though hearing those words again for the first time. </p><p><i>Harry, I'm so sorry. It's James. There's been an—Oh Gods, there's been an accident.</i> </p><p>Harry let out a sound, half gasp, half sob and wrenched his eyes open, gritting his teeth as he swallowed heavily against the burning in his throat. A keening cry escaped him and he bit down on his cheek until the metallic tang of blood filled his mouth.</p><p>He wouldn't cry. He fucking <i>wouldn't</i>. He took a drink from the glass in his hand instead, barely tasting the whisky as slid down his throat, washing the blood down with it.</p><p>His eyes darted desperately around the room, the room he'd spent days painting by hand, to get every detail perfect. He'd painted symbols for protection, strength, peace and love all through the room, images and talismans from a dozen different countries. He glared at them now, at the ridiculous fucking notion that he could have done something to protect his son, that he could have done anything to protect what was his.</p><p>Harry couldn't help the way his eyes returned to the cot, as though drawn there, as though wanting to see James sleeping there, peacefully, to be told it had all been a horrible mistake and his son was back, after all. </p><p>His gaze caught on the small yellow bear, tilted on its side, reaching out as though seeking James as well. Harry had given it to him, had purchased it in a rush, on his way back from a job. He'd almost missed James' birth—the Patronus that Ginny had sent him. She'd begged him not to take a job so close to the due date, but it had been a small curse, a local job, and back then he'd either had to work or sit at home and drink.</p><p>He'd seen the bear in a gift shop. It was everything he'd been denied as a child. Love. Companionship. Comfort. His son would have everything he hadn't. He'd been so sure of it. And instead—instead—</p><p>Harry felt the churning pit of rage and guilt and disbelief rise in him again, burning through the numbness of the whisky. He took another desperate swallow from his drink, feeling fear clawing at the edges of his mind. He needed the numbness. He could feel the avalanche towering over him, and he knew if it crashed down onto him, he wouldn't survive it.</p><p>Harry focussed back on the details in front of him. He wanted to remember, and at the same time he needed to forget. He took another drink, a bitter twist to his lips. Funny that. Just one more way for his life to fuck him over—to hurt him as much as it could. He was Harry Potter, after all. He'd chosen to come back from the dead, to come back for more. He could take it, couldn't he?</p><p>This—this hollowness inside him where his child lived... Harry would rather be dead than feel like this.</p><p>He looked back at the bear. They'd called it Paddington, Pads for short. It made him think of Sirius, sometimes. He would sit James on his lap and sit Pads in front of them and tell James about the extra grandfather he would have had. Hermione and Ron's crup had eaten Paddington's nose off, giving him a slightly puzzled look. Sometimes Harry imagined it was the same look of surprise Sirius had worn, as he'd stepped backwards, through the veil. </p><p>Harry reached out, fingers hovering just above the stuffed toy. He wanted to pick it up, to right it, straighten the blanket, like he had so many times before, ready for James to be tucked back under it.</p><p>He curled his hand into a fist and took a deep, shuddering breath, feeling the tears burning at the back of his eyes again. He threw back the glass of whisky he held in his hand, finishing it with two deep gulps, welcoming the burn in his throat instead. It refilled automatically. Ron had brought it for him as a joke gift years before.</p><p><i>Joke's on you,</i> Harry thought bitterly. Ron hadn't said anything to him yet, anything more than the empty words that everyone had been saying to him, but his eyes had been on Harry for days, watching, waiting. Harry could <i>hear</i> the judgement in his thoughts, the resentment he kept behind his lips.</p><p>
  <i>Why aren't you looking after Ginny? Look at her. She can't even get out of bed. She hasn't done anything but stare at a wall for days. Why aren't you crying, Harry? WHY WEREN'T YOU THERE?</i>
</p><p>Harry looked down into the empty cot and felt the aching loss of his child through every part of his body. </p><p>He'd been here since nightmares had ripped him out of his fitful sleep hours before. The sound of James crying—crying and crying with nobody coming—still echoed in his mind. He'd had this foggy idea that maybe, if he looked hard enough, he could will James' wide brown eyes to be looking back up at him.</p><p>It didn't seem real. None of it seemed real. Nothing from the moment he'd rushed back into his house six days earlier, the ricochet of a broken curse still smoking around him, seemed real. Instead it was a nightmare blur of desperate screaming denial, guilt so thick he could choke on it and the feeling like every single part of him that was good had been ripped out of him, killed in the same way James had been.</p><p><i>James</i>.</p><p>Harry closed his eyes again, feeling the anguish rise in his throat like vomit. He took a deep, shaking breath. He felt the splash of liquid on his skin and looked down, faintly surprised to see his hand was shaking as well. He looked at the amber liquid, at the false comfort it offered. He looked at the thing that had kept him company through so many of the shittiest parts of the last ten years, and then he lifted his arm, spun and hurled the glass at the wall opposite James' cot.</p><p>It smashed, fragments flying everywhere. The base fell to the ground and Harry watched, numbly, as whisky began to flow out, soaking into the thick burgundy carpet he'd chosen for the room.</p><p>He didn't know how long it was before the door opened and he heard Ron's curse as he took in the room, and Harry standing in the middle of it. He couldn't stop staring at the carpet, it was sodden now, thick and heavy with the booze, darkened to the colour of blood. It had soaked across the room to him. Harry could feel the wetness of it under his bare feet.</p><p>'Harry,' Ron's voice was tired, quiet. 'Harry, what's happened?' Ron bent his head, trying to peer up at Harry's face, through the shaggy hair he hadn't brushed or tied up in days. Harry couldn't take his eyes off the growing puddle on the floor. He imagined it eating through the surface, creating a hole, sucking everything in, him included.</p><p>Ron straightened and pulled his wand out, casting <i>Reparo</i> and <i>Evanesco</i> in quick succession, before he siphoned the spill from the carpet.</p><p>Harry watched the patch of wetness shrink and then disappear, and wished more than anything that there was a spell to do that with people. He shook himself. Shook off the image that flashed before his eyes for a moment. James on the floor and blood. So much blood. He locked it away far, far inside himself. He couldn't see that again. He couldn't. Instead he lifted his head blinking slowly. He didn't look Ron in the face. Couldn't do that either. Instead he watched Ron's hands. His hands were strong. Freckled. Harry remembered wondering if James would freckle. If he would have Ginny's colouring or Harry's. They'd always been so careful about his sun charms, and now—</p><p>'I sent you home last night to sleep, not... <i>this</i>,' Ron said with a weary gesture at the carpet, the worry in his voice almost hiding the distaste.</p><p>'Can't sleep,' Harry muttered, barely aware of the words coming out of his mouth. His voice was raw and croaky. He'd woken up screaming again. </p><p>'They watch me.' He hadn't thought about it until he said it, but as he spoke, the nightmare came flooding back. Four hooded figures facing away from him. Running towards them, desperate, somehow, to find out why they were there. Desperately knowing that if he didn't, something bad would happen.</p><p>He remembered them turning, one by one, hoods like empty voids, until the final figure. He wanted the final figure to turn and at the same time he was terrified it would. And then it had. It had turned and James was in its arms, and James was dead.</p><p>Harry felt himself begin to shake again, tremors running through his body at the memory. He couldn't—He couldn't think of this.</p><p>'Who—' Ron said, before seeming to catch himself with a frown. 'Is this your Death Eaters dream, again? Harry, you need to talk to someone. Especially now. Please. This isn't normal. It's been <i>years</i>.' Ron took a step towards him, hands out as though soothing a wild animal.</p><p>Harry latched onto the words. 'It's not the Death Eaters. It's the ones that did this. They caused all of it and now they watch me, in my dreams.' A faint part of him, the part that had tried to stay sane all these years, tried to be normal, was aware that his voice had a hint of hysteria to it. He could see the look on Ron's face, but he couldn't shake his certainty. He <i>knew</i> right down inside himself, that someone had taken his baby from him.</p><p>'The fuck—,' Ron began, his voice holding an edge of anger. But then he took a deep breath and continued, voice placating, almost like he was speaking to a child. 'We've been over this, Harry. James' death was an <i>accident</i>. I can't imagine anything worse ever happening, but no one caused it. It was an accident.' Ron placed a gentle hand on Harry's arm. 'You know this, I know you do.' </p><p>Ron seemed eager to change the subject. He turned and looked back out the door, as though listening. 'Where's Ginny?'</p><p>Harry shook his head, trying to get the thoughts straight in his brain. The dreams weren't about the Death Eaters, were they? He couldn't make the fragments of memory connect. Ron sounded so certain. But these ones were different, weren't they? It wasn't Voldemort who turned to him, who took from him again... was it? Something in him shouted that this was important. That he needed to focus on it, but then he looked back at James' cot, at Pads lying there, abandoned, waiting for a child that would never come back to him.</p><p>Pads had been through so much and now he was alone again. Harry was alone too. He was always alone.</p><p>'Harry,' Ron said, and Harry looked down at Ron's hand as Ron shook his arm gently. 'Where's Ginny?'</p><p>Harry forced himself to focus. Ginny. Ginny hadn't spoken to anyone since it happened. Ginny was tears and silence and empty, unseeing eyes. Ginny was—</p><p>'Your parents. She stayed there again,' Harry said slowly, voice dull, the memory coming to him as he looked back up at Ron, lifting a shaking hand to push the hair from his face.</p><p>Ron blanched as he met Harry's eyes for the first time. Harry had no idea how he looked. He was far beyond caring. All he saw when he looked in the mirror was emptiness.</p><p>'You need to get ready for the funeral,' Ron said and Harry felt the word like a blow. He realised for the first time that Ron was wearing his best black robes, the ones he'd married Hermione in. Harry stared at them, like they were a betrayal.</p><p><i>Funeral</i>.</p><p>Today was James' funeral. Today they would put him in the ground.</p><p>Harry backed away from Ron, shaking his head. He felt terror run through him, like a living thing. He couldn't. James—He felt his back hit the wooden bars of James' cot and he gripped onto them, as though they were the only things holding him up.</p><p>James couldn't go in the ground. He needed to be here. In bed. In Harry's arms. He needed to be smiling up with his nonsense sounds and his chubby, gasping hands.</p><p>Harry shook his head again, feeling his breathing accelerate as panic filled him. He didn't even notice Ron coming closer until arms were around him and he was pulled against Ron's body.</p><p>'I've got you,' Ron said softly. 'We'll do it together.'</p><p>Harry shook his head against Ron's chest. 'I can't,' he whispered, voice raw. 'I can't, Ron. I can't. I can't. I can't.'</p><p>'You can. He needs you to be strong,' Ron's arms were tight around him, as though trying to hold him together.</p><p>'I <i>can't</i> be strong,' Harry said and his voice cracked on the words. 'I need him for that and he's <i>gone</i>.' Harry felt the burn of tears in his throat again and this time he couldn't hold them back. He felt the sob rip through him and he fisted his hands in Ron's robes as he felt himself crack open again.</p><p>'I can't,' Harry cried, as he lifted his head and thudded it into Ron's chest. His grief poured through him like a river, like it was his blood, spilling from him, draining him of life.</p><p>'I know mate,' Ron said softly, in a voice that was wet with tears. 'I know.'</p><p>His grief consumed him. It was like a swarm of Grindylows reaching up from the depths with sharp claws and pointed teeth. It dragged him into the darkness and tore him apart. Harry had no idea how long it was before Ron stepped back from him gently, bending his neck to look up into his face. Harry didn't bother wiping his eyes, he just let his head hang down.</p><p>'I'm going to get you a sobering potion, and then I'll help you get dressed. We only have about an hour left.'</p><p>'No,' Harry whispered, the emptiness inside him rippling with concern. 'Please, don't. The whisky—it numbs things. I can't feel all of this. Not—Not yet. Please, Ron.'</p><p>'You can't go to your son's funeral a stinking mess, Harry.' Ron's voice was sympathetic, but firm. 'Have you been properly sober since it happened?'</p><p>Harry didn't want to think about that. <i>Couldn't</i> think about the ups and downs he'd ridden to keep his numbness.</p><p>He took the potion.</p><p>He heaved his guts up over the toilet, but the burn of acid in his throat was nothing compared to the maelstrom that consumed him, bombarded him.</p><p>Grief. Anger. Denial. Despair. He cycled through them.</p><p>He came up for air when they Apparated into the cemetery at Godric's Hollow and Ron let go of his arm. There was already a crowd and Harry looked around, trying to focus.</p><p>He saw a sea of red hair, the extended Weasley family. Hermione rushed towards them, her eyes darting to Ron's and containing some sort of unspoken communication before she fixed on Harry and then embraced him.</p><p>Harry stood and let her hold him as he dropped his head to her shoulder. </p><p>'How are you holding up, today?' she asked as she kissed his hair softly.</p><p>Harry shook his head slightly. He didn't even know where to start.</p><p>'The papers are here,' Hermione said. 'We've got them behind a <i>Silencio</i> and a ward that will keep them far enough back that they won't interrupt.'</p><p>Harry straightened at her words, feeling anger surge through him, welcoming it in place of the grief. He gritted his teeth and looked around, spotting the pack of vultures lurking beside some of the older gravestones a hundred yards away.</p><p>He took a step towards them, shaking off Hermione's touch. How dare they? How <i>fucking</i> dare they come here, to feed off the misery and loss of his family.</p><p>Harry felt his magic spark through him, responding to him sluggishly at first and then more strongly as his fury stirred it into life. He felt it crackle over his skin and he bunched his fists as he took another step towards them. Behind him he heard both Ron and Hermione call out, but he ignored them. Here was something he could do. <i>Here</i> was a way he could help James.</p><p>He took another two paces before Molly stepped in front of him.</p><p>'Harry, dear,' she said, eyes red from weeping. 'Ginny's this way. She needs you now. Come, love.' Molly's arm was around his waist, her hand rubbing soothingly at his side as she steered him towards the group of people.</p><p>Harry felt his anger waver in the face of the certainty in Molly's voice. He'd spent the last ten years fucking his life up in one way or another, but every time, Molly's certainty had been something he could fall back on. He let her lead him away, the guilt rising again to drown his anger. He didn't deserve her. He didn't deserve anyone. He couldn't even keep her grandson alive.</p><p>People reached out to him as he passed through the crowd, offering comforting touches, or comforting words. Harry couldn't see or hear them. His feet followed a familiar path, one he'd travelled a hundred times before to be with the rest of his family. His parents. The placeholder for Sirius, who would never return to him.</p><p>As they got closer to the focus of the group, all he could see was the tiny mound of dirt, covered by a green cloth, made to look like grass. The idea was absurd, that this hole in the ground could be anything natural. Could be anything but the most obscene travesty.</p><p>Molly put pressure on him, steering him slightly until he was looking at Ginny instead, draped in black dress robes and standing beside the grave. She looked like a corpse. Her face was pale and still. She stared at the hole in the ground in front of her as though it contained the embodiment of the same horrifying truth that Harry had spent the last six days escaping.</p><p>He wanted to be anywhere but here. He couldn't do this. He couldn't. He couldn't. He couldn't. He could feel his heart start to race and his breath come faster and suddenly, desperately, he needed a drink. His hands started to shake and he shoved them into the pockets of his robes, glad, for just a second, that they hid the way the shaking spread through his body.</p><p>Molly gave him a soft push on the back and he took a step forward, stepping up beside Ginny, leaning towards her. She didn't blink; didn't show any acknowledgement of his presence.</p><p>'Hey, Gin,' he said, voice hoarse. She didn't respond to his words. Didn't look up from her intense staring at the hole in front of them. Harry wondered, as he watched her, whether she imagined as well that if she stared hard enough, she could will James back to life. </p><p>He didn't try to talk to her again. He stood beside her instead and they stared into the hole together.</p><p>There was a service. Words were said. People moved back and forth in the crowd, speaking and holding each other.</p><p>Harry didn't hear the words that were said. Couldn't see anything but the small coffin, its wood shining brightly in the sun as it sat on red sashes, suspended above the hole. Ron had helped him carry it over. James had been in Mungo's, he knew. They'd wanted to keep him, to test him and check him and find out just why it had happened, <i>how</i> it had happened.</p><p>Harry had had nightmares about that too, about James. Alone and cold and so, so scared. And now he was here, in this box, instead. Ron had helped him carry it. They wanted to float it with magic, but some things should be done by hand. Feeling the weight of your son's coffin in your arms felt like one of them.</p><p>He looked up again when Hermione stepped front of him, obscuring his view of his son's new bed. Her eyes were red and puffy and her cheeks glistened with tears.</p><p>'Do you want to speak now?' she asked softly, and Harry looked past her, eyes moving slowly from face to face as he realised everyone was watching them, had eyes fixed on either Ginny or himself.</p><p>He stood there; mind blank. He'd never liked crowds. Never liked speeches. They'd tried to make him do so many, after the war. They stopped asking him after a while, after he started turning up drunk or high, when he bothered to turn up at all.</p><p>Now he took two slow, heavy steps until he stood at the foot of the grave, looking down at the tiny, wooden box.</p><p>He took a breath, trying to gather his thoughts. Trying to think of how he could honour James. Memorialise him. Explain him.</p><p>A slow tinkle of music entered his mind, wavering at the edges of his hearing. He couldn't place it for a moment, and then he realised it was the slow, metallic sound of the music from the mobile that hung above James' change table. A broom chased a snitch and an owl 'round and 'round.</p><p>Harry could hear the love in his own voice as he sung down to James in time with it.</p><p>
  <i>Rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop</i>
</p><p>He would rock James back and forth in his arms.</p><p>
  <i>When the wind blows, the cradle will rock</i>
</p><p>James would smile up at him, reaching for his hair or his beard.</p><p>
  <i>When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall</i>
</p><p>Harry would let his arms drop, catching James a second later and sending him laughing with delight at the movement.</p><p>
  <i>And down will come baby, cradle and all</i>
</p><p>He would lift James up to his face for a kiss. James' hands would twist in his hair and Harry would just look at him. Just look and look and look as though his heart would burst.</p><p>'I can't do this,' Harry blurted out, turning away from the grave. He pushed back through the crowd, shaking off Ron's hand as he reached roughly for him, and then others, pushing them away blindly. He had to get away. He had to get out. He couldn't watch them put his son in the ground. It would be real then. It would be real if that happened.</p><p>A hand grabbed his arm and refused to be shrugged off. There were words, but he couldn't make them out, couldn't see or hear anything. And then someone shook his arm and everything around him snapped into razor-sharp focus.</p><p>'Harry,' said the voice of the person holding his arm. 'Harry, you need to breathe. Please, can you breathe with me?'</p><p>Harry looked up into slate grey eyes and felt his panic and anguish crystallise back into rage.</p><p>'What the fuck are you doing here?' he spat, fury rising in him. He wrenched his arm out of Malfoy's grip. 'You have no <i>fucking right</i>.'</p><p>Malfoy took a step back, hands raised as if that somehow meant he was defenceless. 'I'm sorry,' he said, voice soft. 'I just wanted to pay my respects.'</p><p>Harry let his anger rise in him. Embraced it. Anger was so, so much better than the grief and the guilt. Anger took him away from that hole in the ground. Anger made him feel full of something, if only for a moment.</p><p>'Get out,' he growled. 'Get <i>the fuck</i> out.' He dropped his hand to his side, feeling for his wand, before he realised he hadn't seen it in days. Malfoy tracked the gesture then looked back up at Harry.</p><p>'I'm so sorry about your son,' he said. 'I know you don't want to see me, but I need to tell you someth—'</p><p>'You have no idea what sorry is,' Harry hissed, rage continuing to build in him. '<i>Your</i> damned son is still alive.' Malfoy would get to watch his son grow. Malfoy would get every. Single. Fucking. Thing Harry had lost.</p><p>Malfoy's face twisted at the mention of his own child, and his fingers twitched for a moment into a fist as well. Harry felt satisfaction rise in him at the gesture. Suddenly he wanted nothing more—<i>nothing more</i>—than to sink his fists into Malfoy's body, to punch and kick and bite until he was covered in his own blood and the pain on his body matched the pain in his heart.</p><p>He took a step forward, clenched fist rising, but was stopped by a hand on his arm and an urgent voice in his ear.</p><p>'Harry, please. Don't do this.'</p><p>'What is he doing here?' Harry asked flatly, not looking at Hermione, as she tightened her grip on his arm.</p><p>'He's showing his respects, Harry,' Hermione said urgently. 'The wards let all family and friends through.'</p><p>Harry turned his head to look at her, incredulity warring with his fury. 'We're not friends, and he's certainly not fucking family.'</p><p>'We were friends, once,' Malfoy said and Harry laughed bitterly, turning back to him.</p><p>'We were never friends,' he said, voice cold and hard. 'We fucked years ago. And then you left. And this is my damned son's funeral so I need you to leave again, right the fuck now.'</p><p>'Harry—' Malfoy started again.</p><p>'Your kid's alive,' Harry said, feeling the pain spiral back into his body. He would give anything to be able to say that himself. He could hear it in his own voice. The grief. The desperation. 'What more do you fucking want?'</p><p>'Harry, I've been having dreams,' Malfoy said, speaking quickly now, as though desperate to get the words out before he was stopped. 'There's a man with a hood. He has your face.'</p><p>Harry felt the words spear through him. He remembered his own dreams, a hooded man holding his son's body. He knew what it meant. He had always known what it meant. He had killed James. It was all his fault that James was dead. And now Malfoy knew too.</p><p>'I think it has something to do with your son's death,' Malfoy started, and Harry had had enough.</p><p>He took two quick steps forward, balled his fist and drove it into Malfoy's face. He felt the sickening crunch of bone as Malfoy's nose broke and blood began to flood down his face. He ignored Malfoy's shout of pain and the way his hands rose to protect his face, and stepped in closer, driving a short, hard punch into Malfoy's guts, which had him bending over and retching for air.</p><p>Harry raised his knee to slam it into Malfoy's body, when he was pulled roughly back. He didn't bother to see who had grabbed him, just wrenched his body against their hold. </p><p>'Fight back,' he yelled at Malfoy. He had his arms wrapped around his stomach and straightening slowly. 'Fight back, you bastard.' Harry heard his voice crack on the last word.</p><p>Malfoy looked at him with something like sadness in his eyes, blood dripping down his face. Then he turned on the spot, Disapparating with a crack that echoed around the quiet graveyard.</p><p>The pressure on Harry's right arm eased and Ron stepped up beside him.</p><p>'James deserves better than this, mate,' he said, grief and disappointment in his voice.</p><p>'James deserves to be <i>ALIVE</i>,' Harry returned, his voice rising until he was shouting it in Ron's face. </p><p>In the distance he could see the reporters, quills waving madly, cameras flashing. He gave them the finger and turned back to Ron, shoulders slumping as the last of the anger left him suddenly, leaving only the empty hole where James should live.</p><p>'I can't do this. Take me home.'<br/>
 <br/>
~</p><p>Harry's house was a tomb. He spent as little time inside it as he could. James had been gone for thirty-five days but Harry still saw him in every room. He and Ginny hadn't talked about what to do with his things. His highchair was still pulled up to the table. The colourful mat they'd laid over the floor in the living room, during his spewy crawling phase hit Harry like a punch in the guts every time he walked into the room.</p><p>He hadn't been able to bring himself to go back into James' room since the morning of the funeral. Instead he'd spent as much time as he could out of the house. Away from the stream of visitors and home-cooked meals, the constant questions, the well-meaning concern that felt like fire across his skin. Like guilt so thick he could drown in it.</p><p>
  <i>You need to talk to someone.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>We're worried about you.</i>
</p><p><i>You're</i> still <i>having those dreams?</i></p><p><i>This obsession isn't healthy, Harry. What happened was horrific. But you need to accept it was an </i>accident.</p><p>Harry pulled his motorcycle up in front of Grimmauld Place and kicked the stand down, stepping off it and Disillusioning it with a quick charm. He reached inside the pocket of his leather jacket and pulled out his smokes, lighting one up and taking a deep breath in. He closed his eyes for a moment, blowing the smoke out, as he prepared to walk back inside. Prepared for the flood of memories that he managed, for a few minutes at a time, to bury while he was working.</p><p>Talking jobs had been the only thing stopping him from drinking himself right into a box alongside James, he knew. At least when he was studying a curse, trying to figure out the best way to rip it apart before it got him first, he could make his brain stop, just for a second. And maybe, yes, he was taking more risks than he had in recent years. Maybe he was acting a little like he had back before he and Ginny had hooked up again. Before they'd found out about James. But so what. He was trying. He was doing the best he fucking could.</p><p>He stepped inside the door and kicked off his heavy boots in the entry, hanging his rucksack on a hook above them. He made for the kitchen. He needed a drink. Ginny was sitting at the kitchen table when he walked in. She was in her dressing gown, a cup of tea in her hands that looked like it had gone cold hours before.</p><p>At the sound of his entrance she looked up</p><p>'I told you to stop smoking those filthy things,' she snapped, a hint of fire coming back into her eyes for just a second.<br/>
 <br/>
Harry took a deep drag and blew the smoke out.</p><p>'What's the point? James is gone. They can't hurt him anymore.' His voice was sharp. He knew it was. But he couldn't make it soft. He felt like everything soft inside him was lying in a hole in the ground.</p><p>Ginny flinched, like his words were blows and her eyes dropped back to her cup of tea. Harry could see her shoulders shake as her tears began to flow again.</p><p>'I'm sorry,' he said, laying a hand on her shoulder as he passed her. His touch was brief, but he felt her lean away from it, all the same. He grabbed the whisky bottle off the shelf and left the kitchen.</p><p>~</p><p>The next time he was home, Ron was too. He was already in the kitchen when Harry walked in, his whole body aching from the effects of a blood curse that had begun worming its way under his skin before he'd been able to rip it out of himself. He fucking hated blood curses. They were nasty, insidious, creeping things, unless you forced them into accelerated attack. That was the only way to stop them. Get them before they got you.</p><p>Ron's face softened when Harry walked in, but it wasn't a smile that crossed it. He was standing at the table cutting carrots and Harry could smell the stew bubbling on the stove behind him. His stomach gave a loud growl at the sound, reminding him that he'd barely eaten lately.</p><p>'Hey,' he said, making a beeline for the liquor cabinet and pouring himself a glass of scotch. Gods but he was tired. He tilted the bottle at Ron, but he shook his head and kept cutting.</p><p>'Where's Ginny?' Harry asked.</p><p>Ron frowned at him and set the knife down, leaning on the table. 'You don't know?'</p><p>Harry shrugged, the prickle of guilt he felt at this was nothing compared to the ocean he swam in every day. 'I haven't been home for a few days. Big job.'</p><p>'She's checked herself into Mungo's for a bit. She's been using sleeping potions.' Ron's frown deepened as he spoke. 'She's been seeing things. Did you know that?'</p><p>Harry took a sip of his drink and thought about that. 'I thought some of my Dreamless was missing,' he said. Ron's look morphed into something angry.</p><p>'Are you for real?' He took a step away from the table, so that he was facing Harry. Harry pulled his smokes out and lit one up, drawing the tang of it into his lungs.</p><p>'She's in the fucking hospital because she thinks she's going round the twist and she's finally asking for help, and all you can say is, "oh, the potions I abuse on the regular as well are getting low"?' Ron's eyes narrowed in anger.</p><p>Harry shrugged. A part of him knew he was being a prick. That part of him that didn't want to see Ron or Ginny or anyone hurting... That part of him felt very small and very far away.</p><p>'Enough's enough, Harry. We're all devastated about James' death,' Ron paused to take a breath, pain flashing across his face. 'And none of us can ever understand how you and Ginny feel, but this—the way you're acting. I'm sick of walking on eggshells around you, when I can manage to catch you at all. You need help.'</p><p>Harry watched him, taking a large swallow of his scotch and another drag on his smoke before he spoke.</p><p>'Are you done?'</p><p>Ron's anger changed to shock and he opened his mouth, but Harry spoke over him.</p><p>'You're right. You have no idea how I feel. You, Hermione, Molly, even Ginny. None of you know how I feel. He was—' Harry took a deep breath before he continued, his voice more subdued. 'James was everything to me. I'm not going to go back to my life like it was before him. I <i>can't</i>.'</p><p>Ron's face seemed to soften with these words. 'No one's saying you have to pretend he never existed and suddenly become happy. We're just saying that all this working. All this drinking. It's not healthy. You're never home. Ginny needs you. We all need you.'</p><p>Harry let the words wash over him. All his life, people had needed him. The one who'd needed him most of all, was dead because of him.</p><p>'James needs me,' was all he said in response. He didn't realise, until the words came out, just how they sounded.</p><p>Ron took another step forward, the look on his face hesitant. 'What do you mean James needs you?' he asked softly. 'James is gone, mate.'</p><p>Harry shook his head, angry at himself. He shouldn't have said that. He hadn't slept more than an hour or two in a row for days now and it was messing with his thinking. It was why the curse had managed to touch him today. He was usually so much more careful.</p><p>'I need to find out what happened to him,' he said instead.</p><p>Ron's hesitancy didn't fade, if anything he began to look worried. 'We know what happened, Harry. Remember, they sent it all in a big letter. It was an accident. The was a gap in the wards and the window was left open. The monitoring charm wasn't set. The Erkling coming in was just an awful, awful accident.'</p><p>Harry grimaced at the creature's name, remembering bite marks and so, so much blood. He shook his head again, trying to shake the image out of it. 'I don't know why I have to keep telling you all this. There was no gap in the wards. I do this shit for a living. I ward my own life every day. You think I would ever leave a gap that could put my baby in danger?'</p><p>Ron's eyes flicked for a second to Harry's arms and he realised that the marks from the blood curse were a vivid red on his skin, like the touches of devilish fingers. They stood out even over the hieroglyphs and prayer wards and the phoenix spiralling in vivid blues and greens up his rolled-up sleeve. He could feel Ron's questioning look like an accusation. It joined the voice inside him that whispered to him constantly that this <i>was</i> his fault, that if he had just stayed instead of taking the job that night, nothing would have happened. That if he had triple checked everything, James would still be alive.</p><p>'I didn't do it,' Harry said, speaking through the guilt that rose in his throat like bile. 'I checked the wards before I went out that night. I checked his room. I set the charm. <i>Like I always do</i>.'</p><p>Ron raised his hands placatingly. 'No one is trying to blame you, Harry. It's just that sometimes the things we've done a million times before... sometimes our brains play tricks on us, lay a memory of a different time over the real memories.'</p><p>'The shrink at Janus Thickey tell you that, did they?' Harry sneered, not willing to accept it. James' death couldn't be his fault. It couldn't. Someone else had caused this. He knew they had.</p><p>'Yes,' Ron said simply. 'I've been seeing someone for weeks now. It helps, to be able to talk things through with someone.'</p><p>'That's lovely,' Harry said, putting his drink down on the bench beside himself harder than necessary. He sucked down the last of his smoke and dropped it in the dregs of the liquid. 'I'm glad you're getting help. Really, I am. But I'm fine, and I'm not interested in someone telling me what is or isn't real, so I'll give it a pass.'</p><p>Ron crossed his arms and Harry recognised the moment he put his Auror face on. 'Harry, you have to drop this. You can't keep chasing ghosts. I know you're researching when you're not working. I saw the papers spread all over Sirius' old room. James' death was an accident and you driving yourself mad over it isn't going to help anyone.'</p><p>'You're spying on me now?' Harry asked, incredulous. He took a step forward, moving into Ron's space. 'You're coming into my fucking house and poking around without me here?'</p><p>Ron's mouth tightened, but he didn't deny it. 'I'm worried about you. We all are. Those pictures you've sketched, of hooded figures, they're Death Eaters. Your old nightmares are getting mixed up in this new obsession. James' death was an accident and you need help to start to understand and accept that.'</p><p>'You haven't got a fucking clue what I need,' Harry growled, stepping closer until they were almost chest to chest. Ron might have a few inches on him, but Harry had a lean, wiry strength, and he was used to fighting far, far dirtier. He had no doubt he could take Ron if it came to that.</p><p>But Ron sighed and stepped back. 'I didn't mean to upset you. Just have a think about what I said. Please.'</p><p>'Get out,' Harry said in response. </p><p>Ron opened his mouth as though he wanted to argue, but then he turned and stepped towards the Floo. His eyes were sad as he looked over his shoulder at Harry before he disappeared.</p><p>Harry pulled his wand from his pocket and sent the pot of soup smashing into the fireplace after his departing form.</p><p>~</p><p>Ginny was home again when he got back a few days later, after dealing with a collection of cursed clothing. Evidently a young woman had inherited her grandmother's estate. No one had told her that her grandfather had a chauvinistic, jealous streak. The nightdress she'd worn while fucking her boyfriend had strangled her to death, mid act.</p><p>Harry had destroyed the lot of it, but containing the explosion of magic each time he released a curse in order for the item to be Incendioed had taken its toll on him. He'd ridden his bike back afterwards, and the flight over the ocean had sapped the last of his energy. He felt like every step was an effort he didn't have in him.</p><p>He'd been in Dublin when he got the owl about Ginny coming back. That had been two days ago. He'd wondered how she was. He hoped she was healing. One of them, at least, should be able to move on from this one day.</p><p>When he walked into the kitchen she wasn't there, but he knew she was in the house. It didn't have that same empty, neglected feeling it normally did. He was about to pour himself a drink when he heard it. Faint music coming from upstairs, the tinkling, slightly metallic tone of the baby mobile, rotating round and round.</p><p>
  <i>Down will come baby, cradle and all.</i>
</p><p>He turned on his heel and ran for the stairs, thumping his way up them, his earlier exhaustion forgotten. He could hear Ginny's voice now too, soft and sweet and he felt his heart thump inside his chest, aching with a desperate pain. </p><p>He reached the landing and pushed open the door to James' room, left part-way ajar. Ginny turned to look up at him, stopping her singing as she cuddled James' blanket to herself, breathing in the scent of it.</p><p>At the sight of her empty arms, at the sight of the still empty room, Harry felt something, some desperate hope inside himself break apart. He felt his knees buckle and put a hand out to grip the wall and stop himself from falling.</p><p>'I—I thought,' he began brokenly, unable to make his confused thoughts connect.</p><p>'I'm looking through his things,' Ginny said. 'They said it would help, to touch things that were his, to remember him instead of hiding from him.'</p><p>She folded up the blanket and laid it at the end of the cot, before picking Pads up and placing him neatly on top of it.</p><p>'Don't—' Harry started, moving into the room before he knew what he was doing. <i>Leave it</i>, he wanted to say. <i>It was like that when he left. It needs to be like that when he comes back</i>.</p><p>'Do you want to hold it?' Ginny asked. Her voice was quiet and had an empty tone to it that he'd never heard on her before, but this was more words than she'd spoken to him in weeks.</p><p>Harry shook his head. The thought of smelling James on the blanket, of feeling the familiar softness of it, without the weight of James in his arms...</p><p>'Are you okay?' he asked instead.</p><p>Ginny just looked at him, tilting her head to one side. 'No. Are you?'</p><p>~</p><p>It was another week before it came to a head. A week of Ginny's strange calmness and continual touching of all of James' things. She came in and out, for Mind Healer visits, Harry assumed, though she never wanted to talk about them. There was a line of jars on their bathroom sink, each one printed with Ginny's name in the neat script of the Mungo's quills.</p><p>He tried to stay around the house, tried to keep Ron's words in mind. He and Ginny talked about small things. <i>Did you get the milk? Did you write back to that letter from Luna? Did you want to keep this plate sitting on the bench for ever or were you going to fucking wash it some time?</i></p><p>Harry was sitting in Sirius' room when Ginny came back from wherever she disappeared to. He normally made sure the wards alerted him to her presence so he could leave the room and lock it up before she got upstairs. After Ron, he didn't want anyone else seeing what he was working on.</p><p>He had a thick book called <i>Dark and Dangerous Creatures: Control and Regulation</i> open on his lap and another two beside him, which he was cross referencing. Erklings weren't even native to England. Everyone seemed totally fine with one crawling in the window of his house, but the fact that it shouldn't have was the only thing Harry had at the moment. That and the fucking dreams of hooded men. It was getting so that he couldn't even close his eyes without seeing them, as though they were waiting for him.</p><p>Ginny walked in the door and stopped dead, looking around with eyes that widened as she took in the sketches, pages torn from books, scribbles of notes and theories. They were tacked to the walls and spread over the floor and bed he was sitting on.</p><p>'What is this?' she asked in a voice that was deceptively calm.</p><p>'It's nothing,' Harry said, standing and closing the book he'd been reading. He put it down on the other two and stepped over the papers towards Ginny, planning to shepherd her back out the door and close it behind her.</p><p>'That's a picture of the thing that killed him,' she said, indicating with her chin an image of an Erkling on the wall behind him. It was a pointy, vicious creature, all sharp claws and teeth. Harry had nightmares sometimes, about those feral yellow eyes being the last thing James had ever seen.</p><p>'It's just research,' he said gruffly. 'For a curse.' He stepped forward, nudging her with his body. As he did so, he realised it was the first time he'd touched her in weeks. They lay in bed alongside each other now, not talking or touching, lying awake and staring into the darkness.</p><p>'It's not research,' Ginny said, trying to peer around him as he pulled the door closed behind himself. 'You're still looking into his death, aren't you?' Her voice rose slightly with those words, as though she couldn't believe what she was saying.</p><p>Harry set his jaw. 'It wasn't an accident.'</p><p>Ginny shook her head at him, pain coming into her eyes. 'Why do you have to do this to yourself? Can't you just let him rest?'</p><p>'I'm not doing anything to myself,' Harry said, anger stirring in him. 'I know something is wrong with all of this. That thing shouldn't have been able to get inside. Someone must have let it in.'</p><p>Ginny just stared at him. 'Are you listening to yourself? Someone? Like who? <i>Why?</i> There was no conspiracy, Harry. Nothing let that creature into our house.' She gestured angrily at the walls as she continued to speak.</p><p>'You forgot to set the wards properly. It could have happened to anyone.' Her voice thickened with those last words, as though she didn't believe them as she said them.</p><p>Harry shook his head. 'I didn't set them wrong. I would never set them wrong. And even if I had, I should have felt that thing come through them. I should have been able to Apparate straight—'<br/>
 <br/>
'YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE,' Ginny yelled, as though the words had been boiling inside her, desperate for escape. The moment they left her mouth she stopped and they stared at each other.</p><p>'What did you say?' Harry asked, his voice a whisper.</p><p>'I—I didn't mean it,' Ginny said after a long pause. 'It wasn't your fault. I know that.'</p><p>Harry took a step back from her, so his back was hard against the door to the room he'd just exited.</p><p>'Yes, you did,' he said. </p><p>Ginny was silent, her mouth set. Tears began to shimmer in her eyes.</p><p>Harry could felt her condemnation like a blade through his gut. It sat directly alongside the one he'd stabbed into himself when he'd realised what had happened. Had realised that if he had just <i>been here</i>, his son would still be alive.</p><p>'I have to go,' he said, the words leaving his mouth without conscious thought.</p><p>'Where?' Ginny asked, making no move to stop him.</p><p>'Germany,' Harry said, as pieces clicked to place in his mind. 'The Erklings are native to Germany. I need to know what one was doing here.'</p><p>'You don't have to go,' Ginny said.</p><p>A part of Harry wanted to reach out, to pull her into his arms, to tell her it would all be okay, somehow. That he'd fucked things up, but he'd fix them. He always fixed them.</p><p>'Yes, I do,' he said, and he opened the door behind himself again.</p><p>He worked quickly, now that he had decided to do it. It was almost like he'd been waiting for this moment for weeks, building to it. He stripped the papers from the wall, bundled the books into a pile, rolled up the notes and maps. He heard Ginny go back downstairs, but didn't stop what he was doing. It wasn't until his eye caught on a note, scribbled with red ink and a question mark that he paused for a moment. It was weeks old, shoved underneath a pile of other thoughts, lost in the rest of his hunt.</p><p>There were only four words on it, but reading them set something on fire in his mind. </p><p>
  <i>Malfoy. Hooded figure. Connection?</i>
</p><p>How had he not looked this up before? He'd been so focussed on tracking down the creature that he'd forgotten the random connection that Malfoy had made, that day at Godric's Hollow.</p><p>He shrunk the pile of papers and books down and then pointed his wand downstairs. 'Accio Mokeskin Pouch.' It came flying into his hand and he opened the neck of it, sliding his research inside. He kept a range of things in it, things he'd collected on his travels; charms, amulets, wards. Trinkets some of them, all holding a memory of something different. Something better. He hadn't added anything to the bag since James was born. Hadn't been outside the country since James was born.</p><p>The thought made him frown and he glanced around the room, checking to make sure he had everything. His next stop was his room, where he gathered the few changes of clothes he took on every trip. His invisibility cloak. The more extensive potions kit he took for long range field first aid.</p><p>He paused at the door to James' room, feeling something in him shrink at the thought of going inside again, but this was important. He was leaving. He knew what he needed to do.</p><p>He went inside and shifted the bundle of clothes into one arm before he picked Pads up, holding him just under his chin for a moment. The smell of him, and the cuddly warmth tucked against his body sent pain and grief ripping through Harry. He swallowed against it, burying his face in the bear's fur. He took one, deep, steadying breath, and then another. Then he pulled the bear away from his face and tucked it into the Mokeskin Pouch as well, resolutely not looking down into his confused, scrunched up face.</p><p>He went down the final flight of stairs to grab his rucksack, hanging in the entry hall. He stuffed his clothes into it, leaving it sitting next to his boots and then went back through the house. He passed the kitchen on his way, and saw Ginny sitting at the table. She glanced up and watched him as he passed, but didn't say anything. He didn't slow.</p><p>His last stop was the living room. He knew what he wanted from here. He crossed to the mantlepiece and picked up a photo of James. It had been taken a few months earlier. Harry held it and watched as James cackled in laughter, almost tipping himself off the side of the couch. A moment later Harry's head appeared, as he took off the invisibility cloak. James was obscured for a moment and then Harry disappeared again and James returned. His face was startled, before he burst back into happy laughter.</p><p>Harry had been avoiding the photos. It was hard enough seeing James' face in his mind's eye, without seeing every perfect detail of him. He looked away, searching for something to put the image in, as he flipped the frame over and peeled the back off. He spotted a copy of <i>The Tales of Beedle the Bard</i> sitting on a side table, where Ginny had left it almost two months before. She'd liked to read to James, Harry remembered, but the memory felt old somehow. Faded.</p><p>He crossed the room and picked the book up. He slipped the photo between the pages and then put it into his pouch as well before tying it onto his belt. He wondered what it said of him that he could pack his entire life up in less than ten minutes. He didn't think it was anything good. It probably also wasn't anything he didn't already know about himself.</p><p>His steps slowed as he walked back out of the living room. He stopped in the kitchen doorway. Ginny was still watching him.</p><p>'I'm sorry,' he said, knowing it said everything and nothing all at once.</p><p>'Will you be back?' she asked.</p><p>Harry realised as she asked that he didn't know. He hadn't thought about it. James had tied him down. James had tethered him here, given him a reason to return every night.</p><p>'I don't know,' he said simply.</p><p>'Be safe,' she said, seeming to accept those words. Harry realised she'd heard them from him often enough. They'd been in and out of each other's lives for years. The last eighteen months had been the most time in a row they'd ever spent together.</p><p>'You too,' he said, and he knew that he meant it. Ginny didn't deserve any of this. Ginny shouldn't be the one to lose everyone over and over again. That was his job, after all. It was why he was made.</p><p>~</p><p>He rode at first without conscious thought. He just let himself feel the simple pleasure of the wind flipping strands of his hair behind him and the roar of his bike between his legs. Eventually, though, he found himself steering west. It wasn't until he saw the sign reading 'Welcome to Wiltshire' that he realised where he was going.</p><p>He had to stop in Amesbury and ask directions to the big poncy Manor around these parts. Lucky it wasn't too late at night. He considered having a drink while he was there but something in him was itching to keep moving, to follow up this lead while it was fresh in his mind again. He couldn't believe he'd forgotten Malfoy's words. He could have been weeks ahead in trying to figure out what the hell was going on. He felt anger stirring at himself and tried to push it back down. That wasn't going to help him now.</p><p>By the time he pulled up out the front of Malfoy Manor, Harry was tired and cold, and thinking that perhaps pushing on through the night had been a bad idea. Malfoy was hardly likely to invite him in for a chat this close to midnight, was he? But he was here now, so he may as well make the best of it.</p><p>He kicked his stand down and disillusioned his bike with a wave of his wand. He set repellent charms and a nasty hex over the saddlebags on the back of his bike which held all of his things and then moved towards the gates.</p><p>He assumed he wouldn't get anywhere near them and would need to wait for Malfoy to be alerted by the wards and to come and let him in, but to his surprise, they swung open silently at his approach.</p><p>Harry frowned and lit his wand before he began the long walk down the driveway. His boots crunched in the gravel underfoot, but everything else around him was silent. He could see the Manor in the distance and a number of lights were on, the dull hint of them peeking around the edges of curtains and shutters. Harry frowned, wondering why the place was lit up so late at night and quickened his footsteps.</p><p>He moved into a jog as he got close enough to see the Auror stationed at the front door. The man drew his wand and called out a challenge. Harry forced himself to slow. He tucked his wand into his jacket and stepped into the light with his hands raised. He recognised the Auror, Jeffries. He was in Ron's team. It seemed Jeffries recognised him as well, because his stance relaxed and he lowered his wand slightly. </p><p>'Harry,' he said, voice more official than Harry was used to hearing. 'What are you doing here?'</p><p>Harry tried to look past him to see inside the building. He glanced up again to see the number of lights that were on. What the hell was happening in there? He considered his options quickly. He could say he was visiting Malfoy as a friend, but if Aurors were present, maybe he was caught up in something shady.</p><p>'I need to see Ron,' he said instead, hoping like hell Ron was actually rostered on tonight. It seemed he was because Jeffries hesitated. </p><p>'It's important,' Harry said. 'Hermione sent me.'</p><p>At that Jeffries looked even more torn. 'I can't let you in,' he said. 'It's an active crime scene.'</p><p>The words crime scene ripped through Harry's mind, dread following them. He had to get inside. He needed to know what Malfoy knew.</p><p>'I'll just be a second,' he promised, moving past Jeffries with confidence. 'I remember all the protocols from training. I won't contaminate any evidence. Promise.' Jeffries opened his mouth one more time and Harry touched his wand, sending a non-verbal Confundus his way. He hated spelling people, but he needed to know what the hell was happening. Right now.</p><p>The sight that met his eyes when he stepped through the double doors made him stop in shock. Blood was sprayed up the column of the white marble staircase in the entrance hall. It was bright and obscene against the smooth surface. At the base of the stairs was a body covered with a sheet. He could see the blood seeping out from under it.<br/>
</p><p>He stepped closer, a sick fear gripping him. He could feel his breathing coming faster and his heart begin to pound. He smelt an acrid smell, sharp like sulphur. It stung his nose, burned his throat. Images flashed into his mind. Blood in the carpet. Blood everywhere. A tiny hand.</p><p>He stepped closer again, forcing himself to move. Forcing himself to breathe. He had to know. Blood. Blood. Blood. So much blood. Harry's heartbeat was pounding in his ears now. It was all he could hear. He took another step and then another, feeling like he was moving through treacle, like every step took more energy than he possessed.</p><p>When he reached the sheet, he knelt and took a deep breath. He tried to breathe through the panic that was rising him. So much blood on the outside and he couldn't put it back on the inside. Sticky beneath his knees, soaking into his trousers, covering his hands.</p><p>He looked down and his hands were clean. He shook his head, trying to focus.</p><p>Harry gripped the corner of the sheet and lifted it, just enough to see that the figure under the sheet had long, dark hair. It was a woman.</p><p>He dropped the sheet again and leaned to one side, away from the body laid out before him. He put both hands on the ground and vomited, retching as all that came up was bile and pain.</p><p>He could feel himself begin to shake, giant tremors rocking through him. He tried to breathe through them but he couldn't catch his breath. Couldn't think.</p><p>Ron found him like that. He wasn't sure how much later. He heard his name, then swearing, then Ron's hands on him, pulling him up and outside. Guiding him into the cool night air.</p><p>It was a long time before his breathing went back to normal and he could hear above the pounding of his heart.</p><p>'What the hell are you doing here?' Ron asked, when Harry turned to look at him, wiping sweaty hair off his forehead.</p><p>'I needed to see Malfoy,' he said, not sure what else to say. 'What happened in there? Who was that?'</p><p>Ron's mouth twisted in disgust and anger. 'That was one of fifteen human and house elf staff. They're dead, the lot of them, spread all over the house. It's a bloodbath in there.'</p><p>Harry stared at him, unable to take it in. 'Where's Malfoy?' Then another thought hit him, something far worse. 'He has a son, a little boy.' He almost couldn't bring himself to ask. The image of the blood was back in his mind. So much blood. 'He wasn't in there, was he?'</p><p>'What are you doing here?' Ron asked again, as he shook his head in answer to Harry's question. 'It's the middle of the night.' He looked Harry up and down. 'Did you ride here? The last time you saw Malfoy you tried to kill him. What the fuck are you doing here?'</p><p>Harry ignored his questions. They didn't matter. 'I need to find Malfoy,' he said instead. 'Now. It's important.'</p><p>Ron gave a bitter laugh. 'That's great mate. After we've tracked him down and charged him for fifteen murders, I'll be sure to tell him it's important that you speak with him.'</p><p>Harry stared at him, not comprehending. His thoughts still felt slow, like they wouldn't connect.</p><p>'Are you trying to say he did this?' he asked, looking back at the house. He shook his head. Malfoy might be a bastard, but he wasn't a murderer. Or he hadn't been, seven years ago when they'd exploded in each other's faces.</p><p>'I <i>know</i> he did this,' Ron said grimly. 'We have his magical signature on file from his trial. It matches every single one of the deaths.'</p><p>'It can't,' Harry said, stupidly. He thought of the dream, the hooded figures. His chance to find out what Malfoy knew. His chance to find out what happened to James.</p><p>'It does,' Ron said, and there was a grim finality in his voice.</p><p>'I have to go,' Harry said, backing away.</p><p>Ron stepped forward with a frown, reaching out for him and Harry moved faster. 'Not until you tell me why you're here,' he said. 'This is serious Harry. I've never seen anything this bad. Have you been talking to Malfoy? Do you know where he went?'</p><p>Harry shook his head, raising his hands. 'I don't know anything about him. I just came to ask him about something he said—something he said at the funeral.'</p><p>Ron winced for a moment, but he didn't let up on his stern expression. 'I still need to ask you some questions.'</p><p>Harry debated running, but there was a whole team of Aurors in the house.</p><p>'Tomorrow?' he asked instead. 'I'll come into the Ministry first thing? I should get home now though. Ginny won't want to find me gone when she wakes.'</p><p>Ron relaxed at his words and nodded. 'Tomorrow is fine. Try and get some rest. You look like shit.'</p><p>Harry forced a wry smile onto his face. 'I'm trying,' he said softly.</p><p>Ron gave him a half smile. 'I know,' he said in return. 'I'll see you in the morning, okay?'</p><p>Harry nodded and headed for the gates.</p><p>Once he was back on his bike, he wheeled it around and turned it east. He had to be across the borders and in France before morning.
