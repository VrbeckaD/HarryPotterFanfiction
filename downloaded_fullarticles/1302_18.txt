    <p>Sirius Black was having a mid-life crisis.<br/>
Well, that might be a bit dramatic. He was only in his thirties, but, as he kept being rudely reminded, you could never really be sure when your mid-life was going to be.<br/>
In fact, this was a recurring thought for Sirius. He mulled over the possibilities of this as he swung his legs over his bed early in the morning, wondering what particular crises he had experienced in his life would end up being those that happened to be in the middle of his life. A stinging thought at the back of his mind kept whispering bitter additions to these thoughts, which led it to less casual mulling, and more sickening remembrance.<br/>
Going by that logic, surely James’ mid-life crisis was when he dyed his hair ginger in third year so Lily would notice him? The voice in his head sneered, and Sirius flinched. It simply would not do to dwell on these types of thoughts today, or any other day. </p><p>Becoming a Hogwarts professor was a career path he never had imagined taking, but after being named the official guardian of his best mate’s orphaned child, he had decided that being an Auror was simply too dangerous and unstable if he was going to be there to support and take care of Harry. But he wanted to do something, he wanted to help, and although it may have seemed a shock to everyone else when Sirius was announced the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher after two disastrous years of flitting between jobs for Sirius, and a small crisis when it came to DADA professors, it was really not that surprising, if you thought about it properly. </p><p>At first, Harry had been thrilled to have Sirius, who he idolised with all his heart and soul, at Hogwarts with him, but he had since calmed down slightly, and did not latch himself onto Sirius every time he saw him in the corridors. </p><p>Returning to Hogwarts was an ever-painful process for Sirius. Everywhere he turned, he was reminded painfully of his best friend, his brother, who had been so cruelly snatched from him far too soon. And not only was he reminded by the endless laughter, smiles, jokes and pranks at every corner of the vast castle, he was also reminded of things equally as painful.</p><p>The first day he arrived, Sirius had had a panic attack in the safety of McGonagall's classroom, the memories like a slap in the face and a hand around his neck, choking and mocking him.</p><p>Sirius had still not braved the Astronomy Tower, as the memories of him and his both lover and best friend were simply too strong and devastating. Hell, Sirius could barely walk down the corridors without feeling the ghost of Remus’ hand in his. There was a firm list in his head of places he simplywouldnotgo, consisting of nearly half the castle’s secret passages and hideaways. Crying himself to sleep had become a regular occurrence for the first time in many years, as although he thought his heart had hardened after the years of devastating solitude, but the revisit to Hogwarts dragged up the old wounds, digging their sharp claws into his heart and head and lungs, and making them bleed anew.<br/>
However, multiple therapy sessions with Pomfrey and cups of tea in McGonagall's office had left him feeling a little better, and teaching brought him a joy he had never expected. </p><p>Although teaching Harry’s class could be awkward at worst, he delighted in teaching the arrogant Slytherins a lesson, but also was surprised that the rest of the house, minus Malfoy’s group, were actually not as bad as expected, and even found himself warming to multiple members, mainly the quiet, smart ones. He also took a shine to Hermione, Fred and George, although watching the two pranksters was at best bittersweet, and at worst heart-wrenching. They reminded him so much of himself and James, as did Harry and Ron, in some ways. But it was Hermione who really surprised him.<br/>
She really was the brightest witch of her age, as she confronted him after just the first lesson.</p><p>“I saw you flinch in lessons today when I called you Professor Black. Why?” she asked, ever curious and stubborn to find out whatever she wished to know.<br/>
Sirius tilted his head to the side, giving her a small, if surprised, smile.<br/>
“Well, that is... a delicate subject,” he admitted.<br/>
“I can be delicate.” Hermione sniffed, crossing her arms over her chest firmly.<br/>
Sirius laughed, shaking his head, and pulled out the chair for her.<br/>
“You may wish to sit down.” he smiled slightly sadly, and explained to her all the negative connotations of the surname Black to him, and although he did not go into detail about his family, he gave a brief enough overview for Hermione to understand. Sirius found himself spilling everything to the young girl, how he had assumed the Potter name in his fifth year after he ran away from home, and then legally changed his last name to Lupin when he and Remus had taken part in their unofficial ceremony- unofficial due to the fact it was still illegal to marry someone of the same gender. And how, with a heavy heart, Sirius had had to change his name back once Remus was sent to Azkaban for the deaths of his two best friends. Re-assuming the Potter name was simply too painful, so he had reverted back to Black.<br/>
That didn’t mean he was happy about it, though. </p><p>Hermione had sat there, open-mouthed, as Sirius told her his story, of how Remus had betrayed the Potters to Voldemort, and then also killed Peter in a fit of wolf-induced rage.<br/>
After telling her everything, Sirius was yet again shocked when Hermione got out of her chair and flung her arms around his neck. </p><p>All in all, returning to Hogwarts was better, and worse, than Sirius had expected.</p>
