    <p>~All my friends are heathens, take it slow<br/>
Wait for them to ask you who you know<br/>
Please don’t make any sudden moves<br/>
You don’t know the half of the abuse~</p><p>“MAGIC: THE GREAT EQUALIZER”</p><p>The headline of the Daily Prophet seemed to be almost screaming and Hermione frowned and chewed her lower lip. Putting down the paper, she and Harry shared a troubled look across the breakfast table. “Harry do you” but she was cut off by the sound of the floo chiming. </p><p>They both jumped as Ron’s head appeared in the flames. “Harry” he said imperiously “Just confirming you’ll be there tonight for the exhibition Quidditch game. Minister wants to make this a big to-do and you and I are key to that.” Hermione snorted softly and Ron shot her a glare “Look Mione, I don’t need your lecture. I know how you feel about all of this, you’ve made it quite clear.” Hermione didn’t even glance up from the paper, just deliberately turned a page and kept reading.</p><p>“Yes, Ron, I’ll be there” Harry said tiredly and with a decisive nod Ron vanished from the fireplace. Hermione lay the paper down and stared at Harry. “I don’t like it either Mi” he said softly “I’m going to do this, as a goodwill gesture, but then I’m done.” </p><p>She sighed and stood up, hugging him close and kissing the top of his head. “I’m going in to the shop. What are your plans for the day?” </p><p>Harry shrugged “Nothing I guess” he said “Feels strange to not be working.”</p><p>“If it makes you feel better” she said gently “I think you made the right decision.” He smiled weakly and wandered up the stairs. She watched him go, the lines on her forehead deepening with worry. Turning to the floo she tossed the powder and stepped through.</p><p>The dark and quiet of the store was soothing. She moved through, opening shades and straightening shelves, not eager to turn on the light or face actual other people. Swishing her wand to the front window she watched the sign unfurl until “Phoenix Books” was fluttering in the light breeze. Checking her watch she saw she had about an hour until opening, so she pulled the ledger close and started checking sales. </p><p>The peace of the street was shattered by shouting and an authoritative voice yelling to shut down apparition. Instinctively, Hermione grabbed her wand and edged towards the door, defensive spells crowding her lips. There was a sound of pounding feet and Hermione caught a flash of blond as a figure rounded the corner.</p><p> She barely had time to register that it was Draco Malfoy running for all he was worth when she flung open the door and grabbed him by the collar. Yanking him inside she cast a body-bind before he could curse her. “I’m here to help” she hissed. Releasing the bind she shoved him under the desk and quickly locked the store. She also sent a cleansing spell through the air, even though they hadn’t used any magic she didn’t want to take a risk that his magical signature would be noticed. </p><p>Hermione took a deep breath and worked to relax her face and body. The sound of yelling came closer and a group of wizards were suddenly in view racing down the block. Hermione frowned, they were dressed almost like Aurors but the insignia was just slightly different. One of them abruptly halted in front of the store and banged on the window “Have you seen anything?” He hollered. Hermione looked up apprehensively. She shook her head and shrugged and the wizard growled and ran off. </p><p>When she was sure they were gone she lowered the blinds of the window and cast a silencing charm. Beckoning to Draco she went into the back room and shut and warded it. Only then did she turn to him and exhale. He was just staring at her, breath still racing and eyes wide. She reached out her hand and he visibly flinched, but she just took his arm gently and guided him down into a seat. She went to the little kitchenette and fixed a cup of tea. Pressing it into his hand she sat on the stool in front of him and put a hand on his knee “What happened” she asked.</p><p>His eyes darted around and he licked his lips. “What do you care?” he asked, trying to make it sound nasty, but only managing to sound scared. She just sat quietly and looked at him with calm eyes. He gave a shuddering breath and put his head on his hand. “I don’t know” he admitted “I was just, walking. I heard a shout and I kept my head down and walked faster. It got louder and I heard them yelling that now was their chance. I didn’t wait, I just took off. Apparently that was enough to start a manhunt.”</p><p> His hand started to shake and he put the cup down quickly. “I have to make sure everyone is ok” He said, mostly to himself. Reaching into his pocket he pulled out a galleon and spelled it wandlessly. Hermione recognized the Protean charm, she wondered if he’d borrowed the idea from the DA. He watched the coin anxiously as a series of symbols flashed around the edges, finally the coin went dark and he relaxed. </p><p>“Draco” she said “What’s going on.” He stared at her, she almost blushed under the intensity of his gaze. </p><p>“I’ll tell you” he said “But I need to know I can trust you.”  She considered for a minute and then took his hands. She gently placed them on the side of her head and closed her eyes. She heard the whispered “Legilimens” and the gentle intrusion of his magic into her mind. He seemed to linger on her time at the Ministry, at the shouted conversations about the “Equality through Magic” initiative. At the quiet conversations between her and Harry. She was grateful he went passed the break-up with Ron, the decision not to undo the oblivation on her parents and the other painful things from the last three years. He pulled back and her eyes fluttered open. His stormy grey ones were gazing into hers and she held his gaze, feeling a hundred tumbling things all at once.</p>
