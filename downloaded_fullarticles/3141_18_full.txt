    <h1> </h1><p>Draco lay on the hard cot that had been his only furniture for the past year. A particularly recalcitrant knot pressed firmly into his shoulder blade and he briefly considered shifting, but just as quickly dismissed the idea—no amount of moving would bring him comfort. His eyes remained stubbornly open as the bone-deep blackness of his surroundings slowly lightened with the breaking dawn and weak light fought its way through the large cracks in the wall.</p><p>Today was the day—the day he was being released from Azkaban. He supposed he should be happy, but in reality he couldn’t feel much of anything. Even though the Dementors had been banished from the wizard prison, their aura of despair had permeated the crumbling rock and rusted steel. He was lucky that his sentence was only a year. At least he could still remember a time he had been happy, even if he could no longer<em> feel </em> it. Others that had been here longer weren’t so fortunate.</p><p>A distant clang of metal set Draco’s heart racing. Judging by the degree of light in his cell, he figured it was time for the guard to collect him, but he didn’t feel ready yet. Though the guard had told him yesterday to prepare for release, he had received no further information and he quite literally had no idea what to expect. He hoped he would be able to go home and see his mother.</p><p>~</p><p>He was not going to be able to see his mother. Draco became increasingly panicked as he sat in the hard wooden chair in his probation enforcer’s small office in the DMLE and listened to the terms of his release. <em> No contact with his mother or former friends. No Apparition. No wand. Must find and sustain employment. Random searches. Weekly visits. </em></p><p>With each new rule imposed he wondered why they had bothered to let him out at all. He had no idea how he would go about finding employment with no wand, no manual skills, and no contacts.</p><p>Finally, he could no longer contain his panic, “How am I supposed to comply to these terms with all the restrictions!? It’s like you’ve cut off my arms and told me to paint!”</p><p>His enforcer, Hopkins, smiled nastily in response, “Personally, I think we are being much too lenient on your type. You’ll manage or you’ll go back, simple as that.” He leaned back in his chair and looked much too pleased.</p><p>“Go...go back?” Draco questioned.</p><p>“Of course. You put one hair out of line and you go back to Azkaban. Now, we’ll put you up in the Leaky for one week while you find employment. If at the end of that week you don’t have a job and a means to support yourself, you go back to your cell with no chance at parole for another year.”</p><p>Draco paled. How in Merlin’s name would he be able to find a job in one week?</p><p>~</p><p>Draco lay on the rickety bed in his bare room at the Leaky. He had stayed up long into the night pacing the wooden floors and trying to think of places to find a job. There was absolutely no way he could go Muggle, but he was drawing a complete blank on any magical jobs that didn’t actually require magic. He had tried to conjure a few spells wandlessly, but other than a shaky levitating charm he hadn’t gotten far. Exhaustion finally drove him to the sparse bed and he sank into its simple, but comfortable, mattress.</p><p>Now he stared at the exposed beams running across the ceiling and tried to bite back the bile of panic that rose as soon as his eyes had opened. He closed his eyes again and pictured the cracked stone walls of his cell in Azkaban, drawing comfort from the familiarity that blossomed in his chest. Intellectually he knew this wasn’t a good sign for his mental health, but he took the comfort it provided anyway and wearily rolled out of bed. Familiar or not, he still felt the despair of Azkaban and had no intention of going back.</p><p>Draco dressed in the shapeless clothes he had been provided when he was dropped at the Leaky. He didn’t know why they couldn’t have just taken clothes from his house; when he had asked, Hopkins just laughed mockingly and shoved the bag of clothes and other basic necessities into his chest, then turned and left, still laughing.</p><p>Draco sighed at his reflection and tried to adjust the way-too-large shirt into a more pleasing shape, but soon gave up the futile attempt. If he at least had his wand he could have altered the clothes to fit better, which may have helped the hideous cut look decent on his thin frame. He cringed at himself in the mirror; he looked absolutely ridiculous. He had expected things to be hard once he was released from Azkaban, but he <em> hadn’t </em> expected the continued isolation and impossible stipulations. Knowing he looked as good as he was going to, he took a deep breath and left his room.</p><p>His plan for the day was to visit a few choice shops in Diagon Alley and hope for the best, but first: tea. He had been given a 2 Galleon daily stipend from the Ministry for meals and though he thought that sounded low, he hadn’t paid attention to food prices in years, so maybe it was plenty. Either way, he’d have to pay attention as he knew he couldn’t count on any sympathy from Hopkins if he didn’t manage his funds well.</p><p>Mercifully, there weren’t many other folks in the bar when he entered. He hadn’t yet seen anyone that he knew well and he wished to keep it that way for as long as possible. He chose a booth in the far back corner and scooted close to the wall. He located the menu and flipped it open to see what he could have for breakfast; he hadn’t starved while in Azkaban, but he also had never been given enough to be entirely satisfied. He was really looking forward to a proper meal.</p><p>His heart sank. 6 Sickles for the cuppa alone! The tiny print below indicated the tea was served indefinitely for the course of the meal, but this was essentially one-third of his daily budget!</p><p>“What’ll you ‘ave?” came a gruff voice from above Draco, making him startle.</p><p>Draco quickly glanced at the menu once more before closing it, “I’ll have a cup of tea and toast with butter.”</p><p>Tom the barman quirked a brow, “Not a very filling breakfast for a new parolee.”</p><p>“Yes, well, it’s what I would like. I assume the tea will be unlimited with the toast?”</p><p>“Aye.” Tom paused a moment longer then headed to the kitchen, quickly returning with a plain tea service and a few slices of toast.</p><p>After a slow breakfast during which he prepared himself as much as he could for the debasement of asking for a job, Draco finally left the sanctuary of his hidden booth and hesitantly walked out toward the back alley. He had only arrived in Diagon Alley from this entrance once before but he felt confident that he remembered the way correctly.</p><p>He stepped outside and was immediately faced with the imposing brick wall; he threw his hands up in frustration, “For fucks sake!” he yelled. He couldn’t even enter Diagon Alley without a wand! How in Salazar’s forsaken world was he supposed to do <em> anything </em> without a wand?</p><p>“Forgot that bit, did ya?” asked Tom as he stepped into the small courtyard and approached the wall with his wand raised.</p><p>Draco scowled at him, “How much did they tell you about me?”</p><p>“Enough, I suppose.” replied Tom as he tapped the proper sequence of bricks that would open the gateway to Diagon. “There should be a good flow of folks in and out later today for you to return. I’ll do a final check at 5:00pm if I’ve not seen yeh.”</p><p>Draco huffed in response and entered Diagon Alley through the now open entrance.</p><p>~</p><p>“I’m sorry Mr. Malfoy, we simply don’t have any openings available for you.”</p><p>“Mr. Crawley, I assure you I would be an asset to the Apothecary. I was the top student in Potions during my time at Hogwarts and surely you know who mentored me. You won’t find a better suited employee.”</p><p>Mr. Crawley stared at Draco as if he were an offensive odour or a street beggar, “I think we are all aware who mentored you, Mr. Malfoy. After all, didn’t it just afford you free room and board for the past year? Now, if you would be so kind as to exit my shop, we are finished.”</p><p>Draco stared for a moment longer, then turned and left. He hadn’t actually expected to receive a job on his first try—but he hadn’t expected <em> not </em>to either. He continued through Diagon Alley to his second choice in employment—Slug &amp; Jiggers Apothecary. He really was well-suited for an apothecary job and felt it was his best shot.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, he was starting to worry. The owner of Slug &amp; Jiggers had also refused to hire him, indicating his unsavory reputation and how that would negatively impact his potion sales if people thought they could be poisoned. Draco had tried to convince him that he could stay in the back and merely prep ingredients, but the owner was having none of it.</p><p>He quickly moved on to the next shop on his list, Obscurus Books. Malfoy Manor had an extensive library that Draco had used well during his childhood; surely this would translate to hireable experience.  </p><p>Or not. He had practically been chased out of the shop and asked not to return. He was hungry, tired from the drastic increase in physical activity, and utterly defeated. He retreated to a small cafe and took up residence in a corner booth. He used another 6 precious Sickles for a cup of tea and proceeded to nurse his despair and shattered ego.</p><p>~*~</p><p>“Oi! Just for that you get no tea!” Harry laughed as he stepped out the front door of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. He was spending the day helping George with some remodeling and moving of inventory in the shop and desperately needed a tea. He genuinely enjoyed helping George in the shop, but when the man was in his creative space he was quite a handful.</p><p>Smiling politely at a few strangers who called out to him, he made his way to the closest cafe in Diagon. He opened the door and started purposely toward the counter, scanning the faces of the other patrons as he went out of habitual instinct. His eyes had already flicked back to the cashier before his brain registered an anomaly.</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>He scanned the room again and his heart nearly stopped when he spotted it. Nestled in a corner of the small shop was the unmistakable gleam of white-blonde hair that could only belong to a Malfoy. The man-in-question was looking down at the table and didn’t seem aware of his surroundings at all. Harry’s heart was striving to make up for the near-stop earlier and was currently beating at least twice as fast as normal. He was suddenly terrified that Malfoy would look up and spot him staring at him like a complete tosser. He abruptly turned heel and left the shop in a sprint; he didn’t stop until he was safely ensconced back in Wheezes.</p><p>“Harry, ya bellend, where’s my tea!?” squawked George. “Harry? You ok, mate?” George immediately dropped his joking demeanor and approached Harry in concern.</p><p>“Y-yeah. I...I saw Malfoy.”</p><p>“Malfoy! Lucius?”</p><p>“What? No! Malfoy, <b> <em>my</em> </b> <em> Malfoy. </em> Well-I mean, not <em> mine </em>, but, ya know…” Harry looked at George in desperation, “Draco Malfoy. He’s here. In Diagon.”</p><p>“Well...did he give you grief or something?” George asked, confused by Harry’s discomfort.</p><p>“No. He didn’t see me.”</p><p>“Hm. Well, I’ll pop upstairs and make some tea. How about you start moving the Portable Swamps.” George eyed Harry again as he walked away; he thought he ought to send an owl to Ron.</p><p>~</p><p>Harry lay in his bed that night replaying the image of Malfoy sitting in the shop on repeat: <em> Why was he in there? When did he get out of Azkaban? Was he hiding anything? He looked good. Shit, no. He looked like always, if a bit thinner. Did he always look good? Shit. </em>Harry rolled over, reached into his bedside drawer, grabbed a small vial of sleeping draught and downed it. He didn’t want to keep thinking tonight.</p><p>The incessant buzzing of an alarm finally roused Harry from sleep. He groaned and waved his hand, putting an instant stop to the intrusive noise. He felt a little disoriented from the lingering effects of the draught he had taken and he briefly considered sending a patronus to George to skive off helping today, but then he remembered the reason he had taken the draught in the first place. <em> Malfoy. </em>He rolled out of bed and started to get ready.</p><p>An hour later, Harry cautiously entered the same small coffee shop he had seen Malfoy in yesterday. He glanced around and was surprisingly disappointed he didn’t see him. He ordered a tea for George and a coffee for himself; he was going to need something strong to make it through today.</p><p>Later, after a long morning of moving shelves and setting up new displays, Harry was already knackered and absolutely starving. “Hey George, do you mind if I pop over to lunch with Ron?”</p><p>George smiled, “Sure thing Harry, tell him I say hi. Probably won’t need you for the rest of the day if you get caught up in anything.”</p><p>“What would I get caught up in?”</p><p>“Oh, I dunno. Just saying.” George winked and smiled knowingly at Harry.</p><p>Only Harry didn’t know <em> what </em> he supposedly knew.</p><p>~</p><p>“Hey Mate, brought lunch.” Harry said while walking into Ron’s office in the DMLE. He held up a bag of Chinese takeaway and motioned for Ron to clear a spot on his desk.</p><p>Ron grinned as he pushed a pile of papers to the side and scooted up close to help Harry unpack the bag, “I thought I might see you today.”</p><p>“Oh? Why’s that?”</p><p>“George owled me. Malfoy, huh?” Harry choked on his bite of rice. Ron laughed as Harry drank some water and tried to clear his throat. “He was released this week. He’s on parole and I imagine he’s in Diagon trying to find a job; that’s one of the listed conditions of his release.”</p><p>Harry attempted to look nonchalant, “Ah, good to know. I mean, I didn’t ask or anything. But still, good to know.” They ate in silence for a couple of minutes before Harry cleared his throat again, “So, just curious, what else did you see in his file?”</p><p>Ron bit back a chuckle, “There are a lot of conditions he has to follow. Some are crazy, like no wand, he’s got to find a job, no contact with family or former friends. Apparently if he doesn’t comply he goes back to Azkaban.”</p><p>“Goes back? Wow. Hm.” They lapsed into silence again for a few moments until Ron asked how things were going in the shop and Harry spent the rest of the time filling him in on the updates that were in progress.</p><p>Once lunch was over, Harry thought about going to Wheezes, but his mind was still trying to work through what he had learned about Malfoy. Based on how he looked in the cafe, his job search wasn’t going well. He ended up Apparating back to Diagon Alley and walking around, hoping to run into Malfoy again. He even spent a couple of hours in the cafe during the afternoon but he didn’t catch another glimpse of the platinum head.</p><p>Frustrated at his lack of success and more than a little confused over his own motivations, Harry decided that he needed a night out. A nice, Muggle night out.</p><p>~</p><p>Harry woke and immediately froze, listening intently for the danger that must have roused him. His head was pounding and his mouth was dry. His eyes darted to the bedside table and noted his missing wand, <em> fuck. </em> He jumped when the pile of covers next him rustled and an arm snaked around his waist.</p><p>“What’s going on?” a sleepy, sandy-blonde head mumbled. “Ready for another go?” The hair shifted into a face with a crooked, sloppy grin and Harry bit back a groan. Memories from the night trickled back to him: a Muggle bar, a cute bloke, stumbling to Grimmauld, throwing his wand in a drawer, messy kisses, blow jobs...and apparently passing out in bed.</p><p>Harry gently pushed the hand now groping his cock away and slid out of bed, “‘M going for water,” he mumbled while quickly slipping on some joggers and then backing out of the room. He cursed himself as he plodded down the stairs. He didn’t typically drink so much and always had the blokes out the door before he crashed for the night.</p><p>Harry grumbled as he wandlessly Accio’d a glass from the cupboard and filled it with tap water. He leaned against the counter and contemplated how best to get the bloke out of his bed. The view outside his kitchen window was still dark, but he could hear the birds starting their morning cacophony and he knew dawn was approaching.</p><p>His stomach rumbled and he turned to search his cupboards and fridge for something quick to eat. It had been a couple of weeks since Kreacher had last stopped by and stocked his fridge or prepared food and Harry hadn’t been bothered to do his own shopping. He settled on some bread and jam because he didn’t want to wait for toast.</p><p>Somewhat sated and with his head a little less poundy, he headed back upstairs to gently prod the bloke into leaving. He entered his room and stopped short. The man was still awake and propped in the middle of the large bed, stroking his hard cock and staring at Harry. Harry gulped, then shrugged and slid his joggers off, soon joining the now smiling man on his bed.</p><p>~*~</p><p>“Look, I’ll do anything: dishes, sweeping, trash-gathering, anything. Just—I just need a job.” Draco was pleading with the owner of the cafe he had frequented the past week. He truly thought food service was the lowest he could go but he was desperate and no longer had options. Tomorrow was his last day out and if he didn’t secure something he’d be going back to Azkaban.</p><p>“I’m so sorry sweetie, I just can’t. You don’t have any skills, or a wand, and though I know you’ve paid your time, I can’t ignore how my customers look at you. I really hope you find something suitable.” The older woman patted his shoulder and turned away.</p><p>Draco’s shoulders slumped as he walked back to the alley entrance to the Leaky. He had tried nearly every shop in Diagon and had received some variation of the same answer everywhere. Either folks didn’t want him there because of his reputation, or he couldn’t do any non-magic modification of the work without a wand. He had been working on his wandless magic all week but had not made much progress, if any at all.</p><p>Draco shuffled into the bar and into his regular booth. Tom came over shortly, “The usual tonight?” Draco sighed and pulled out what remained of his stipend. He had been so hungry today that he had been forced to purchase a sandwich for lunch. He had only 10 Sickles left.</p><p>“Just a tea tonight, Tom,” he said, weariness evident in every syllable. Tom eyed him briefly before turning away. Draco rested his forehead on the table and tried to force his worn out mind to keep thinking of a way to secure employment. He heard Tom’s footsteps approaching and slowly lifted his head. He was shocked when a full roast dinner was placed in front of him. The smell was absolutely divine and his stomach rumbled loudly...but he couldn’t afford this. “Tom, you know I can’t pay for this,” Draco said while reluctantly pushing the plate away.</p><p>“Don’t be daft, it’s on the house tonight. You look half-starved,” Tom said gruffly.</p><p>“I...I don’t know…” Tom crossed his arms and looked as if he would brook no argument. “Thank you,” Draco whispered. He could no longer look Tom in the eye as he shamefully, and gratefully, tucked into the dinner.</p><p>~</p><p>The next morning, Draco packed up the few items he had been given and tied them up in one of the plain shirts. He stopped at the door and looked around the room he had occupied for the past week. It looked as if no one had been there at all. Likely, this time tomorrow he would be back in his cell in Azkaban convincing himself this week had been nothing more than a hallucination.</p><p>He planned to risk going into some of the shops in Knockturn Alley today. He figured as long as he stayed away from any shops his family had previously frequented he would be within his guidelines, and perhaps his reputation would be a boon rather than a hindrance.</p><p>He opted to skip breakfast and asked Tom to go ahead and let him into Diagon. He planned to swing by the cafe for a tea and then immediately start asking around the tamer Knockturn shops.</p><p>Draco made it to the cafe without incident and ordered his tea to go. As he waited for it to be prepared he heard the door open and glanced toward it out of habit. His heart stopped. He clutched the counter and willed his knees to stay firm and not pitch him to floor. He opened his mouth to say something, but nothing came out.</p><p>The man who had just entered the cafe had also stopped in his tracks. The two stared at each other, seemingly trying to gauge what an appropriate reaction would be. The issue was decided when another patron tried to enter the store and impatiently jostled the man blocking the entrance.</p><p>As Draco remained rooted to the spot, Harry <em> freakin </em> Potter walked directly up to him and just…. <em> stood there </em>. Somehow, Draco regained his composure first, “Potter.”</p><p>“Malfoy. Er. Hi.” Harry rubbed the back of his neck and looked like he would rather be anywhere else, despite the fact <em> he </em> had approached Draco. “Um, how’s the job hunt going?”</p><p>Draco paused, “What?”</p><p>“Uh, I mean, I know…” Harry had turned bright red. Draco couldn’t care less about his discomfort; how did he know what Draco was doing?</p><p>“Have you been following me!?” Draco’s voice came out a little shriller than he planned, but he would not be able to handle it if Potter had been following him around all week, watching rejection after rejection.</p><p>“What? No! I just, Ron found out what you were…well, he told me…”</p><p>“So you had the Weasel look me up? Is he an enforcer? Are you?”</p><p>“No. Ron is an auror. I...well, I don’t really do anything specific right now.”</p><p>“That is hardly surprising. A year has passed and you are still living off your reputation as the Golden Boy. I can’t say it was a pleasure to see you, but I really must be going. <em> Obviously </em> you know why.” With that, Draco snatched his tea from the counter and huffed past Harry and out of the cafe.</p><p>He hurried around a corner and collapsed against the wall to catch his breath and calm his shaking. He was mortified. Of <em> course </em> Potter had meddled in his business; Draco really thought he would never see him again after the trials a year ago. For some reason, which Draco had yet to figure out, Harry had spoken on his and his mother’s behalf and it had gone a long way to reduce both of their sentences. Being Marked, he’d still gotten a year in Azkaban, but it was way better than the 30 years his father had received.</p><p>His mother had been able to get by with just house arrest, and as far as he knew that’s where she still was. Merlin, he missed his mother. Many times this week he had considered going to see her—even though it would cause his immediate return to Azkaban, he thought it would be worth it to just see her for a minute. Only his desire to have a normal life sooner rather than later prevented him from acting so rashly.</p><p>Once Draco had fully collected himself and felt that enough time had passed for Harry to also have left the area, he exited the little alley he had ducked into and headed toward Knockturn. He stopped just outside the decrepit tunnel that lead to Knockturn and finished his tea, tossing the cup in a nearby bin. He attempted to straighten his large clothes, took a deep breath, and made it one step into the tunnel before he heard a familiar voice yell out and felt his body go stiff with a magical bind.</p><p>~*~</p><p>“You should have seen me mate, I looked like a complete wanker!” Harry lamented, throwing himself dramatically across the small couch in Ron’s office.</p><p>“Since when do you care what you look like to Malfoy?” Ron was busy reading through a report as he said this and missed Harry’s glare, “<em> Malfoy </em> is a wanker, he probably didn’t notice you being one.” Ron finally glanced up, “What?”</p><p>“He definitely noticed. He thought I was following him ag—erm, following him.” Harry blushed and looked away, pretending to have a deep interest in the fabric of the couch.</p><p>Ron laughed, loudly, “Bloody hell Harry, what is it about him that always sucks you in!? He’s a fucking posh little git!” Ron had nearly lost it now, his report lay abandoned on his desk as he guffawed and smacked his leg.</p><p>Harry sat up straight, “I hardly think it’s as funny as you’re making it out to be. And he doesn’t ‘suck’ me in; I just think sometimes he needs a little more surveillance than others. But no, you’re right—it’s not like I caught him being a Death Eater before or anything!” Harry was in a right strop now. He had stood during his rant and was pacing in front of Ron’s desk.</p><p>Ron held his hands up in a gesture of surrender and tried desperately to bite back the chuckles that still threatened to erupt. “I’m just saying mate, he gets you worked up like none other. I remember when Hermione used to get me worked up like that.” Ron waggled his eyebrows.</p><p>“Are you...wh-what the fuck Ron? I don’t fancy him! Just because I like blokes doesn’t mean I like them all. And <em> Malfoy </em>!? Seriously, I better call ‘Mione, you’ve lost the plot—I just, I can’t. You know, I’ll talk to you later, when you’ve calmed down a bit.” Ron could no longer contain his mirth and burst into a new set of cackles. Face burning, Harry stomped out of his office, still grumbling to himself about how completely ludicrous Ron was being.</p><p>As he exited the auror hall a commotion in the enforcer’s hall drifted into his consciousness; he was still upset at Ron’s childish antics and initially dismissed the yelling—until, with a jolt, he realized that he recognized the shrill voice. His feet reacted before his brain and he was already approaching a small huddle in the enforcer’s hall before he even knew he had changed direction.</p><p>“I was NOT going to meet up with <em> anyone </em>! I was merely trying to find a source of employment that complied with the impossible restrictions you put on me!” Draco looked frantic, “Has anyone ever been able to do it?”</p><p>Harry saw a squat man holding his wand out, apparently keeping Draco’s hands bound with an <em> Incarcerous </em>, “Others aren’t your concern. I caught you going into Knockturn to meet up with old Death Eaters—I told you these felons can’t be rehabilitated!” The man had turned to address the two other enforcers that were standing with him.</p><p>“But I wasn’t—”</p><p>“What the bloody hell is going on here!?” Harry interrupted, and with an angry wave of his hand he dissolved the binds weaved around Draco’s wrists. All four faces turned to him in shock.</p><p>“Well-I-I hardly think this is a matter worth<em> your </em> attention,” stuttered Hopkins while subtly placing himself in front of Draco as if blocking Harry’s view would redirect his attention.</p><p>“Why do you have him here, and why was he bound?” Harry’s calm, quiet tone belied the rage boiling just beneath the surface. Though Hopkins looked uncomfortable, he didn’t seem to be aware of the true danger.</p><p>“Mr. Potter, this is enforcer business and what I am doing with my parolee is of no concern to any other department...or person, seeing as how you don’t even have a position here.” Hopkins seemed emboldened after his speech and briefly glanced back at the other two enforcers to seek further encouragement. His face fell when he realized the two men had retreated nearly to the other end of the hall and were definitely avoiding eye contact.</p><p>Harry stepped closer, “I believe Malfoy was looking for a job. It’s early yet, why is he here? His week isn’t up yet.”</p><p>Hopkins paled, “You don’t know what you’re on about! I found him going into Knockturn to rally up some old allies. He’s a danger to society!” Draco huffed a laugh behind him.</p><p>Harry looked questioningly at Draco, “Well?”</p><p>Draco bristled at the implication, “I was not going to rally any supposed ‘allies’ as he says. I <em> was </em> going into Knockturn, but only to see if anyone less biased there would hire me. He came from behind and bound me without explanation and brought me back here, presumably to throw me back in Azkaban, but I should be able to finish my week!”</p><p>“If he ain’t found a job by now, he’s not going to find one, so I might as well save some money for the Ministry and send ‘em back!” Hopkins had turned bright red and was puffing out his chest in a fake show of machismo.</p><p>Harry gritted his teeth. “He has a job.”</p><p>Both Draco and Hopkins snapped their gaze to Harry. “I do?” “He does?” they said in unison.</p><p>“Yes. With me. He’s going to...erm...cook for me.” Harry distractedly scratched his head and looked pointedly at Draco, who looked hilariously confused and disgusted.</p><p>Hopkins looked between Harry and Draco. “Surely you aren’t serious. He’s a criminal and you’re a...a…”</p><p>“I’m serious. The war is over; it’s time for old prejudices to be over too. If you need proof I can send the paperwork over tomorrow, I assume that will be enough?” Harry made direct eye contact with Hopkins in a silent challenge.</p><p>Seeing his power slipping away, Hopkins turned towards Draco, “Do you even accept this position, if it’s even real? You know there will be searches. And you can’t have your wand. And your funding here is cut off, so you have to find a place to stay, by tonight.” Hopkins leaned back on his heels and crossed his arms, seemingly in triumph.</p><p>“His position includes room and board,” Harry said impulsively, just managing to bite back his own look of horror. Again, two sets of eyes stared at him in wide-eyed shock.</p><p>Draco cleared his throat, “As you can see, I have a...position. I believe that means we are done here for now.” He lightly stepped around Hopkins and brushed past Harry to leave the department.</p><p>“Er, well, I’ll owl the details.” Harry said to a gobsmacked Hopkins before turning to follow Draco. <em> What the ever-living fuck have I done </em>he thought as he practically chased after the blonde head.</p>
