  <b>Harry/Draco</b>
</p><p><br/>Draco: “Potter, all my life I’ve been suffocating under the weight of my father’s expectations and struggling to free myself from the darkness in my soul. But your bravery has shown me the error of my old ways. From now on I shall devote my life to defeating the Dark Lord, combating anti-Muggle prejudice, and making the world safe for blibbering humdingers and puppies!”<br/><br/>Harry: “I don't believe you.”<br/><br/>Draco: “Alright, alright, the real reason I switched sides was because I heard you were dynamite in the sack. Now can we please get on with it?”<br/><br/>[Sex]</p><hr/><p>
  <b>Harry/Ron</b>
</p><p><br/>Harry: “Hey, Ron?”<br/><br/>Ron: “Yeah?”<br/><br/>Harry: “Wanna shag?”<br/><br/>Ron: “Sure.”<br/><br/>[Sex]</p><hr/><p>
  <b>Harry/Fred/George</b>
</p><p>Fred (nibbling Harry’s ear): “Do you know why we like you best?”<br/><br/>Harry: “Is it because I’m courageous, loyal, and -- oh yes, just like that George -- have great stamina?”<br/><br/>George (flicking Harry’s nipple): “Nope, guess again.”<br/><br/>Harry: “Um, because I just turned eighteen and yet I'm miraculously acne-free?”<br/><br/>Fred: “No! It’s because you…”<br/><br/>George: “…are the only one,”<br/><br/>Fred: “…who could ever tell us apart.”<br/><br/>[Sex]</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <b>Harry/Neville</b>
</p><p><br/>Harry: “See, there’s this bond between us. The Prophecy could have applied to you too, and had Voldemort decided to confront your family instead of mine, you would be the one with the fate of the Wizarding World resting on your shoulders. So I think you’d understand better than anyone else why… actually, I don’t see how this leads to my next point, but wanna shag?”<br/><br/>Trevor the Toad: *Ribbit*<br/><br/>Neville: “Okay.”<br/><br/>[Sex]</p><hr/><p>
  <b>Harry/Diary!Tom Riddle</b>
</p><p><br/>Harry writes: “Do you know anything about <strike>the Chamber of Secrets?</strike> the male G-spot?”<br/><br/><em>Yes.</em><br/><br/>Harry: “BDSM?”<br/><br/><em>Yes.</em><br/><br/>Harry: “Rimming, <em>Bukkake</em>, and Tantric sex?”<br/><br/><em>Of course.</em><br/><br/>Harry: “Can you tell me about it?”<br/><br/><em>Why don’t I show you instead?</em><br/><br/>[Sex]</p><hr/><p>
  <b>Harry/Remus</b>
</p><p><br/>Remus: “Harry, I truly care for you, but I’m concerned that you might be using our relationship as a misguided attempt to find a father substitute.”<br/><br/>Harry: “Nah, I’m mostly in it for the raunchy pre-full moon sex.”<br/><br/>Remus: “Oh, alright then.”<br/><br/>[Sex]</p><hr/><p>
  <b>Harry/Sirius</b>
</p><p><br/>Harry: “Look, I’m not my father. If we become lovers, I won’t think you’re trying to use me to resurrect the closeness you once shared with your dead best friend.”<br/><br/>Sirius: “That’s all very well, but am <em>I</em> alive or dead?”<br/><br/>Harry: “Does it matter?”<br/><br/>[Sex]</p><hr/><p>
  <b>Harry/Snape</b>
</p><p><br/>Harry: “Look, I’m not my father, and you don’t have to hate me anymore!”<br/><br/>Snape: “Believe me Potter, I have abundant reasons to loathe you for yourself.”<br/><br/>Harry: “Oh. Well then…”<br/><br/>Snape: “But that doesn’t mean we can’t shag.”<br/><br/>[Sex]</p><hr/><p>
  <b>Har</b>
  <b>ry/Lucius</b>
</p><p><br/>Harry: “Oh God!”<br/><br/>Lucius (fingers cat o’ nine tails lovingly): “Excellent. I see that you’ve already discovered one of my favourite forms of address.”<br/><br/>Harry: *gulps*<br/><br/>[Kinky non-con sex]</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <b>Harry/Voldemort</b>
</p><p><br/>Voldemort: “Because I am a <strike>moron</strike> devious and cruel evil overlord, I shall not kill you. Instead, you will be permitted to live a life of utter degradation as a plaything for myself and my minions.”<br/><br/>Harry: “Do you still remember all those pervy tricks from when you were Tom Riddle?”<br/><br/>Voldemort: “Yessss… and I’ve trained all of my Death Eaters as well.”</p><p>Harry: "Oh my..."<br/><br/>[Kinky non-con group sex]</p><hr/><p>

</p><p><br/>Author: Let’s not go there.</p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <b>Harry/The Half-Blood Prince*</b>
</p><p><br/>HBP: “But you don’t know anything about me yet!”<br/><br/>Harry: “JKR has already confirmed that we’re not the same person, and that’s good enough for me.”<br/><br/>[Sex]</p><hr/><p> </p></div>
