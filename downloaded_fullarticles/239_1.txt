    <p>A Cold Sleep</p><p>Part 1</p><p>Wearing his cousin's castoff rags the wind pierced right through him, the invisibility cloak offered almost no protection and he didn't dare cast a spell until he was far enough from the Dursley's that it wouldn't be attributed to him. He hadn't been able to get at any of his warmer clothes, the only things in the bag that Hermione had made for him were his broom, his school books, and a few of his most treasured possessions, the Marauder's map, and his photo album included. This was not a situation that he had prepared for, the Ministry had mandated that all Hogwarts students return home for the winter holiday, and the mandate specified that it be the student's legal guardian.</p><p>So Harry had been forced upon the Dursley's again and they had not been pleased to have him. As soon as he was in the door his trunk was taken away and he was locked into the smallest bedroom, informed that they would not be finding him any food for the duration of the three week break. He counted himself lucky that they had assumed everything was in the trunk; he needed his wand, if nothing else. It shouldn't have happened, he was 17, and he was supposed to be of legal age in the Wizarding world. But temporary edict from the Ministry forced him to act as a minor due to the threat still looming from Voldemort.</p><p>He didn't know what threat that was. Voldemort had not made an appearance since being returned to his body at the end of Harry's 4th year. The Death Eaters had been inactive, Harry's scar hadn't even burned since that night. It was the steady diet of paranoia fed to the Ministry by Dumbledore and his Order of the Phoenix that had led to the tense atmosphere the past two and a half years. Harry had grown more and more distrustful of the old man that he'd once considered a mentor, he couldn't explain it, but it seemed as if Albus had reversed course and set himself to the task of becoming a Dark Lord.</p><p>Hermione had become the only one that he could truly trust, she was not as enamored of Dumbledore as Ron was and though she didn't really believe his theory, she helped him to prepare for the worst. Somehow he had his doubts as to who he should contact, he didn't really think that any of his friends would believe him, so he just had to keep walking.</p><p>It had been a week since he'd been forced into his room, a week since he had eaten. He probably wouldn't have gotten out at all, but earlier that evening, while Petunia and Vernon were out to dinner, he heard the locks on his door begin to open, one by one. He had covered himself with the invisibility cloak, unsure of what might happen to him. But all he saw was Dudley, standing in the doorway, his blue eyes not even checking the room to see if Harry was still alive.</p><p>"Go, while you still can," was all the blond boy had said and Harry wasted no time, bolting from the room and down the stairs, out the open front door. He didn't know why his cousin had planned his escape, but if he lived through it, he was going to find a way to repay Dudley for the kindness.</p><p>Now though, as he walked through bitter cold wind and the occasional sprinkling of rain, he wished that he had paused to take something more substantial to protect himself, or at least some food. His adrenaline would only carry him so far, before long he would succumb to the cold.</p><p>He dragged himself to a cluster of trees that he knew separated the suburban homes from the industrial areas across the way and lost himself in them. Here, he thought, might be a good place to cast a spell. Fumbling for his wand he debated what to do, if the Ministry was tracking him, then using a heating charm would likely get him detected before he managed to find help. But if he used his Patronus then he was going to be forced to rely on a speedy reply before either the Ministry came for him or the cold did. He had to take the option of a rescue, however slim. The opalescent stag was standing before him an instant later, before he had a chance to second guess himself.</p><p>"Find me someone safe, someone that can help, bring them here," Harry said to the glowing creature, he smiled when it gave a nod of its head before turning and galloping away into the dark of the night. Harry collapsed against a tree, the spell had left him feeling absolutely depleted and so he sank to the ground and huddled for what little warmth he could generate on his own. He figured that he was going to die; he should have died with his parents anyway. He'd only delayed it by 16 years. At least he had sent Hedwig with Hermione; he didn't want to know what his Uncle might have done to her.</p><p>It became harder and harder to keep his eyes open as time went on, his body had nothing left to run on. It sacrificed the little protection that he had, but he removed the invisibility cloak and tucked it away, he'd be impossible to find if he fell over and was covered by it. After it was safe in the bag that was tucked against his chest, he stashed his wand as well and allowed his eyes to slide close, intending to let them rest.</p>
