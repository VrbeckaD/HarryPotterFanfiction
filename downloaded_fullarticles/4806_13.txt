<hr/><p> </p><p>“Right, something needs to be done.”</p><p>Hermione stormed into the common room, not thinking to stop the portrait from falling on Neville, who came stumbling in after her.</p><p>“About what?” he asked, rubbing the spot on his leg where the portrait had hit him.</p><p>“Harry and Ginny,” She replied, “Did you listen to a different conversation to me?”</p><p>“What’s this?” asked Dean with interest, surfacing from a very violent game of exploding snap. It seemed that the Weasley twins, judging by Seamus’ singed eyebrows, had spectacularly beaten him and Seamus, although this sight was such a common occurrence that nobody batted an eyelid.</p><p>“I was saying” sighed Hermione, exasperated at Neville’s seeming lack of concentration and comprehension, “That something needs to be done about Ginny and Harry. Ginny obviously has a massive crush on Harry, and all he needs is a prod in the right direction to admit to himself that he wanted to be with her. The only people that can’t see that are Ginny and Harry themselves.” She took a deep breath, before adding “and Ron, of course, but he wouldn’t notice other people’s feelings if they came with a giant neon sign!”</p><p>Neville, who had been paying rather more attention than Hermione had thought, noticed that that last part had rather more emotion in it than should be expected from someone talking about ‘just their friend’.</p><p>Fred started to talk, seeming to be deep in thought. “You know, we have been starting to think the same thing recently.”</p><p>“And with the parade of guys she’s been dating recently” added George, ”It can’t happen too soon.”</p>
