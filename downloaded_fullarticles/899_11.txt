    <p>
  <span>As identical twins, Fred and George were obsessed with symmetry. As contrarians by nature, they were obsessed with asymmetry. In family photos, they were never next to each other, always placed so that if one were to draw a line directly down the middle, the line would be exactly between them. Symmetry.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They made good Beaters because they were a matched set. Every motion made by one could be perfectly mirrored by the other. Fred could watch the left half of the field, and George could watch the right half. If one was sick or injured, the other could still play, but not half as well as if he were with his twin.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Fred came out to George before anyone else. It was easy, so easy it barely even felt like it mattered. What is the weight of telling a secret to the person who’s the second half of your soul? George nodded like he knew, and Fred smiled. A little assymmetry, an invisible, tiny difference that illuminated even further all the ways they were the same.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They took Arithmancy because of their obsession. Math, symmetry, twins – it all had to be tied together somehow. They didn’t find any answers in the math or the magic. They weren’t quite sure what the question was.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When George lost his ear, Fred laughed at the assymmetry. “Finally,” he laughed, “a way to tell the two of us apart.” It didn’t matter for long.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>There were days George forgot, and days he couldn’t think about anything else.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>For the first time in his memory, George’s Christmas sweater didn’t have his initial on it. There was no one to distinguish him from, no one he could accidentally be mistaken for. He wished, every once in a while, that someone would say Fred. It had been such a constant of his life, being mistaken for his brother. He never would be again.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>April Fool’s Day was the worst. Their twenty-first birthday, their favorite holiday. They had planned, during quiet moments in the midst of terror, to go to America, to an American bar, and get absolutely plastered. To take some time off and forget it all. Never, through all of their meticulous planning and weighing of outcomes and risk/reward analyses, not once had either of them considered that one might make it out alone. After George half-heartedly cut the cake, Bill took a picture of him for the family birthday photo album, and George flipped through it. Twenty years of photos of him and Fred, and one photo of just him. Symmetrical right down the middle, symmetrical to a memory. George closed the album and set it down on the table. It would be a while before he opened it again. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It just seemed so unnatural to George that Fred had spent almost every moment of his life with George, and now here George was, at the end of the decade, the century, the millennium, looking out on an unpredictable amount of time without his brother by his side. Even the time was asymmetrical now. Twenty years with, thirty, forty, eighty years without. No more balance. He didn’t have the words to describe it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They say two heads are better than one, and George always thought they were right, but how do you get used to being one when you’ve been two your whole life? How do you adjust? Do you, the one, become merely a half? Part of what used to be?</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Like everyone else, George had nightmares. They started off fine. George would wake up in his bedroom in the Burrow, and Fred would be just out of bed, in the bathroom. When George got to the bathroom, he had just missed Fred going downstairs. When George got downstairs, Fred was outside. When George reached the wall of the garden, there was a chasm, unimaginably wide, and Fred stood on the other side. George yelled, and waved his arms, but Fred never heard or saw him. He yelled all the things that had ever gone unspoken between them, the result of years of living in perfect sync: “Don’t do anything stupid!” “Be careful!” “I love you!” George would get up on the wall, and then Fred would seem suddenly to be right in front of him and say, “Till the end of the line, Georgie,” and stick out his hand for their secret handshake. George would always take his hand, but when George leaned in for the shoulder bump, Fred was gone, and George fell into the chasm.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He woke up screaming.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>George spent many silent afternoons working with his mother. They had driven each other crazy in George’s adolescence, but they had common ground now. Her brothers had been killed in the First War, and she had been only ten years older than George at the time. She knew she could never fully get it, Fred and George were twins after all, but they had this thing now.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>George spent more time with Harry. They would go flying together, just to be in the air, just to be away from it all. Harry had lost more people than George knew he could ever conceive. George felt like he was dying a little every day, and he had just lost Fred. Harry had lost Lily, James, Sirius, Dumbledore, Remus, he had seen Cedric die, he had come so close to death himself. Sometimes George wondered how Harry didn’t go insane, didn’t kill himself with the weight of it all. He heard Harry crying some nights, he knew Harry didn’t sleep nearly as much as he should have, he knew Ginny was the only thing that was getting him to sleep at all. George never said anything. What good would it do, anyway? They all had to get through this on their own.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Quidditch was one of the times he forgot. Pickup Quidditch became a constant in the Burrow when everyone got too tired of the silence but didn’t know how to break it. Someone would Floo call Luna, Neville, and Angelina, and then the twelve of them would split into teams. There were only two Chasers on each team, but otherwise it was Quidditch as usual. George would sometimes get so deep into the game that when Bill would hit a Bludger particularly well George called out, “Nice one, Fred!” Forgetting was worse than remembering to George, because every time he forgot there was a moment of remembering. And the remembering was worse than just knowing. He almost fell off his broom the first time it happened. It happened less and less with each passing day.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Remembering was better in a sense, because George knew Fred wouldn’t have wanted to fade away. He knew it would get easier. Everyone kept telling him it would get easier. The question wasn’t if, but when.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He ran into Angelina after a Harpies game, waiting to congratulate Ginny. They started talking, and Angelina asked George to drinks. He agreed, then went home and tossed it over in his mind again and again. Fred’s ex-girlfriend, but George wanted to see her, but he couldn’t betray Fred. He told Angelina to her face when they met at the Leaky Cauldron that night. She smiled sadly and said that she had been thinking the same thing. They reminisced together about Fred’s finest moments, and George smiled. It had been too hard to share it with his family, but to share Fred with someone else was wonderful. He kept seeing Angelina, and they moved past Fred into each other’s lives. After game drinks became after game sleepovers became early morning pancakes in the flat above the shop. When George proposed to Angelina he told her he thought he would never be symmetrical to someone again, but he had found her, and they were symmetrical in their own way. She cried as she said yes. </span>
