    <p>Harry blinked shocked when an unfamiliar owl landed beside Hedwig, glancing at the snowy owl and puffing up his feathers even further than they already were which was quite a feat in itself and then majestically sticking his leg out to Harry. Staring at the gorgeous black owl Harry was so lost in thoughts of who would be sending him letters that it took the owl giving a slightly indignant hoot for him to realise he should take its burden from it. Murmuring an apology and offering a whole rash of bacon before he risked his fingers to untie the parcel.<br/>It was a beautifully wrapped box done in black paper with golden ribbon tying it together and bowed at the top. Harry was suddenly aware of the curious eyes of the hall fixed on him and he ducked his head with a blush lighting his features even as he reached out and tugged the ribbon to open it.</p><p>A gasp went round the table and everyone dropped any small amount of pretence that they were not watching as they leant closer to see the gift that had been lying beneath the wrapping paper, some even standing on the bench to try and get a better view.</p><p>"I…what?" Harry frowned looking confused.</p><p>"You have to say no Harry! This is ridiculous, as if you would say yes! I will burn it for you," Hermione sneered reaching out to take the box before Harry could say anything, only to shriek when the box visibly shocked her.</p><p>"Honestly Granger, this is some of the oldest magic in our world and one of the most serious offerings of magic. Do you really think anyone but the recipient can do anything to it," Parvarti scowled at the other girl before turning to Harry who was looking unsurely between those around him. "It is a courting box Harry," She explained gently.</p><p>"A Courting box?" Harry asked slowly.</p><p>"Its an old ritual in our world, not many people go for it anymore since things moved on and its acceptable for people just to date. Normally it is used for older families and important figures, as a way to prove that the sender has true feelings for the recipient and isn't just after their money or name. This is the start of the Courting, the Promise of Courting. The sender will give some form of container holding a gift, encrested with their family coat of arms telling the recipient that they are swearing their name to the honesty of their wish to Court and that they hope in the future that you will belong to their House in formal bonding. The box symbolises the protection of the relationship, guarding against outside forces that may seek to do it harm, and the intention to protect the recipient from outside harm," Neville explained to Harry.</p><p>"I…oh…who?" Harry stammered his fingers reaching out cautiously to stroke over the family crest carved into the top of the gorgeous box, however the box didn't shock him and he traced his finger over the smooth wood.</p><p>"Zabini," Hermione hissed making Harry blink shocked again at the box.</p><p>"As in…"</p><p>"Blaise Zabini. He seems to have a very strong interest in courting you, no don't look at him yet!" Parvarti shook her gripping Harry's wrist gently when he automatically went to look at the Slytherin table. Confused instead he looked at her.</p><p>"You have to look inside the box to the gift first mate. The rule of this Courting say that the sender is allowed to send you three gifts before you are allowed to reject them if their advances are truly not welcome. But first you have to acknowledge the gift they have sent you, if you are impressed then you nod your head to them to show that they have done well and that you are pleased, if they have not given you a suitable gift then you just look at them," Seamus explained to him.</p><p>"You have to be honest Harry, this isn't a situation for pretending to like something so not to hurt someone's feelings, this is very serious," Neville added.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath Harry felt as though he was twitching with the force he had to put on himself not to look at the Slytherin table yet. If it was not for the other insisting how serious this was in their world, and the fact that Blaise had sworn his family name to the seriousness of this he would think that this was some big joke from the Slytherin, and that perhaps one of them had noticed his glances and had decided to torture him with them.</p><p>After all what on the earth and heavens would Blaise Zabini see in him? The man was frankly gorgeous and looked as though he belonged on the front covers of one of the muggle modelling magazines. He had already caught the attention of Witches Weekly, firmly nudging his way passed Malfoy for handsome young male aristocrat. To Harry's embarrassment he himself had been classed as beautifully gorgeous in a different category, feeling humiliated for the fact that his name would put him in something like that, not believing anyone when they insisted that it was a true assessment that had nothing to do with his fame. Blaise Zabini stood at 6,4 with dark chocolate skin and storm grey coloured eyes, sharp cheekbones and a defined nose, his shoulders were broad to match his frame and his chest and stomach which could be appreciated through his well tailored robes looked as though you could crush rock onto them. Harry had definitely noticed the other teen, he had just not expected to be even a blip on his radar.</p><p>With trembling hands he reached out and stroked his fingers around the box, turning it till he could reach the clasp and opened it with almost a reverent touch. He stilled before smiling softly when a gentle tinkling of music came from the box as he lifted the lid, fully pushing it back his eyes were drawn to the two beautifully dressed wizards waltzing gracefully around a small platform on the box, when he looked closer he saw that they were staring lovingly at each other as they danced.</p><p>"That's an old romance song Harry, it was written for the story of Matthew and Brendon Hamish, they fell in love even though their families were enemies. They made a promise to each other that they would bond, when Brendon's father tried to force him into bonding with another he and Matthew ran away and bonded together in a private ceremony. They fled the country because they knew their families would be furious and set up in a wizarding village in the middle of nowhere, working hard to make a life for themselves. When their families finally tracked them down they had three children and another on the way. Their parents realised that through their stupidity they had missed out on so much already, including the first years of their grandchildren's lives and they swore peace with each other and asked the two to come home with their family. This song was written based on the night of their bonding," Neville explained in a soft voice. Harry listened to story and felt his heart skipping a beat in his chest, Slytherin's did nothing by chance or coincidence, everything was planned out to the smallest detail, so Blaise had intended this song to be the one the music box played.</p><p>"Oh Harry!" Parvarti gasped making him realise that there was something else in the box. The box itself would have been an amazing gift! But there lying in the centre of the box was the most beautiful thing that Harry had ever seen. Reaching inside he gasped when his fingers brushed the crystal side of the object as he felt a tingle of magic.</p><p>"He crafted this with his own magic," Harry choked out, the skill to make something like this would have taken hours upon hours of work! </p><p>The gorgeous rose had a deep emerald green stem and realistic thorns headed by the blood red head of the flower that looked so realistic Harry expected to feel the silky soft petal under his fingers when he brushed his fingers over it. Twined around the rose was a detailed black and purple snake with silver eyes, but instead of looking like it was smothering the rose it was most definitely protecting it and guarding it. The meaning was clear to Harry and sank into his soul like a balm. He was the rose, and even though he had sharp thorns more than capable of protecting himself he did not have to anymore, because the snake who was most definitely Blaise would guard and protect him.</p><p>Stroking his fingers once more over the beautiful statue and feeling the tingle of magic he finally raised his eyes and found those he had been fighting not to meet. Blaise was watching him with his normal blank expression giving nothing away, but he was watching him with an intensity that made the hair on the back of Harry's neck stand on end and his skin tingle. Smiling shyly Harry nodded his head, blushing when a cheer went around. Blaise stood sharply and bowed across the room to Harry before walking over with clear intent in his eyes towards the Gryffindor.</p><p>Harry blinked up at him when he finally stopped in front of him, having stood to meet him. Those stormy grey eyes seemed to burn into his soul as they held his own eyes captive before he reached down and took Harry's hand, the gentle but firm touch making Harry feel as though he was on fire. Blaise raised the hand to his lips and pressed a lingering kiss to the back of Harry's hand before using the grip to tug him forwards against his body and seal their lips together in a deep, bruising kiss that left Harry with no doubt of what Blaise was telling him…well once his brain had cleared enough to think of anything but those amazing lips on his.</p><p>"You will be mine," Blaise growled out before kissing Harry once more. Pulling away reluctantly from the stunned Gryffindor he brushed his fingers against the back of Harry's cheek in an action that was tender even though his expression never changed before he spun and left the hall.</p><p>"Well that was a little against the normal proceedings," Parvarti giggled getting Harry's attention from the door Blaise had just disappeared through.</p>
