  <i>Many years ago, a group of heroes rose. They met and found their goal by chance. They reached that goal through skill, determination, and perseverance. The chains that bound us were torn down...</i>
</p><p>
  <i>But at what cost?</i>
</p>
<hr/><p>Harry James Potter did not like his dreams. How odd was that? Because what eleven year old child didn't enjoy dreaming? But when those dreams were filled with blood, screams, and poisoned air, it was easy to understand why he wouldn't.</p><p>The dreams of green light were a haven of a respite from the dreams of crimson blood.</p><p>Unfortunately, this night was not a respite. Harry jolted upright out of bed, his heart racing. Once more he had fallen down into poison among the ruins of a city.</p><p>Harry half expected to reach up and have his hand hit the bottom of the stairs but that was not the case. He shook his head. He still wasn't used to sleeping in the second bedroom, even if it had been almost a month since the whole debacle with his birthday and Hogwarts letter.</p><p>In only days he'd been packing up his things into his Uncle Vernon's car and be heading to Hogwarts. For almost a whole year he'll be free from the Dursleys. Maybe he'll finally be able to find out why he had those dreams.</p><p>It had to do with magic, right? No one else his age at school ever had dreams like him (as far he was aware). They were all non-magical...so it must be something to do with magic.</p><p>Either way, Harry needed a drink of water.</p><p>Slipping out of bed, he tip-toed out of the bedroom and down the stairs. Harry was careful to avoid the squeaky step. He didn't want to wake the Dursleys.</p><p>He turned the cold water on and filled up a cup of water. Turning, he leaned against the kitchen counter as he sipped from the cup.</p><p>The Dursley house was somewhat unnerving during the night. No matter how many times Harry had snuck through the house during the night, it never changed. The ominous feeling of being watched was always on him.</p><p>Harry paused.</p><p>He was likely being paranoid...but what if that was magic too? Harry didn't know anything about magic. For all he knew everyone who was magic had that feeling at night.</p><p>Maybe he should look in his textbooks for an answer...it wasn't like he was going to be able to sleep tonight.</p><p>Filling his cup back up, Harry retreated to the bedroom, intent on researching anything he could on dreams and magic.</p>

  <b>According to scholars of old, dream magic was highly specialized. Many of the users would try to scry for the future through it while others were content with reliving moments from the past.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>There are many theories on why knowledge of dream magic was lost. The most popular is that the two groups, one that scried for the future and the one who relived the past, came to blows and all practitioners were killed.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Far more likely is that dream magic at the time was outlawed for being too dangerous to teach young witches and wizards. This could result in very few people being interested in it when they came of age and thus it died out from lack of knowledgeable user.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>In this day and age, the Department of Mysteries in the Ministry of Magic are researching dream magic. How they are doing it or why is currently unknown.</b>

<hr/><p>This was not okay.</p><p>The Dursleys had left, the platform for Hogwarts was nowhere to be found, and he was pretty sure the attendants thought he was crazy. The other people in the station probably also thought he was crazy but that was neither here nor there.</p><p>He tapped his fingers against the cart, feeling hopeless. Hedwig hooted at him, her big eyes watching him. It seemed liek she was begging him to be let out.</p><p>Harry shook his head.</p><p>A sad hoot came from the snowy owl, her claws clicking as she shifted on the stand.</p><p>Before he got a chance to scold Hedwig (they were getting enough look without her looking like he plucked her feathers) a woman's voice cut through the din. Harry's head snapped up at the mention of muggle. That could only mean...The woman must be a witch!</p><p>For a brief moment he wondered if he wanted to approach a complete stranger and then realized he'd already done that. Granted, those strangers had been attendants but he had done it anyway.</p><p>He shuffled his feet before pushing the cart forward. "Excuse me...?" Harry leaned back as the entire family turned to look at him, save for the oldest boy, who had already vanished into the stone barrier. Three pairs of brown eyes and two blue bored into him. </p><p>The woman broke the tension. "Yes, dear? Is there something I can help you with?" Harry tore his gaze from the younger members of the family to survey the woman. Her clothes were patched but not in the 'I'm so poor I can't buy new clothes' way but more in a quaint stylish way. Her red hair would stand out in a crowd--if that crowd didn't have equally red hair.</p><p>It just so happened, that the rest of the family also had red hair like hers.</p><p>"Ah, well..." Harry stuttered as he thought about how to answer the woman's question. "I was wondering if you might know how to onto platform nine and three quarters?" He tugged at his too-large shirt, worried. Maybe he was wrong?</p><p>Her smile eased his worried away. "Ah, so you're a first year? It's Ron's first year too." Harry's eyes flicked to the shortest of the three boys. 'Ron' was the lanky one and the only one of the boys to have blue eyes. The woman spoke again, drawing Harry's attention. "Fred, would you show him how to go through?"</p><p>"Mum, I'm George."</p><p>"Alright, George, will you show him how to get through?"</p><p>"Just kidding, I am Fred!"</p><p>The woman gave Fred a sharp look and he waved his hands in front of him as if to protect himself. Without another word, he saluted Harry and ran into the barrier. Like the older brother, he vanished from sight. George copied Fred's salute and followed Fred through the barrier.</p><p>Harry looked up at the woman. She smiled back. "And that is how it's done."</p><p>Glancing at the last two kids, he nodded and said, "Okay. Thank you." Harry gripped the handles of his trolley before kicking forward. He ran and ran, his eyes closed, waiting to hit the barrier. But he didn't. Instead he almost ran into a family of four on the other side of the barrier.</p><p>Apologizing rapidly, Harry turned his gaze to the platform. The people, the sights, the smells...he lost himself in the grandeur of the new world.</p>
