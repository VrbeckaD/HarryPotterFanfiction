  <strong>Seen my share of Broken Halo's </strong><br/>
<strong>Folded wings that used to fly</strong><br/>
<strong>They've all gone wherever they go</strong><br/>
<strong>Broken Halo's that used to shine</strong>

</p><p>It had been 7 years since Hermione last walked these hallowed halls that were Hogwarts. Though in truth they were now unrecognizable due to the damage that had been done to the ancient castle during the battle of Hogwarts, where so many had lost their lives. The castle had of course been rebuilt but not in the same manner and which it was originally erected. Both familiar and unfamiliar portraits littered the walls along with tapestries decorating the way as she strode towards the headmistress's office.</p><p>Minerva had requested that Hermione returned while Madam Pince was on Sabbatical. The vivacious Gryffindor was the only person she would entrust her precious library to while she was away. Everyone had assumed that Hermione would follow in Ron and Harry's footsteps and take a job at the ministry perhaps as an Auror, or in one of the other departments fighting for muggles or magical creatures as she had always so passionately done. The war had done more damage to her than even she was willing to it admit.</p><p>She hadn't had a peaceful night's rest since she was 16 years old and often relied on Dreamless sleep, a highly addictive potion that wasn't suggested to be used more than 3 days in a row; and only while a person was in times of grief much like drug muggle drug xanax. Though even the healers seemed to be more lax in prescribing it these days than they used to be. So she tried not to see it as what it really was an Addiction.</p><p>She often found herself unable to sleep without the potion, and had spent many a sleepless night researching. While she was at University getting a dual master's degree in both potions and charms she had created a scar reduction cream that had thankfully erased the vicious word that had been carved into her arm by Bellatrix Lestrange and was quite the wealthy witch before she was even halfway through school.</p><p>She had taken her time going through school and even obtained an associate’s degree in library science, another thing that assisted in qualifying her for the position she was being asked to fill. As successful she had been in school and in the one cream she had produced Hermione Granger was for lack of a better word, a mess.</p><p>The scar reduction cream only work for the scars that were present on the skin not the ones that were left on the mind. She had once been full of life, her smile could light up any room. But that smile had been gone for a long time now. It had left her when the shell shock of everything she had gone through and done had finally worn off and she had found herself halfway through her potions mastery, and all alone seeing as how life has seemingly become to busy for Ron and Harry to write her back.</p><p>Severus watched as she walked by him, taking in the slow steps and haunted appearance. Her molten amber eyes that had once shined so bright as they burned held no light in them. Even her curls that had once bushed off her head in disarray now hung down her back in loose ringlets as if they too had lost their will to live. From his discussion with Minerva earlier that morning it had been quite a task convincing Miss. Granger to return to Hogwarts. That she with all her talent had spent the last six months in which she had been put of school shut up inside a hovel of an apartment, despite being able to afford something more luxurious and accommodating for the research everyone has assumed she would pursue.</p><p>It was a crime she hadn’t been sorted into Slytherin due to her blood status. Her cunning and ambition would have been truly been allowed to flourish. Severus could see she was undernourished, and while her clothing was clearly new and seemed clean the wrinkles that encompassed the fabric would astonish those who knew her back in her school days where hers clothes always remained well kept and wrinkle free.</p><p>He could practically see her tattered wings dragging behind her on the floor and her broken halo resting askew atop her head. He felt a kinship to her because he too had been lost after the war after spending so many years believing he was in love with Lily Evans, and trying to protect her son with everything in him. He was finally learning how to live a life with no masters. She may not have given up as much flesh and blood as he had but she had given up her childhood.</p><p>Severus Snape was not a friendly man however looking at this slip of a girl obviously so broken and in need of guidance, He wanted to be. Not just for him, or Minerva who had requested that he attempt to reach out to the girl but for her as well.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
