    <p>Staring at the ceiling proved to be boring. Mainly because, like everything else in this house, it was bland, uninteresting and ‘normal’. Maybe also because he had stared at it so many times, that he knew every single crack by now.</p><p>Harry James Potter was dying from boredom. And also trepidation. He was forcing himself to sleep, to close his eyes and make his mind shut off, but he was too wired up.</p><p>Today was the 30<sup>th</sup> July. And in just a few hours, he was going to turn 15. Which was… well… which was a lot.</p><p>Especially because he was going to get his Soulmate Mark tomorrow.</p><p>Dear Circe.</p><p>His own Soulmate Mark. A small lettering appearing on his skin, telling him who his Soulmate was.</p><p>Everybody looked forward to their 15<sup>th</sup> birthdays. Finding out your Soulmate’s 1<sup>st</sup> words to you, was exciting. Everyone kept saying how becoming 15 was a huge thing and how you stepped out of childhood forever on that day. How you were going to find your soulmate, your significant other, your everything.</p><p>But Harry feared that once he woke up the next day, he wouldn’t find anything. He knew the probability of that happening was extremely small. Only 0,9% of the planet didn’t get a soulmate. But even <em>that</em> was just about <em>77 millions of people.</em></p><p>He had never met someone without a Mark, but he knew how society viewed them. Everyone knew, that if you didn’t get any Mark, you were worthless. The God has not bestowed a Soulmate on you – you were not worthy of one – so how could you be good at anything?</p><p>Once again with the ‘Everyone’s. Merlin, how much he hated those opinions. He hated most of what society thought ‘normal’ and ‘completely acceptable’. Probably because of the Dursleys.</p><p>But even he didn’t want to end up Markless. Even though he himself had nothing against them, he felt sad for them. And truly, he didn’t want to <em>not</em> have a Soulmate.</p><p>He could see it. Everywhere he looked, from everything he’d heard… having a Soulmate was beautiful. Harry had always dreamed of someone taking him away, showing him a nicer place, someone who would understand him and truly love him.</p><p>He didn’t even care who, he just… he just really wanted that.</p><p>But his luck has been the worst, so…</p><p>Harry rolled to his side and closed his eyes.</p><p>He remembered the first time he had seen a Soulmate Mark. He was just about 3, or… maybe 4? He wasn’t sure. Aunt Petunia had been scorning him for dropping one of the cups, even though it hadn’t broken. She had waved her hand around, and Harry noticed a string of an ugly scrawling on her upper arm.</p><p>He’d asked her about it and she’d got a weird expression on her face. It had been the first time he’d seen her blush and the loving look she gave it, freaked him out. “It’s my Soulmate Mark. These are the first words your Uncle has ever said to me. He has mine as well, of course.”</p><p>Harry had peered at it. In the nearly unreadable writing that he later learned to recognized as Uncle Vernon’s stood: <em>Watch where you’re going.</em></p><p>Aunt Petunia had continued. “You get your Mark on your 15<sup>th</sup> birthday. It shows you the greatest person for you…” then she’d sneered, “of course, freaks like you don’t get Soulmates. Now go and clean this up!”</p><p>And that was the end of it. Harry had in later years heard the story of how his relatives had met – they like to say it to everyone who’d listen (with the exception of him, of course) and he overheard them telling it to Dudley.</p><p>It was very mundane, normal and boring – just like that bloody ceiling. They both had been going their ways on a certain street, when they managed to bump into each other. Vernon had been rude - as always – while Petunia had hastily apologized.</p><p><em>Pardon me, sir.</em> Stood on Vernon’s arm. After that, they supposedly let everything go and started to talk, enthralled in themselves.</p><p>Dudley had said it was the most romantic thing he’d ever heard. Harry thought it was the most terrible way of meeting, but whatever. He didn’t really expect more from them, to be honest.</p><p>Dudley had gotten his own Mark a month back. It was heavily anticipated (Harry secretly wished it would be something really dumb) and it turned out to <em>be</em> really dumb. It was a ‘Hello’. <em>Hello.</em></p><p>And his relatives particularly <em>swooned</em> over it. Petunia sobbed at how ‘beautiful' and ‘normal’ and ‘amazing’ it was. Dudley had proudly stated he would tell everyone ‘Hello’ in return, so that his Soulmate will have the same Mark.</p><p>It seemed like neither of them realized ‘Hello’ was the most common word to say when you met someone… so it could be anyone. Like, completely anyone.</p><p>But of course, it was Dudley and whatever was <em>not</em> awesome when it came to him?</p><p>Merlin.</p><p>But yeah, ever since that, Harry’s birthdays were slowly crawling closer and closer and the Dursleys made very sure to tell him, that freaks didn’t get Marks.</p><p>Which was bullshit, really. The whole Wizarding world proudly wore their Marks, but… the Dursleys just liked to torment him. Dudley laughed and poked at him, saying he’ll never get one. Or, that he will but, his Soulmate will be some old granny. Or, heaven forbid, his soulmate will be a boy!</p><p>Because even though the gay couples were <em>soulmates</em>, society still liked to pretend it was highly unnatural and disgusting.</p><p>It belonged to the long list of what Harry hated about the society.</p><p>But not to be <em>too</em> pessimistic, right?</p><p>He closed his eyes, willing himself, to just. Stop. Thinking.</p><p>Maybe it would be a girl. Maybe it would be Cho… only Cho had gotten her Mark last year, and it turned out to be Cedric. And Cedric died…</p><p>He ran his hand through his hair and sat up in frustration. Hedwig hooted from her place. He sighed, gently shushing her, before flopping back down.</p><p>Okay, so what. Maybe he won’t get a Soulmate Mark. It didn’t make him worthless. Only… if he really <em>was</em> that unlovable, then… then…</p><p>
  <em>Just sleep. Worst case it’ll be Malfoy.</em>
</p><p>Harry laughed at himself. And then, finally, <em>finally</em> fell asleep.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>It was Hedwig who woke him up.</p><p>She was sitting on her perch, just as in the night, but there was a bunch of mouse pellets hanging around. Ew.</p><p>Harry yawned, turning around to get back to sleep, when he saw a glimpse of his bare wrist and sprung up.</p><p>He was 15! He got a Soulmate Mark!</p><p>He put his glasses on and frantically started to look himself over. His hands, wrists, fingers, forearms, <em>backs</em> of forearms, elbows, upper arms. Nothing.</p><p>Right, the place of your Mark was supposed to be significant, somehow. For a lot of people, it was the place their Soulmate first touched them.</p><p>No wonder a lot of Marks were on hands, people shook them all the time.</p><p>But that was not the case for Harry. Alright. Legs.</p><p>He checked the thighs, back of them, calves, knees, ankles, even between his fingers and his panic was steadily growing bigger and bigger.</p><p>Okay, wait, maybe his chest. He quickly shed the t-shirt and silently prayed to whoever was up there. <em>Please be there, please be there.</em></p><p>But it wasn’t. His chest was empty. Okay. Okay, maybe… right! It could be on his neck or face, where he couldn’t see it.</p><p>So he rushed to the bathroom, and started to look himself over. Inches and inches of bare skin stared back and nothing…</p><p>And then he came to his face. He lifted his bangs and… oh.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>No, no, no, no, no.</p><p>Fuck, why him?</p><p>Harry <em>had</em> indeed found his Mark.</p><p>But now he just wished he hadn’t.</p><p>It had to be his scar. Of course it had to be his scar.</p><p>Right over it, in line with his hairline, were two words written in neat, beautiful cursive. A very familiar handwriting to Harry, after all, he had spent few days writing back and forth with the diary.</p><p>
  <em>Avada Kedavra. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Avada Kedavra.</em>
</p><p>For Merlin’s sake, could he go and die? Maybe if he Avada Kedavrad himself, it would work…</p><p>Jesus Fucking Christ.</p><p>People have spent their entire <em>lives</em> trying to find their soulmates. There were even dating services for it!</p><p>But no, Harry had the fortune of knowing <em>exactly</em> who his soulmate was.</p><p>Because it was none other than Lord Voldemort. AKA Tom Marvolo Riddle. AKA, the guy that killed his parents and tried to murder him on every occasion he got!</p><p>Harry was truly and utterly <em>fucked.</em></p><p>His legs gave up, and he crumpled down to his knees, still clutching the sink. This was bad. This was… really, really bad.</p><p>If anyone found out… He didn’t even want to think about that.</p><p>He should be happy about even <em>having</em> a Soulmate. It meant there was someone for him. Who would love him.</p><p>But that same person had tried to kill him.</p><p>Voldemort had been doing his best to take his life at every opportunity he got. His Soulmate – his <em>own</em> Soulmate – was trying to murder him. He killed his parents. And countless others.</p><p>And that was a whole other thing. Lord Voldemort was insane. He was a megalomaniac. A <em>psychopath.</em> Crazy, cruel, not far from becoming a monster.</p><p>Scratch that – he already <em>was</em> a monster. That <em>thing</em> that came out of the cauldron could not be described as anything else. He killed Cedric. He used the Cruciatus on Harry.</p><p>And this person – this emotionless creature – was supposed to be his Soulmate.</p><p>Harry could only laugh. Laugh at the <em>irony</em> of it. The Boy Who Lived and the Dark Lord, sworn enemies, people on completely other sides of the war… were Soulmates.</p><p>Was he <em>that</em> unlovable? Was he <em>that</em> unworthy of anything else? Was he really such a terrible, useless person that he <em>deserved</em> a soulless monster for a lover?</p><p>Soulmates were supposed to be… the same. Heavily similar. Yin and Yang. Teacups and plates. Complimenting each other, clicking together like puzzle pieces.</p><p>He and Voldemort were the exact opposites. Harry was a Gryffindor, a teenager and absolutely <em>not</em> in favour of killing and murdering. Voldemort was a Slytherin, he was very much insane and also just about 50 years older than him.</p><p>And Harry had been worrying about it being Malfoy! Circe…</p><p>What was he going to do?</p><p>He gritted his teeth and stood up. His Mark was staring back at him from the mirror and he couldn’t help but touch it. It pleasantly tingled, happily humming beneath his fingertips.</p><p>It wasn’t too visible, thankfully. If one wasn’t looking too closely at his scar, they wouldn’t even notice. And he was already used to wear his hair over it so… good.</p><p>At least one thing wasn’t screwed up.</p><p>But somehow, even though it horrified him to think <em>who</em> was his Soulmate, he somehow wanted to… keep touching it. Marvelling at it and at how <em>pretty </em>and <em>elegant</em> that handwriting was, he never noticed it before but… Tom really <em>did</em> have a nice handwriting…</p><p>His thoughts wandered off to Tom Riddle. To a 16 year-old, beautiful, charming, witty Tom Riddle. The one that he had spent days writing to.</p><p>Harry had never allowed himself to admit it. Every time the theme came up, he quickly reminded himself who Tom was, and thought about something else. But… well…</p><p>He would be a fool, if he couldn’t admit that he had a crush on the older boy. Before the whole ‘I’m actually Voldemort and want to kill you’ thing happened, he genuinely <em>liked</em> Tom. He admired him.</p><p>He had liked the intelligent teenager and their long debates.</p><p>Of course, at first Harry didn’t think he’d spent much time writing to the diary. After the first day, he put it in his truck and told himself he’d let it be. Until… well until he pulled it out next day, curiosity making him write to Tom, to try to understand what had happened with Hagrid.</p><p>And they wrote. For days. Days, upon days, upon weeks. Until the diary went missing. It did sadden Harry, but then other things happened, so he let it be.</p><p>Maybe that’s why the betrayal stung even more. Because he <em>liked</em> Not-Voldemort Tom. He liked the boy before. They spent a long time debating about certain things, or spells or social stuff. And Tom was always understanding, helpful and a complete smart ass, but Harry liked it.</p><p>The thought of this Tom, this guy that never became Voldemort, becoming his Soulmate, made his chest fill with warm.</p><p>He knew that was unreal, because that Tom was just an act, but… but still… Harry wouldn’t be against it. There, he said it. He wouldn’t mind dating Tom Riddle. Jesus…</p><p>But reality was different. Tom Riddle had gone insane. He became a Dark Lord and started to slaughter innocents. He also looked like a snake and didn’t have a nose.</p><p>(Not like Harry particularly cared about how people looked like, but Voldemort was literally giving him nightmares.)</p><p>He ran a hand through his hair and let out a short laugh. What was he even thinking about?</p><p>Dear Morgana, he should just stop. He had been a foolish 12 year-old back then, but then again, all 12 year-olds were foolish. And Tom Riddle was too charming for Harry to resist and not get a massive crush on.</p><p>He should probably stop thinking about that. Yeah. Alright.</p><p>He went back to his room and pulled his shirt on.</p><p>He looked around the room and at Hedwig and felt a pang of pain at not seeing any letters. Anywhere.</p><p>Same as this whole summer.</p><p>He didn’t like thinking about it and Morgana forbid if Dudley were to find out.</p><p>But it still stung.</p><p>His friends hadn’t written him all summer. Nothing from Ron, Hermione or even Sirius. Nothing. Not even a simple hello. He had written them all summer. Sending letters after letters and Hedwig always came back, letter-less, but with no reply.</p><p>Harry had thought that they would at least send something for his birthday. Maybe a birthday card. That would truly be enough for him.</p><p>But all summer… just radio silence.</p><p>Like in the summer after first year, but this time, it was worse. Worse, because not only was he currently dealing with awful nightmares, but due to not receiving any news from them, he had no contact with the wizarding world. Which meant he had no idea what was going on there, which also meant he had no knowledge about Voldemort’s actions.</p><p>With the Dark Lord getting resurrected, he could be doing Merlin knows what and Harry had no way of knowing. He had sent letters full of questions, desperate cries for information, that he was sorely not getting.</p><p>Also, with Hedwig coming back empty-handed – or clawed, in her case – it meant that his letters <em>were</em> getting received. His friends just weren’t replying…</p><p>Not even Sirius. Not even his Godfather, had written <em>anything</em> to him.</p><p>Wasn’t <em>that</em> reassuring, huh?</p><p>He guessed he should have expected it, after the month of nothing, but still… yeah.</p><p>Not even Neville had replied to him yet – he had sent the boy a birthday card, the day before. But… well, Neville lived a long distance away, so maybe the reply just didn’t come yet.</p><p>Staring at the bed just made him depressed. So he pulled on some outside clothes – all baggy, because, well, he didn’t have anything else – and walked out.</p><p>Fortune had it that he managed to avoid everyone else in the house. Thank Circe. He truly didn’t believe he could deal with Dudley’s jabs right now. Or Petunia’s ordering. Or Vernon’s stupid jokes he <em>had</em> to laugh at.</p><p>He <em>despised</em> the house. He abhorred it with every sense of his being.</p><p>So he walked out and started to wander about around Little Whinging.</p><p>He did it often this summer – Harry took every chance he could, to get out of Number 4. His mind was swirling with thoughts.</p><p>It had been a big pole in the Wizarding world, passed through whispered giggles and between friends, but never in public serious media.</p><p>Did He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named have a Soulmate?</p><p>Many people liked to believe the answer to be negative. Harry himself hoped that would be the case, because if such a twisted bastard like <em>him</em> got a Soulmate, while so many nice people stayed alone, the world would really be a fucked up place.</p><p>But apparently… yeah. Old Voldy got a Soulmate.</p><p>It might be better if he never got to know.</p><p>He thought about what <em>Voldemort’s </em>Mark was. Harry couldn’t clearly remember what he had told him when they met.</p><p>Now that he was thinking about it… yeah, Voldemort was mocking his parents for protecting him and, yeah, Harry probably told him he was a liar or that it wasn’t true or something like that.</p><p>Ha, wouldn’t it be funny to have a big <strong>SHUT UP </strong>in a very visible place? Voldy would certainly deserve it.</p><p>Well… probably better than having <em>the killing curse</em> on your face.</p><p>Harry walked up to a playground and sat down on one of the swings. It was still pretty early in the morning and quite chilly, which meant there weren’t many kids around. It was just him and an old lady with her 5-year-old grandson.</p><p>He sighed. How did he even get into this mess?</p><p>Maybe it wasn’t Voldemort. Maybe someone else will come up to him and jokingly say that. But that would be really shitty. And who would <em>do</em> something like that? There was only one person who had ever tried to kill him and that was Lord Voldemort.</p><p>Harry sighed again.</p><p>He wondered what he should tell people. They were going to ask – everyone always asked. He couldn’t just straight up tell them his Soulmate was the Dark Lord. The <em>Daily Prophet</em> would have a field day.</p><p>Maybe he should tell Ron and Hermione that he didn’t have a Soulmate… but wait. Those two didn’t talk to him. Right.</p><p>But still, the idea had its merits. Not having a Soulmate was terrible and he knew he’d get a backlash for it, but it was better than telling the truth.</p><p>Hm, or maybe he could write something on his arm – something really common like <em>Your eyes are so pretty, </em>or <em>Hi, how are you?</em> Something that would make the world believe he was looking for his significant other, rather than question why he was alone.</p><p>Deep in his thoughts, the Boy Who Lived didn’t notice someone closing in. It was only after a moment, that he heard a creaking noise.</p><p>Harry quickly stood up, reaching for his wands. Then he cursed himself. He had forgotten it in his room!</p><p>He scanned the area, looking for danger. Something cold suddenly touched his neck. Harry flinched back, but black-gloved hands grabbed him and the tip of the wand pressed further.</p><p>The last thing Harry heard was a raspy “Stupefy”, before the world turned pitch black.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>Harry woke up in a bed. It was a nice bed, soft and comfy and he snuggled further into the inviting warmness. His bed at the Dursleys was way worse than this, yeah, this bed was nice – wait.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>He sprung up, looking around. This was indeed not his bed at Number 4, neither the one at Hogwarts.</p><p>Harry found himself in a cell. A dark, cold, rectangular room with walls made from stone. There was the bed, a chair and a tiny toilet. On the wall over him, was a small window and the wall opposite it was made completely out of bars.</p><p>He quickly stood up, his heart beating in his chest. This was prison. This was a holding cell!</p><p>Someone kidnapped him. Yes, that’s it, someone must have kidnapped him. He remembered the raspy voice and black clothes the attacker wore.</p><p>Death Eaters.</p><p>Oh no…</p><p>If it was them – because who else –, then it meant, he had been taken by Voldemort.</p><p>What if… What if the other man <em>knew? </em>What if he knew Harry was his Soulmate? He had his own Mark after all – maybe he realized back when they first met and now he was just waiting for Harry’s 15<sup>th</sup> birthdays.</p><p>Oh, no, no, no, no, no.</p><p>This was bad. This was really, really bad.</p><p>If the madman knew… Merlin knew what he would do to Harry. What if he decided to take Harry prisoner and keep him here for the rest of his life? In this dingy little prison with no light and only one chair?</p><p>He quickly ran to the bars, trying to open them. Nothing. The door was locked.</p><p>The Chosen One started to pace. He had to get out. Preferably before anyone came by to check on him.</p><p>Somebody would notice he was missing, right? The Dursleys would be relieved and not care, but… maybe someone <em>will</em> eventually write to him and they’ll realize he’s not there and they’ll come for him. They will. Absolutely. Because if not, then –</p><p>“Oh, you’re up!”</p><p>Harry quickly spun around. Someone was standing right outside his cell.</p><p>The person was clothed in black robes, a grey shirt and a pair of black pants. They held a lit lantern in their right hand. By the sound of it, it was a man.</p><p>Harry squinted at the face and found himself staring at a familiar smirk he’d last seen only a month ago.</p><p>“Barty Crouch Jr?” He breathed out in disbelief.</p><p>“Yep,” the Death Eater popped out the ‘p’, “that’d be me. Good thing you’re up, Potter.”</p><p>Harry took a step back. “You’re supposed to be dead. They caught you – “</p><p>“I escaped Azkaban; you think a bunch of professors would stop me?” Barty seemed very proud of himself.</p><p>Harry frowned. “Why am I here? What do you want with me?”</p><p>To his surprise, Barty shrugged. “Who knows. But come with me,” he unlocked the door, “the Dark Lord is waiting.”</p><p>Harry stared at the open door. “Voldemort? I-I’m not coming.”</p><p>“Jesus… Kid, if he wanted you dead, you’d already <em>be</em> dead.” He said.</p><p>The Boy Who Lived looked back at the tiny cell. He didn’t like the idea of walking out with a Death Eater – especially if this one was supposed to lead him to Voldemort – but he knew that this could be his chance at escaping.</p><p>So he adjusted his glasses and carefully walked out of the cell.</p>
