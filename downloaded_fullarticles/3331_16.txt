    <p>He was sleeping, he thinks, but now he isn't. Molly's here and he must have got up to open the door because…well, because he's up and she's here. She's saying something, and he's not quite sure how long she's been talking for, but he's pleased to see her. He's always liked her, with her round, expressive face and her impetuous temper.
</p><p>
'Sirius fancied you,' he says. 'Did he ever tell you that? Of course he was twelve and you were twenty two, so it would never have worked out. Well…' He considers. 'Not for you. I guess it worked out for me, didn't it?'<br/>
There's something wrong with that but he can't quite remember what. And anyway he gets distracted because someone behind Molly makes a choked sound.<br/>
'Remus, are you <em>drunk?'</em><br/>
<em>'Tonks!'  </em>he says, delighted. He likes her too. He <em>really</em> does. Sirius doesn't but that's because he - he's not -
</p><p>
Remus must have had a bad dream before he woke because there's something horrible lurking at the corner of his consciousness. But he shakes it off.
</p><p>
Where was he? Sirius doesn't like Tonks, but that's because Sirius is an idiot. Always was. Doesn't understand how beautiful he is, that he could have anyone he wants. It's just as well for Remus really, but then again it's not. Because (has he mentioned?) Sirius is an <em>idiot</em>. As if Remus would ever, apart from that <em>one time</em>, and that was - well, that was different because -
</p><p>'I can't <em>bear</em> this,' Tonks blurts.<br/>
'What's that spell?' Molly asks. 'Antioxidasomething, we used to use it all the time before the children were born. Antioxi…Antitoxi…<em>damn</em> it.'</p><p>
Remus realises, all of a sudden, what she's about. Backs away, palms raised. 'No. Molly. Not that.'<br/>
She frowns at him. 'Remus, it doesn't hurt.'<br/>
'It does.' He knots his brows, needing to explain to her the absolute importance of something he can't quite grasp himself.  'Hurts,' he tells her, 'if I'm not drunk.'
</p><p>
'Oh Merlin,' Tonks whispers.<br/>
'Remus,' Molly says gently, 'you can't stay drunk for the rest of your life.'
</p><p>
But what does she know? He did pretty well last time, didn't he? Three years straight without a sober moment, after the war ended. After James and Lily died and they sent Sirius to -
</p><p>
<em>To Azkaban.</em>
</p><p>
Is that where Sirius is? Because it wasn't Sirius's fault. It was Peter's, he remembers that quite distinctly. So Peter should be in Azkaban and…<em>where is Sirius? </em>Sirius should be here, safe with Remus, and something must have gone terribly wrong because he<em> isn't</em>…
</p><p>
He must have lost track of time because he seems to be sitting on the floor. Someone is sobbing harshly, and Tonks is saying in an anguished voice, 'Molly, we have to make this <em>stop</em>.'
</p><p>
And then Molly says<em> 'Soporificus,' </em>and everything goes quiet and dark.
