    <strong>Prelude</strong>
  </u>
</p>
<p align="justify">Her heart was thumping so loudly she was almost deaf to the sounds of the Snatchers chasing her. She was almost deaf to the sounds of her two companions as they ran either side of her. She was almost deaf to the sounds of spells being fired in rapid succession. Almost. But almost wasn't good enough. She could still hear it all, it was simply muffled by her beating heart and the blood rushing through her body.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Wild red curls were singed and mattered; a combination of barely dodged spells and weeks on the run. They were three, high value targets who the Snatchers were eager to get their hands on. They knew what it would mean too. If they were captured, they'd be killed but not before they were very publicly tortured. The Snatchers would take them to the Death Eaters who would happily make an example out of them to whoever was left to oppose them.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Her russet brown eyes scanned the wooded area rapidly, searching for anything that could help them. Her mind worked quickly, playing through every possible scenario in the span of a few seconds before she came to one conclusion. They were totally screwed if they didn't do what needed to be done soon.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Rose!"</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">She barely had a moment to register his voice before she was being shoved out of the way of a Sectasempra that would have torn her in two.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"No!"</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Alice's scream sent a cold sliver of ice straight to Rose's chest. She knew just how close the two of them were; if he was hurt, Alice would quickly become distracted. In this world, distractions got you killed.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Rose turned on her heels, her wand tightly clutched in her hand as she raised it in the direction of the Snatchers.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Protego Maxima!" she yelled, barely paying attention to the silver bubble that erected around them. Alice was already on her knees beside him and Rose didn't hesitate to fall beside the both of them. "James?" she asked, watching as her cousin looked around blearily before his green eyes zeroed in on her.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Alice was already casting the counter curse, waving her wand and almost singing the counter curse as her eyes teared up and those tears fell onto James' dirty face. He'd live, they both knew he would. Each of them bore scars from one curse or another, curses that should have killed them but hadn't.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"We need to do it now," Rose gasped, her hand reaching into her jacket pocket as the Snatchers threw curse after curse at her shield. Her hand wrapped around cool metal and she quickly pulled out the small time-turner they had stolen from the Department of Mysteries only a few short hours ago.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"If we do it now, it could kill him!" Alice protested, her wand movements stilling as she finished the counter curse.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"If we wait, <em>they'll </em>kill all of us," Rose retorted as she extended the time-turner chain and threw it around Alice's neck before gently lifting James' head to put it around his neck too. "Remember," she began, pointing her wand at the shield and non-verbally strengthening it as she felt the Snatchers begin to tear it down. "This isn't like other time-turners," she continued, "it won't just take us back, it'll completely fracture this timeline and it'll take us to our closest blood relatives. We have no idea where we're going, or what situation we'll be falling into. Constant Vigilance."</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">James was groaning pitifully, his eyes closed and his breathing laboured. He was pale and sweating and Rose cursed that she had lost her beaded bag; the bag that had all their supplies including the blood replenishing potions. There was nothing more they could do to help James and she just had to hope he appeared next to someone that could help him.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Rose had just started turning the time-turner when she felt a particularly strong spell decimate her shield. She knew she couldn't fight, she needed to make sure they got where they needed to go. Besides, Alice was here and she and James were the better duellers; Rose was the brains, she had always been the brains.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Stupify! Reducto! Bombarda!" Alice yelled in quick succession, sending out a few non-verbal curses after it as the Snatchers deflected her verbal ones. Rose didn't even wince when she saw one of the Snatchers exploded, his blood splattering his three companions as he did.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">"Crucio!"</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Rose felt her eyes well up as Alice moved to take the curse that was aimed at her, her body stiffening and bending at odd angles as she bit her lip. All of them had been under the cruciatus curse at one point or another in their lives but it was hard to build up an immunity to something that changed in intensity depending on the witch or wizard casting it. Alice didn't scream and Rose continued to turn the time-turner furiously. She needed to get them out of there. Even with as strong as Alice was, no one could stand being under the cruciatus curse for extended periods of time.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Even with the pain coursing through her body, Alice somehow found the strength to raise her wand and Rose felt the heat of the Fiendfyre leaving her best friend's wand. Screams filled the air and Rose almost gagged as the smell of burning flesh reached her nose. Alice had fallen unconscious on James' body and Rose knew if this didn't work, they would die here tonight. The Snatchers may not kill them but the Fiendfyre would.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">She felt the flames lick her skin just as she released the dial and the time-turner began to turn. The fiery lion reared its head and with a mighty roar, pounced on the three teenagers.</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">Only to meet thin air as they vanished into the past.</p>
