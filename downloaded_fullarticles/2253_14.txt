    <p>Jane bit her lip. She had made a terrible miscalculation. Her eyes flicked to the watch on her wrist to check how much longer class was going to go.</p>
<p><em>Fuck me</em>, she thought. Half an hour left. She wasn’t sure she was going to make it.</p>
<p>Crossing her legs, hoping in vain it might help in some way, Jane took a deep breath. She’d had to pee for what felt like forever. Her bladder ached, despite her clenched thighs and feeble attempts to ignore it.</p>
<p><em>Why didn’t I just go before class? I should have known better</em>. Even though she silently berated herself, she knew the reason why she was in this situation. There was a weird pleasure she felt in feeling full. The sort of feeling that, for some reason, reminded her of sex. She’d always liked to hold it if she could, wait as long as possible before giving in to her need for release.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she had finally found herself in a situation which was becoming increasingly uncomfortable and was pushing her to her limits.</p>
<p>Jane’s fingers tightened on her quill as she continued to dutifully copy out her notes onto the parchment. No matter how distressed she was becoming, she knew she couldn’t show it. She was seventeen, for fucks sake. There is no reason she should squirm in her seat like a toddler, even if she wanted to. Thankfully, all those years in Slytherin meant she had pretty good control over her outward appearance. She would not, for any reason, betray her discomfort.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes to go. Jane wished for a second for the possibility to get out early from class, but this was Potions, and there was no way Professor Snape would ever let them out even a minute before class was due to end. And she also knew there was no chance of ducking out to use the bathroom before then. Snape might be her Head of House, but he was still strict about the rules.</p>
<p>Although, she mused, it was good that this particular class period was lecture-based instead of hands-on. There was no way she would be able to move around, stand up, or do anything that might be required in order to brew a potion. She could just imagine it, leaving her seat to fetch an ingredient and involuntarily releasing a flood of piss down her legs. Or maybe it would just leak out slowly, a little bit every time she moved, until the urine had soaked her panties and began to drip down the insides of her thighs. <em>No, best not to think about that. </em>Just be grateful this class required nothing of her but sitting in her seat and writing down the information relayed.</p>
<p>Ten minutes. Almost there. Time seemed to be passing so slowly. It felt like every tick of the second hand on her watch matched a pulse in her bladder, constantly reminding her of her dilemma.</p>
<p>A few more lines of notes. A few more minutes. Jane rearranged her legs, crossing them the other way. Was that a little dampness she felt drip out of her, or was she imagining it? She squeezed her legs together a bit tighter.</p>
<p>A couple more minutes to go. For all that she knew she couldn’t piss herself in class, the thought of it kind of excited her. It would be embarrassing, for sure. Completely humiliating. But the picture conjured in her mind still made her heart quicken, her stomach tighten and warm. Maybe it wasn’t pee dampening her underwear, maybe she just got off on the idea of making a mess where and when she knew she shouldn’t, doing something simultaneously childish and wrong.</p>
<p>Snape dismissed them. Thank fucking god. However, Jane knew she couldn’t jump up and rush out of there to the nearest bathroom. That would be too obvious, too immature. She had a reputation to uphold. So, even though every second longer she took was a risk, Jane forced herself to remain seated and calmly, carefully, pack up her bag.</p>
<p>Time to get up. This was the part she was really worried about. Until now she had felt fairly confident she could hold it, as long as she didn’t move. But now, with how insistent the urge to go was, how desperate she felt, Jane wasn’t sure she was going to be able to hold it in.</p>
<p>Well, if she sat there much longer, she was definitely going to make a mess. Quickly standing up, Jane reflexively tightened her leg muscles, hoping her uniform skirt would hide the fact that she was clenching her thighs together as best as she could. </p>
<p>She forced herself to walk at a normal pace towards the door. There was a bathroom just down the hall. Hardly anyone used it, if she could just get inside the door she could make a mad dash to one of the stalls. She felt like every step she took caused the ocean inside her bladder to come just that much closer to bursting out of her.</p>
<p>Jane made it halfway down the hall before her control over her muscles began to give. She felt a quick squirt of pee slip out of her, soaking her panties. With great effort, she kept a straight face and an even stride. Her skirt would hide it. She was so close. She wasn’t going to lose control a couple feet from the bathroom. But it felt like she wasn’t going to have much of a choice in that. She was beginning to doubt her ability to make it inside even the bathroom itself, let alone into a stall with enough time to get her underwear down. She’d have to be quick.</p>
<p>By the time Jane reached the door of the bathroom, a little trickle of warmth was slowly making its way down her leg. She didn’t think anyone would notice, but this was a ridiculously close call. <em>Please, please, please be empty</em>, she begged as she pushed open the door to the bathroom.</p>
<p>It was. Closing it quickly behind her, Jane relinquished any thought of making it to a stall and simply leaned back against the door, ensuring it would stay shut at she closed her eyes and finally let go.</p>
<p>It was bliss. Jane felt the piss flow out of her in a hot rush, her aching bladder muscles completely relaxing. She felt the wetness soak her panties and slide down her thighs, so she spread her legs wider and hitched up her skirt to try and prevent some of the damage.</p>
<p>Piss splashed on the floor as she leaned her head back against the door, sighing with the satisfaction of finally being able to let go. Her eyes closed as she listened to the sound of her stream hitting the tiles, enjoying the feeling of the release. The absolute pleasure she felt at the moment caused her legs to tremble slightly as she continued to pour the contents of her bladder onto the floor.</p>
<p>Her eyes fluttered open as she felt the last of it begin to drain out of her. She looked down at herself. She looked a mess, really, with her skirt clenched in her fists and held up around her waist, her panties soaked through, thighs slick, a huge puddle of piss spreading between her shoes. But she felt amazing.</p>
<p>As the last few dribbles of her pee fell into the pool beneath her, Jane recognized the desire that had been mounting in her belly during the incident for what it was. She now craved a different kind of release. One of her hands crept down between her legs, brushing over her warm, wet panties. She bit her lip and ground her palm over herself, stimulating her clit and causing a whole new kind of wetness seep out and her knees to tremble.</p>
<p>But no. There was no way Jane was going to masturbate out in the open in the middle of a girl’s bathroom while standing over a puddle of her own piss. She’d spent too long in here already, it was too much of a risk. Dropping her skirt and stepping away from the puddle, she gathered herself. A few waves of her wand and a couple murmured spells cleaned up the mess and made her presentable again. Magic really was useful.</p>
<p>As Jane stepped out of the bathroom and began making her way to her common room, she took stock of what she knew and needed to do next.</p>
<p>First, she needed to get fucked. Whether she took care of that herself or found someone else to help her out depended mostly on convenience at this point. All she knew was that she needed something to ease the new need she was feeling.</p>
<p>Then, she needed to figure out a way to be able to do something like that again, but hopefully with a bit less risk involved. A smile curled at her lips and she began to make her plans.</p>
