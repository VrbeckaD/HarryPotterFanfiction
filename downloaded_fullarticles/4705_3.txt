    <p>
  <span>Dishes clattered in the sink while steam fogged the kitchen window. Hermione scraped burnt rice out of a pot and into the garbage bin. The television was on in the living room, and occasional laughter drifted into the kitchen.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Back at the sink, Hermione plunged the heavy pot into the bubbles. Water splashed onto her shoe, but she didn't notice. Her mind was elsewhere.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was at King's Cross station,.to be exact, only two weeks prior. The Hogwarts Express was emptying for the summer months. She was saying goodbye to Harry and Ron, hugging Ginny, and almost missed waving goodbye to Neville as his Gran tugged him across the platform. Hermione's parents arrived and had begun walking her back to the car. She realized time was up, and something exploded inside. She turned around and ran back toward the Weasley's, almost knocking into Colin Creevy on the way.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>None of them seemed to notice at first. Which was for the better, because next moment she was tugging on Fred's arm. He turned to look at her, his face breaking into a smile. When he stopped walking, the whole Weasley family stopped too. Hermione felt humiliation burn her cheeks. The entire platform was watching to see what was so important it required a sprint.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I-I-I, I'll miss you all. Have a great summer.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A chorus of “You too!” split the awkward silence. They gave her more waves goodbye and turned away to continue across the platform. Mrs. Weasley smiled so brightly, Hermione felt like she must've known something was up.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione sighed into the bubbles, and scrubbed more aggressively at the very stuck, very burnt rice in the bottom of the pot.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Why </span>
  <em>
    <span>then</span>
  </em>
  <span>? Of all the times for her to realize she liked Fred, why then? And why had she been so awkward about it?!</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She scrubbed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And what exactly was she supposed to do when she got back to school? He was two years older! They didn't have class together. He was always busy either with Quidditch or Detention. They didn't have anything in common! Because of Ron, they saw each other here and there. But he was usually busy making jokes with George and Lee.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She scrubbed harder.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She felt incredibly frustrated. Why couldn't she get a crush on someone like… like Neville. She was pretty certain he liked her already. But the thought of going out with him just… didn't… quite… work in her mind. He was really nice! But she couldn't honestly say she wanted to be his girlfriend.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>However, when Hermione found herself thinking back to stealing Polyjuice Potion ingredients with Fred, she felt glowy and wiggly inside. She had to try really hard not to over-romanticize their carriage ride on the way to Hogwarts at the beginning of the school year.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Maybe she could owl someone? Definitely not Ron or Harry. She supposed Lavender would know about this stuff. But then of course telling Lavender would mean telling just about everyone.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“If you scrub that pot any longer, you'll put a hole in the bottom.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Huh?” Hermione looked back at her mother, who was at the kitchen door.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I was saying, I think that's clean enough. You've just about scrubbed the dickens out of that poor pot. Something weighing on your mind?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, I guess you could say that.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione rinsed the pot. Jean took it from her with a towel, dried it, and put it away.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What are my two girls getting up to?” Hugh came up and rested his elbows on the counter. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was no way Hermione was going to discuss boys with her dad.</span>
</p>
<p><span>Remarkably, Jean seemed to catch wind of that. “</span><em><span>Your</span></em> <em><span>girls</span></em><span> are going out for ice cream, and you can't come. No boys allowed.”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Hugh feigned a wound to the chest. “Oh, ow, the agony! I can only be healed by a small order of mint chip!"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh stop it, you!” Jean swatted at her husband with the towel she was still holding. “Let's go, Hermione, before your father dies of ice cream failure.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A few minutes later after a short car ride, they were digging into their ice cream. Hermione thought she was probably too old for sprinkles and the red bar stools that spin, but the shop was fairly empty, so she decided it didn't really matter. After a couple full rotations on the barstool, she settled into her dessert.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ok sweetheart, your father is at home, you have your ice cream, now spill.” Jean took a large bite of Rocky Road.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don't know what to talk about! I mean, there's this guy I like, but I don't know what to do about it, and I don't know if there is something I really can do.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hmm, okeh, teh me abouh him.” Jean replied thickly through her ice cream.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione rolled her eyes but smiled. “Well, he's two years older-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jean gulped dramatically. “Older men! Wow!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mum, you're </span>
  <em>
    <span>really</span>
  </em>
  <span> not helping.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sorry, go on.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I feel like he probably wouldn’t notice me in that way. He's a Gryffindor too, so we see each other just about every meal and during study hall. I have my friends, he has his, but we still kind of run into each other. He's nice to me, and he's helped me with my schoolwork a few times.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What's this bloke's name?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“His name is Fred.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh! He's a Weasley boy, right? Didn't we meet a Fred last year in Diagon Alley?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, he's Ron's older brother, and he's one of the twins.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, you like Fred, do you also like George?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What? No! Don't be ridiculous. They're completely different.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mrs. Granger smiled and held up her hands in surrender. “Oho, I'm so sorry! Do continue.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, I can't explain it. They just, are!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ok, ok. Now, just out of curiosity, what about Harry and Ron? Do you think you could ever like them? And do they know that you like Fred?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mum, they're like brothers. They're both great, really! But I, don't…”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“See them like that?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah. And I don’t think I could ever tell them about a crush. They’d be weird and it would be just awful trying to explain it to them.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jean smiled knowingly and nodded. Hermione giggled at the idea that she wasn’t the only one who knew boys could be awkward.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Jean used her empty spoon to point at Hermione. “Ok, well, how about that Neville chap? He likes you!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione blushed. “How do you know that?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“When we visited while you were petrified, he brought you a very lovely card.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You read it!?” Ice cream dripped down Hermione’s chin. Jean laughed, then patted a napkin onto her daughter's face. It stuck to the ice cream, which made Jean laugh even more.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hermione, the boy threw it at me and then ran away. It's his fault, really.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mum, you're- you can't blame Neville!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why not?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Because it's Neville! He wouldn't hurt a spider if it crawled under his shoe.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Aw, what a darling! Why don't you like him? He sounds very nice!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I </span>
  <em>
    <span>do</span>
  </em>
  <span> like him as a friend, but it's the same thing, I just don't- </span>
  <em>
    <span>like</span>
  </em>
  <span> him, not like </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Fair enough. Ok, so, Fred.” Mrs. Granger took another big bite of ice cream.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Fred. Right. Well, he's cute, he's funny, and, oh I don't know!” Hermione pushed her ice cream aside and buried her head in her hands.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey! Where'd you go?” Mrs. Granger lightly rubbed Hermione's back. “Sweetheart, it's ok to have crushes. You're young. You're not going to marry anyone this year. So if you don't have a complex chart as to why you like a person, you know what, that's ok.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione nodded and took a bite of her melting ice cream.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Also, who says he has no reason to notice you? He wrote you a card too, after all.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Mum, do you screen all my mail? Or just the stuff that comes in while I'm unconscious?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“After Neville's sweet letter, I wanted to see what your other friends had to say. It's not like you were reading them at that moment.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione shook her head. “Unbelievable! Well, what did you glean?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Don't be so snippy, those letters may have kept you at Hogwarts.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her heart plummeted. “I didn't even know that discussion was on the table! Why would you take me out?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hermione, you were </span>
  <em>
    <span>petrified. </span>
  </em>
  <span>At mid-term they wrote us saying they had the issue under control. Well, they really didn't. So your father and I had a discussion about sending you to-” Jean’s voice dropped to a whisper, “-to a Non-magical-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Muggle.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“-Yes, to a Muggle school.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione gave a hearty sigh. “And?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And the letters won us over. You have friends there. You are growing into what you were destined to be. I may not always understand the things you talk about, but I can tell you're really great at it and that you really love it. Not to mention your high marks. Regardless of how we feel about the school, we really are very proud of you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione blushed. “Thanks, mum.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course, we'd really like it if we could have a year where we didn't get a note from the headmaster. That would be highly preferable.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It's not my fault! I don't go looking for these things. Havoc just seems to creep up on me!”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sweetheart, you've been at the helm of havoc since you were a toddler. I expect nothing less. Especially now that you have help from Harry and Ron, may the gods above save us all.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Gee, thanks.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mrs. Granger gave Hermione a playful nudge. They finished up the dregs of their ice cream. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright Kiddo, let's get this mint chip home to your father before he collapses.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione slid off her stool. “Coming, mum.”</span>
