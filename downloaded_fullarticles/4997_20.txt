    <p>“Well, team, we're going to France,” Kurt said early on a Friday morning. He received annoyed glances in response. It was way too early. “Where in france are we going exactly?” Reade asked, hoping for something fun. “Bourgougnague,” Kurt said, stumbling slightly on the foreign word. “Wait!” Patterson said, suddenly very attentive, “Are we going to Hogwarts?” she asked, excited. “Yes,” Kurt said, slightly annoyed. “When do we leave?” the young scientist said, still increasing in excitement. “We haven’t even been briefed yet,” Jane said, amused. “We leave in an hour,” Kurt said, “We’ll be gone for a week, so pack accordingly. I’ll brief you on the plane.” Patterson immediately shot out of the room, talking to herself all the way. The remaining team members looked at each other and giggled. This was going to be a fun week.</p><p>An hour or so later, the team was on the plane being briefed. “Rich Dotcom has been cooperating with us recently, and he told us that a terrorist organization would be setting up a scavenger hunt to get plans to make a nuclear bomb. Our job, is to find the plans before the fall into the wrong hands.” Kurt said, matter-of-factly. “Do we know how this scavenger hunt is set up?” Tasha asked. “No.” Kurt said, “But try not to hurt anyone unless necessary. We can’t have any extra attention on us.” The team all nodded in understanding. Once satisfied that the team knew what they were doing, Kurt turned around and smiled to himself. This was going to be a fun week.</p><p>The next day was their first day in the castle. They got there at 8:00pm, just in time for the sorting ceremony. They were given ‘wands’ and robes, and told to go into the Great Hall. Everyone had taken a quiz to see which house they were in before they came, so the sorting went fairly quickly. Tasha and Reade were put in Slytherin, Kurt in Gryffindor, Jane in Hufflepuff, and Patterson in Ravenclaw. This is good. Kurt texted them. We can check each of our houses without having to sneak in one. Soon, dinner ended and they were all lead to their dorms. Patterson followed excitedly. Puzzles and Hogwarts? Together? She couldn’t have been happier.</p>
