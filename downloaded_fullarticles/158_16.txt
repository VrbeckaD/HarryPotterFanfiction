    <p class="western">It was the guy that attacked him, hurrying away from the Auburnbrie sisters while rubbing his cheek.</p>
<p class="western">“You!” Cor exclaimed in surprise, marching over. Justifications for his interference, a demand for an apology for kicking him in the balls, even an apology of his own, all sat on the tip of his tongue as he crossed the distance between them. He wasn't quite sure which of them he was going to say, that all depended on the hunter.</p>
<p class="western">Who turned around, and suddenly Cor forgot all of it, steps stuttering to a stop.</p>
<p class="western">Those were the the prettiest damn eyes he had ever seen.</p>
<p class="western">His voice stalled in his throat as the <em>teenager</em> faced him properly. They were the same age. They were the <em>same</em> age, and he was tiny. Wild jet black hair, pale sharp features, and those eyes, <em>wow</em>, summer leaf green in colour and framed with long black lashes. He wore the blood of his enemies, tough work roughened leathers covered in scratches and mud from hard fighting. His weapons were dented and caked in blood from use and prior kills, and not a single speck of it was his own. Even the way he stood gave him pause, straight backed, chin up, meeting his eyes head on, feet firmly planted. Confident in a way he rarely saw even from his brothers in the army.</p>
<p class="western">“Can I help you?” the boy asked coolly and Cor swallowed at the crystal cut Tenebraean accent, opening his mouth to say.... something. But. <em>Wow</em>. No. The first person aside from Regis himself to have ever put him on his ass was not only his own age, but clearly no stranger to hardwork or getting his hands dirty. After so many <em>years</em> of having to fight tooth and nail for even the slightest scrap of respect from men twice his age with half his skill.... He gets dropped by a guy half his height and weight with a face like <em>that?</em> He was pretty sure he'd had some rather X-rated dreams that started along those lines.</p>
<p class="western">And then the boy scoffed, scowling and barging past him when he took too long to answer. “Whatever, if you're too stupid to figure out what you're fucking saying that isn't my problem.”</p>
<p class="western">Looking back.... He could have reacted better.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<hr/>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">Cor stared.</p>
<p class="western">It was hard not to with so much skin on show.</p>
<p class="western">Potter stood up and reached for a shirt, the fading shadows of livid angry bruising fading away under Lady Auburnbrie's care. He had about the same muscle mass as your average alley cat. Lean and wiry, there wasn't an ounce of spare fat on him and Cor could see every muscle shift and move beneath his skin as he grabbed it and began to pull it on. A thin dusting of dark hair trailed up from his trousers to his belly button, a long thin pale scar went across his chest from shoulder to hip, his back completely unmarked save for a strawberry red birthmark a tiny bit to the left of his spine below his shoulderblades.</p>
<p class="western">He swallowed uncomfortably, feeling overly warm, and looked away as Potter spoke to Regis. Only looking back when Regis made a joke about how familiar it was that he didn't like being told what to do. Which, no. He <em>didn't mind</em>. He just hated <em>stupid</em> people telling him what to do. Because they always told him to do <em>stupid</em> things.</p>
<p class="western">That shirt was too big for him, he decided inanely in the back of his head somewhere. Potter looked far too deceptively <em>fragile</em> like that. Never mind the fact that the shirt he was wearing could have fit Cor himself, which once he realised put his brain down several other tangents that made his stomach turn pleasantly and his heartrate kick up. He scowled at himself because Potter had the personality of a feral cat, and cute face aside, he didn't <em>want</em> to think about that sort of stuff about him. He was an asshole. And what was he doing in someone else's shirt anyway?!</p>
<p class="western">He might have been a bit snippy and demanding because of it.</p>
<p class="western">And quite rightly he had a wet flannel thrown in his face for it.</p>
<p class="western">Weskham removed him from the room before he could retaliate.</p>
<p class="western">What followed was perhaps the most embarrassing dressing down he'd received to date. <em>He was <b>not</b> interested in Potter like <b>that!</b></em></p>
<p class="western">Except he was.</p>
<p class="western">A little.</p>
<p class="western">He slouched in his seat scowling down at the table, ears hot, uncomfortable as Weskham primly read him the war treatise about appropriate behaviour to others, especially when sexually interested in them. And <em>of course</em> he refused to modulate his voice. Which meant Clarus proceeded to choke on his beer, until Cid smacked him on the back and demanded, “Are y'all fuckin' kiddin' me, Rus? Y'all <em>didn't</em> notice?!” as if it were as obvious as the sun in the sky.</p>
<p class="western">Which, apparently, according to them, it really was.</p>
<p class="western">He slouched further in his seat, folding his arms grumpily as Regis and Harry showed up, feeling his ears go hot when the Ulwaat boy sat next to him to talk to Cid, before proceeding to prove himself more than just a pretty face. Economics, manufacture, Cor listened with half an ear and turned away from them, grumpy because he wasn't allowed to talk, so joining in on the conversation wasn't allowed. It wasn't <em>just</em> because there were daemons that had stalled industry out in Lucis proper, it was also education. The plain fact of the matter was, Insomnia had public education. Lucis did not. Schools were rare out here and so was higher education. Many older people didn't even know how to read depending on how far out in the sticks they were. Insomnia had a considerably higher population, and over 98% of them were educated to at least highschool level, meaning that those who <em>opted</em> to go further, and become graduates had their pick of placements and fields of study. And with the war, the big money was in communications and defence. And with the population stuck in what was essentially a large cage, entertainment.</p>
<p class="western">But of course he wasn't allowed to share his thoughts. Even if he thought Potter would find it interesting. He didn't want to risk Weskham locking him in the car the next time they went to do something interesting, or took Regis into a daemon nest.</p>
<p class="western">It wasn't that he didn't <em>trust</em> them to keep him safe – but His Majesty <em>told</em> him to protect his only son and heir.</p>
<p class="western">He didn't want to let his King down.</p>
<p class="western">If he fucked up and Regis got hurt, if he died, the relations between refugees and citizens would sour even further. Right now, he was the only real <em>tangible</em> proof that they could be accepted. He was a public figure in a way that he didn't think the others in the Retinue had figured out yet.</p>
<p class="western">“What do you think?” Potter asked curiously, looking at him, obviously attempting to offer an olive branch.</p>
<p class="western">He grimaced and looked away.</p>
<p class="western">He was going to swap where all of Weskham's knives were in their case for this.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<hr/>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">“Y'all must've been pretty highly ranked before hand,” Cid observed, leaning against the side of Lady Auburnbrie's truck to get a better look at the small haul of accessories that Potter was sorting through. The hunter looked at him in bewilderment. “In yer army,” the old man elaborated as Cor looked between the two.</p>
<p class="western">Potter's face twisted in confused offence. “I'm <em>fifteen</em>,” he spluttered, “I'm not old enough to join the army!”</p>
<p class="western">Cor stared at him, “We're the same age, and I am,” he pointed out. True he lied about his age when he signed up for the military, but right now they were both at the right legal age. Just what was Ulwaat's age of enlistment if they thought fifteen was too young?</p>
<p class="western">“Well, what were ye doin' before this?” Cid asked, something like real worry in his tone as he examined the dark haired teenager who was looking increasingly uncomfortable and dismayed.</p>
<p class="western">“I was in school. Like everyone else my age in the country,” he explained stiffly. “It's – minimum age requirement to join the army is eighteen.” So <em>late?</em> “It's <em>illegal </em>to – I mean, there's <em>cadets</em>, but I don't....” The hunter dragged a hand through his hair looking pained and uncomfortable in a way that immediately made Cor worried. Because – because he was starting to get a bad feeling about all this. When he first mentioned having to stay in Meldacio to wait for his godfather his chief argument was the fact that the man couldn't <em>fight</em>, and just now he'd admitted to only being a hunter for <em>two months</em>, and being quite successful at it judging by the miniature haul of rewards he had spilled out across the flatbed in front of him. Some of which could be sold for a very pretty gil. But he wasn't in the military. And in fact looked quite uncomfortable with the very concept because of his <em>age</em>.</p>
<p class="western">“Were you <em>ever</em> trained?” he asked slowly, studying the boy's pretty face closely.</p>
<p class="western">He scratched at his ear uncomfortably, leaf green eyes flickering between his face and a point just past his shoulder. “You're... gunna have to be more specific,” he requested at length.</p>
<p class="western">Not good.</p>
<p class="western">“Did anyone ever teach you how to use a sword, or a gun?” he asked with rising dread, because if he was right....</p>
<p class="western">“I held a sword when I was twelve once? And killed a giant ass snake?” he <em>suggested</em> more than informed.</p>
<p class="western">It felt like the bottom of his stomach dropped out.</p>
<p class="western">He was a civilian. Not a hunter. But an actual 100% <em>Insomnian level</em> civilian. A school boy. A fucking <em>school boy</em> left in the middle of Cleigne to try and survive without weapons, or glasses, or a clue of where he was with absolutely no training or background in combat. His godfather couldn't fight so clearly the man wouldn't have been able to teach him to defend himself, he had no <em>style</em> – fuck Cor should have seen it before now! He had no <em>Style</em>. Nothing was standardised. Not his sword forms, nor even the way he held his pistols!</p>
<p class="western">The fifteen year old sighed and tucked his hunt rewards into his backpack. “It's not a big deal,” he told them calmly, <em>and completely erroneously.</em> Even Cid was looking at him in outright horror.</p>
<p class="western">“I beg ter differ,” the old man choked out. “Y'all takin' hunts without knowin' her ass from yer elbow. Yer gunna get yerself killed one'a these days,” he said in dismay.</p>
<p class="western">“Not dead yet,” he pointed out as he got to his feet and swung the backpack on. Cor stared up at him, an impossible figure cut out of the blue sky around him. “I think I can handle it,” he declared before turning and jumping out.</p>
<p class="western">Cor shook his head and folded his arms to hide his clenched fists. “You flail with your sword like you're having a seizure, and you're blind. That's bullshit,” he pointed out sharply. He had no swordschool. Yes he had been getting by so far, but <em>luck</em> could only take you so far! He was a Rank 5 hunter judging by the accessories he had, so he definitely had skill. But his handicaps – from here on out they could very well get him <em>killed</em>, especially in unfamiliar surroundings so close to the front lines!</p>
<p class="western">But the dark haired boy only threw a knife-edged smirk over his shoulder, “And yet here I am,” he mused lightly.</p>
<p class="western">Yet there he was.</p>
<p class="western">Fuck.</p>
<p class="western">“Roll yer tongue back in, boy,” Cid grumbled, rubbing his chin looking worried.</p>
<p class="western">Cor flushed and glared at him, “It wasn't out!”</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<hr/>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">Harry snatched his hat off his head, pale faced and near frantic. “Get changed, quickly!” he whispered, “Run around in a uniform and they're going to know who you are immediately. <em>Hurry!</em>” he hissed even as he turned to check the alleyway they had just come from.</p>
<p class="western">Cor summoned his civilian clothes from the armiger. The hunter had a point, one he hadn't really considered before because he typically <em>lived</em> in his uniforms. They were a lot sturdier and made of specially woven fibres exclusive to the Crownsguard defence support and equipment suppliers, his clothes were more armoured than most Niflheim soldier's so called bullet-proof vests.</p>
<p class="western">Harry paused for a split second, looking him up and down before he dropped to his knees and bent forward.</p>
<p class="western">His heart practically jack-knifed into his throat, his stomach <em>flipping</em> – and Harry untucked his jeans from his boots.</p>
<p class="western">“Shoelaces catch on damn-near fucking everything out in the wild, never tuck yer boots in,” he whispered quickly, voice catching on the edges of Lady Auburnbrie's familiar Cleigne accent. “Don't know what they do in your home, but I've never seen a teenager with his shirt tucked in either,” he added doubtfully even as he reached up to Cor's hips, fingers tugging swiftly at his jeans as he pulled his shirt out from them.</p>
<p class="western">This – he was a mess. He was half hard, sweating like crazy, bright red, and then there was a clatter of guns and boots and he grabbed Harry by the back of his shirt to yank him behind him even as they looked up at the unit of Niffs bearing down on them.</p>
<p class="western">One of them turned back the way they came, “Nothing, sir! Just some handsy teenagers. You two,” he barked, turning back towards them with disgust. “Either keep it in your pants or get a room. Scram!” he barked, gesturing with the muzzle of his gun for them to get gone.</p>
<p class="western">Harry grabbed his hand, “Y-yessir,” he squeaked, his hands shaking and <em>cold</em>, nails digging into Cor's flesh as he turned tail and practically dragged him down the other street.</p>
<p class="western">Cor tightened his grip on the hunter's hand, alarm and concern clenching in his chest when he got a good look at the other fifteen year old's face.</p>
<p class="western">He was terrified.</p>
<p class="western">His eyes were wide behind his glasses, pupils dilated to pin-pricks, he had gone chalk white, and cold. And yet, despite all that, he checked every sidestreet, every window and doorway as they ran down the alley to the main plaza where they could see the tipster in the window of his kitchen helping to evacuate people from the street. Harry waited before dragging him to a hiding space and ducking down, his breath shaking ever so slightly as he carefully inhaled and exhaled as if counting.</p>
<p class="western">Part of him was confused, Harry was willing and able to tangle with daemons and fiends five times his size. But guys with guns freaked him out? The other part of him was concerned. Harry was a civilian, hunter rank or not. He wasn't used to these kinds of situations. His plan to get them out of Lestallum was great, flawless even. But it could all fall apart if he panicked.</p>
<p class="western">He tightened his grip a bit and pointed out an older hunter further up who was arguing with a pair of Niffs. Harry looked back at him and nodded, his expression determined as he pointed to where they were going next. They ran. Cor kept a tight grip of his hand and stayed quiet even as they reached the hotel and saw the soldiers in front of it. At least Clarus found a safe place to hole up, and then came Weskham and Cid, playing up the Leidan Red-Neck angle so hard he was surprised Cid was even playing along with it.</p>
<p class="western">They were so close to escaping the city that he could practically taste it. Harry's shaking had lessened with their goal so close that he didn't want to wait, didn't want to pause. He wanted to get them out.</p>
<p class="western">Even if he had to go through the next unit coming into the city.</p>
<p class="western">He reached for Genji through the armiger.</p>
<p class="western">“No!” Harry yelped, whipping around to grab his hand. “No! You'll draw too much attention!” he whispered frantically, looking over his shoulder to the group of men, and then over Cor's shoulder with mounting panic. “We can't fight everyone!” he hissed, tugging on him.</p>
<p class="western">Cor begged to differ. They were only human. And they were dressed for covert ops, no heavy armour or gear. He could absolutely one-hundred percent take them.</p>
<p class="western">“<em>Cor!</em> Please!”</p>
<p class="western">He jerked and snapped his head around to look at him in shock, Harry grabbed his arm and yanked him down a sidestreet, and he went because – because he looked like he was on the verge of breaking. Because of him. <em>Cor</em> was the one making him panic like that. So he shut up and let the hunter pull him out of sight, hide them in someone's narrow far too small porch where they had to stand practically between each other's legs.</p>
<p class="western">“Once we're out of the city, we can just hop the fence at the side of the road,” the smaller teenager whispered, rubbing his arms nervously, pale skin covered in pimples of adrenalin and fear to the point where Cor felt like an even <em>bigger</em> asshole for being the one to put them there – and not even in the fun way that he sometimes dreamed of.</p>
<p class="western">Harry tipped to the side a little, peering out and down the street and then tensed up horribly.</p>
<p class="western">And then he looked up, his face going from stressed to considering for a split second, before something like resignation and determination set his jaw and knitted his eyebrows together.</p>
<p class="western">“Do <em>not</em> stab me for this,” he hissed.</p>
<p class="western">Cor frowned, stab him? What was he -</p>
<p class="western">Hands grabbed his skull and pulled him down, even as Harry reached up and crushed their mouths together.</p>
<p class="western">What</p>
<p class="western">what what what <em>what what W HAT</em></p>
<p class="western">The hunter snarled against his lips, “Do you <em>want</em> to get shot? Stop dicking around and put your fucking back into – ”</p>
<p class="western">Irritation licked his insides, mixing furiously with stress and embarrassment and just about drop of frustration he had felt about this impossible boy and his mouth and his eyes and his hands and hips and <em>ass. </em>He shoved him backwards against the wall and kissed the living daylights out of him, digging a hand into that thick black hair he had fantasised over for a week, it was nothing like he expected, coarser and thicker than he thought it would be, even as he used his grip to force Harry's head back. He tasted like exactly nothing but spit and skin because Cor wasn't paying attention to stupid shit like that as he pulled him in tight, wanting to feel every inch of him against him.</p>
<p class="western">The gun was getting in the way. He grunted in annoyance and shoved it down and out of the way, feeling Harry's hands tangling in his shirt as he tried to stand up straight, gasping into his mouth with sounds that should have been fucking illegal.</p>
<p class="western">He gripped Harry's hips and pulled him in close, grinding into him even as he hiked the hunter up one of his thighs, and there were clearly no objections if the way he was leaning into it was any indication. He nuzzled into Harry's neck, kissing and licking at his tendons just to hear the sound of his voice.</p>
<p class="western">Right before they were doused with cold water and the home-owner smacked him in the side of the head with her bucket.</p>
<p class="western">“NOT ON MY DOORSTEP!! NOT ON MY DOORSTEP!!” she shrieked as the two of them scattered like scalded cats.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<hr/>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">It had been a long time since he had seen something so grim. A long long time.</p>
<p class="western">Night had long since fallen when they got out of Crestholm Channels. The border control Crownsguard had deployed swiftly and brought out generators and extra men to hold the area, medical had the two survivors that Harry had found, and there were already engineers and soldiers on the scene to handle the clean-up and reignition of the power. Once the power was back on they could focus on removing the daemons and fixing the rest of the systems.</p>
<p class="western">It wasn't easy coordinating the border control with the more typical Crownsguard, for one, only the Crownsguard would actually listen to him. Border control seemed to hold him with some level of contempt, at least until Clarus put his fucking foot down. But by that point, all the instructions he had were already given out, and unless he was going to take his sword up and go back down there, there was nothing more for Cor to do.</p>
<p class="western">So he took a step back, and then he saw Harry in the distance, just outside the ring of activity, sat on the back of his truck, watching the organised chaos with a dull look on his face. He swallowed a little, and then made his way over after taking a quiet breath.</p>
<p class="western">“You alright?” he asked gently, staring down at the hunter's pale miserable face.</p>
<p class="western">He grimaced into his knees, “No.”</p>
<p class="western">He looked back out over the Crownsguard and the Channels, silent for a moment. “...First time seeing someone dead?” he asked softly.</p>
<p class="western">Harry shook his head, “No. Just.... the first <em>massacre</em> I've ever seen,” he admitted quietly, something complicated in his voice before he squeezed his eyes shut and dragged a hand through his hair with a sigh.</p>
<p class="western">The only way to handle these kinds of situations was to focus on the good.</p>
<p class="western">“The two people you found will live,” he stated. “The lady is awake. She was one of the people at ground zero. They were looking to expand by boring another reservoir so they were taking soil samples and doing sonic imaging of the surroundings when they saw an empty cavity less than a metre away,” he explained, spotting Harry's tired green eyes watching him curiously from the corner of his eye. “As soon as one of the guys knocked on it, the whole wall caved in and a bunch of daemons crawled out. She said she thinks they got trapped in there during a landslide of something.”</p>
<p class="western">Harry's eyes slid shut with something that could have been relief, or could have been heartbreak. Days like this, it was hard to tell.</p>
<p class="western">“As long as they keep the armed guards for the next few weeks to ensure nothing else forms up, they should be fine then,” he muttered. Sound advice that he would be sure to pass on. No one was certain what daemon spawning rates were, but if the hunter was suggesting weeks, then that was what Cor would be passing on.</p>
<p class="western">The hunter tightened his grip on his knees and hunched up unhappily, shivering in the sharp Leidan night air, squeezing his eyes shut and grimacing in unhappiness.</p>
<p class="western">It hurt seeing him like that.</p>
<p class="western">He stripped out of his jacket, well aware of how cold the smaller teenager could get, and dropped it over his shoulders before folding his arms and turning to watch the men working in the distance and refusing to be embarrassed about his actions. There was a long stretch of silence as Harry stared at him with a sad face before he huddled down and drew it around him in silence, hiding his face in his knees again.</p>
<p class="western">He didn't say anything. And it didn't take long before eventually the hunter slowly relaxed, dropping into an exhausted slumber that eventually saw him curled up on the flatbed under Cor's jacket.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<hr/>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">Regis couldn't believe his eyes.</p>
<p class="western">“Wesk!” he hissed, scurrying away from the tent, “Wesk! Have you got your camera? Weskham, you absolutely have to get a picture of this! Look look!” he whispered, grabbing his friend's arm and pulling him over to Kimya's tent. The young women grinning and holding the tent flaps open for them to get a better look.</p>
<p class="western">Weskham paused, blinking, and then covered his mouth with a hand, grinning, “Oh my. Well. Happy Birthday indeed,” he muttered softly.</p>
<p class="western">“I know right?” Regis giggle squeaked, trying to keep his voice down but the absolute glee making it hard.</p>
<p class="western">Cor shifted in his sleep, frowning a little as he pulled Harry a little closer and buried his face into the other teenager's hair. The two were curled up tight, practically suction-cupped to each other with Harry tucked up under the soldier's chin, both of them sleeping soundly. Which, given how it was long past dawn, was <em>highly</em> irregular for Cor who was often up with the sun at the same time as Weskham himself.</p>
<p class="western">Regis flapped his hands eagerly, “Weskham, you must, please,” he practically <em>begged</em> as his Retainer summoned his polaroid camera to hand.</p>
<p class="western">The sound of the shutter, followed by both Regis and Clarus' cackling, woke the pair as Weskham quickly retreated, and Kimya worked to getting the two teenagers out of bed for breakfast.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
