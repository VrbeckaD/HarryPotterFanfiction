    <p>The Great Hall was filled with awaiting silence, it was time for revelation of the upcoming Champions for the Triwizard Tournament. It was exciting and nerve-racking at the same time. <br/>(M/N) was on one side annoyed of it, on the the other slightly a tiny bit excited. It really was nerve-racking. <br/>«Now the moment you've all be waiting for, the Champion selection!» Dumbledore stepped to the Goblet, the once blue flames turned and the first Paper came out. «Champion for Drumstrang, Viktor Krum!» the boys cheered with proudness, the flames turned again red with another Paper, «Beauxbatons Champion, Fleur Delacour!» a jubilee clapping with cheers was heard from the Females. Another came «For Hogwarts the Champion is, Cedric Diggory!» all Hogwarts Students cheered. All three Champions were standing on the Stage.<br/>«Excellent! Now we have our Champions! But in the end only one will down in History!» again people cheered and clapped.<br/>Something wasn't right, the flames goes into a red again and two paper flow out. The silence was almost anxiously painful at the moment.<br/>«Harry Potter.» he looked at the other paper «and (M/N) (S/N)!» non of the two stood up, the whole room was just painful quiet and rather speechless.<br/>«HARRY POTTER AND (M/N) (S/N)!» Dumbledore sounded almost angry, «You both, go! Go!» said Hermione. Both stood finally up and walked to the front.<br/>(M/N) felt nauseous and warm, too warm, like we he would slowly burn. He heard the other students Whisper and the looks they gave, makes him want to cry. He felt like crying.<br/>Why was his name in the Goblet? Why him? He felt anxiously and scared.</p><p>All five were in a room, the (H/C) teen liked to call it the Trophies room. He stood next to Harry, waiting for something or someone. The teachers bursted through the doors. <br/>«Harry! Did you put your name in the Goblet of fire?» «No sir.» «Did you ask one of the older Students do it for you?» «No sir.».<br/>Professor McGonagall came to (M/N), «(M/N) what about you? Did you somehow put your name into the Goblet? Or asked an older Student?» «No Madam, I didn't!» the (E/C) teen felt like crying, crying till he dies.<br/>«Well of course they lying!» Madam Maxime accent was thick.<br/>The adults had a heated discussion about it, but (M/N) didn't listen to it anymore. </p><p>He looked at his own reflexion at the Bathroom mirror, his eyes were (E/C) with a hint of Silver mixed in, not really noticeable. His hair was (H/C) with highlights of (F/C) mixed with in. It was short, but not too short.<br/>(M/N) flashed a grin, there were they, his Demon teeth's. They were still small, baby teeth, wouldn't anytime fall out. Not that he wanted it anyways.<br/>His skin was slight mix between (s/C) and a rosy white. He looked normal, he was a Half-Blood. Half Wizard, half demon. (M/N) wasn't tall, but he was fine with his 1,60 meters.<br/>His right ear had some piercings http://pin.it/jGfp1Tf , did it in his fourth year. There was two tiny Tattoos on his Body, one would be a cross on each site was another symbol, a moon, a star, the sun and a hexagram. Then there was his (Y/Z) sign.<br/>Yes. He looked normal, but he wasn't normal. Not at all. Not at the slightest. The appearance, including his demon teeth, looked normal. Then again, not.<br/>(M/N) was deaf, not completely at all, he wore hearing aids, but even if he wouldn't wear them, he could just hear faintly. If he was honest, he felt pathetic and ashamed.<br/>The teen sighed, turned the water on and splashed his face with it. He still felt burning warm, dizzy and nauseous. He was shaking. </p><p>(M/N) sat on his bed, different thoughts were running through his mind. Non of them were actually positive. <br/>There he stood, his Boyfriend of 2 years, Fred Weasley. The ginger looked at him with disappointed and anger, but there was also a hurtful look in it.<br/>«How did you do it? Or was it someone? You could told me about it!» his voice sounded harsh,<br/>(M/N) felt small, vulnerable. Again he felt the tears picking in his eyes. «I didn't put my name into the Goblet, nor did I ask someone to do it!» «Yeah, of course» sneered Fred. The tears were falling silently over his, already red, cheeks. He took a shaky breath, «I, I didn't put my stupid name inside this stupid goblet! I don't want this! I never wished for it! Nor asked for it!» (M/N)'s voice quivered, it didn't waste a minute, till the first sobs escaped his lips. He cried, loud and almost painful. <br/>Somehow he was seated into someone's lap, but he still cried. <br/>«Hey, sshh, Im sorry (M/N). Im sorry.» Fred's voice was gently, he hugged him a bit tighter, drove his hand through (M/N)'s hair in a calming manner. The night would be long, he knew that, but he couldn't care less at the moment.<br/>The (H/C) teen almost choked on his crying, he was quite the sensitive demon. </p><p>It was in the middle of the night, the moon stood high and mighty and showed his glory to everyone. He opens his eyes, slowly, they felt sluggish and burned slightly. He looked around, the curtains of his bed were closed, did he closed them? He couldn't remember.<br/>(M/N) turned his head to the side, he came face to face with the face of his sleeping Boyfriend. He felt safe and calmer, snuggled deeper into his chest. His eyes felt heavy again. Sleep took over him once again. Such a bless.</p>
