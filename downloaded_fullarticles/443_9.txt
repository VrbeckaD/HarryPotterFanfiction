    <p>It had been 5 years since Neville had stepped foot in England. When the battle was over, the funerals were complete, and all that was left was to put the wizarding world back together, Neville fled. </p><p>The horrors that he had faced during the reign of terror that was the Carrow twins came crashing down on him. The entire year, he had pulled a sense of bravery and honor he hadn't known he had. The Room of Requirement became a safe haven for anyone who needed it during that year and he had started it all. When the abuse and torture of students had started shortly after the beginning of the start of term, Neville didnt even think before he dove head first into the fray.</p><p>Taking punishments for younger students, causing distractions, sometimes at the detriment to his own health, to save others from the Carrows and Filch became second nature. He wasn't sure his body would ever fully heal from the amount of crucios he took. Every one he was able to fight through was done so only by thinking of his parents. He would not dishonor his parents and the sacrifice they made to keep himself but succumbing to the same curse that had taken their minds from them.</p><p>When the battle was won, Neville didn't know what to do with himself. He just knew he was tired. Tired of fighting, tired of pain, tired of being a leader. He refused the offer to join the Auror Academy, the offer to return to Hogwarts to finish his education properly was returned with a politely worded refusal. He couldn't imagine returning to the scene of his nightmares so soon after. </p><p>His grandmother agreed that perhaps he needed some time away to come to terms with what he had been through and helped him pack for a trip around the world. He wrote a letter to everyone important to him, visiting his parents to say goodbye, he left with no way for anyone to contact him except his grandmother. </p><p>He had no plans really, just to be as far away from England as he could get. He went to India first. He loved the sights and smells, the culture. He then hopped from Greece to China. He spent two years studying plant life in New Zealand. He was slowly able to deal with his nightmares, his guilt at being one of the survivors, his depression that threatened to swallow him whole and never let go. Neville was finally able to let it all go and find himself again.</p><p>He kept in contact with his grandmother during his travels, sending her postcards from everywhere he visited, little trinkets and books he knew she would enjoy. She wrote to him to keep him updated on the changes the Wizarding World was seeing, his parents, and herself. She never told him about his friends or anyone he might know. He had asked her not too. It was too painful in the beginning and then it had been too long. He didn't know them anymore and they sure didn't know him. </p><p>This didn't stop him from wondering. How were Harry and Ron fairing as Aurors? Had Hermione revolutionized the way magical creatures were seen? Had Ginny become a famous quidditch player like she had always wanted? Was Luna discovering more creatures only she could see? Then there was Hanna Abbot.</p><p>Hannah had been the only bright spot during the year of hell. She had tended to his wounds when he had been hurt and unable to go to the infirmary. She listened to him when he spoke of his parents, how scared he was about surviving, and held him while he cried. He wouldn't have made it through without her and her loving heart. </p><p>He didn't see it coming, falling in love with Hannah. It snuck up on him one night when she was healing the deep gashes on his back from a whipping he had taken from Filch for helping a first year escape. She was so gentle in her healing but sharp with her words. <br/>"I don't know what to do with you Neville! Do you have any idea what you're doing to me? I never know what state you're going to be in when you crawl back to the room. I don't know what I would do without you Neville, you have to be more careful!" </p><p>That was when he knew he loved her. When he was at his lowest, he would just think of her face and he could fight a little more, deal with a little more cursing. Leaving her was his biggest regret but he didnt feel it was the right thing to do to lay his burdens on her. He wasn't capable of being the man she needed him to be when it was all over. He had sent her a letter explaining that he was leaving, that he was sorry, that he couldn't breathe there right now. </p><p>He left before he received an answer from her. He never asked his grandmother if one ever arrived. He wasn't sure he could handle what the answer might be. He tried his hardest to push her out of his mind with very little success. He saw her everywhere. The blue of the tulips he had created in Holland were the same color as her eyes, he would hear her voice in women passing him on the streets. He saw her every night in his dreams.</p><p>He held no illusions that she felt for him what he felt for her. Not after abandoning her when all was said and done. Although they hadn't been a couple in any sort of official capacity, he had hoped one day they might be. He knew he had screwed that up with leaving.</p><p>When he received a letter from his grandmother informing him that Headmistress Mcgonagall had contacted her about getting in touch with Neville for a teaching position, his mind immediately went to Hannah. He agreed to read the letter that was offering him the position of Herbology professor and head of Gryffindor. Professor Sprout was retiring and Neville was the only person she wanted as her successor. Pomona had written at the bottom of the letter six words.</p><p>It's time to come home Neville. </p><p>Those words were how Neville found himself staring at the gates of Hogwarts waiting to be admitted. He had returned the previous week, spent time with his grandmother and his parents, read through all the letters he had received from his friends while he had been away. He had responded with letters of his own, making plans for lunches and dinners, but no apologies for disappearing. He didn't owe anyone an apology.</p><p>Except for Hannah. She hadn't written to him at all during his five year sabbatical from real life. He hadn't really expected her too but couldn't help but feel disappointed. He was still on the fence about sending her a letter telling her he had returned. She had made her stance clear by not writing to him and he couldn't blame her.</p><p>His musings were interrupted by Mcgonagall opening the gates for him <br/>"Mr Longbottom, it's been some time, I'm so pleased to see you looking well." She gave him a rare smile and pulled him in for a hug "You will be a wonderful addition to the staff."</p><p>Neville blushed slightly "Thank you headmistress, i'm pleased you all think so highly of me. I hope I'm able to live up to the expectations."</p><p>Mcgonagall scoffed "Of course you will, dear boy. Now, let's get you settled before dinner this evening."</p><p>Following Mcgonagall through the castle to an area he hadn't seen before, he was shown to his room.</p><p>"You'll set your own password once I leave, there's a living space, a small kitchen area, you aren't required to dine in the Great Hall except for special occasions, a bedroom, and this door here will lead you to your office. You'll be able to set your office hours using the runes around the doorway. Your office will only be visible to students during that time."</p><p>Neville looked around the office stunned "Are the students allowed in the part of the castle? I don't remember ever being here and I know I have been to several professors' offices."</p><p>Mcgonagall chuckled "That's the magic of Hogwarts dear boy, your office is attached to your room, but during your office hours it will also be visible to students on the first floor." </p><p>"I could spend the rest of my life studying the magic of Hogwarts and I'm sure I still wouldn't scratch the surface of her secrets." Neville said in awe of his surroundings.</p><p>"I've often thought the same thing. Now then, dinner is in an hour in the staff room located on the 2nd floor, we'll be doing a meet and greet of sorts for you and the other new professors. I'll see you then." Mcgonagall gave him another smile and swept from the room.</p><p>Neville spent the next hour setting his password and his office hours. He had just started to unpack when he realized the time. Throwing a semi formal robe over his clothing, he set out to find the staff room. There were quite a few faces he recognized from his time as a student, including the diminutive Professor Flitwick and Hagrid of course. Then there were the faces of people he knew that he was surprised to see. Draco Malfoy who pulled him aside to apologize and to tell him as he was the potions professor, he would like to talk to Neville about collaborating on a project with him. Parvati Patil was the divination teacher, giving him a brief hug and a promise to catch up. Pansy Parkinson was a surprise. She was new that year and was taking over as a transfiguration teacher and had given him a small smile before continuing her conversation with Professor Vector. </p><p>Neville was talking to Flitwick about his time in Greece when the door to the staff room opened and a voice he thought he would never hear again was speaking to Mcgonagall.</p><p>"I'm terribly sorry I'm so late Headmistress, I was trying to get all the potions sorted before I came down."</p><p>Nevilles mouth went dry as he stared at Hannah. She looked beautiful. Her blonde hair was longer than it had been, she still talked with her hands, although he had no idea what she was saying. All he could hear was a ringing in his ears.</p><p>Neville stepped forward as she turned around and they locked eyes.</p><p>"Hannah..."</p><p>The look on her face broke him. She went through several emotions very quickly. Relief, happiness, anger, then it became devoid of any emotion.</p><p>"Minerva, I'm so sorry, I'm suddenly not feeling well. I'll see you in the morning for the staff meeting." She turned on her heel and walked as quick as she could out the door.</p><p>Nevilles brain finally caught up with the rest of him, he ran after her "HANNAH! Please stop!" </p><p>Hannah stopped, turned towards him slowly. With a look of pure heartbreak on her face, she looked Neville square in the eye "Don't speak to me Neville, I have nothing to say to you. Leave me alone."</p><p>She then turned and fled around the corner, leaving Neville in the corridor feeling like his entire world had collapsed on top of him.</p>
