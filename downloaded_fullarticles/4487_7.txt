<p>Jack Frost and the Ice Prince</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Oi, Jack Frost!” cried Scorpius as he trailed after James. “Why’re we outside in winter?”</p>
<p>James tossed a smirk over his shoulder. “You’ll see. Hurry up!” </p>
<p>Groaning, Scorpius jogged, catching up to James. Grinning, James grabbed his hand, tugging him into some trees. “Perfect,” he said, pressing Scorpius against a trunk. “No one’ll see us here.” </p>
<p>Scorpius raised an eyebrow. “You dragged me out here to snog?” </p>
<p>“Or more.” James winked. </p>
<p>“You’re mad! My fingers are blue!” </p>
<p>“My <i>balls</i> have been blue since you arrived,” James growled. </p>
<p>“Insane,” mumbled Scorpius, the rest of his words cut off by James’ kiss. </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Undoing his trousers, James nibbled at Scorpius’ neck. “Put your legs around my waist.” </p>
<p>“You’re certifiable,” Scorpius groaned. “Do you <i>literally</i> want blue balls? There’s a warm house not a few feet away where we can—”</p>
<p>“Can what?” growled James, scraping his teeth along Scorpius’ neck. “Sit and make small talk with my family? We’ll do that later, <i>after</i> I fuck that sweet arse of yours.” </p>
<p>“But it’s cold!” cried Scorpius. “Not all of us are Jack Frost.” </p>
<p>“But we’re both wizards.” James murmured a Warming Charm. </p>
<p>Scorpius relaxed. “Yeah, okay.” And shifting, he wrapped his legs around James’ waist. </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“You know,” said Scorpius as James cast Lubricating and Stretching Charms, “you’re lucky I’m athletic and flexible.” </p>
<p>“True,” agreed James, slicking some conjured lube over his cock. “There’s a short list of people I’d try this with.” </p>
<p>Scorpius, working his trousers and pants down, paused. “Wait, you considered doing this with someone else?” His eyes narrowed. “Who?”</p>
<p>“No one,” said James. “Now please, can we—?”</p>
<p>“No way, Jack Frost. Not until you tell me who else you’ve considered for this!” </p>
<p>“Oh, for—” James rolled his eyes. “My bits are turning blue!” </p>
<p>“Cast another Warming Charm,” Scorpius said flatly. </p>
<p>James groaned. </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“It’s just a fantasy, all right?” James leaned in to kiss Scorpius, but he turned his face aside. “Scorpius!” </p>
<p>“Who?” Scorpius snapped. </p>
<p>“No one!” James shouted. He sighed. “It’s fantasy, nothing more. Now, can we please do this before my family comes to investigate why there’s shouting?” </p>
<p>Scorpius searched his eyes, and after a moment, he smirked. “Fine. But if anyone asks why I call you Jack Frost from now on, you get to explain.” </p>
<p>James grinned. “Deal. Now, seriously, my cock and balls are blue! There’s only so much Warming Charms can do—”</p>
<p>Scorpius tilted his arse up. “Proceed.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Good?” panted James as he slid into Scorpius. </p>
<p>Scorpius, pressed against the tree, laughed breathily. “I take…everything…back. It’s…genius!” </p>
<p>“Right?” James sped up, bracing his arms against the tree trunk as he fucked deeper into Scorpius. </p>
<p>“Coming—” gasped Scorpius after a few moments. “Can’t wait much…longer!” </p>
<p>“Wait for me, baby,” babbled James, his thrusts going ragged. “Just…another…second—”</p>
<p>“Ah!” cried Scorpius, his body convulsing around James’. </p>
<p>Scorpius’ muscles rippling around James’ cock pulled him over the edge, and he, too, came. </p>
<p>Once they’d recovered, Scorpius kissed James. “Brilliant, Jack Frost.” </p>
<p>James grinned. “You, too, Ice Prince.” </p>
