    <p>Tina was sitting at her desk in the MCUSA headquarters filling out paperwork. She stamped yet another paper in a seemingly endless pile and sighed. Since being reinstated as an auror, nearly two years ago now, she'd been neglecting her desk duties in favor of spending time in the field. She'd been on the same project for the last year, looking for <em>him</em>. Her searching took many forms though. Sometimes she was infiltrating groups of Grindelwald's supporters. Sometimes she was investigating magical smuggling operations. But her main goal was always finding him. So far, she'd had no success. They'd been able to gather no intelligence relating to Newt Scamander. It was as if he'd vanished off the face of the earth.</p><p>Tina realized she had completely zoned out and was holding the ring hanging on a chain around her neck. Newt had given it to her the very same day he'd . . . She shook her head and tried again to focus on the task at hand.</p><p>Three quick raps sounded from her office door.</p><p>"Come in!" she yelled. A flustered looking young intern entered. He was breathing heavily. He looked like he'd just run there.</p><p>"Yes, Eddie, what is it?" she asked, looking back down at her paperwork.</p><p>"Ms. Goldstein, they've found him mam!"</p><p>Tina's head snapped back up. "What?" She fixed Eddie with a piercing glare.</p><p>"Newt Scamander! They've found him!" he said.</p><p>Tina jumped up from her desk. Papers went flying. "Where the hell is he?!"</p><p>"They found him in some run down house upstate, not 20 miles from Ilvermorny mam, just this side of the Massachusetts border. Only a few supporters were there when they arrived and they were handled easily. But Mr. Scamander is not well. He's refusing to leave," the boy said.</p><p>"I'm coming too!" shouted Queenie as she rounded the corner, running much faster than she should have been able to in those heels.</p><p>"What? How -," Eddie said but Tina cut him off.</p><p>"Can you apparate us there?" she asked.</p><p>"Yes?" he said. He was unsure whether Queenie should be coming along.</p><p>"Do it!," Tina said urgently.</p><p>Suddenly they were standing in a forest. "This way. There's an enchantment around the building." Eddie led her through the trees and in just a few seconds the mansion appeared.</p><p>"Goldstein get in here! Kid absolutely lost it when he saw me. Understandable. Maybe you'll have better luck," said Graves as he emerged from the house.</p><p>"Where is he?" asked Tina.</p><p>"He's in the basement," Graves led Tina down the hall. "What's she doing here?" asked Graves, gesturing to Queenie.</p><p>"Another friendly face can't hurt," said Tina. She took Queenie's hand and pulled her into the house.</p><p>"Fine. Listen we may not have much time. Who knows when Grindelwald will be back and we need to have him out of here and a solid defense set up by then," Graves said.</p><p>Tina nodded and they began their descent down the creaky basement stairs. "Lumos," she whispered. She pointed her wand down in to the basement but Newt was nowhere to be seen. "Newt? It's me . . . Tina. Queenie's here too. Where are you?" she asked into the darkness.</p><p>"Stop it," she heard a small voice say from below her.</p><p>"Newt, are you underneath the stairs?" she asked. There was no reply.</p><p>"Is it okay if we come down there?" she asked. She figured it was polite to ask permission because people hiding underneath staircases in the dark usually wanted to be left alone.</p><p>Before Tina could round the stairs, Tina grabbed her wrist and whispered, "He thinks were imposters. He thinks we're here to hurt him."</p><p>Tina nodded in understanding. They reached the bottom of the staircase and rounded it. Newt was there in the farthest corner, with his knees pulled up to his chest and his hand held up to block the light from Tina's wand. Tina had been holding it together remarkably well but at the sight of the dark bruises on his face and neck, and the way he trembled as he tried to push himself farther back into the corner, she began to fall apart. He wore only a dirty button up shirt and light brown pants. He had no shoes or socks, nor anything else to keep him warm. In upstate New York in the winter time, <em>he must be freezing</em>, Tina thought.</p><p>"The light is hurting his eyes," Queenie said. Tina lowered her wand to point it at the floor, away from Newt's face.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Tina said.</p><p>"Stop. This isn't going to work," said Newt.</p><p>"Newt, what do you mean -."</p><p>"You know what I mean!" Newt cut her off. "If you're going to taunt me, do it with your own face." He was clearly angry. He thought she was <em>him</em>.</p><p>"Newt, I swear . . . It's me . . . It's us," she insisted. "Ask . . . Ask me anything."</p><p>"I'm not playing your game," Newt ground out.</p><p>"Okay . . . You remember when Tina first snuck you and Jacob into our apartment? And you saw that I was a legilimens? The first thing you thought was, I wonder if she can do it with animals. I thought it was very charming but I never said anything about it," said Queenie. "See, how could anyone but me know that?" she asked sweetly.</p><p>Newt's breathing picked up. He was getting more nervous, <em>why?</em></p><p>"Newt please, calm down. We're here to help, to get you out of here. Isn't that a good thing?" Tina asked.</p><p>Newt was becoming more and more agitated. He seemed to be having a panic attack.</p><p>"I can't," he gasped. "I can't leave." He was really struggling now. Queenie was the first to move forward. She could always tell just what people needed. Tina followed her. They knelt down on either side of Newt and took his hands.</p><p>There were tears streaming down his face. He was hyperventilating. Tina wasn't sure what else to do, so she leaned in and kissed him. Tina held the kiss for as long as she could. When she pulled away, Newt seemed to have calmed down a bit. Then he noticed the ring hanging from her neck. His trembling hand pried itself out of hers and gently grasped the ring.</p><p>"This was mine," he said.</p><p>"Yes. You gave it to me, remember?" Tina asked.</p><p>"Yes. I remember . . . It's you. It's . . . It's really you. Both of you," he said looking between Tina and Queenie.</p><p>"It's really us, and we need to get you out of here. Every auror MCUSA has is out there and a few on loan from the ministry! It's gonna be an ambush. We're taking him down for good this time. You need to be gone before he gets back," Tina said. Newt shook his head, more tears fell.</p><p>"No I can't. You don't understand. I . . . I can't leave," he said. His voice dripped with despair.</p><p>"I understand," Queenie said suddenly. Newt looked up at her as if begging her not to hate him. "It's okay. I understand," she said again. She squeezed his hand between bother of hers. "I think, it might be best if we all stay here. If the aurors take him in, or kill him," Queenie said, "then we can let him see you. Well use a sleeping spell. Make it look like we're taking you against your will."</p><p>"What?" Tina asked. <em>Why would we do that?</em> They both ignored her.</p><p>"What if their plan doesn't work? What if he kills them all?!" Newt asked.</p><p>"If that happens . . . We will leave. We'll apparate back to MCUSA without you. He'll never know we were here," Queenie said.</p><p>"Like hell we will!" yelled Tina.</p><p>"Tina!" Queenie said, grabbing her sister's wrist again. Queenie's eyes widened pointedly at Tina as if to convey a message. "<em>Trust</em> me," she said as she squeezed Tina's wrist. Tina shook her head a few times before reluctantly agreeing. Her sister could obviously see this from an angle she could not. Tina had no choice but to trust her.</p><p>"I'll go let Mr. Graves know," said Queenie. She stood and hurried up the stairs.</p><p>"Tina," Newt whispered in the silence. "I'm sorry. I can't leave . . . He can't think I've escaped, or-or- tried to escape. If he thought that . . . You don't know what he would do to me," he choked out. Still more tears fell. "I'm sorry," he said again. "I'm so sorry." He was clearly angry with himself. Tina could never be angry with him. She couldn't imagine what he'd been through, how Grindelwald had tormented him. She still loved him as much as ever.</p><p>She took his face in her hands, gently. The bruises were bad. She imagined there were probably many more under his clothes. She gently kissed each one and with each kiss she drew away some of his fear, self-loathing, and pain. His head leaned back against the wall and he closed his eyes. Her gentle affection was exactly what he needed. She smiled at him and leaned back onto her heels. Then she reached into her coat pocket and pulled out a canteen of water, much too big to have fit in there.</p><p>"Drink some of this," she commanded. He obeyed. He was too thirsty not to. While he was drinking she also pulled out a small blanket. She took the water back, once he'd had enough and then sat down against the same wall as him. She crossed her ankles in front of her. "Lay down and rest," she said, patting her lap. Again, Newt could do nothing but obey, he was so tired. He laid his head on her lap, his knees still pulled up to his chest, and she threw the blanket over him.</p><p>"Tina?" Newt said.</p><p>"Yes?" she replied.</p><p>"I need you to promise me something," he said.</p><p>"Anything," Tina said sincerely. Her fingers gently combed through his hair as they sat there.</p><p>"Don't leave me," he said. His voice cracked.</p><p>"I've been looking for you, all this time. Why would I leave you when I've finally found you?" she asked.</p><p>"You don't know . . .," his voice shook. "The things he's done to me. The things <em>I've</em> done-," Tina cut him off.</p><p>"I don't care. I love you, Newt Scamander. I will <em>always</em> love you. We can get through this," she assured him. He was quiet again.</p><p>Queenie came back down the stairs. "They're all set up. Mr. Graves gave us his okay to stay down here." Queenie sat in front of Newt with her legs folded underneath her. "He understood," she said to Newt, taking his hand and squeezing it. He nodded and squeezed hers back.</p><p><em>Queenie, do the bewitched sleep spell. Hurry. You know I can never make it work</em>, Tina thought directly at her sister. Queenie nodded and pulled out her wand. She pointed it at Newt and uttered the words and Newt fell into a deep sleep.</p>
