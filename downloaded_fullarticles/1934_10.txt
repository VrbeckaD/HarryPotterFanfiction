  <em>What the heck’s up with this floo address?</em>
</p><p>Harry scowled at the scribbled piece of paper that George gave him. <em>Draco sodalitas</em>, it said. Did it <em>have</em> to have Malfoy’s name? Malfoy just <em>ruined</em> dragons for Harry.</p><p>With a pained groan, Harry tossed in the floo powder and called out the address. The floo spat him out onto the softest carpet that was gentle on his knees. But the room itself—empty, and ridiculously opulent, with its shimmering gold-gilt <em>everything</em>.</p><p>There was only one set of double doors leading out of the room. Harry’s gut instinct suddenly told him to be <em>careful</em>. Sure, the twins told him to come here. But…</p><p>Cautiously, Harry approached the doors. With a sparkle of magic, the doors swung open silently.</p><p><br/>

</p><p>Harry’s mouth dropped opened as flowers and sparkles swirled around him. “What the hell?!”</p><p>Front and centre was Draco Malfoy himself, dressed in formal light blue robes, now gasping, a hand politely over his mouth. Pansy Parkinson stood to the side, in a blue suit and clipboard floating beside her. Blaise Zabini stood by the back in dark blue robes, silent, watching.</p><p>And <em>then</em>.</p><p>There was <em>Neville</em> in blue robes and clutching a large potted sentient plant and blushing when Harry met his eyes. And to the other side, two certain twins, George and Fred Weasley in matching blue robes, ears and smirks.</p><p>Harry glared at them. “<em>You</em> two!”</p><p>Parkinson jabbed Malfoy, who stopped gasping behind his hand and started towards Harry, a smile on his face.</p><p>Harry stumbled back. The smile looked <em>good</em>, which meant that it was <em>all wrong</em>.</p><p>“Mister Harry Potter,” Malfoy said, voice all low and velvet soft. “Whom do you prefer? The huggable type? Tall, dark and handsome? A threesome?” Malfoy’s hand suddenly caressed Harry’s face. “Or would you like <em>me</em>?”</p><p>Harry’s cheeks heated up, his ears burning. Malfoy was close enough that Harry could see the different greys <em>in his eyes</em>. He pushed Malfoy back and glared at the twins. “George! Fred! I thought we were going to hang out or something. Not <em>this!</em> I’m going!” Frustrated, Harry swung his arm out, and turned to leave.</p><p>His arm knocked into something.</p><p>That something fell.</p><p>And <em>shattered into a billion gazillion pieces</em>.</p><p>“For Merlin’s sakes,” Harry muttered, drawing out his wand—</p><p>“<em>No!</em>” Malfoy shoved him.</p><p>Parkinson stepped over and examined the aftermath of the crime. She shook her head, sighing. “That costed one-hundred-thousand Galleons, Potter,” she said. “And it <em>cannot</em> be reparioed.”</p><p>Harry tried to edge away, back hitting the closed doors. “Er, what was it?”</p><p>Malfoy turned to him, eyes dark. Paradoxically, Harry relaxed. Now <em>this</em> Malfoy was what Harry was used to!</p><p>“That was <em>my</em> family heirloom artifact charmed for good favour and good health and plentiful gold,” Malfoy growled. “You <em>will</em> pay it back. You’re the heir to the Potter and Black fortunes.”</p><p>Harry straightened and shrugged. “That money’s tied up in <em>charities</em>, which I bet you wouldn’t know about even if they hit you in the face. It’s not like <em>you</em> need any more favour or health or gold <em>anyway</em>. Who the hell <em>cares</em>?”</p><p>Malfoy stalked right up to him, <em>loomed</em> over him with that damnable height difference. “You broke it. You pay it. And you will pay it back with your <em>body</em>.”</p><p>Harry gulped.</p><p>“<em>As the Host Club’s</em> personal elf! For one full year!” With one last glare, Malfoy spun on his heel and stalked off, robes flaring behind him. “Deal with it for me, Pansy,” he said with a raised hand. “I need to prepare for some <em>actual</em> guests.”</p><p>“Can you even do that?” Harry protested.</p><p>Parkinson smirked. “Oh yes we can.”</p><p>Harry tried to catch Neville’s eye.</p><p>Neville flushed, hugged his pot plant. “Sorry, Harry.”</p><p>Harry gasped. “Wait, is that why <em>you’re</em> here? Because you have to pay something back?”</p><p>Neville reddened even more, glancing to Zabini for an unknown reason. “No. Um. Because…”</p><p>Zabini gave Neville a slight nod back.</p><p><em>Riiggght</em>. Harry focused on Fred and George. “This is all your fault!” he said childishly.</p><p>Fred and George laughed. “You should have—”</p><p>“—seen your face!”</p><p>“We didn’t tell you to break Draco’s heirloom!”</p><p>“<em>Argg!</em>” Harry crossed his arms. “I’m going. Right now.” He turned and came face-to-face with a Parkinson with a dark sparkle in her eye.</p><p>“I’ll let you leave <em>for today</em> provided you return tomorrow. However, if you do not pay your debt as our servant, we <em>will</em> take matters into our hands.” She smirked. “How does a dozen book deals about the <em>Life of Harry Potter</em> sound? And a naked Harry Potter calendar for the next ten years—”</p><p>“Erk!” Harry shook his head. “No, no, servant is <em>fine</em>. I’ll be back!”</p><p>Parkinson took a half step back and inclined her head. The doors opened behind him, and Harry made his escape.</p><p>By the time he got home, which he shared with Ron and Hermione, Harry’s heart was thudding in his chest.</p><p>And he shivered, realising what he had gotten himself in to.</p><p>The house was still empty, given that it was only early afternoon. But no way was Harry leaving safety. He was going to <em>wait</em>.</p><p><br/>

</p><p>“Oh, Harry, wow! What’s all this?” Hermione came over for a hello hug.</p><p>Harry blinked up at Hermione and Ron innocently, twiddling his thumbs. In front of him, on the dining table, was half a dozen dishes he had prepared.</p><p>“Looks great, mate,” Ron said. “But something happened, didn’t it? Don’t tell me—it’s Malfoy, isn’t it? We haven’t had a Malfoy crisis in a while, we’re <em>definitely</em> due in for one.”</p><p>Harry groaned dramatically. “It’s Malfoy <em>and</em> Fred and George!”</p><p>Ron looked alarmed. “All three of them?”</p><p>“Tell us,” Hermione said.</p><p>In a rush, Harry vomited the words out, the horrible, disastrous handful of minutes that have changed his life <em>forever</em>.</p><p>“Interesting,” Hermione said, her eyes far away. “Neville mentioned a standing afternoon tea appointment. He’s at this <em>host</em> club?”</p><p>“No <em>wonder</em> the twins promoted me at their shop! So they could go off and do <em>that</em>,” Ron said.</p><p>“Yes, well, that doesn’t help <em>me</em> with my predicament! How am I supposed to pay back a hundred thousand galleons?”</p><p>“Unfortunately, Parkinson is correct. The fastest way to make that money back is if you capitalise on your fame,” Hermione said, patting Harry sympathetically.</p><p>“It would take you a long time to earn that working at the Wheezes,” Ron said. “A lot longer than a year.”</p><p>“Sit tight,” Hermione said. “We’ll see what we can do. It’s not like you’re currently employed or busy, Harry,” she added, giving Harry a look.</p><p>Harry winced, feeling the jab through his heart.</p><p>“But for now...<em>Neville’s</em> there,” Hermione continued. “Nothing bad’s going to happen with him around. And I’m almost sure that the twins won’t do anything illegal.”</p><p>“Not very motivating,” Harry mumbled.</p><p>Ron slapped on him on the back. “Hey, if nothing else, you’d have a <em>lot</em> of stories to tell us. With Fred and George around, I bet stupid shit’s going to happen.”</p><p>“And Malfoy,” Harry added.</p><p>Ron gave him a weird look. “Right. And Malfoy.” Ron clapped his hands together. “Okay, Harry’s crisis temporarily solved. Can we have dinner now?”</p><p><br/>
