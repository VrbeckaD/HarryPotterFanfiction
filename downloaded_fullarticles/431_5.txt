  <span>“Gods-damned mother fucking Albus Dumbledore!” James Potter muttered as he took in the date on the paper before him on the Headmaster’s desk. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>
    <em>02 May 1998</em>
  </b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The last time he had read the Daily Prophet it had been the morning of Halloween in 1981. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He had been in hiding with Lily and Harry when Dumbledore, one of the only people who was privy to their Secret Kept location, had come to visit. Leaving Lily to watch Harry play on his toy broomstick, the two wizards had disillusioned themselves and walked down the lane to Bathilda Bagshot’s house and entered her back garden. James had been confused when he saw John Smith, member of the Order of the Phoenix that was about a hundred and twenty, standing there, but trusted Dumbledore completely so didn’t ask questions. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The next thing he knew, Dumbledore had shot a full body-bind curse at him before he toppled onto his back and had to listen as his trusted mentor explained to John the way to take Polyjuice potion and the answers to the questions James and Lily had set up to verify their identities. James wanted to holler in pain as Dumbledore reached down and pulled a handful of hair from his head. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He watched in horror as John added them to a large flask before taking a drink and doubling over in pain as his body morphed from his hunched over, age spotted, balding self, into the perfect image of James - messy black hair and all. A few spells later, and John’s clothes and been transfigured by Dumbledore to match James’. There was nothing he could do but wait as the two men left the garden. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>What felt like an hour later, but may have only been a few minutes, he almost cried out in pain as Dumbledore — biggest fucking wanker in the world — walked back into the garden, stopping only when he had trod on James’ still disillusioned arm. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Sorry about that,” Dumbledore said, stepping back and grinning. “Didn’t see you there.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James had never understood until that moment what it meant to truly hate someone. Hate them so much that he would be able to cast </span>
  <em>
    <span>Avada </span>
  </em>
  <span>and be happy when it worked. Aurors were taught to use the curse, had to practice it on training dummies, but his had always been weak. He didn’t have the hate in his heart needed to power the spell. Dumbledore had changed that the moment he tricked James this afternoon. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Voldemort will attack your family tonight. I know it will sound cruel, but it has to happen. The only way to get rid of him is if the prophecy is fulfilled.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Prophecy? What prophecy? </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“He will try to kill Harry, but don’t worry, he will live.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>A mad man is going to try to kill my son and you tell me not to </span>
  </em>
  <span>worry</span>
  <em>
    <span>? You’re crazier than I thought!</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Lilly will have to die though. The only way to win the war is if she sacrifices her life for Harry.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Lily is going to die? My Lily? The woman I have loved since the first moment I saw her on the Hogwarts Express? </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“But Harry will be safe. He will go to live with Petunia and her husband. They will raise him until it is time for him to go to Hogwarts.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Petunia? Why in the hell would that frigid bitch raise Harry? What are you going to do to me?</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I know you hate her, but that is what Harry will need. To be raised by people who will teach him to be humble. Merlin knows you never were.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>To be humble? What are they going to do to him? Petunia’s husband has more pride than the entire Black family. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I just need everyone to think you are dead for a bit. But once Voldemort is killed for good, you will be good as new.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Dead for a bit? And just how are you going to manage that? </span>
  </em>
  <span>A light bulb went off in James’ head. </span>
  <em>
    <span>That is what the Polyjuice was for. That man is going to get killed in his place. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I invented a potion from the Philosopher's Stone with Nicolas Flamel. It will put you into a sort of animated suspension. You won’t age or die, or even get sick. Once Voldemort is gone for good, you will be good as new. It shouldn’t take me more than a few weeks to figure it out. I am quite brilliant.” The fucker smiled to himself as he took a sweet from his pocket and popped it in his mouth. “I have arranged a room for you at Hogwarts so I can make sure you are safe.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>That had been over 16 years ago. James had spent the time completely unaware of his surroundings. He had woken up and looked out the small window in his room a little after dawn. It had taken him until the sun was high in the sky to find the loose brick in the wall that allowed him to leave his prison. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He had been afraid he would have no muscle mass after being asleep for that long, but when he took his first step, he noticed everything was in the same working order it had been before. He still had the small bruise on his wand hand from where Harry had bit him the night before Dumbledore arrived. James walked down a flight of stairs and found himself coming out of a hidden wall behind the Headmaster’s desk. He had no way of knowing how much time had passed until he glanced at the paper on the desk before him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Voldemort is dead!</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Harry Potter triumphs!</b>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry Potter? His little Harry? But the picture in the paper showed, not his infant son, but a grown man with looks similar to his. James fell back into the desk’s chair as he realised he and his son were less than four years apart in age. Dumbledore said he wouldn’t age, which meant he was still twenty-one and Harry would be seventeen, almost eighteen by now. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James devoured the paper, learning everything he could. The entire edition, thicker than he ever remembered, was filled with stories of what had happened since the night Voldemort had attacked their house in Godric’s Hollow. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>There was an old interview that Harry had given, begging the world to believe him that Voldemort was back a whole year before Fudge would admit it. </span>
  <em>
    <span>The man always was an idiot.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Reading the article of Dumbledore’s death felt bittersweet. Right now he wanted to kill the son of a bludger, but before he had cursed James and left Lily to die, James had respected him. Shock coursed through him when he read Severus Snape had killed him. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Guess I owe Snivillus my thanks.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Four pages summarised details of the battle that had taken place the night before. James didn’t try to stop the tears as he saw Remus Lupin’s name listed among the fatalities. They had almost stopped until he read that Sirius had died two years before. He almost set the entire room on fire as he read about his best friend — his brother— serving time in prison for a crime Dumbledore </span>
  <em>
    <span>knew </span>
  </em>
  <span>he didn’t commit. He also felt angry that someone had already killed the traitorous bastard Peter.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He pushed the thoughts of Peter away as he saw his own name listed along with Lily’s as the reason Voldemort ‘died’ the first time. He gave himself over to the pain of losing his love. His heart felt as if it would fall out of his chest as he realised he would never see her again. He pulled his wand from his pocket and pressed it against his temple. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James closed his eyes and let the anger of Peter’s betrayal, the deaths of his wife, brother, and best friend fill his mind. He remembered the way he felt when Dumbledore hexed him. Taking a deep breath, he readied himself to cast the Killing Curse; the only thing that would bring him relief. He opened his eyes, and was halfway through the first word when his eyes fell to the still open paper. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>There was his reason to live. Harry, smiling up at him from multiple pictures on the page. James opened his hand, allowing his wand to drop onto the desk. His eyes took a long time to leave the pictures of Harry, normally surrounded by the same two people, another young man, and a beautiful witch. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Harry! I have to see Harry.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The door to the office opened, and James grabbed his wand again, casting a </span>
  <em>
    <span>Protego </span>
  </em>
  <span>seconds before two stunners came flying towards his face as two people entered.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Wait!” he yelled, keeping his shield up, but raising one hand towards them. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Who are you? How did you get in here?” the woman shouted at him. It took James a moment to see past the extra lines on her face and grey in her hair.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Minnie? It’s me, James Potter.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“James Potter has been dead for over fifteen years,” Professor McGonagall spat. “Who are you?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I promise, it’s me. Dumbledore cursed me so I wouldn’t wake until after Voldemort died.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What is something only James would know?” the black skinned man that James thought looked familiar but couldn’t place, standing behind her asked in a deep voice. Minerva turned to James, her eyebrow raised in question.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“In my seventh year I came to your office drunk, called you Mummy and asked for a spanking,” James said quickly and smirked as Minerva’s face turned red. “Sirius was with me and we had detention with Professor Kettleburn for a week, mucking Hippogriff shit out of the stables.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I should have spanked you for all the good shoveling manure did you,” Minvera muttered. “There has to be another way to check.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I understand. I will take Veritaserum, anything. I just want to see Harry.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Floppy!” Minerva called and an old house-elf popped into the room.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What is you doings out of bed?” the elf’s high voice called. “Master Dumby is saying you are not to be waked.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Floppy, do you know who that is and why he is here?” Minerva asked. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I is keeping Master Dumby’s secrets. He is putting hims to sleep.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Who was put to sleep, Floppy?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Him,” she pointed at James. “Master Dumby is saying that young Potter is need to be with Muggles so he is putting other Potter to sleep. Master Dumby be asking Floppy to check on him. I be changing his sheets.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“When did this happen?” the man asked.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Long times ago. Same night Harry Potter is killing the evil man the first times.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Thank you for your help, Floppy,” James said. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Floppy, I need Veritaserum from Headmaster Snape’s stores. Please bring me some.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They waited as the elf popped out of the room, then reappeared holding a small bottle of clear liquid. She bowed to them before popping out of the room again. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Shouldn’t Harry be here for this?” James asked. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I need to make sure it is you before I get his hopes up,” Minerva spoke quietly before clearing her throat. “Set your wand down and kick it away from you. I am not taking any chances.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James watched as Minerva pocketed her own wand and the black man did the same. Dropping his shield, he set his wand on the ground and kicked it towards the man who picked it up.  James watched as Minerva conjured a cup of tea before dripping three drops of the potion into it and handing it to him. James used his tongue to test the temperature before drinking it all in three gulps. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you know where you are?” Minerva asked.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the Headmaster’s office, Scotland, United Kingdom, Europe, Planet Earth,” James said.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Still a cocky bastard then,” the other man’s deep voice said with a chuckle.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you know who we are?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You are Minerva ‘Minnie’ McGonagall, my favourite professor. The man looks familiar, but I can’t remember his name.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“This is Kingsley Shacklebolt. Acting Minister for Magic.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I can’t believe you forgot me, Potter. We went through Auror training together,” Kingsley said. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, fuck me. You got old,” James said. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Not all of us can live for sixteen years and not age.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What is your name?” Minerva continued with her questions.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“James Fleamont Potter.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Who were your parents?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Fleamont and Euphemia Potter. But our friends called them Flea and Mia.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What is your animagus form?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh shit, you know about that?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, I know about it. Now what form is it?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“A stag.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What was your nickname in school?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Prongs.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What is your son’s name?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Harry James Potter.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Where was he born?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Harry,” James said. He could feel the potion wearing off but smiled at this question because it was something only a few people knew, “was born in a little cottage in the Scottish Highlands. Lily and I were visiting our favourite professor. When said professor admitted to an affair with a well known International Quidditch player, Lily went into labour. Harry was delivered by Madame Pomfrey on your bed, Minerva. Lily and I sent you new sheets as an apology.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You’re really alive?” Minerva asked, tears in her eyes. She moved towards him before throwing her arms around his shoulders. “I can’t believe you’re actually alive! I am so happy to see you.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Happy enough to give me that spanking, Minny?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, you!” Minerva said through her tears as she pulled back from him. She placed her hand on his cheek. “I’m glad you’re back. You keep me young.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Welcome back, James,” Kingsley said, smiling. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Thanks.” James moved towards Kingsley and wrapped his old friend in a hug. “It’s good to see you. Minister, eh? Must be slim pickings if they let you be in charge.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“There is a lot of work to be done, but I am up to the task until there is an official election held.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Can I see Harry now?” James asked. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“He just went up to Gryffindor tower to sleep before we came up here,” Minerva explained. “In case you didn’t see, he and his friends broke into a bank yesterday morning, before coming here and killing Voldemort. Needless to say, the boy will be asleep for a while.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Is there anything I can help with while we wait for him to wake up?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“The castle will need a lot of work, and most of us are tired. Any help you can give restoring the castle would be wonderful.” Minerva paused. “Would it be okay if I change your appearance until it is time to see Harry?”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Only if you promise to make me look like your lover,” James said with a wink. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James smiled as he caught a look of himself in the broken window before him. Instead of making him look like her long ago lover, Minerva had disguised him to look like an old Scottish man. He had long, wiry grey hair, a pudgy stomach, and was dressed in a dark grey and blue kilt. Cheeky witch had vanished his shorts and told him he needed ‘to look traditional’.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James had started his restoration work by going to the dungeons, thinking he would work his way from bottom to top. There was no damage this far down and he hoped there would be more places in the castle that had escaped the ravishes of war. The ground floor was already being worked on by large groups of people so he slowly made his way up the stairs, continuing on as he saw people fixing each floor. Finally, she made his way to the fifth floor before finding a corridor that was empty but in need of repairs.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The work repairing the castle wasn’t too hard. The damage caused by normal hexes and curses were easily fixed with a </span>
  <em>
    <span>Reparo. </span>
  </em>
  <span>The areas that were damaged by dark magic would take a lot more work, and while James was trained on how to do it, he focused on taking care of all the easy fixes first, in case he needed assistance on the other areas. Some dark magic took two or more people to remove before they could fix it. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He was watching part of the wall repair itself when the door next to him opened and he swung his arm around, jabbing his wand under the girl’s chin. He felt a sharp sting as her wordless hex hit him in the arse. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Fuck!” James yelped. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Move your wand, or the next one is a slicing hex to your bollocks,” she growled.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>James pulled his wand back quickly; death was preferable to being an eunuch. He turned and his stomach dropped. He was staring into the eyes of the most beautiful human he had ever seen. Nothing in the world mattered but the goddess in front of him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He felt his magic in a tangible way he had never felt before. James watched in amazement as it seemed to leave his body; a red shimmering mist that hovered between them. The woman’s eyes were wide as his magic mixed with the blue haze that had left her. The two clouds turned a bright purple before splitting and he felt a new kind of magic enter his body. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Who are you?” James asked. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hermione Granger. And unless I’m mistaken, I’m your soulmate.” </span>
</p>
