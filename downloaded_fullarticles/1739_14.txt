  <em>Professor Snape</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I understand that you disliked my father, but my mother was your friend. As her son I am asking for your help. Please.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I don’t trust Dumbledore, he left me with Petunia, he insists that I go back there every year, even though I’ve told him about Vernon, he beats me, whips me and I’m basically starved there. I’ve more broken bones than unbroken ones. I’ve never seen a doctor or a healer. Ever. Dumbledore knows this. But he keeps sending me back. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Someone put my name in the goblet and now Voldemort is back. I will happily swear on whatever you want if it will let you believe that. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Fawkes likes me and he and the sorting hat have told me lots of things. Things that Dumbledore doesn’t want me to know.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I need help if I’m going to survive two powerful wizards and a fat muggle trying to kill me. Please, professor. Please meet with me and let me show you what I know.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I’m scared, professor. I don’t want to die and fawkes says that’s what Dumbledore plans for me.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Please help.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Harry</em>
