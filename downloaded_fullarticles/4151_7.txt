    <p>Bill Denbrough can’t remember the last time he’s felt so excited about school. He’s standing in the middle of a crowded terminal in Portland International Airport. Terminal 19<sup>1/2</sup> to be exact. He’s rarely ever left Derry, his tiny middle-of-nowhere hometown, and on any other day he would’ve been more excited just being in an airport for the first time. </p><p>But today, he’s about to go to a magic school, where magical people learn to do magic. And <em>he’s</em> one of those magical people. It sounds so crazy he’s half-convinced the past month has been some kind of lucid dream. The owl-delivered letter, the shopping trip he’d went on with his father to buy spell books and cauldrons… It all feels like something out of a bedtime story he’d make up for Georgie. </p><p>The terminal is filled with children and adults, some in normal clothes and others wearing thick robes. Owls and ravens are zipping around overhead, and cats are expertly weaving past people’s legs. Outside the terminal window, Bill can see a crimson airplane with blue streaks that seems far too small to carry dozens of students.  </p><p>“Bill!” </p><p>Bill turns towards the voice, and in the crowd he can make out a short boy waving at him, hair styled into a perfect quiff and familiar fanny pack wrapped around his waist.</p><p>“Hey Eddie!”</p><p>He grins at the sight of his best friend and holds up a hand in greeting as Eddie runs over to him. The Denbroughs had offered to give Eddie a lift to the airport, but Mrs. Kaspbrak had stubbornly refused. She’d wanted to say goodbye to her “sweet little Eddie Bear” in person, and the Denbroughs’ tiny car wouldn’t have fit all of them.</p><p>“You have no idea how glad I am to see you. I <em>just</em> managed to get away from my mom.”</p><p>Over his friend’s shoulder, Bill can see an anxious Mrs. Kaspbrak eyeing her son like a hawk, as though debating whether or not it’s too late to drag Eddie back to Derry. </p><p>“L-l-let’s get on the p-plane before she d-d-decides to change her m-mind.”</p><p>The two of them quickly board, and are shocked to discover the interior is nothing like that of a normal plane. For starters, the inside of the plane looks at least three times larger than from the outside. Instead of rows of seats, the long corridor is outfitted with spacious compartments that would fit right in on a high-class train.</p><p>“Magic”, Eddie states simply, completely awestruck.</p><p>“Y-y-yeah. Magic.”</p><p>The two are knocked out of their stupor when a group of irritated older students try to push pass them. Bill and Eddie stow away their luggage, then set off to find an empty compartment before more students come through. Their search doesn’t take long, as a bespectacled boy with wild dark hair waves at them from his seat.</p><p>“Hey! You guys need somewhere to sit?”</p><p>Bill and Eddie gratefully enter the compartment, narrowly avoiding the stampede of other students. They take a seat across the bespectacled boy, who’s joined by a lanky, curly-haired boy already dressed in his red-and-blue school robes. </p><p>“Wait a sec. Dude, are you wearing a fanny pack?” the bespectacled boy asks, pointing at Eddie’s waist.</p><p>“Uh, yeah. Something wrong with that?”</p><p>“I thought the only people who wear those things are senior citizens and tourists –”</p><p>“I’m Stanley by the way,” the curly-haired boy hastily interrupts. “And this idiot is Richie.”</p><p>“B-Bill. And th-th-this is Eddie.”</p><p>“Why do you talk like that?” Richie asks, prompting Stanley to immediately elbow his friend. </p><p>“I-i-it’s fine. I just h-have a st-stutter.” Bill, who has come to expect the same question every time he meets new people, isn’t terribly bothered by Richie’s lack of tact.  </p><p>Eddie, who has always been defensive of his best friend, is glaring daggers at Richie when a pleasant voice starts speaking over the intercom.</p><p>“Ladies and gentlemen, this is your chief flight attendant. On behalf of Captain Mantell and the entire crew, welcome aboard Ilvermorny Airlines, Flight 19<sup>1/2</sup>, non-stop service from Portland to Massachusetts…”</p><p>Bill tunes out the rest of the announcement, which is mostly going over safety regulations and flight conditions, and braces himself for turbulence; his father, the only one in the family who’s been out of state, explained that takeoff was always the most unpleasant part of a plane ride. To his surprise, there’s no sudden jolt of movement as the plane takes off. In fact, the small lurch he feels is no worse than a starting car.  He offhandedly wonders if the plane is enchanted somehow to make the ride feel smoother. Out the window, Bill can make out Georgie eagerly waving to him as the scenery of the terminal zooms by, followed by the rapidly shrinking landscape of Portland, and soon enough all he can see is an endless sea of clouds. </p><p>“It’s b-beautiful,” Bill says aloud, scooching over so Eddie can look outside as well. “I’ve n-n-never ridden a p-p-plane before.”</p><p>“And to think my parents are always complaining about No-Majs,” Richie says. “Getting to Ilvermorny was a complete mess before they invented airplanes.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Eddie asks.</p><p>“It was a <em>literal</em> mess,” Stanley says. “Nowadays, the school just sends airplanes all over the continent to pick up students, but before that everyone had to use Portkeys. My grandparents keep telling me to be grateful I didn’t attend Ilvermorny in the 1800s.”</p><p>“Er, P-P-Portkey?”</p><p>“They had to teleport to school,” Richie explains. “Problem is that using a Portkey when you’re too young can make you super sick. So, like, a third of the students would spend the first week of school vomiting everywhere.”</p><p>“That’s disgusting,” Eddie says with a visible shudder.</p><p>“Not as disgusting as your mom,” Richie replies conversationally.</p><p>“…<em>What</em>?”</p><p>Eddie stares at Richie with his mouth agape, looking so scandalized that Bill has to stop himself from giggling.  Richie laughs and holds his hand up to Stanley for a high five, who simply rolls his eyes and grabs his wrist, pulling his hand back down. </p><p>“I don’t know how I’m going to survive if we’re Sorted into the same House,” Stanley groans.</p><p>“W-w-what’s the deal w-with the whole S-Sorting thing, anyway?” Bill asks. </p><p>“You guys don’t know about the Sorting?” </p><p>“Not really. Bill’s a No-Maj-Born,” Eddie says, still glaring at Richie. “I’m Half-Blood, but I didn’t actually know I was a wizard until I got my letter.”</p><p>“Hey, no worries! Stan and I are both Pure-Bloods. Stick with us and we’ll show you the ropes,” Richie boasts. </p><p>Stanley elbows Richie again and promptly launches into an explanation of the Sorting. Apparently, the student body is divided and sorted into one of four houses, each prizing a certain quality. Horned Serpent, which favours the scholarly. Wampus, which favours warriors. Thunderbird, which favours the adventurous. And Pukwudgie, which favours healers. </p><p>Richie exclaims that he’s definitely going to end up in either Wampus or Thunderbird, and that Stanley will end up in Horned Serpent (“Because you’re a complete <em>nerd</em>, Stan the Man.”). Eddie, meanwhile, has no idea what House he wants to be in, and when asked, Bill honestly states he doesn’t mind where he ends up so long as he has friends with him. </p><p>“Aw, you’re making me blush Bill!” Richie laughs, reaching over to playfully punch his shoulder.</p><p>Bill and Eddie then ask Richie and Stanley about magic, since they both belonged to all-magical families, but it turns out they aren’t that much more knowledgeable on the subject. Stanley says that kids aren’t allowed to perform magic, or even receive a wand at all, until they enter Ilvermorny. </p><p>At one point, a uniformed woman comes by pushing a cart full of snacks and Richie immediately buys a massive armful of assorted candy, eagerly insisting that Bill and Eddie have to try them all. Bill has a blast testing all the unfamiliar treats, such as the Rainbow Pops that stain his tongue appropriately, the Bubblegum Balloons that can be blown up to the size of a basketball, and the Every Flavour Beans, which are quite aptly named. Bill gets one that tastes like caramel, while Eddie spits his out, claiming it tastes like spinach.</p><p>Stanley stops him from eating the Tacky Taffies, explaining that they’ll glue his mouth shut for an hour, and that he usually gives them to Richie whenever he’s being too loud. And Eddie refuses to touch the multi-coloured Jelly Worms, which wriggle about like real worms. Richie spends the next five minutes flailing a handful of the worms in Eddie’s face as the shorter boy shrieks at him to stop. </p><p>It’s not until Stanley forcibly shoves a Tacky Taffy in Richie’s mouth that they get a moment of peace, and the rest of the flight passes without incident. </p>
<p></p><center>
  <p> ----------</p>
</center><p>Unlike the rest of the student body, who get to Ilvermorny by carriage, the first-years have to reach the school by hiking up the mountain trail on foot. To build character and give the students a chance to experience the unique, literally magical ecology of Mount Greylock. At least that’s what the aging groundskeeper, Mr. Daggett, claims.</p><p>Meanwhile, all Eddie can think about is the probability of hiking-related fatalities. </p><p>“R-r-relax Eddie,” Bill says, quickly noticing his discomfort. “M-Mr. D-Daggett said n-n-new students d-do this every year, s-so I’m sure it’s s-safe.”</p><p>“…Right,” Eddie replies, not entirely convinced. He tries to keep his anxiety under control as they climb up the aged, cobblestone steps. In the distance, they can just barely see the granite walls of Ilvermorny above the treeline.</p><p>Richie had been the most excited about the hike, eager to catch a glimpse of a fantastic beast, something like a dragon or a hippogriff. A half hour into the trek, however, they have yet to see anything more interesting than a small, blue-feathered bird, and Richie just seems bored by the whole ordeal. </p><p>“And here we see a specimen of the indigenous bluebird,” Richie says in an absolutely awful Australian accent. “Which, I should point out, is neither magical nor interesting in any way.”</p><p>“Actually, that’s a Jobberknoll. You can tell by the iridescent down. Their feathers are used to make Memory Potions,” Stanley replies distractedly, sharp eyes intently observing the woods.  “And shut up Richie. You’re going to scare away all the animals.” </p><p>Richie sticks his tongue out at his friend, not that Stanley seems to notice or care.</p><p>“Hey Stan, why don’t we blow this popsicle stand and go on a little off-road hike? Satisfy that bird-watching boner of yours. Bet there’re way cooler things deeper in the forest”.</p><p>Already tired and annoyed, Eddie finds himself speaking before Stanley can reply. </p><p>“Are you kidding me? Like, over a hundred people die every year while hiking. Plus, who knows how many diseases or dangerous animals are out there? Why the heck would anyone want to spend their time wandering around the woods?”</p><p>Evidently, speaking up was a mistake. Richie grins obnoxiously, his face lighting up with unbridled glee, like he was just waiting for someone to take the bait. </p><p>“Beats spending it inside of your mother!”</p><p>“Okay, that wasn’t funny the first time you said it, and it <em>definitely</em> isn’t funny the second time!”</p><p>“Beep beep, Richie,” Stanley says, rolling his eyes. “Quit bugging Eddie.”</p><p>Richie, of course, ignores his friend and casually drapes an arm over Eddie’s shoulders.</p><p>“Hey! Get your hands off me!”</p><p>“Oh, lighten up!” Richie laughs. “I’m just messing with you, Eds.” </p><p>“And don’t call me that!”</p><p>There’s a brief struggle as Eddie tries to push the other boy off, but, being shorter and lighter, he only ends up throwing himself off balance. He yelps when he feels his feet slip on the stone steps, and instinctively grabs at the other boy’s robes in his panic. </p><p>“Dude, watch it!” </p><p>“Eddie!” </p><p>There’s a horrible swooping feeling in Eddie’s gut as he falls backward and tumbles off the trail, and he has barely enough time to twist himself around so he lands on his arms and not the back of his head.</p><p>“Eddie! Are y-you okay!?”</p><p>The impact isn’t quite as painful as Eddie expected, but to his horror, he realizes that he’s landed in a damp, muddy ditch. He can feel mud seeping into his robes and he shrieks, his mind racing through a list of all the terrible diseases that are undoubtedly festering in the dirt and grime. </p><p>In seconds, Bill has rushed down the trail to help him. To Eddie’s surprise, Richie quickly follows him, along with an exasperated Stanley. They all try to pull him out of the dirty hole he’s fallen into, which they realize too late is some sort of burrow. A horde of angry fairy-like creatures immediately fly out and attack them, eager to draw blood with their sharp claws. Bill is able to pull Eddie back onto his feet, but not before the tiny creatures have viciously scratched their exposed hands and faces.  </p><p>“Get them off! Get them off!” Eddie screams as the four of them swat at the air, trying to keep their attackers at bay. By now, Mr. Daggett and the rest of the first-years realize something is amiss, and the groundskeeper runs down to help. </p><p>Thankfully, Mr. Daggett manages to chase the creatures off quickly enough, but Eddie flushes bright red in shame when he sees the rest of the firsts years giggling at them. He’s certain that without Bill there to comfort him, he’d have suffered a full-blown panic attack then and there from the embarrassment. </p><p>“See, Stanny-boy? Now that was <em>way</em> more interesting than a Jobbyknob.”</p><p>And that is how, on the first day of school, a loudmouthed moron with bug-eye glasses pushed Eddie into a nest of Doxy eggs.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p> ----------</p>
</center>“C’mon dude. It was an accident!”<p>“You pushed me off the trail!”</p><p>“Well maybe that wouldn’t have happened if you hadn’t overreacted!”</p><p>They’re standing in the middle of the Great Hall, covered in scratches and their robes caked with dried mud. Eddie has yet to stop glaring at Richie, and is struggling to think of a scathing enough retort when he’s cut short by the start-of-year assembly. The first years are addressed by the Headmaster, a gangly, silver-haired man named Professor Callahan, but the four of them are barely paying attention to his speech. </p><p>Now resolutely ignoring Richie, Eddie pulls out his travel-sized bottle of cleaning alcohol from the fanny pack under his robes and fervently begins cleaning out the scratches on his arms, nose wrinkled with concentration. Once he’s done, he holds his hand out to Bill, silently demanding he roll up his sleeves. The older boy sighs in exasperation, but has a fond smile on his face as he complies and lets Eddie clean his wounds, knowing that he won’t be pleased until he’s certain that Bill’s optimal health is ensured.</p><p>Eddie is about to offer the alcohol to the other two boys, but he sees Stanley is already cleaning his own cuts with a travel-sized bottle of hand sanitizer. Eddie silently nods to himself in approval; Stanley had apologized profusely for Richie’s idiocy as they walked the rest of the way up the mountain, and Eddie had quickly decided he liked the curly-haired boy much better than his annoying friend. </p><p>Unfortunately, they aren’t able to do anything about their filthy clothes, which seems to be bothering Stanley immensely. </p><p>“I can’t believe I’m about to go through the Sorting ceremony covered in dirt and blood,” he says, hands wringing anxiously and face scrunched up in disgust. </p><p>“B-beats being c-covered in v-v-vomit, right?” Bill says, concern in his voice. The joke comes off more awkward than intended due to his stutter, but Stanley gives him an appreciative, if strained, smile nonetheless. </p><p>Eddie, meanwhile, suddenly gets the horrible thought maybe none of the houses will want him. If he’s realized anything from the first-years’ hike, it’s that he’s not particularly smart or adventurous, he sure as heck isn’t a brave warrior, and he’s definitely more a victim than a healer. He almost asks Stanley whether it’s possible for a student to be rejected by all four houses, but the Headmaster starts calling out the first-years’ names before he can voice his concerns. </p><p>Professor Callahan goes through the alphabetical list of students, and Bill is one of the first to get called up. Not nearly as bothered by his dishevelled state as Eddie or Stanley, Bill eagerly makes his way to the centre of the chamber, overlooked by four massive wooden statues. He’s barely had time to stand on the podium when the statue of what resembles a large mountain lion roars triumphantly. </p><p>“Wampus!” the Headmaster calls out. </p><p>A round of applause follows from the older students, and Eddie claps as loud as he can as a beaming Bill goes to join the rest of his Housemates. </p><p>It isn’t long before the Headmaster reaches Eddie’s name, and he nearly trips on his way up to the podium. He stands motionless, sweating bullets, and can’t help but think the four statues look particularly intimidating from this angle, surrounding him and looking down on him. A few seconds of silence pass, which feel like an eternity from his perspective. </p><p>Eddie doesn’t think it took nearly this long for any of the other students to get sorted. He starts to feel a familiar sense of panic overtake him and is about to take his inhaler out of his fanny pack, when the statue of the strange, goblin-like creature stirs and points its bow into the air.</p><p>“Pukwudgie!” the Headmaster exclaims, and the other students cheer politely, Bill clapping with the most enthusiasm. Chest still tight with nerves and eager to get out of the spotlight, Eddie rushes off the podium to join his new House. He sits down next to a taller, dark-skinned boy in his year, and desperately wills himself to stop blushing. </p><p>He’s so wracked with nerves it takes him a second to realize he’s not in the same house as his best friend, and he shoots Bill a worried glance from across the hall. Sensing his distress, Bill gives him a thumbs up and a reassuring smile, and Eddie does his best to get his breathing back to a stable pace. </p><p>The rest of the Sorting passes quickly and Richie’s predictions prove to be spot-on, as the bespectacled boy ends up in Thunderbird while Stanley gets sorted into Horned Serpent. The first-years then get herded into a separate chamber, where a small, ancient woman in heavy robes is standing on a stage. Beside her is a long, narrow table with hundreds of rectangular wooden boxes organized into neat rows. The Headmaster introduces the woman as Ms. Dubativo, a celebrated wandmaker, and explains this is where they’ll finally receive their wands. The first-years start whispering to each other excitedly until the robed woman starts calling out their names.</p><p>Again, Bill is the first student to get called up, and this time he’s nearly vibrating with excitement. Not that Eddie can blame him, as he feels much the same way; they’re only about to get their freaking <em>wands</em> after all. </p><p>Ms. Dubativo scrutinizes Bill for a moment, then takes out a wand from one of the many boxes. </p><p>“Holly and dragon heartstring, ten and a quarter inches, quite rigid…” she mutters, more to herself than to Bill.</p><p>Bill reaches for the wand, but almost instantly the elderly woman snatches it back and returns it to the box.</p><p>“No no no, not right at all… How about…?” Ms. Dubativo hands Bill another wand, not that he can really tell what the difference is between the two. “Ash and unicorn hair, eleven inches, reasonably pliable…”</p><p>Bill takes hold of the wand, and his face lights up with amazement when a stream of golden sparks shoot out from its tip. The other students all gasp in wonder, and he shares an awestruck grin with Eddie before he sits back down with his House, new wand in hand. </p><p>This time, Eddie rushes forward with excitement rather than nerves when his name is called. He tries not to bounce in place as Ms. Dubativo looks him up and down, then hands him one of her many wands. Like with Bill, the wandmaker quickly takes back the first few. The Oak and phoenix feather wand is a bust, as is the Ash and jackalope antler, as well as the Cedar and dittany stalk.</p><p>Eddie is tapping his feet impatiently by the time Ms. Dubativo picks out the fourth wand, a thoughtful expression on her wrinkled face.  </p><p>“Hm… Perhaps… Not a common core material, to be sure, and rather stubborn, but…”</p><p>She holds out yet another wand, and Eddie reaches for it hesitantly, half expecting it to be snatched out his grasp once more.  </p><p>“Nine and a half inches, springy. Hawthorn and Thunderbird tail feather.”</p><p>“Uh, I’m in Pukwudgie, actually.”</p><p>Ms. Dubativo stares directly into his eyes, giving him an odd, unsettling look. Eddie feels like she’s staring straight into his soul, and suppresses a shiver. “Mr. Kaspbrak, wands are not so simple as to favour a witch or wizard from a particular House.”</p><p>And it seems the wandmaker is correct, because the second Eddie touches the wand, it’s tip glows with a beautiful, near-blinding silver light. Eddie can distantly hear the other students clapping in the background, but he barely registers the noise over his own amazement. </p><p>“…Hawthorn wands are not easily mastered. You may have gained a powerful ally today, Mr. Kaspbrak.”</p><p>With that final comment, Ms. Dubativo shoos him off the stage so the next eager first-year can come up, leaving Eddie thoroughly confused; why did she refer to the wand as though it’s a person? 

</p><p>In any case, Eddie is far too ecstatic over his wand to ponder the cryptic remark for long. He remembers when the letter of enrollment first came, delivered by an owl no less. He remembers learning that his mother, of all people, was actually a witch this whole time. He remembers how upset he’d been at his mother’s secrecy, and his mother telling him she’d only kept this whole other world a secret because she loves him and wanted to protect him. </p><p>“<em>You love your mommy too, don’t you dear? </em>” she’d asked, the familiar hint of a demand under her sweet tone.</p><p>“<em>…yes mommy</em>,” Eddie had replied, ever the dutiful son.</p><p>He remembers arguing with his mother for the first time in his life, begging to be allowed to attend Ilvermorny. Promising to take all his medication, to keep his inhaler in hand at all times, to write home every week. He remembers how his mother had only relented after writing to Ilvemorny, and the school had assured her that they would do everything in their power to accommodate Eddie’s condition.</p><p>Now, with his wand in hand, Eddie knows that he’d been right to stand his ground for once. There’s a tingling, comforting warmth radiating from his wand, and he feels like he’s been reunited with a part of himself that he’s never even noticed was missing. A feeling of <em>rightness</em> that he’s rarely experienced in his life. At this moment, Eddie’s not a frail, sickly little boy covered in dirt and Doxy scratches. </p><p>He’s a <em>wizard</em>.</p>
