    <p>James Potter had been <em> nouveau riche </em>, sort of. Courtesy of his grandfather, the potions tycoon. Did third generation count as new money? Doubtless. Anyhow, new money or old money, Harry had never dreamed of inheriting a vault of gold when he was eleven, when he walked head-down along the lanes of Little Whinging looking for pound coins. Normally he just found the bigger, shinier 10p and 2p, but sometimes the young queen’s scratched up face winked back at him, and he’d try to buy sweets off kids at school.</p><p>He knew James and Lily Potter had lived in Godric’s Hollow, in an old cottage that was a shell now. It was an inheritance, but a bleak one. Like inheriting a funeral. The gold vault had been quite enough. Hogwarts had been quite enough. And then the whole, prophecy and birthright thing had been a little more than enough, and by the time he was eighteen and somehow alive (<em> still </em> alive implied a continuity of alive-ness that now felt misleading), he was not interested in any more inheritance. He’d seen his parents come as murdered ghosts from a wand, from a stone. He was banned from keeping his gold in Gringotts for five years thanks to the dragon incident -- the goblins having been talked down from a lifetime ban, and maybe a beheading --, and had to beg McGonagall to let him keep it hidden in Hogwarts. Inheritance dealt with.</p><p>Hermione rented a large flat in Muggle London, and never spent any time there. After all, at first she was still doing Hogwarts, taking her NEWTS. She operated more like a professor’s assistant than anything else though; she was free to leave at any time, and she went a lot of places. Even now that she had finished seventh year last June, Harry hadn’t seen her in a month, though she wrote every Sunday and Wednesday. Ron got Mondays and Fridays. The flat was very well-situated for access to the Ministry, to the Portkey ports, to places that they all needed to be and needed to go to. Hermione had signed the paperwork, but Harry thought the Ministry paid their rent. The tenants were a rotating cast; Neville called it the Hermione’s Home for Postwar Witches &amp; Wizards. Harry did not see much of everyone. He was busy. There were trials.</p><p>He only went out at night, otherwise. He’d never really seen Muggle London, aside from on the run; he liked the randomness of it. One night he tried to go to Chinatown and only managed to buy some bubble tea before he was swept up in a mob of hundreds of drunk Germans in footballer jerseys and was pushed a few streets over, where he wound up wandering into the lobby of a West End production. The receptionist tried to explain that he’d missed the show, but he was distracted by men and women running through the lobby in full 19th century costume, darting from one side of the stage to another, explained the pained receptionist, and could he please not bring outside food in here?</p><p>He went to Camden Town and bought a Tshirt with an otter on it for Hermione. He bought an Arsenal jersey, because he had vague memories of cheering them on silently from the back of the Privet Drive living room. The Dursleys cheered for Chelsea, so he’d only really been a reactionary Arsenal fan, but so what? In a back stall that you had to know how to find, he bought some knockoff novelty potions, some singing jewelry. Christmas was coming up, after all. A man stopped him and freestyled a rap about a thin guy trying to get by; Harry bought his CD for two pounds. The queen winked at him as he dropped the coins into the man’s hand. He bought chips in the underground, and drowned them in vinegar, and held them to warm his hands. He bought one of those new oyster cards, because he was never, ever stopped on the tube. People crazier than him weren’t stopped on the tube.</p><p>He went to a lot of trials. It took some time. It took about a year and a half.</p><p>Then a letter came, and it began with,</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Mr Harry Potter, regarding your inheritance-- </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Mr Potter did not want to regard his inheritance any more. Mostly his inheritance had been a war. He took himself to the Globe that night, because Hermione had written from wherever she was and said he should, and that groundlings tickets were only five quid. When he was eleven and suddenly in possession of a room full of gold, he had loved buying the biggest, the most. Now he felt himself falling into some early-learned frugality. Five pounds sounded sensible. He wore comfy trainers and accidentally arrived early enough to be at the front of the queue, and then had his elbows on the stage. It was the last play of the season; it was cold and he shared a blanket with three Sotheby’s interns.</p><p>It was <em> Othello </em>.</p><p>He walked home, as much of the distance as his feet could stand. It was early enough that the tube was still running, and he didn’t need to deal with night buses, though the Knight Bus was fine, if still vomit-inducing. He walked. It was the center of London; it was the golden mile and the Thames. He went past London Bridge to Tower Bridge, because it was nicer. Smiled at the Knob, frowned at the construction. He ducked down the steep steps with all the tourists sheltering from the wind and walked back along the Thames in front of the Tower. It was not quite November, but edging close; he bought a poppy and pinned it to his coat. Years of Hogwarts uniforms had ruined him, and he hadn’t chosen his clothes as a kid either, so he mostly wore black. Black robes and cloak, or a black peacoat that brushed his knees. He fit into London like that.</p><p>Even so -- he turned away from staring at the grassy green Tower moat and up the hill, cutting through a frosty mid-city playground and past the station. He felt them, always -- hands reaching out from the crowd, touching his coat, pinching like a bit of him could be grabbed. They could be gentle too -- wisps of touch, pilgrims come to their holy relic like he was the kissing stone.</p><p>He felt himself unravelling at the edges. The last trial was in the morning. Not the very last, but the last he felt compelled to attend. The worst was mostly behind him. He’d tried not to become a second judge in the Wizengamot, handing down verdicts of guilt or innocence. He’d tried to only speak up when he was defending someone. There had been exceptions. There had been successes and failures.</p><p>Ron was angry and wanted no one involved to walk free again. He wanted no one near his family who could hurt them, ever again. Maybe it was Hermione’s influence, or maybe Ron too was sick of rage, because he at least only ever voiced the second half of that statement publicly. Hermione herself wanted to have nothing to do with the right and wrong. She said she didn’t know her own mind anymore. She said once, only to Harry, that what she had done to her parents was quite enough to make her feel dirty. What she wanted was to overhaul the judicial system. What to do with Azkaban sans Dementors. Take out old loopholes. Draw up better laws.</p><p>Harry gave up after a while, lights swimming in front of him, and picked a Muggle bus. He went to the top deck and felt it lurch and swing, and liked how he could have both, Wizarding busses and London busses. Below him, rows of ground floor kebab shops and tattoo parlors and upmarket sushi stops and chippies and Sainsbury's locals and off-licensed shops and Save the Childrens whizzed by. Down some dark roads he saw other signs, Wizarding ones glowing for those who could see them, the wide spread of Diagon and Knockturn-adjacent streets settling cobweb-thin into the geography of Muggle London. And then there too were little bubbles of Wizarding sections that Harry hadn’t known about. Some were just houses. Short rows of homes popping in and out of existence from one set of eyes to the next. Warm places, where through a front window, the green glow of a floo call showed, instead of a TV.</p><p>Somewhere, a radio announcer was reviewing the latest news of the brawl back in October between the Holyhead Harpies and Puddlemere United, and the reappearance of vanished Chaser Wilda Griffiths in Malaysia. Somewhere, a TV pundit was running clips of Tony Blair.</p><p>He got back to the flat; it let in anyone with the password, which he’d wondered if they’d get tired of after so many years of it, but apparently the habit was ingrained, and easier than trying to come up with something new.</p><p>“A Collector’s Guide to Antique Succulents,” said Harry to the door. They’d let Neville set the password. It was always whatever book he was starting that month, and was scrawled on a charmed blackboard in the kitchen. It wasn’t a dire secret. This wasn’t the war, or Hogwarts.</p><p>Ron was home, and somewhere down the magically enhanced hallway, two charmed record players softly scratched out music -- Celestina Warbeck vied quietly with Kurt Kobain.</p><p>The sofa under the window was huge, puffy, and a bright, shaggy orange that was Ron’s fault. It was immensely comfortable, however. Harry collapsed next to Ron and put his feet up, staring at his big toe poking a hole in his sock.</p><p>Ron looked up from his Christmas present from last year, when the war had just been fought, and was over, and Hermione could charm things for fun instead of for survival. It was a chess set which fought against Ron, and learned his moves. Apparently as further motivation to win, Hermione had made it so that the pieces spoke mostly French, and entirely refused to swear in English. This had had the unexpected effect of teaching Ron a very serviceable French accent, so long as he wanted to say, “I piss on you, and all your friends, you gigantic fuckhead!”</p><p>Harry was pretty sure Ron was going to win the respect of Fleur this Christmas, thereby causing a rift with Ginny that would last until Easter. He was prepared to start the betting pool with any takers as soon as they arrived at the Burrow next Friday.</p><p>“Oh, Harry,” said Ron, not looking up from his match.</p><p><em> “‘Arry le merdant!” </em> yelled a rook from the board.</p><p>“<em> Mec ta gueule, </em>” Ron told it. “Yeah, a letter came for you.”</p><p>The letter was tossed over, and Harry recognized the same handwriting from the morning. He opened it and glanced at the first line to be sure, then sighed and set it aside.</p><p>Neville wandered in, and saw that Harry was home. “Last one tomorrow then?” he asked, going to put the kettle on. He pulled out Harry and Ron’s mugs along with his own, popped one bag in his, one bag in Harry’s and three in Ron’s, which was the size of a cereal bowl.</p><p>The kettle turned bright red and sneezed, which was how you knew it was done.</p><p>“Yeah,” Harry said slowly.</p><p>“That’s good then,” said Neville, floating sugar cubes across the kitchenette. “I don’t think it’s good for you to keep going like this. It will be good to quit.”</p><p>Harry frowned. “What’s that supposed to mean?” he asked.</p><p>“Nothing,” Ron muttered.</p><p>Neville wiped his hands thoughtfully on a tea towel. Neville had bought the tea towels. He seemed more together than the rest of them, a lot of the time. Maybe Harry was getting it together too, because he had an inkling of what Neville was getting at, maybe.</p><p>Harry said, a little gruff, “I don’t think spending all anyone’s waking hours in some dark courtroom is supposed to be <em> good </em>for me, you know. I just thought I needed to do it.”</p><p>“And now you don’t anymore!” Neville said brightly, tapping at their milk pitcher until it leapt up and dashed generous splashes into the mugs. “Isn’t that nice.”</p><p>Ron grunted.</p><p>Neville brought over milky tea for all of them, and kept his mug, giving a vague wave and shuffling back to his room.</p><p>After Neville left, Ron turned to Harry, and after his muttering mood, Harry was surprised to see him wearing a crooked little grin. “We’re a right pair of moody arseholes, aren’t we,” he said. “Post-war arseholes.”</p><p>“You’re… you’re right to be angry,” Harry said slowly, wondering if Ron meant that he knew that Harry knew that Ron didn’t always agree with Harry’s stance in the trials. “About, y’know. Them. And everything. Even for me some of them, the collaborators,” -- not a word in his vocabulary, Pre-War, now a standard slickness on his tongue -- “Don’t seem apologetic enough. And--”</p><p>Ron cut him off with a wave of his hand. “Nah, Harry. Just, you were downright moody in school, and I was just angry all the time….”</p><p>“You’re still angry all the time.”</p><p>“Don’t tell Hermione. She’ll find me a new therawitch.” Harry grunted, and Ron eyeballed him, said, sly, “What, still don’t want one?”</p><p>“Who the hell is <em> qualified </em>,” groaned Harry, flopping back on the sofa, and Ron laughed.</p><p>“Post-War Arseholes for life, then,” he said, toasting Harry with his tea (it sloshed over the rim and a soaked bishop cried out in protest).</p><p>“Sure,” said Harry, “arseholes for life,” and he almost smiled.</p><p> </p><p>He mostly napped till it was Friday, after walking out of the Wizengamot for what was hopefully the last time, though he wouldn’t bet his bottom galleon. Then Ron packed them two identical bags of clothes and toiletries and not much else, Harry fished his Christmas presents out of their hiding place under the floorboard, and they piled it all together in front of the grand fireplace, alongside the fireplace shoe rack, the robe rack, and everyone else’s slowly accumulating Christmas packing piles. Some were bigger than theirs, even though most of the flat wouldn’t be leaving for a few weeks. It was only the first of November.</p><p>There were a lot of rooms in Hermione’s Halfway House. She hadn’t quite figured out a room-of-requirement style charm to make the flat grow more rooms when need arose, but would cheerfully do the job herself if need be, and after years in dormitories and then in tents, or the old Room itself, most residents wouldn’t have minded sharing quarters anyway.</p><p>Luna had a Christmas pile, and Neville, and Finnegan and a few kids who’d weathered seventh year at school that Harry hadn’t known too well, but were nice. Cho Chang had enough stuff in the flat that she had her own pile, even though she kept an apartment in Glasgow and hated London.</p><p>Harry and Ron eyed the wrapping of everyone else’s Christmas parcels, looked at their own, which were 80% spellotape, and shared a glance.</p><p>“Honestly, we’ll have so much under the tree this year that I doubt anyone will notice,” said Ron, in the painfully hopeful tones of someone who’s mother definitely, always noticed that sort of thing.</p><p>Harry shrugged. Last Christmas it had felt like he was still in shock, but at least everyone had been. Now, would it be cheerful? He didn’t think he would be mourning alone, but would the Weasleys and everyone be able to set down their griefs, stack them under the tree with the presents, only to be opened when the guests were gone and the Burrow was quiet again, snow inching up to the kitchen windows? Could he, Harry, do that?</p><p>Luna and Cho appeared, heads together and talking about something that looked mildly urgent, but nothing Harry had to deal with. Cho had gotten better with Luna, according to Neville; had become sort of her champion, and Luna Cho’s advisor. Cho Chang had in fact, in the name of Luna Lovegood’s honor, started one of the courtroom brawls Harry had born witness to, and the only one he’d enjoyed.</p><p>“Hey Harry,” said Cho.</p><p>“It’s good to see you before you go,” said Luna, tilting her head.</p><p>“You too, Luna,” said Harry.</p><p>“Floo’s ready,” called Ron, kneeling by the fireplace, his freckled face glowing green from the fire.</p><p>Footsteps sounded in the hall, and Luna said, “We’ll visit before advent, Harry.”</p><p>Harry gathered all his things in his arms, tried not to drop his present to Mr Weasley into the floo network, and called out, “The Burrow!”</p><p> </p><p>The bustle and noise of the Burrow was nothing like that of London, or even their odd flat. It was loud but not noisy. Outside, it had snowed already, while in London there wouldn’t be any.</p><p>There was a hush to it, when Harry escaped Mrs Weasley’s embraces and Teddy’s screeching and went out on the stoop. In the garden, gnomes were shivering and warming their hands around a little fire in an old bean can. In the windswept blue sky, which stretched from one hilly moor to another, Ginny was a speck on her broomstick.</p><p>Most of the family wasn’t home yet; Hermione couldn’t make it till closer to Christmas. But Harry wanted out of London for a little bit, at least. And following Ron home for the holidays was an ingrained habit.</p><p>He was drifting, sure, but he thought -- bitterly -- that he maybe he’d earned it. He had all those gold galleons, after all. He had that whole war in his stomach. He had an inheritance to live on.</p><p>He watched as the speck that was Ginny leapt into a spectacular dive, aiming right for the garden, aerodynamic and swift. He realized she was chasing something, eyes picking out a telltale shadow before her in the sky. He wondered if she was practicing with a quaffle or a snitch, and then the shadow formed itself into a tawny owl who was hurtling in terror towards the garden, as Ginny gave out a war-whoop and and pulled up at the last second, robes smacking in the wind, and the owl blew a crater in the snowy holly hedge about six feet from Harry’s place on the stoop.</p><p>“Hiya, Harry,” said Ginny, one hand still on her broomstick, hopping gently to the ground. She tried to fish out the owl from the hedge and snow, but it flailed at the sight of her. Harry sighed, removed the snow from his glasses, and went to help, getting his gloves scratched to hell in the process.</p><p>“Oh, it’s for you,” Ginny said, peering over his shoulder, the goggles she wore against the cold making her look like an owl, too.</p><p>The address read,</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Mr Harry Potter </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The Front Stoop </em>
</p><p>
  <em> The Burrow </em>
</p><p> </p><p>He recognized the handwriting from the last two letters, and tucked it into his cloak with a sigh.</p><p>“What is it?” asked Ginny, squinting at him. “Is someone harassing you again?”</p><p>“I don’t need you giving anyone <em> else </em> a Glasgow kiss in my honor,” muttered Harry, who had learned this term from Cho.</p><p>“I already did.”</p><p>“Probably why I’m concerned.”</p><p>Harry had only heard about the incident secondhand, from Neville, who had been very impressed with Ginny’s ability to smash bottles on other peoples’ faces (but had administered first aid, anyway). If Harry was overly concerned with avoiding playing jury, judge, and executioner, Ginny wasn’t so bothered.</p><p>Ginny shrugged and walked wordlessly into the house. She didn’t seem angry, or anything. Ginny just didn’t talk as much as she used to. She was focused. Words were meted out like rations. Mostly, she flew. Harry could get that, at least. Maybe they were too much alike after all. Too much of Tom Riddle in their heads; too much time spent wishing they had bird-bones, wishing all they could feel was a deep and empty sky all around them.</p><p>“I’ll open it for you,” Ginny said when they were in the kitchen, shedding cloaks. Mrs Weasley and her charge were absent, though sounds were coming from the pantry, and a rolling pin was enthusiastically flattening some dough for gingerbread on the counter near Harry’s elbow.</p><p>“I can do it myself, Gin,” Harry said. He fumbled his gloves off and snatched the letter out of the pocket of his cloak. He slipped his index finger under the flap and broke the unfamiliar golden wax seal.</p><p>The letter read,</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Dear Mr Potter, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Regarding your inheritance, I write to inform you that you have not finalized the documentation to pass ownership of Mapperton House, Dorset, from your father, James Potter to yourself, Harry Potter. This property is entailed to you as sole owner and heir, as of your seventeenth birthday (31.07.1997). As it is now over two years past that date, we are concerned that your entailment will expire, and under Wizarding Ancient Property Law (see bill 4549, section 24A), the property will become public, and under the full purvey of the Ministry of Magic. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> As the will of James Potter specifically dictates that the property be left to any son or daughter of himself and wife, Lily Potter nee Evans, and considering the extenuating circumstances, I have taken it upon myself to ensure that your opinion is taken into account, and that you do not neglect your family’s property. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Please contact me at your earliest convenience, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Cecil W.M. Brownott </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Properties of Wizarding Importance </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry spent so much time reading this letter that Ginny easily managed to read it too, and finally he let the parchment fall but couldn’t meet Ginny’s eyes.</p><p>“I didn’t know your dad had a will,” Ginny said after a pause.</p><p><em> “I </em>didn’t know my dad had a will,” Harry replied. He stared dazedly and Mrs Weasley’s bewitched kitchen appliances, as cookie cutters descended en masse on the rolled-out gingerbread dough. Anger was a distant thing, but it was sounding far off somewhere.</p><p>He studied the letter again. At first he had assumed that there had been some mix up, and someone was writing him about Grimmauld Place by accident. Harry had taken that property, though, and on Hermione and Bill’s recommendation had leased it out to the Curse-Breaker’s Guild of London, as training and research for their recruits. He certainly had never even <em> been </em>to Dorset -- or if he had, it had been nothing but an anonymous copse of trees, or a terrified run into a village for supplies. Dorset not at war, not watched from the shadows, he had never seen.</p><p>He might’ve ignored this letter like the last ones, if not for <em> that </em> line, for those mentions of his mother and father. His father had had a will? Why had Harry never seen it? More questions for Dumbledore; more questions for Remus and Sirius; more questions for the dead.</p><p>He didn’t need Ron’s therawitch to tell him that that was the wrong path to go down. He shook himself.</p><p>“Dunno what the hell the rest of it is,” he mumbled, “but I’m writing back about my Dad’s will, at least. Who knows what else people kept me from knowing about as a kid?”</p><p>“Not stopping you,” said Ginny, an odd look on her windburnt face.</p><p> </p><p>Harry wrote a reply. It just read, <em> I want a notarized copy of my dad’s will before I proceed. </em></p><p>Maybe so much time in the Wizengamot had helped his vocabulary.</p><p>He sent it off with the shaken owl, after feeding her a little gingerbread and milk, and then a mouse that Crookshanks (who vacationed at the Burrow when unable or unwilling to travel with Hermione) deposited too-helpfully at his feet. The reply came before dinner, several sheets of parchment tied together with black velvet, plus an outer sheet, which read in the familiar hand of the mysterious Cecil Brownott,</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Mr Potter, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Here is the paperwork requested. I must make clear that I and the P.W.I. only have access to those parts of the will pertaining to property rights. I hope that this is adequate for your needs. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> We are glad to have contact with you before the critical time, and are anxious to continue correspondence and a proper hand-off. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Regards, </em>

  <em> Cecil WM Brownott, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Properties of Wizarding Importance </em>
</p><p> </p><p>And after that followed some legaleze that Harry could only parse because of the past year in courtrooms. He pressed down the pages, traced the forms of their names; tried to feel something of his parents talking through the paper, as they bequeathed on him the rest of James Potter’s tycoon grandfather’s inheritance: a property far to the south called Mapperton House.</p>
