    <p>Harry-Before Year 1</p>
<p>Steam billowed around the wheels of the Hogwarts Express. Lily and Pandora came back from having stowed their luggage and their pet Kneazle, Kaiya, on board. Both had put on their school robes at home, they were so excited to finally be off to Hogwarts. They had bits of both my looks and Luna’s. Lily was shorter and still had a trace of baby-fat around her face. Pandora looked a couple of years older than Lily, but she was actually the younger of the twins. Both had naturally loosely-curled black hair, but Pandora’s was long and she straightened it, and Lily kept hers cut short.</p>
<p>Lily saw me first, elbowed her sister, and they both came straight for me. Curious eyes followed both them and me; I guess my fame hadn’t dissipated much.</p>
<p>“Mum’s not going to make it is she?” Pandora asked, her lips quivering a bit.</p>
<p>“I’m quite sure she’ll be here before the train leaves.” I knelt and put my arms around both of them.</p>
<p>“Pffft, wanna bet? Mum missed our last birthday; off in Kathmandu or wherever with Rolf and she almost didn’t make Christmas last year.” She pulled a Sickle from her pocket.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ll take that bet.” I also took out a Sickle and we both handed them to Lily, who would hold the bet and give the coins to the winner.</p>
<p>“Again? Don’t you two get tired of this?” She laughed as she stuffed the two coins into the pocket of her robe. “And you shouldn’t have made that bet, Dora.” (Only she could call Pandora ‘Dora.’ Anyone else who tried got the glare of death, even her Mum.)</p>
<p>“Oh, why’s that?” Pandora looked at me suspiciously.</p>
<p>Lily laughed again. I could hear her little girl laugh still here, but also an older, wiser laugh. “I saw Mum’s Patronus talking to Dad through the window while you were putting away your trunk.”</p>
<p>“Cheater.” Pandora punched me lightly in the side.</p>
<p>I put my chin up in a haughty manner and spoke with a fake-posh accent. “It’s not cheating to use knowledge that your opponent doesn’t have.”</p>
<p>“Is that another of Shacklebolt’s quotes? If so, you should tell him it’s not very good.”</p>
<p>“Nope,” I said, “it’s one of my own, just made it up.”</p>
<p>“Mum!” Lily screamed and ran off down the platform. I turned just in time to see Pandora go streaming by me toward Luna, who was wending her way through the throngs of students and parents. She was wearing Muggle clothing; jeans, a black T-shirt, and the plaid over-shirt that Charlie had given me for Christmas about ten years ago. It was sun-faded and frayed around the cuffs. She’d repaired it with mismatched patches on the elbows. I smiled as I remembered all the other times she’d worn that shirt. I sometimes thought that she still wore it because it reminded her of our time together.</p>
<p>The girls finally reached her and Luna knelt and pulled them both into a tight hug. Her normally dirty blonde hair was sun-bleached and it spilled over and onto Lily as they embraced. She spoke quietly with the girls, then stood and took each of them by a hand. I watched as they walked over to me, Luna’s eyes taking in everything around her. To those who didn’t know her, she seemed disconnected, but I can tell you from personal experience, she noticed everything. Pandora unconsciously emulated her, and her head turned as she watched everyone, but still listened to what Luna was saying. Lily watched her Mum and sister instead, more focused on them than on the crowd.</p>
<p>“I’ll take that Sickle, now,” I said to Lily, who reached into her pocket and handed it to me along with the Sickle I had bet. I made of show of polishing them on my robes and Pandora glared at me, but I could see the smile behind the glare.</p>
<p>“Did you con our daughter again?” Luna asked.</p>
<p>I shook my head innocently. “Not me. Pandora bet that you wouldn’t be here on time; it’s not my fault that she didn’t know we’d spoken by Patronus.”</p>
<p>“You should know better than to bet against your father, Pandora,” Luna said, smiling. “He’s always surprised people, and after a point, you’d think they’d no longer test him. I don’t think some people think clearly.”</p>
<p>“Most people are bloody stupid,” Pandora said. I started to say something, but Luna beat me to it.</p>
<p>“Even if that were true, which it’s not, it’s not nice to say. If you keep up the know-it-all attitude, you’ll have a hard time making friends at Hogwarts.” Luna’s eyes went distant. “It wasn’t until my fourth year that I really felt like I had friends, but Ginny and Harry always treated me well, and so did Neville.”</p>
<p>
  <span>“Picture of you and your family, Harry?” A familiar voice spoke from my shoulder.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I turned and shook Dennis Creevey’s hand. He had Colin’s old camera around his neck.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“As long as they don’t end up in the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Daily Prophet, </span>
  </em>
  <span>that’s great,” I told him, releasing his hand.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He had us all gather together on the edge of the platform and took a few pictures of us. Luna, Lily, Pandora and I all smiled and waved. He seemed pleased with the composition.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ll send the prints to your office, Harry.” He left the platform, waving to other people he knew.</span>
</p>
<p>The train blew its whistle again, and I knelt to hug my daughters while they hugged their mother. I never wanted to let go, but then I thought about how I always pictured this with Luna as my wife and not Rolf’s and I broke the hug first. Lily met my eyes and she started to tear up. I don’t know if she understood what I felt or if she was just sad at leaving me and her mother. At least she’d have her sister there at school with her.</p>
<p>I stood and the girls let go of Luna. We all walked together to the train, and I kissed each of them goodbye on the cheek.</p>
<p>“Learn lots,” I told Pandora.</p>
<p>“Make good friends,” I said to Lily.</p>
<p>I stepped back and let Luna kiss and hug them. She whispered something to each of them that I couldn’t hear. They got on the train with a last wave and then disappeared down the corridor onto the train.</p>
<p>The Hogwarts Express pulled out with a shrill whistle and a blast of steam. Luna grabbed my hand and squeezed. We both understood each other again in that moment, I think; happy to see our daughters grow up and head off to school, but a little sad that they weren’t little girls anymore.</p>
<p>When the train had pulled around the corner and we couldn’t see it, we both turned and walked away hand in hand.</p>
<p>“How have you been, Harry?” Luna asked as we went through the wall back to the Muggle section of King’s Cross.</p>
<p>“Well enough, how about you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Rolf and I are doing well. He’s still in Africa, searching for the Mokele Mbembe, and I’ll be joining him again after I visit my dad and then take care of a few banking issues. We’ve overdrawn again, even though there should be plenty of gold in our vault from our books. I don’t understand how we can always be overdrawn, but Bill’s going to help us out.”</p>
<p>“You’re overdrawn because neither of you are good with money. You should just have Bill manage your account and give you a monthly stipend from it,” I told her. It wasn’t the first time she and I had talked about money. When we lived together, she was always spending money we didn’t have on artwork, trips to exotic places, or to rescue animals. Not all of it was bad; it’s where our Kneazle came from.</p>
<p>“You’re probably right,” she chuckled. “It’s hard to think of money when you’re on the trail of some creature that everyone else assumes is a legend, but you know isn’t.”</p>
<p>We walked in silence for a bit, still holding each other’s hands.</p>
<p>“Coffee?” I asked, pointing at the fancy Muggle coffee shop.</p>
<p>“Sounds good,” she said. “You’ll have to order for me, when I order at these places, the Muggles all give me the strangest looks. You know what I like.”</p>
<p>We went in, Luna sat at a table, and I went to the queue to order a large black drip coffee for myself and a coconut-milk hazelnut latte for Luna.</p>
<p>I sat down across from her and slid her drink over to her. She took a tentative sip and then nodded. I knew she’d like it; I’d ordered similar things for her before and I still knew her tastes.</p>
<p>“Lily wrote to me recently,” she said.</p>
<p>I nodded. She wrote to her mother about once a week, and Pandora about once a month.</p>
<p>“She told me that you’ve been super busy at work recently and have been coming home late. She said you seemed stressed and unhappy lately.”</p>
<p>“Is that verbatim?” I asked.</p>
<p>Luna smiled wanly. “No, she said you seemed unhappy and pale and that you had been eating take-out instead of going over to eat with Nana Molly and the Weasleys. Are you okay?”</p>
<p>I thought before answering. Lying to Luna was pointless, as she could always tell when I was.</p>
<p>“Not really,” I said finally. “Some nutter is killing Death Eaters’ children and leaving ‘For the Greater Good’ written in their blood on the walls near them. Ritter and I’ve been trying to find out who it is and keep it out of the press at the same time. I’ve had to coordinate with MI-5 on this as they think it may be a terrorist, but it’s obviously someone with an axe to grind; I just hope it’s not someone I know.”</p>
<p>“You know it probably will be, though; don’t you?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I sighed and sipped at my coffee. I’d need it for the office today.</p>
<p>“Ritter’s also thinking about retiring soon, and then I’ll likely become Head Auror  if I want the position.”</p>
<p>“But?” she asked; she could sense there was a ‘but’ coming.</p>
<p>“But, I’m not sure if I want to be Head Auror. If you’d asked me right out of school, I would have said that of course I wanted to. But lately, I’ve thought more about the girls and how much more I’d miss them, but also, now that they’re off to school it would only be over the summer, so I’m really conflicted.”</p>
<p>“When you come home, will you always come home to an empty house? I mean with the girls gone and Kaiya with them, won’t your house be quiet?” she asked. I knew she could read me.</p>
<p>“I can always go to the Burrow, or visit Ron and Hermione, but they’ve got children of their own, and Hermione is so busy, too. It seems like as we’ve all gotten older, we’ve lost touch a little. I mean, we’re all still friends and see each other a lot, but it’s not the same.”</p>
<p>“Is there no one you’d want to come home to?” she asked.</p>
<p>I shifted uncomfortably. The only person I’d wanted to come home to in the sense she meant was her. I don’t know if I was really over her or not.</p>
<p>She saw my eyes go down to my coffee and she understood.</p>
<p>“Harry, you’ve got to move on. It’s not good for you.” She put a hand under my chin and raised my face so our eyes met.</p>
<p>“Have you even been on a date since I left?”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Hermione and Ron each set me up a couple of times, but nothing clicked. I had dinner with them, a drink, maybe a laugh, but there was nothing there with any of them.”</p>
<p>“Keep trying, Harry. There’s someone out there for you. At least get laid, even if it’s not someone you plan to spend your life with, you can still have some fun. Not all relationships need to be forever.”</p>
<p>I choked on my coffee and when I recovered, I laughed bitterly.</p>
