    <p>Hermione shuffles into the Hog’s Head, shaking the snow out of her hair. Only a few tables in the inn are taken. Still better than the usual Wednesday afternoon, actually. Not that Harry would want to have more guests. She is pretty sure that he bought the Hog’s Head simply because he knew people rarely wanted to go there. Harry pretends to like people, but he really doesn’t.</p><p>She spots Harry behind the bar, and Teddy sitting in one of the barstools. The boy’s hair is brown with little strands of purple today, and his tongue is sticking out in concentration as he works vigorously on a drawing. Hermione approaches and raises a hand in greeting. “Hey there, Teddy. Hi Harry!”</p><p>Harry turns to her and nods back. “Hey, ‘Mione. Here for a butterbeer?”</p><p>“You know I can’t have beer right now, Harry!” Hermione says, with a meaningful pat on her belly. “Is Molly around?”</p><p>“Not at the moment. Your husband is upstairs.”</p><p>Hermione heaves herself into one of the barstools. “Your beard is coming in nicely.”</p><p>Harry chuckles as he rubs a hand across his chin. “I hope that’ll make it even easier for me to go out in public without anyone recognizing me.”</p><p>“For now, a big hat and scarf will do that trick for you. The snow is really quite horrible.”</p><p>Harry shrugs. “Certainly makes our soup sell faster.”</p><p>Hermione smiles. Harry couldn’t cook to save his life. More proof, if proof were needed, that he really didn’t buy the Hog’s Head because he wanted to go into the restaurant business so badly.</p><p>As if reading her thoughts, Harry says: “I’m might pick up a cooking class or something.”</p><p>“With Ron?” If Harry dislikes cooking, Ron loathes it. The only reason <em>he </em>decided to jump aboard Harry’s crazy business plan was that he wanted to hang with his mate as much as possible. Honestly, if it wasn’t for Molly coming over at least once a week to sort out their bookkeeping, the place would fall apart.</p><p>“No, just me,” Harry says as he pours her a cup of herbal tea. “Ron has zero interest in learning to cook. Lucky you for marrying him.”</p><p>“Hmmm,” Hermione says, smiling. “He’s excellent at doing laundry, though. So I think I’ll keep him.”</p><p>“Have you been house hunting yet?”</p><p>“Not yet. We’ve been figuring out what we want to look for. A nice house to raise children in. I don’t know - a garden. With a tree I can hang a swing from.”</p><p>Harry shakes his head. “The two of you are such grown-ups.”</p><p>“We’re twenty-five years old, Harry,” Hermione reminds with a smile. “We’re all grown-ups.”</p><p>“I don’t feel like a grown-up,” Harry confesses. “Not in the least.”</p><p>“You’re old,” Teddy chimes in. Harry chuckles.</p><p>Hermione turns to Teddy now and gives him a single pat on the head. “What are you drawing?”</p><p>Teddy points his pencil at the dark brown blob he has drawn. “Harry is fighting Bigfoot.”</p><p>Harry sneaks a peek at the drawing. “I’ve never fought Bigfoot.”</p><p>“No, but I’ve already made drawings about everything cool you’ve actually fought,” Teddy reasons. “So now I’m thinking off my own monsters.”</p><p>“Why don’t you draw me with my job right now?” Harry suggests, lifting the glass he is currently cleaning.</p><p>Teddy scrunches up his nose. “But your job right now is boring.”</p><p>“It’s… It’s not…” Harry splutters. “This job is <em>fascinating</em>. You should see some of the people who come through here.”</p><p>“Like who?” Teddy asks, seeming mildly more interested.</p><p>“See that man at the end of the bar? He owns thirteen cats.”</p><p>Teddy blinks at him a few times. “That <em>is </em>interesting,” he says, before going right back to his drawing.</p><p>Harry is perfectly aware of the fact that his current job is anything but ‘cool’. He hasn’t been ‘cool’ in a while. On the one hand, that is exactly what he wants. To be away from people for a while and not draw any attention. On the other hand, he can’t help the constant feeling of guilt. He could be hunting criminals down right now, but instead he is getting people tea or coffee, or the occasional bowl of soup.</p><p>After finishing Hogwarts, he had entered the auror training program, because it felt like the only logical option. Expectations had been high. Journalists followed him around wherever he went, eager to learn how ‘the great Harry Potter’ would solve all crime for them. He only lasted a few years before he couldn’t take it anymore. Especially after he broke up with Ginny and, for a little while, felt like he was all alone in the world. Around the same period, the news reached him that Aberforth Dumbledore had died, and Harry only hesitated a little before purchasing the Hog’s Head inn and quitting the auror program.</p><p>At first, the press had been on him like vultures, coming up with the most ridiculous conspiracy theories to explain their hero’s sudden career switch. But after a year or two they realized that Harry’s life had become genuinely boring, and they lost interest in him. Harry has owned the Hog’s Head for five years now, and the last few years have been blissfully peaceful. But still, the fact that Teddy is now making up adventures about Harry’s life makes Harry feel inadequate, somehow. It reminds him that people were expecting so much more from him.</p><p>“This is what I want for my birthday,” Teddy says, interrupting Harry’s thoughts.</p><p>Harry looks down at the kid, who is pointing at his own drawing. “Bigfoot?” He jokes. “You want bigfoot as a present? Wrapped up with a pretty little ribbon?”</p><p>“No,” Teddy says, giggling a little. “But you said my party should have a theme. So maybe the theme can be about fighting dragons, or vampires, or trolls…”</p><p>“Heroes versus monsters?” Hermione suggests.</p><p>Teddy nods vigorously and Harry sighs a little. That’s just great. Teddy’s birthday is coming up in a month. Harry has already had to move heaven and earth to convince Andromeda to give him another chance to organise Teddy’s birthday party, because his attempt from last year ended in a fiasco. Teddy had requested a quidditch party and Harry had arranged for a whole bunch of toy brooms for the kids to play with, which, well…. may have resulted in several broken bones, one nasty concussion and a whole mob of angry parents.</p><p>And now he apparently has to spend the next month proving himself by organising a perfect birthday party with a theme that feels like it was chosen to personally offend him. <em>Heroes fighting Monsters; you know, Harry, like the stuff you used to do back when you were actually contributing to wizarding society instead of hiding away in a shabby pub?</em></p><p>“I’ll get right on it,” he tells Teddy. And the way the kid’s eyes immediately light up makes Harry feel a little better about it all.</p><p>-</p><p>“How do you imagine a ‘Heroes versus Monsters’ birthday party should look?” He complains to Hermione later that evening, after Andromeda has picked Teddy up and taken him home with her. “What – am I supposed to get a dragon in here for the kids to ’fight’? That doesn’t sound like a recipe for disaster <em>at all</em>.”</p><p>“We’ll help you organize it, Harry,” Hermione promises him. “Don’t put too much pressure on yourself. You don’t have to throw him the birthday party of the century to prove some point. We can sit the kids down and have them make drawings. Teddy loves drawing.”</p><p>“Lame…” Harry informs her.</p><p>“Oh, stop moping, you misery guts,” Hermione says, with a fond but exasperated look. “It’ll be fine.”</p><p>Her frizzy hair glows when a sudden light shines into the pub from outside. Harry leans to the side to glance out the window. To his surprise, he spots a flying car with blazing headlights landing neatly outside the pub.</p><p>After the war, combining muggle technology with magic became a bit more socially acceptable. People felt that, by showing how open-minded they were about muggles, they sent out a clear message that they had been on the ‘good’ side during the war. Arthur Weasley, who used to get the side-eye for his strange muggle-fascination, now has offers pouring in from all over the country from wizards who want to buy the rights to his latest ideas and inventions. He usually rejects them, but he did sell his concept for flying cars a few years ago. Honestly, though, Harry has never heard of any wizards who prefer the method of travel over the floo, a portkey or apparition. In fact, the only car that Harry can ever remember landing right in front of his pub, is Arthur Weasley’s own Ford Prefect. Harry and Ron had bought him that car two years ago, finally making up for losing the Ford Anglia in their second year.</p><p>This car is something else, though. All dynamic lines and shiny surfaces, with wheels that light up with a soft blue glow. Even Harry, who has no interest in, and no knowledge about cars, knows that someone rich is about to enter his pub.</p><p>Compared to the car, the man who enters is surprisingly low-profile. Mister rich-guy looks forty-ish, has a short beard, is wearing a simple tracksuit, and is accompanied by…. Harry squints his eyes, then lifts an arm and pokes Ron, who was just returning from the kitchen, in the ribs.</p><p>“Ouch – what?”</p><p>“Isn’t that… Draco Malfoy?”</p><p>Ron follows his gaze to the two men who have entered the pub. The younger one is unmistakably Malfoy. The same white-blond hair and cold grey eyes. Just a little taller and less hair gel. His clothes look different. And the way he moves is different too, somehow. Less rigid. The older man with the beard has put his hand on Malfoy’s back and is guiding him to a table near the widow where they sit down.</p><p>“Huh,” Ron says. “Still alive I see. Pity.”</p><p>Hermione cocks her head. “I thought he moved to Italy?”</p><p>They look on how the bearded man sidles closer to Draco and kisses him. Harry coughs uncomfortably and looks away. Ron, on the other hand, only stares harder. “Oh, <em>yuck</em>. Seriously, he’s dating that old fart?”</p><p>“He’s not <em>that </em>old,” Hermione says. “I quite like the beard. And his car is huge.”</p><p>“Why don’t <em>you </em>go date him, then?” Ron immediately challenges, and Hermione rolls her eyes.</p><p>“You know what it means when a guy has a big car, right?” Ron continues.</p><p>“That he’s rich?” Hermione asks in a dry voice.</p><p>“No, that he’s got a tiny-“</p><p>“I’ll go take their order, then,” Harry quickly breaks in. He rushes away.</p><p>“That’s just like Malfoy,” Ron grumbles as he watches Harry leave. “Marrying some rich sugar daddy. Spoiled, arrogant, stuck-up little snob.”</p><p>“Good to see you’re no longer cherishing any feelings of resentment,” Hermione jibes as she elegantly stirs sugar into her tea.</p><p>Ron ignores her. “Whatever he orders, I’m going to spit in it.”</p><p>Harry approaches the table where the couple is sitting and decides to take the friendly approach. “Evening. Snowing, huh?”</p><p>The man looks up. “Oh, yeah! Yes, it is.”</p><p>Draco looks up, too. His eyes widen in recognition and he quickly turns away, pointedly staring out the window and away from Harry, his shoulders tense.</p><p>“We were supposed to be at our holiday home hours ago,” the man continues, scratching his beard. “But the snow makes it hard to fly. And this one is hopeless behind the wheel.” He chuckles as he points his thumb at Malfoy, who flushes in embarrassment.</p><p>Harry smiles back, amused at the situation. The man seems friendly enough. He wonders how Malfoy got his paws on him. “Holiday. Pleasant. Nearly there, though?” He asks.</p><p>“Yeah. Maybe twenty minutes. I just really needed some coffee.”</p><p>“Do you want some soup, too?”</p><p>“No, just coffee please. Black.”</p><p>Harry’s eyes flash to Malfoy, who is still steadily ignoring him and has plastered a bored expression on his face. “For both of you?”</p><p>“Yeah, the same for him.”</p><p>Harry nods. As he walks off, he hears the man asking: “That guy looked at you weird… Do you know him?”</p><p>“Of course not, Linus…” he overhears Malfoy reply. He can barely supress an eyeroll.</p><p>“Two black coffees,” he tells Ron when he arrives back at the bar.</p><p>“Let me do it,” Ron says, standing up straighter. “Then I can spit in his.”</p><p>“Come on, Ron,” Harry says, batting his hands away and grabbing the coffee pot. “It’s been, what? Seven years?” He has to admit, even though Malfoy is clearly still a ponce, Harry doesn’t really feel that same anonymity as he used to. Just a slight annoyance.</p><p>Ron waves his hand. “Yeah, yeah. You’re the forgive and forget-type. But I'm pretty good at holding a grudge. What did he say?”</p><p>Harry shrugs. “Nothing, he ignored me. The other guy ordered for him. He pretended like he didn’t know me.”</p><p>“<em>Seriously</em>?” Ron turns to Hermione. “See what I mean?”</p><p>Harry pours two cups of coffee and lifts them up. “You know what? I’ll screw with him just a little, okay?”</p><p>He moves back to the table where Malfoy is sitting with his boyfriend, whose name apparently is Linus. He puts the cups down in front of each of them. “Two black coffees. There you go, sir. --  Draco.”</p><p>Malfoy freezes in his seat and stares up at him like a deer caught in headlights. Harry simply gives a polite smile and walks off again. He joins Ron behind the bar and smirks at him.</p><p>“Okay, yeah,” Ron admits. “His face was pretty funny.”</p><p>Hermione shakes her head, composedly.</p><p>“Back to more urgent problems,” Harry says, leaning on the bar. “Any more suggestions for a ‘Heroes vs Monsters’ party?”</p><p>Ron and Hermione spend some time brainstorming with him. Most of Hermione’s ideas are too mundane for a birthday party. Most of Ron’s ideas are too outlandish. Harry wants something that is special – because he needs Teddy to approve – but also something that is chid-appropriate – because he needs Andromeda to approve.</p><p>“Trouble in paradise,” Ron suddenly mutters. Harry looks up.</p><p>Malfoy and Linus appear to be arguing already. Linus is gesturing wildly while Malfoy seems to be mostly giving the silent treatment, sipping his coffee with a deep frown. “I’m going to the restroom,” Harry hears him say, and Draco sets down his coffee cup and walks off, meandering past the tables and chairs to reach the lavatories.</p><p>“Draco, I’m trying to talk to you!” Linus angrily yells after him, making a few other customers glance up from their butterbeers.</p><p>Draco ignores him, enters the bathroom and slams the door behind him.</p><p>“You know what…” Linus grumbles, and he stands. He grabs his wallet and slams some money down onto the table. He angrily snatches up his scarf and gloves and marches towards the front door.</p><p>Both Harry and Ron gape - and other guests have turned their heads as well. Linus slams the door behind him and through the window he can be seen marching up to his car, opening the trunk and starting to throw pieces of luggage onto the sidewalk. One suitcase bursts open and a pile of underwear rolls into the snow.</p><p> “Oh boy. Oh boy, oh boy,” Ron says as a look of glee appears on his face. He bounds over to the restroom and bangs on the door.</p><p>After a moment, the door opens. “Oh. <em>You</em>.” Malfoy says, sniffing. “I was kind of busy you know. And it smells in here, by the way.”</p><p>For a moment, Ron looks ready to punch him in the face. Then he remembers what he was coming over for. “Yeah, <em>sorry</em>,” he says, drawling. “But there seems to be a problem with your…. I’m sorry, is he your husband, or your uncle or something?”</p><p>Malfoy flushes, but a sharp retort dies on his tongue when he follows Ron’s gaze out through the window. Outside, Linus has thrown another bag into the snow and is now stepping into the front seat, slamming the door.</p><p>“Goddamn…” Malfoy mutters, before rushing to the door and out into the cold. “Linus!”</p><p>The engine roars. Malfoy grabs the handle to open the door on the passenger side, but Linus has clearly locked the doors from the inside. Draco bangs against the window, but the engine roars again and then the car speeds off, angrily knocking over a garbage can before lifting its wheels of the ground and taking to the sky.</p><p>Malfoy is left behind, standing in the snow, surrounded by his luggage.</p><p>-</p><p>The bell chimes as the last customers leave. Well - the last customer apart from one person. As Harry wipes down the bar, his eyes keep wandering over to the seat by the window where Malfoy is still sitting, arms crossed, staring out the window. He has rescued his luggage as best he could. It is now in a disorganized pile next to his seat. Malfoy looks a little lost, and Harry somehow doesn’t have the heart to send the man away.</p><p>“I’ll take care of it,” Ron mutters, and before Harry can say anything, Ron is already sauntering over to Malfoy’s table.</p><p>“Hey,” Harry hears him say. “I’m <em>reaaallly </em>sorry. But we’re closing. So…”</p><p>He looks on as Malfoy frowns and glances down at his watch. “It’s eleven o’clock.”</p><p>“This is the Hog’s Head,” Ron reminds him. “Not some Diagon Alley night club. Time to go.”</p><p>“Fine, asshole,” Malfoy grunts, zipping up his jacket.</p><p>“Yeah,” Ron says. “Real mystery why your sugar daddy dumped you.”</p><p>Malfoy sets his jaw, but doesn’t retort.</p><p>Harry leaves his dishcloth on the bar and approaches them. “Ron,” he says evenly. “Could you take care of the trash in the back?”</p><p>Ron shrugs. “Sure, if you take care of the trash out here.” And he rushes out, cackling at his own joke.</p><p>Harry sighs and turns back to Malfoy, whose face is pink with embarrassment. “Don’t worry, I’m leaving,” the man snaps, trying to gather his bags together.</p><p>“Just – just hang on,” Harry says with a calming motion. “Where are you going?”</p><p>“I’ll wait outside, I suppose.”</p><p>“Are you sure he’ll come back for you? It’s been over two hours.”</p><p>“Stay out of my business, Potter.”</p><p>“I don’t want to be responsible for you freezing to death, all right? Is this holiday house far off, or can you apparate there without splinching yourself?”</p><p>“I’ll walk,” Malfoy says stubbornly, slinging his bags over his shoulder.</p><p>“Take the knight bus,” Harry suggests.</p><p>“I have no cash on me,” Draco bites out, the pink colour still high on his cheeks.</p><p>“You can’t walk,” Harry says, trying to keep his voice as calm and neutral as possible. “Where are you even going to walk to? I’m going to go ahead and assume that you don’t know any of the other proprietors in this village.”</p><p>“What do you suggest, Potter?” Malfoy says, spitting out his last name just like he always used to do back at Hogwarts. “You’re the one who told me to leave, so…”</p><p>Harry sighs. Frankly, he is not sure why he bothers. As far as he is concerned, Malfoy could lose some of the attitude seeing as how he is the one who is in a pickle right now. But still, Harry doesn’t want to have an expensive lawsuit filed against him because he sent the Malfoy heir out into the snow at night. “I’ll cut you a deal,” he offers. “How about you help us close up, and in exchange you can stay here for the night. There’s guest rooms upstairs.” He waves vaguely towards the spiral staircase next to the bar. “You’ll have plenty of time to get home tomorrow and your, ah, boyfriend will have had some time to cool off.”</p><p>Malfoy is clearly mulling it over in his head. Finally, he lowers the bags to the floor. “I can’t believe this,” he mutters, sullenly.</p><p>“That’s a deal, then,” Harry says.</p><p>He hears Ron enter and turns back to him. “Ron – Malfoy is spending the night. Give him a little job to do, all right?”</p><p>Ron’s eyes widen comically. “He is <em>what </em>now?”</p><p>“Don’t be dramatic and just give him something to do. I’ll go prepare the guest room.”</p><p>Ron leans against the doorframe, squinting at Malfoy with a somewhat smug look on his face.</p><p>“What?” Malfoy snaps as Harry makes his way upstairs.</p><p>“I’ve got a perfect job for you,” Ron casually responds. “I’ve been informed by a customer today that our toilet smells. Let me get you a bucket.”</p><p>-</p><p>Harry arrives back at the inn early the next morning. He has to kick some snow out of the way to be able to pull the backdoor open.</p><p>“Boy, oh boy,” he mutters, stamping his feet to get rid of the snow and taking off his hat and gloves. ‘<em>Lumos’</em>.</p><p>The lights turn on, casting a soft glow over the backroom of their inn. There is a kitchen at the far end, which they barely use. There is a red door to the left, leading to the front of their inn, where the pub is. In the middle of the backroom is a large, rectangular, wooden table where Harry usually sits to try and make sense of his administration. And to his right is another door leading to a small office which he never uses. That office is essentially Molly Weasley’s territory. The place where she sits and actually <em>does </em>make sense of his administration.</p><p>Harry had only owned the place for about two weeks when he had stumbled in one morning to find the Weasley matriarch already sitting at the table, giving him a stern look. He hadn’t really spoken with her since he had broken things off with Ginny several months earlier, and immediately assumed she was here to lecture him about that exact thing. But instead, the first thing out of Molly’s mouth was: “Ron tells me you have no idea what you’re doing.”</p><p>“What else is new?” Harry had weakly joked.</p><p>Molly had firmly installed herself in the tiny office adjacent to the backroom, and sorted out all his paperwork in a single day, promising to be back the next week. It had taken Harry some effort to convince her to let him pay her for her trouble, but they had reached an agreement in the end.</p><p>Smiling at the memory, Harry shuffles closer to the kitchen to grab the coffee grinder. Humming, he opens a kitchen cabinet to get the kettle.</p><p>“Morning,” a voice sounds behind him, and Harry jumps out of his skin.</p><p>He whirls around to see Malfoy, barefoot, wearing jeans and an expensive looking green jumper. He is carrying a slightly amused look on his face. Probably because he managed to scare Harry. Once again, it occurs to Harry that Malfoy somehow looks different. It might be the way he holds himself. Or the somewhat genuine smile on his face. He wonders if Malfoy sees <em>him </em>differently, too. “Merlin, you’re up early,” he mutters. “I had you pegged as the sleeping-in kind.”</p><p>“I don’t sleep in,” Malfoy merely says.</p><p>“Coffee?”</p><p>“I have no money on me,” Malfoy reminds him, approaching the table and sitting down. He rolls his sleeves up a little and pulls one knee up to his chest, wrapping his arms around it. He looks very un-Malfoyish.</p><p>Harry waves a hand. “Yeah, yeah, I remember. But it’s part of the package. So?”</p><p>Malfoy hesitates, then nods at him. “Sure. Thanks.”</p><p>“Black, right?”</p><p>Malfoy hesitates again, not quite meeting Harry’s eyes this time. “Prefer it with some milk, actually.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Harry jokes. “Does your boyfriend know that?”</p><p>Malfoy just purses his lips, studying his hands. “Look, I’m sorry about the fuss,” he finally says. “Me and Linus…” he seems to not really know how to finish that sentence.</p><p>“Doesn’t matter,” Harry says. “Either way, the toilet smells like a meadow.”</p><p>“Screw you,” Malfoy says, but without any real venom.</p><p>Harry gives a sheepish smile. “Sorry. I did mean it. I didn't have you pegged as someone who knows their way around cleaning spells.”</p><p>Malfoy arches an eyebrow. “You don’t have me pegged as much, do you?”</p><p>Harry gives another sheepish grin, tapping the kettle with his wand to get the water boiling, and then tapping the coffee grinder to start grinding the beans.</p><p>“So, you…. you own this place?” Malfoy asks.</p><p>“Yeah. Bought it after Aberforth Dumbledore died, four or five years ago.”</p><p>“Do you get a lot of guests staying the night?”</p><p>Harry turns and leans against the sink, eyeing Malfoy. The intensity of his tone makes Harry think that he’s not simply making small talk. “In winter… almost none. In summer, a few.”</p><p>“Right. And no other employees?”</p><p>“Ron and I do everything together. We hire some extra help in summer,” Harry replies. “A Hogwarts student looking for a summer job or something.”</p><p>“But you’re also looking for people right now,” Malfoy says. “I saw the sign in the front window.”</p><p>“Oh, yeah,” Harry replies, turning back to the kettle. The truth is that they are looking for a hand because Hermione is pregnant with their first child, and Ron might soon need more time off. Harry isn’t sure if he should share that bit of personal information with Malfoy, though. “That sign has been there for a while. It’s not a phenomenal job, I guess.” He prepares two mugs of coffee and sets one down in front of Malfoy, who clasps his hands around it. Harry sits down, too. It stays silent for a moment.</p><p>“I’ll take the job, if you let me stay in that room for a while,” Malfoy then says.</p><p>Harry almost spits out his coffee. Instead, he gulps it down and coughs a little. “You – you <em>what</em>?”</p><p>“I need a place to stay,” Malfoy quietly says, his eyes trained on the coffee cup.</p><p>Harry eyes him critically. “Have you owled your boyfriend yet?”</p><p>“Let me handle me personal affairs, please,” Malfoy says, coolly. “Can I take the job or not?”</p><p>“Aren’t you being a little immature?”</p><p>“Potter, let <em>me </em>handle my personal affairs.”</p><p>Harry leans his head in his hand. “Haven’t you ever learned not to be rude to your potential employer?”</p><p>Malfoy sneers, but doesn’t reply.</p><p>“Do you even know how to wash a plate?” Harry queries.</p><p>“Of course I know how to wash a bloody plate,” Malfoy practically growls.</p><p>“You don’t seem the type for it.”</p><p>Malfoy now smirks, looking up at him. “What, don’t have me <em>pegged</em> as a washing-up kind of guy?”</p><p>Harry can’t help but smile at that.</p><p>“I can wash a plate, Potter,” Malfoy says.</p><p>“Harry,” Harry corrects him.</p><p>Draco gives him a longish stare. “Sure,” he finally says. “Harry.”</p><p>Harry honestly isn’t sure why he is even considering this. Letting Draco Malfoy work in his inn? Letting Draco Malfoy <em>sleep </em>in his inn? “And you just want to stay in one of our rooms?”</p><p>“Yes. Well, and some food would be marvellous,” Draco adds.</p><p>Harry is at a loss for words. He honestly doesn’t know how to deal with Draco, heir to the noble house of Malfoy, offering to scrub his plates in exchange for staying in one of his shabby rooms. It must be written all over his face, because Draco sighs deeply, and clarifies: “Look, me and Linus… we might not be the best match after all, all right? I just need a little time to think things over before I go back to him. And I don’t exactly have anywhere else to go. Friendly reminder, all my living relatives are in Azkaban.”</p><p>Harry slowly nods. Right, so Draco is looking for something temporary, before moving on to something better. That doesn’t sound as improbable. “All right,” he says. “If you think it’ll help.”</p><p>“Perfect,” Draco says, looking relieved. He gulps down the last of his coffee.</p><p>“Hey,” Harry says, sitting up. “Damn – I forgot you wanted milk. Why didn’t you say something?”</p><p>Draco, for some reason, looks embarrassed. “It was fine,” he insists, before getting up. “When’s Weasley coming?”</p><p>“Ron has a day off, today.”</p><p>Draco grins. “What a shame.”</p><p>-</p><p>Harry waves his hand to make the chairs float down from the tables. The place won’t open until noon. Even then, Harry doesn’t expect the first guests until later in the afternoon. People know they don’t need to bother coming to the Hog’s Head for lunch. And that’s exactly how Harry likes it. He doesn’t really care that, after four years of owning the place, he still isn’t turning a profit. He has plenty of money either way. All he cares about is people not bothering him too much. So far, he is successful. Once he bought this inn, kept his head down, and started leading the most boring life imaginable, the press quickly lost interest in him. As long as he keeps his scar hidden beneath his hair, he can even go out into public without people recognizing who he is.</p><p>He glances out the window. He has asked Draco to shovel snow outside, and Draco seems to be doing exactly that. Harry can’t help but feel confused. Of course, it’s been years and they’ve all grown up a lot since school, but he never thought he’d see Draco Malfoy do some good honest work without bitching and whining about it. He looks on as Draco stamps his feet a few times and suddenly realizes that Draco is wearing shoes from a muggle brand. Speaking of which – he hadn’t considered this before, but he now realizes that Draco’s jeans look quite mugglish, too. In fact, he’s not sure if wizards ever wear jeans. He then notices something else and moves to the front door, pushing it open and leaning out. “Don’t you have a scarf or some gloves?”</p><p>Draco looks down at his red hands, flexes his fingers for a moment, then shakes his head.</p><p>“Go buy some, then,” Harry says. “Gladrags Wizardwear is right around the corner. They take Gringotts cheques.”</p><p>Draco scoffs, then lowers his shovel when he sees Harry’s face, as if he hadn’t realized that Harry was being serious. “Why do you think I’d be working here if I had <em>money</em>?” He asks.</p><p>Harry frowns and leans against the doorpost as he processes that question. Draco turns his back to him and continues shovelling. “What do you mean?” Harry finally asks. “Your family is insanely rich.”</p><p>“Was,” Draco corrects. “Ministry took it all during the trials.”</p><p>“Didn’t you ever have a job?”</p><p>“No,” Draco says curtly. “Didn’t need to, did I?”</p><p><em>‘Because I had hooked up with a rich guy’ </em>is left unsaid. Harry has to stop himself from rolling his eyes. “Okay, then,” he says, trying his hardest to remain supportive. “Why don’t you go collect some more of your stuff from Linus? I’ll even do it for you if you really don’t want to see him.”</p><p>“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Draco says stiffly.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Draco kicks some snow aside. “I don’t want him to know where I am,” he admits.</p><p>“Come on, Mal- Draco,” Harry says. “People break up. <em>Mature </em>people manage to talk things out.”</p><p>Draco’s annoyed tone is back. “Potter, let me deal with this, okay?”</p><p>“Whatever,” Harry sighs, throwing up his hands. “You want to borrow my gloves?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Draco snaps back.</p><p>Harry steps back inside and walks to the backroom. He takes his gloves from his pocket, then walks back to the front door, leans out and throws them at Draco.</p><p>“There,” he says. And he gets back to work.</p><p>-</p><p>It’s a quiet day in the Hog’s Head. A few regulars come in, but that’s all. After hanging up their ‘closed’ sign, Harry carefully arranges his galleons, sickles and knuts into piles, tallying up the total. That’s about all he can do when it comes to finances. Molly will take care of the rest.</p><p>Maybe he should take a bookkeeping class after his cooking class.</p><p>From the kitchen, he hears the sink running and the soft clinking of glasses bumping into each other. He slides the heavy coins into a small safe and firmly closes the lid, folding the piece of paper where he kept the tally.</p><p>When he moves through the red door into the backroom, he is met with the sight of Draco Malfoy vigorously scrubbing out his large soup pan with a sponge. He has only rolled up his right sleeve, leaving his left sleeve to get drenched by the soapy water. Harry realizes perfectly well why – there is a dark mark hiding under that sleeve. “What are you doing?”</p><p>Draco stills his movements and turns around, throwing Harry a wary look. “The dishes.”</p><p>Harry squints at him. Is Draco so far out of touch with reality that he has never needed to learn a dishwashing spell? That seems about right. “By hand? Do you not know the right spells?”</p><p>“Oh,” Draco says, fiddling with the sponge. “Well… Yes, I suppose I would know them. But I don’t have my wand. I didn’t take it with me on our trip.”</p><p>Harry stares at him, absolutely gobsmacked. He has never heard of a wizard going on a trip and leaving his wand behind. He has never even heard of a wizard leaving his wand in another room of his own house. Let alone a wizard from a family like the Malfoys. Not having a job, not having money was one thing. But not even having a wand? How in Merlin’s name did Draco Malfoy of all people land himself in <em>this </em>situation?</p><p>“So I suppose you can feel better, knowing that I’m unarmed,” Draco weakly jokes.</p><p>Harry studies Draco’s face for a while, then delves into his pocket. “All right, I’ll bring you one of my spare wands tomorrow. I have some lying around. For now, just use mine,” he says, as he extends his own wand to Draco. “Magic doesn’t help with the paperwork anyways.”</p><p>Draco looks down at the wand, and then up at Harry. “You’re giving me your wand?”</p><p>“<em>Lending,</em>” Harry emphasizes with a small frown. “Here.”</p><p>He steps forward, but Draco actually leans back in response, his back hitting the kitchen counter, looking at the wand as though it might explode. “Have you lost your mind?” He asks.</p><p>Harry loses his patience and slams his wand down next to the sink. “Just use it. You’re wasting time. I’ll be out front when you’re done.”</p><p>He leaves the room.</p>
