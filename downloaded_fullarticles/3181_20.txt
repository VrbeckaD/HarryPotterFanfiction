    <p>He should probably stop, he knew as much. What was this, his seventh drink? Tenth? He'd lost count after the first five glasses full of whiskey had burned their way down his throat. The world was muted and blurry now, everything reaching him slow and warped, as if through a thick layer of honey - or another amber colored liquid, if you will. </p>
<p>He let his head drop onto the cool and sticky wood of the counter, breathing the scent of lemon and stale tequila in through his mouth. </p>
<p>Behind him, the bar was oddly quiet that night. There were fewer patrons than usual, and even those present seemed to be interested in spending the night sipping light beers from bottles and having whispered conversations by the pool table. The telly mounted atop the far corner was out of commission (due to god knew what reason), and sat in quiet witness to the happenings of the world. The usual crowd of noisy youth seemed absent today as well, and Draco felt something he never though he would in his entire life as a mortal on this plane. He *missed* them. Almost. </p>
<p>Their noise was a good way to keep thoughts away. As annoying as it had been. </p>
<p>He groaned against the wood of the counter, before lifting himself up off it and plopping his head on his palms, elbows digging into the wood. The silence in the place was starting to get  suffocating. He thought about returning, about setting a record on the magically restored gramophone, and letting the tunes take him where they will, but he didn't want to. Not yet. He wasn't ready to leave the warmth of this broken place, the dim and dingy lighting, the overwhelming scent of alcohol vapours...no, not yet. </p>
<p>He let himself relax a bit, rolling his shoulder and losing a breath, forcing his mind to focus on the clanking of the cue ball rolling about on the pool table, the odd word flying around the room, and the bored groaning of the metal.fan overhead, when the bartender appeared in front of him with a basket full of chips. </p>
<p>He slammed the basket down in front of Draco, and his face almost slipped from his hand in the slight tremor that followed. </p>
<p>“Eat,” said the older man, in unwitting mimicry of a certain werewolf, “you'll feel better.” </p>
<p>Draco looked down at the greasy food,fat uneven slices of potatoes smelling of meat and whatever leftover broth they had been cooked in, and scowled. It made his stomach turn, just a little bit. He nodded his thanks to the insolent muggle nonetheless, before popping a couple of the pieces of the disgusting food into his mouth. </p>
<p>It tasted awful, so he popped a couple more in. His fingers itched for the crinkling touch of a cigarette, but he resisted the urge. </p>
<p>Not yet, he told himself. Not yet. </p>
<p>As he munched on the deplorable contents of the chips basket, not for the first time, Draco felt oddly grateful for the existence the world he had been raised to hate, to despise…to demean. When everything he knew had turned upside down...this *worthless*, *pathetic*, *powerless* world had shown him kindness. </p>
<p>Simple, easy kindness. </p>
<p>It had given him anonymity, it had given him a place to go, it had given him a bar that served cheap liquor and greasy charred potatoes that passed for chips. </p>
<p>It had given him everything he needed, and hated. Everything he could ever love. </p>
<p>An odd, fleeting, fragile peace. </p>
<p>When the door behind him opened once more, Draco paid no attention to it. Well, almost. In a moment of weakness that inspired self loathing, he hoped it was the blasted group of kids who made their way through bars all over this dingy part of the city every week. But the door swung shut, and only silence followed.</p>
<p>Draco sighed, as the closing doors sent a chilly breeze his way. With the flurry of cold October air that brushed him, he felt something else and stiffened. </p>
<p>It was like the warmth that seeped into cupped hands holding a mug of tea, or the delicate embrace of heat that came with holding a candle close in the cold. A sigh, a touch- so delicate, so worn, so....silken. </p>
<p>The soft, comforting warmth of magic. </p>
<p>He sat up straighter, his mind clearing in an almost practised panic. He flexed his arm so his wand slipped off the holster, sliding between his fingers. He held effortlessly still, a deliberate finger almost absently tracing the rim of his glass. </p>
<p>There was nothing to be afraid of, not really. The war was over. Had been over for a while now. But Draco felt like his battles never ended. Threats came and went. Attacks and ambushes were not uncommon. Curses flew, bodies broke. Life went on. </p>
<p>Gripping his wand tighter in his hand, he lifted the glass to his lips and sipped. He heard the clip-clip of heels on wood, a call for a drink and then the almost imperceptible thud of a body collapsing on wood. Whoever it was, they hadn't come for him. He loosened his grip, just a smidge. </p>
<p>Sometimes it was the good ones that came, sometimes the bad. He belonged to neither, he belonged to both. And he had gotten used to living in this in-between. He had gotten used to not cowering in front of things that made him want to cower, and not undermining things that he had always been told were beneath him. <br/>There was some irony, Draco often thought, in how his cowardice in a war had taught him courage after. How his prejudice in a war had chipped at his biases. </p>
<p>Leaning his head casually on his arm, he chanced a glance at this stranger. The fact that they hadn't been looking to ambush him only made their appearance at this run down bar that much more bizarre. </p>
<p>Draco had been coming here for months now, and while the appearance of magical folk in muggle establishments the likes of this watering hole weren't uncommon, The Smaug Den was hardly a haunt of the kind.</p>
<p>It was hardly a haunt of any kind, really. </p>
<p>So when he caught sight of the unsuccessfully tamed bushy brown hair of the “stranger”, it was only natural that Draco's head would slip off his hand and slam itself unceremoniously into the counter. </p>
<p>The momentary silence that followed this unfortunate event almost had him disapparating, statute of secrecy be damned. But, gentleman -and one in complete control of his life- as he was, he simply pushed his red face off the counter for the second time that night. Sputtered conversations resumed as they always did, and Draco was not surprised to see a glare shot his way when he turned his face. </p>
<p>Ah, the sweet taste of nostalgia. </p>
<p>How many times had he seen those same hazel eyes shoot venom at him across a room?! How many times had he wished he could douse the fire from them?! How many times had this very hatred snared their lives together?! </p>
<p>Draco almost smiled. Almost. </p>
<p>A few stools down from him, white-knuckled fingers clasped tight around her glass of beer, was none other than Hermione Jean Granger. </p>
<p>And she looked very, very cross.</p>
