    <p>The day had been good : a sunny Sunday afternoon to end the summer vacations. Lunch had been the same as always : quite cold but peaceful, something Draco had learned to accommodate to over the years ; the road to the station, however, had been silent. Draco cherished the silence but knew it was a sign of his father’s temper.<br/>
« Remember what we said this morning ? » Lucius asked this with such authority, as they were standing on the platform.<br/>
« Yes, father, » he replied with no conviction whatsoever.<br/>
« Don’t think I won’t be watching you. »<br/>
Draco recognized his father’s irrevocable tone. At least he cares, he thought bitterly.<br/>
« I understand, father. »<br/>
This is just his way of showing he loves me. </p><p>Lucius never truly accepted his downs and lows, and always tried to live through me. That’s why he got me that stupid Nimbus 2001 in the first place, not to make me happy, as he should have at least pretended to, but just to pride himself. Always telling me to get sorted in the « right house » like if I hadn’t, I would’ve been the shame of the family, which, I already am, since I, apparently, suck at quidditch, and basically everything, while the great Harry Potter succeeds at everything he does. </p><p>« Did you hear what I just said ? », Lucius asked, his eyebrows furrowed. Draco looked up at his disagreeable, yet familiar face.<br/>
« Yes, father. »</p><p>It’s always « yes, father », « I understand, father », like the first time he told me about Harry, or when he strictly forbade me to make friends with « mudbloods », like we’re so much better than muggle borns just because they’re not « pure » ; because we’re such a lovely family.</p><p>He could have blamed his father for his own incapacity to make friends, too, but that would have been a lie, he gladly admitted to himself. Draco had wanted, for a long time, to please his father, to make him proud. Not only had he lamentably failed, but he also realized that by trying to fit in, he ended up isolating himself more. Every time he had taken someone down, wether it be Weasley for his second-hand robes or Granger for her muggle parents, he felt the tiniest pinch of regret piercing his shields. As for Harry, every time he looked him in the eyes after letting out another snark remark about his Mom, his werewolf uncle, or his stupid scar, he felt an unusual hollowness instead of the satisfaction he expected. </p><p>He heard laughter, looked up and saw a truly lovely family and friends standing a few feet away from them, hugging each other goodbye, parents looking at their children with such love in their eyes : he had never seen those. Harry was dodging his Dad’s hand trying to ruffle his messy hair one last time, and he could distinctively hear Hermione’s teary laughter as she said goodbye to her Mom and Dad. </p><p>*****<br/>
Lily took Harry’s face in her hands and kissed him goodbye on both cheeks. « Be safe », she said.<br/>
Harry gave her a loving smile and answered « Like always ».<br/>
Sirius, James and Remus exchanged a knowing look, holding their laughter back. Harry was known for his habit of getting into trouble in the family.<br/>
After getting on the train, he could finally sit down with his friends, Ron and Hermione, leaving his parents and their friends for the first term.<br/>
« Ron, do you have your rat ? », he heard Molly Weasley shout from the platform. The red haired boy didn’t blink before waving Cheezy at the window. Before he knew it, Hermione grabbed his hand and snatched the rat from his grip.<br/>
« Ron ! Be careful ! It’s a damn rat not a toy ! »<br/>
Hermione then proceeded to gently place Cheezy in his cage.<br/>
« She’s such a bummer ! » Ron whispered to Harry, obviously not annoyed at all.<br/>
« I CAN HEAR YOU ! » she retorted biting back a smile.<br/>
Harry smiled. « She’s right, Ron. You could hurt Cheezy. »<br/>
« When did you become so boring ? » Ron complained, rolling his eyeballs as he sat next to him.<br/>
« Aren’t you excited to start the new year ? » Hermione asked « We’re going to learn about patronuses ! I wonder what mine will be.. »<br/>
« Yes, we are ; and you already asked this 50 times on the way here », Ron said.<br/>
Ginny then entered the wagon, closely followed by a blonde haired girl with strange goggles and a dreamy smile. « Can we sit with you ? All the other ones are taken », she asked.<br/>
« Of course ! » Harry said, leaning back into his seat.<br/>
« This is Luna, by the way. »<br/>
« Hi », said Luna, almost singing. She stared at Ron « I like your pants, with the patchwork. »<br/>
Ron was pleasantly surprised : he was not used to people complimenting his clothes, as he didn’t have the fanciest ; just hand-me-downs.<br/>
« Thanks. »<br/>
The train was just leaving the station, they were all sitting and chatting, as friends do, except Harry seemed a little bit distant. Cedric Diggory, the captain of the Hufflepuff quidditch team, caught all of his attention as he passed accompanied by Cho Chang.<br/>
Hermione waved her hand in front of his eyes « Harry ! What’s wrong ? You seem off.. »<br/>
He could almost feel himself blush, with all his friends staring at him.<br/>
« Oh I think I know what’s going on.. » Ron exclaimed « Cho Chang just passed by our compartment ! »</p><p>Yup, you got me..</p><p>Harry was undeniably embarrassed as everyone laughed « Okay, okay, really funny, thanks Ron. » he sighed. </p><p>It’s definitely not Cedric I spent all summer trying not to think about. Just good old Cho Chang.</p><p>Cedric Diggory. His perfect, handsome, talented, selfless, unattainable, earth-shattering… crush. Harry sighed as he looked out of the window as the train entered the first valleys. He knew the way to Hogwarts almost by heart : the valleys and the mountains, the majestic pine trees, the high bridge he used to be secretly scared of which crossed the greyish blue river matching the color of Cedric’s eyes. Harry sighed again. He could still feel his cheeks burning. He remembered the first time he saw Cedric, when they all went to the Quidditch World Cup together, and when he was chosen as Hogwarts Champion in the Triwizard Tournament. He admired him for his bravery, his selflessness, his muscled arms and nicely cut jaw… he remembered looking at him waving to his friends when he won, his smile as bright as the sun and his eyes shining in the late afternoon light. When came summertime, as he realized he kept thinking of him and his friendly gaze, he started thinking maybe his admiration for Cedric wasn’t just admiration, but something more. He had then spent the rest of the summer holidays thinking about the boy. But of course his friends would think it was Cho he was looking at. </p><p>Slowly, the mountains were turning into the Hogwarts castle’s alentours, meaning they would be arriving soon : Harry recognized the familiar trees of the Forbidden Forest, the quidditch pitch, the lake, and soon, Hogwarts’ towers.<br/>
Harry was still deep in his thoughts but he could hear his friends talking.<br/>
« I can’t wait to see the new students ! » Ron turned to him « First years are always lost, it’s really amusing, isn’t it Harry ? »<br/>
Harry was suddenly awaken from his daydream « Yes but maybe this time we’ll actually help them instead of giving them the wrong directions. »<br/>
« You know it was an accident ! » the red haired boy defended himself « I still get lost in this castle ! »<br/>
« True », said Hermione. </p><p>As they got out of the train, Harry rushed to Hagrid, greeting him with a friendly hug.<br/>
« Welcome back Harry, Ron, Hermione ! Did ye have a nice summer ? » Hagrid asked with his usual strong and soft voice. « Yeah ! It was awesome ! What about you ? »<br/>
« Oh yeah, ye know, the usual… » . They walked towards the castle while Hagrid told them about his summer holidays, and stumbled upon Dean and Seamus, who always happened to be together, and walked with them to the Great Hall where the Sorting Ceremony should be beginning anytime soon.<br/>
As they entered the castle, Harry and Ron spotted Draco in the crowd at the same moment.<br/>
« He’s still here » Harry murmured to Ron « and he’s still the same. »<br/>
« Did you think he would disappear over the summer ? Just like that ? Of course he’s still here, » Ron said.<br/>
To be honest, Ron was kind of getting tired of all their bickering and fighting, they had to get over their little boys’ ego.</p><p>« Ariana Nott ? » professor McGonnagall looked into the crowd of first years, looking for her, the little girl hopped the steps to sit under the Sorting Hat. The professor placed the hat on the child’s head. After a few seconds of silence, the Sorting Hat exclaimed « Hufflepuff ! » and everyone in the house cheered.<br/>
Harry looked at her walking to her table and saw Cedric welcome her into her new family.</p><p>After all the students got sorted in their houses, they could finally start eating, to Ron’s pleasure. He couldn’t stop stuffing his face with food.<br/>
« Man, did I miss this ! » he said to Harry. His friend looked at him funny,<br/>
« It’s not like your mom’s the worst cook in the world, I like her food. »<br/>
« Yeah Ronald, shame on you for hating on mom’s food ! » Fred chimed in.<br/>
Harry was glad to be with all his friends again. They always saw each other during the summer holidays, of course, wether it be at his house or at the Weasleys’, but being all together in Hogwarts just wasn’t the same. However, it wasn’t exactly the same this year : Harry had never kept a secret from Ron and Hermione before. The others, sure, but Hermione always found out who he had a crush on anyway, and Ron and him could spend hours talking about their crushes at night. They always knew who he liked. Only now, he liked Cedric, and nobody knew about it, and he didn’t know if he wanted them to know, or how he wanted to tell them about it. </p><p>When dinner was over, Harry and his friends walked to the dormitories, they put their pyjamas on, and then, the fun could start.<br/>
Coming back to Hogwarts on a chilly august night was truly the best out of the summer vacations, if you asked Harry.<br/>
Dean and Seamus were chatting on Seamus’ bed when Ron took out some sweets from his jacket.<br/>
« Okay, look, Fred and George worked all summer on these, and I worked all summer on stealing some, so we might as well enjoy this. » he said with pride. Harry looked at Neville. He could feel his hesitation.<br/>
But after some « Come on Neville, this is gonna be fun ! » and « I don’t know, your brothers always come up with good but dangerous stuff.. », he finally accepted to taste some of it and they did, in fact, taste good.<br/>
They were all chatting and laughing, like always, but Harry couldn’t shake Cedric out of his head. It was usually easy for him to be on the outside and have fun without thinking about whatever was going on inside his head, but tonight he just couldn’t seem to forget about Cedric Diggory, at least not completely. The thought of the Hufflepuff golden boy was always at the back of his mind.</p>
