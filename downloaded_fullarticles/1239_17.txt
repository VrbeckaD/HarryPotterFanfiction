    <p>James was a fantastic assassin, but even he couldn’t escape a building full of soldiers unscathed.</p>
<p>It took him every ounce of effort to slip away, hand pressed against his side. If he was thinking clearer, he might have found it suspicious that he managed to escape at all.</p>
<p>At least, though, he got what he came for. One of Tom’s top lieutenants lay dead in her own house, and the Order’s calling card left burned into the first floor, a smoky contrast to the ornate decor of the Black’s family home.</p>
<p>Of course it was Sirius that made the point to leave the mark where everyone would see it.</p>
<p>By the time he pressed his call beacon and patched himself up, he was clear-headed enough to realize something was amiss. Leaning against a tree, waiting for the familiar sound of his partner’s whistle letting him know it was time to leave, James replayed the mission in his mind.</p>
<p>No one had chased him, and it was even too easy that he managed to infiltrate their compound. The kill was suspiciously simple, especially knowing what Bella could do in the open field.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, he knew something was wrong. Lily still wasn’t nearby, and he’d stymied the wound for long enough that he could move around again, even only at 75%.</p>
<p>James considered that he was tracked, but it was unlikely. The blow he took, some kind of spear running through his side, missed anything vital, and really only hindered him in the recovery time.</p>
<p>He made double sure he wasn’t being traced and ran back to their camp. </p>
<p>Halfway through, a cold chill ran up his spine. Hands numbed, he realized what was happening.</p>
<p>Bella was never in that house. Master torturer, the Eater’s director of intelligence, who took on the tasks Tom wanted to wash his hands from. She had been a step ahead of them.</p>
<p>When the camp was in visual range, he knew it was too late.</p>
<p>Most of the team was dead, and Lily was held on her knees by several soldiers in front of Bella.</p>
<p>It was clear she was being interrogated for information. James could barely make out what Bella was saying.</p>
<p>“He’s dead you know. It’s time. We put poison in him and let him run. By now he’s probably nearby. I wonder whose words will be last.”</p>
<p>Lily had been stoic stoic, but her facade broke upon hearing the words. Not many others could tell, but James always knew.</p>
<p>They were never an item. Their world was too fast paced, too dangerous to be together. They worked together seamlessly, but they never really talked about their personal lives.</p>
<p>Bella’s booming voice cut through James’ thoughts. The numbness spread through his arms and his feet. “You loved him didn’t you? It’s alright. Despite what Tom thinks, I’m not so cruel. Let that thought be your last, dear.”</p>
<p>Then, with a bang of light and a sob from Lily, she crumpled to the ground.James’s couldn’t move his body. He fell to his knees, then laid prone in the dirt, head still gazing at Lily as his breathing slowed to a crawl. She loved him. He was certain she did.</p>
<p>Moments later, he heard the crunching of footsteps in the dark as James eyes shut.</p>
