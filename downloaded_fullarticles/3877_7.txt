    <p>Harry Potter was never able to remember how it was, exactly, he had got from the Weasley’s kitchen to the Vecordia Mortifer Asylum for the Dangerously Insane. He could remember the latest explosive Wizarding Wheeze startling Fleur as she carried an enormous plate of roast potatoes, crashing crockery, shrieking, and Bill getting into a row with George. Then he remembered seeing fragments of the final battle, Snape with his throat torn apart, Molly wailing over Fred’s body, Remus and Tonks laid out side by side, glowing red eyes fixed on him and an overwhelming sense of rage. He vaguely remembered Arthur’s calm voice and the shrill tones of a hysterical St Mungo’s healer. Then he was lying in a darkened room, on a floor which appeared to be softened with cushioning charms, with only a blanket, a pillow and a plastic basin for company.</p><p>He didn’t care, of course. It had been months since he’d cared – maybe longer, as he didn’t really keep track of time. After the war ended, he’d been carried along on the euphoria and relief for a while. But somehow it had slipped away. The old thoughts came back, the old doubts, the nagging sense of failure, the vague dread that things were going to go wrong and, most of all, the clawing fear of losing those he loved. The love of Harry Potter was a curse. Every time he looked at Ginny, he wondered when it would take her. The people he loved were always taken from him. His parents, Sirius, Albus, Remus. Even, in a strange way, Snape, the faithful guardian of his mother’s memory.</p><p>He’d hated Snape, of course. Hated him for years. But now he grieved for him as deeply as if he’d loved him. Perhaps it was the memories, those miserable memories, which had made him realise just how much he had in common with his angry, bitter teacher. One, in particular, he couldn’t drive from his mind. It wasn’t the most horrific, not by far, but it struck him as the saddest. The boy Snape, perhaps seven or eight, had been looking up at a sour-faced woman, clutching his arm to his body as if in pain. His body shook slightly, as if he was crying.</p><p>“Control your emotions, you weak, pathetic boy” she had said. The distaste on her face reminded Harry of Petunia Dursley, but her tone of voice was the tone that Snape had used to torment his students in Potions class.</p><p>Snape, Harry concluded, had never stood a chance.</p><p>As the memory overwhelmed him again, Harry pulled the blanket towards himself, clutching it to his chest as he had one of Dudley’s hand-me-down jumpers as a child. He’d pretended the jumper was a teddy bear and cuddled it every night. Now he sought that same comfort, holding the scratchy warmth of the blanket in his arms as he felt the familiar choking rise in his throat and the tears came once more.</p><p>…</p><p>There were shoes in front of his face. Harry moved his hand around until he felt his glasses, and the shoes came into focus. They were solid, sensible beige shoes, poking out from a set of healer’s robes, topped by a round face and curly hair that reminded him of a younger Professor Sprout.</p><p>“Hello there, Mr Famous Boy-who-lived Potter. We seem to be looking rather sorry for ourselves today. Whatever seems to be the matter?”</p><p>The voice that spoke had a forced cheeriness to it that grated on Harry’s nerves. He closed his eyes.</p><p>“Don’t be like that now. It’s not often we get someone so famous here. A real hero and celebrity. We’re all ever so keen to meet you.”</p><p>He opened his eyes again. Perhaps it was his mood, but he found her words ominous rather than reassuring.</p><p>“That’s better. Now, up you get. Can’t have you dallying in here. Get changed, and you can go through to the ward.”</p><p>Harry pushed himself up to a sitting position and the healer handed him a stack of clothing.</p><p>“Come on, now.”</p><p>She stood watching, tapping her foot occasionally.</p><p>“Do I get some privacy?” Harry asked, shifting uncomfortably under her gaze.</p><p>“Privacy must be earned, Mr Potter,” the healer replied sharply.</p><p>Harry turned his back and undressed, before pulling on the provided underwear, trousers and shirt, all grey. He was sure he could feel the healer’s eyes on him, although another part of his mind told him he was being paranoid.</p><p>“What about my clothes?” he asked, clutching his jumper, hand-knitted by Molly Weasley, to his chest.</p><p>“Behave well, Mr Potter, and your own clothing will be returned to you. Right down to those rather fetching red underpants. Now, come along.”</p><p>Harry felt his face go scarlet and followed the healer out of the door.</p><p>--</p><p>They entered a long corridor with tiny rooms off either side. Harry didn’t look too closely until the healer stopped outside one room.</p><p>“This is yours, Mr Potter.”</p><p>Harry stepped in, noticing a grubby-looking mattress, a pillow and a blanket. There was a single shelf, with another set of clothing and pyjamas.</p><p>“You will keep it neat and tidy, Mr Potter. That is one of our rules. It’s important to maintain a sense of order. Follow the rules, you will be rewarded—for example, getting your clothes back, being allowed to close the door to your room, access to books, and such like. I can even…”</p><p>The healer cleared her throat and Harry looked up at her for a moment.</p><p>“I can even get you into the women’s ward. Plenty of willing ladies there.”</p><p>Harry felt slightly sick as the healer raised her eyebrows suggestively.</p><p>“Right then, let’s show you the rest of the ward.”</p><p>Suddenly businesslike again, the healer turned and walked from the room. Harry looked longingly at the mattress for a moment. He really didn’t feel like a guided tour. But on the other hand, he was pretty sure it wasn’t a good idea to go against the healer.</p><p>He followed meekly as she walked along the corridor, prattling in her fake cheerful voice. He paid little attention until they came to a large room, and she stopped suddenly.</p><p>“Everyone, look what we have here. Mr Harry Potter.”</p><p>Suddenly, Harry felt every pair of eyes in the room on him. There was a murmuring of indistinct voices. He saw two other healers walk up, as well as several patients.</p><p>“Fancy the great Harry Potter in our little hospital. What an honour indeed. I’m sure we are so overwhelmed that we don’t know what to do with ourselves.”</p><p>The voice which spoke was cold as ice. Harry glanced up to see a blonde healer giving him a venomous glare.</p><p>“Oh, Rufus, don’t be silly,” said the original healer.</p><p>Several of the patients had walked up close to him and began to touch him. One or two murmured his name as they pawed at his clothing. One man sank to the floor and wrapped his arms around Harry’s leg. Harry tried to pull away but the man gripped tighter. His hair was matted and his clothing filthy.</p><p>“Please, please,” the man begged as Harry felt panic rise within him.</p><p>Suddenly, the third healer stepped forward and pointed his wand to the man’s back. The man gave a jerk and released Harry’s leg with a whimper of pain.</p><p>“Oi, Black, there’ll be none of that,” the healer snarled.</p><p>“S… sorry, I’m sorry, Senior Healer MacNair,” the man whined.</p><p>Senior Healer MacNair gave him a sharp kick in the ribs.</p><p>“I’ll see that you are, Black.”</p><p>The tall healer then dealt with the other patients who had their hands on Harry in a similar fashion.</p><p>“No dignity at all,” MacNair said to Harry.</p><p>“Thanks, but that wasn’t…” Harry replied.</p><p>“Thank you, Senior Healer MacNair,” the original healer snapped back. “You’ll mind your manners here.”</p><p>“Thank you, Senior Healer MacNair,” Harry said. His mind was racing. Senior Healer MacNair. That couldn’t be good, surely.</p><p>“At all times you are to refer to healers by their title. If you don’t know their name, Healer will suffice. But so you don’t have this excuse, this is Healer Lockhart.”</p><p>The blonde healer moved his head slightly.</p><p>“And you’ve already met Healer Umbridge.”</p><p>Harry dropped his head.</p><p>“Thank you, Senior Healer MacNair, thank you, Healer Umbridge.”</p><p>This was definitely not good.</p><p>--</p><p>Harry slowly adjusted to the routine of the ward. He would be woken, far too early, by Healer Umbridge’s fake cheery voice. On a couple of mornings he was too slow to rise, and she hurled a series of stinging hexes through the door. After that, he made sure he was up quickly. He would carry his clothing through to the bathroom, then wash and dress under her watchful eye. After a few days of polite compliance, he was given a towel and allowed to use the shower, and after a week he was given a toothbrush.</p><p>Meals were served in the main room of the ward. Patients were expected to sit at the table and eat neatly, although they had only spoons. Anyone who spilled their food would be dragged from their seat by Healer MacNair and forced to lick their food from the floor. Several of the patients didn’t even bother to try and eat at the table. The man who had clutched Harry’s leg would snatch a piece of toast and sit in a corner, muttering as he ate. MacNair would glare at him, but leave him alone.</p><p>The time between meals was near-constant boredom, punctuated only by random brutality inflicted on any patient who stepped out of line. There were old issues of the Daily Prophet, some tattered books and a couple of decks of cards, neither complete. On the first morning, Harry hadn’t felt like company anyway, so had retreated to his room and flopped down on the mattress, staring at the wall.</p><p>“I wouldn’t do that if I were you.”</p><p>Harry turned to see a red-headed man leaning against the door frame. He was clearly a patient, from his grey clothing, but there was a clarity in his gaze which made Harry wonder who he was and what he was doing in the asylum.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Lying around in your room during the day isn’t recommended,” the man said. “Come on.”</p><p>He stepped into the room and Harry cringed away. The man ignored it and offered his hand.</p><p>“I’m Gideon,” he said.</p><p>Harry took his hand rather uncertainly and Gideon pulled him to his feet.</p><p>“Come back into the main room, and we can talk,” he said, grabbing Harry by the arm and pulling him from the room. About halfway down the corridor, Harry noticed Healer Lockhart, his cold blue eyes following Harry as he walked by.</p><p>Gideon pushed Harry into a sofa and sat down beside him.</p><p>“Harry,” Gideon said softly, “it’s not a good idea to isolate yourself here. You need to try and make sure you are never alone with Healer Lockhart. You’re not exactly his type, but you are young and famous, so he’s sure to go for you.”</p><p>Harry looked at Gideon for a moment, blinking in confusion. Then he felt a cold knot forming in his stomach.</p><p>“Fuck,” he whispered.</p><p>“Well, exactly,” Gideon said.</p><p>--</p><p>Gideon turned out to be Gideon Prewett, one of Molly Weasley’s brothers.</p><p>“But you’re dead,” Harry said, perhaps louder than was wise, because Gideon shushed him.</p><p>“I’m not the only dead man in here, Harry. In fact, there’s so many of us, this place should be called a cemetery. Once you are here, generally your family doesn’t discuss you any more. No wizard wants to admit they have a relative who is insane. Easier to say we are dead.”</p><p>“But… when you are released, what’s everyone going to say then?”</p><p>Gideon’s face looked a little sad.</p><p>“I won’t be released, Harry. Coming to the Vecordia Mortifer Asylum is a one-way journey. Just like the cemetery.”</p><p>Harry sat in silence for a few minutes, trying to absorb what Gideon had said. Did that mean he was in here forever? He glanced up and saw Healer Lockhart across the room, cold blue eyes on Harry. He was going to be stuck in here, trying to avoid Healer Lockhart forever?</p><p>“It’s not so bad, Harry.”</p><p>Harry turned and stared. He’d thought Gideon seemed quite sane until that point. </p><p>“Look, once you get used to it, it’s possible to have a reasonably decent life in here. Basically, stay away from Lockhart, don’t annoy MacNair, and do a few favours for Umbridge and the other healers, and you’ll be okay. Just don’t, whatever you do, end up in Ward Two.”</p><p>Harry continued staring at Gideon.</p><p>“I can see you aren’t quite ready to accept this, Harry,” Gideon said, patting him on the shoulder. I know it’s a shock and you probably aren’t feeling all that great right now, if you’ve ended up in here. But there’s a few of us who aren’t so mad, and we’ll do what we can to look after you. No guarantees, though. We can’t work miracles.”</p><p>Gideon gave Harry another pat on the shoulder and left him to curl up on the sofa, ignoring everyone in the room until he was called to lunch.</p><p>--</p><p>In some ways, Gideon was right. Harry washed, kept his room tidy and ate without making a mess. That was enough to make most of the healers leave him alone. Between meals, he’d curl up in a chair and stare at the wall, knowing that Gideon was keeping an eye out. Often, an elderly wizard would sit down next to him. He seldom spoke, except to pat Harry on the back or arm and say, “It will be alright, boy”. Gideon told him that the man was Victor Burbage, father of Charity, and that he’d ended up at the asylum after his daughter’s death. Victor moved slowly and spent nearly as many hours staring at the wall as Harry.</p><p>The man who had clung to Harry’s leg the first day took to following Harry around.</p><p>“He’s alright, Harry,” Gideon told him. “Regulus won’t hurt you.”</p><p>Harry gaped, remembering MacNair’s words on his first day.</p><p>“Regulus Black? But…”</p><p>Harry stared at the dark-haired man then back at Gideon.</p><p>“I know, another supposedly dead man,” Gideon said. “I did tell you there were a few here.”</p><p>Harry took a slow breath.</p><p>“Oh, oh Merlin. His brother was my godfather. I can’t believe he knew. He’d never have left his brother in here. Surely?”</p><p>Gideon shrugged.</p><p>“Hard to know. It’s a pretty old tradition, pretending your insane relatives are dead. And wizards are nothing if not traditional.”</p><p>“But Sirius was in Azkaban. Maybe he never knew?”</p><p>“It’s possible, Harry. I just can’t say.”</p><p>After following him for a few days, Regulus took to sitting on the floor beside Harry. He would poke his finger at Harry’s foot until Harry patted his head or shoulder. Then he’d rest his head against Harry and sit there making faint humming noises. After a while, Harry found it rather comforting.</p><p>Harry made sure he was never alone if he could avoid it. He noticed that there were a couple of men that Healer Lockhart seemed to target. One was blonde, with pale blue empty eyes. The other, unfortunately, was Regulus. Healer Lockhart would walk up to one of them and pull them by their hair. They would follow meekly down the corridor to the bedrooms.</p><p>“Can’t we do something?”</p><p>Gideon shook his head.</p><p>“They can do what they want to us. The other healers will back them up. Just try and keep your head down and hope he decides you are too much effort.”</p><p>It couldn’t last, of course.</p><p>One morning, instead of Healer Umbridge, he heard Healer Lockhart’s voice calling him to wake up. Before he could move, Lockhart had opened his door and entered his room, flicking the door shut with his wand as he moved closer to the mattress.</p><p>“Harry, Harry, I get the feeling you’ve been avoiding me.”</p><p>Harry shook his head.</p><p>“No, Healer Lockhart, sir.”</p><p>“I think you are, Harry. I think that nasty Prewett boy’s been spreading rumours about me. What’s he been telling you? Has he been telling tales?”</p><p>Lockhart raised his wand and stroked it down the side of Harry’s face.</p><p>“I don’t mean any harm, Harry. I just thought you might like to have some fun. Would you like to have some fun with me, Harry?”</p><p>Lockhart continued to stroke Harry’s face with his wand, while his other hand tugged at the waistband of Harry’s pyjama pants. Harry pulled away, but found himself pinned against the wall with the healer breathing in his face.</p><p>“Don’t be like that, Harry. Don’t make me force you. Or do you like to play rough? Is that it? You want me to play rough?”</p><p>Suddenly Harry felt the healer yank his hair and found his face buried in the man’s groin. He could feel himself begin to shake with fear, but another part of him was enraged. He thought of the resigned look on the face of Regulus when Lockhart dragged him away. He wasn’t going to be like that, wasn’t going to be the man’s victim.</p><p>He struggled, feeling rage rise within him. For a few moments, it simply seemed to arouse Lockhart more, but then the man jerked away cursing.</p><p>Harry dared a glance, and saw that the man’s fingers were beginning to swell, then his chest and face. It was the same accidental magic he’d used on his uncle’s sister all those years ago. For a moment, he felt rather pleased with himself, before the furious healer pointed his wand at Harry and everything went black.</p>
