    <p><i>“Dear William,</i><br/>
<i>I’ve already written to mom and dad and they are excited about my getting into the Ranger School! It’s the same one you and Jacob went too of course! I’ve already made a few friends too! The Teachers all seem really nice too. Mr. Flitwick is my favorite. He’s the Assist teacher if you remember! I’ve also met the headmaster!! It wasn’t for anything bad, don’t worry! Dumbledore is really nice.</i><br/>
<i>Some of the older students talk about Jacob. It seems people are mixed on how they feel about him.</i><br/>
<i>I still can’t believe it.. One of the biggest Ranger schools, and the only one where you spend a long time here, and I was able to get in!! I do feel weird about being so far away from home.. But hopefully, over these next few years, I’ll still be able to become a ranger, just like you and Jacob!</i><br/>
<i>I hope you’re safe, and I hope you’re close to finding Jacob. If you find him, hit him on the back of the head for worrying us all for so long!</i><br/>
With love,<br/>
<i>Your little sister Rosie.”</i></p>
