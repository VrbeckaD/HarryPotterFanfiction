    <p>Hey everyone! Like I said in the description, I want to write some requests for Harry Potter one shots :) If you'd like one just comment what you'd like to see! I write about any character or relationship (canon or not). Currently my only rule is no crossovers, because I probably haven't seen/read what you have suggested. Thank you so much!</p>
