  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>¡Oye!</span>
  </em>
  <span> ¡Marco, sal del pinche baño! Has estado allí por cuarenta y cinco minutos!” Carlos shouts angrily from the hallway.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It's too bad the walls of Lance’s house weren't soundproof, maybe then he could actually get a good night’s sleep for once. Oh well, it's too late now. He's already up, so might as well get out of bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Groaning, Lance rolls out of his bed and lands on the floor with a loud thud, hopefully retaliating enough at Carlos and Marco for disturbing his deep slumber. Lance slowly stands up and extends his arms out, stretching. His back cracks and he sighs in content.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance can't stay mad forever because today’s the day his Hogwarts letter should be arriving. He turns eleven years old today! Finally, the day of June 26 is here! Hunk, Lance’s best friend, has been waiting for this day since he turned eleven back in January. Hunk promised Lance he wouldn’t open his letter until Lance received his. They wanted to go to Diagon Alley together to pick out their wands and get their schools supplies.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Both Lance and Hunk come from a long line of Purebloods, people who only have magic heritage, so they’ve known each other for a long time. Their dads each work for the Ministry of Magic and their moms grew up together as childhood friends, which ultimately led to Lance and Hunk becoming best friends. Lance’s parents moved into the same neighborhood as Hunk’s parents before Lance and Hunk were even born! What a way to start a friendship, right? Their other house became too small and cramped because Lance’s family had gotten bigger. Marco, the youngest before Lance was born, outgrew his crib that had been in their parents’ room, but still was too young to share a room with his older brother, Carlos, so, naturally, they moved into a bigger house that would suit their family needs. Though, the final deciding factor was Lance himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His parents realized that their family would get even bigger, so they packed up everything and moved into a house that had enough bedrooms for the kids. The two oldest kids, Isabella and Carlos, each got their own rooms, the twins, Hannah and Lucy would share a room, and Marco and Lance would each get their own rooms too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once Lance was born, his mom would babysit him and Hunk when they were little. A friendship was quickly formed. They played together all the time and even attended the same muggle school (way before they received their Hogwarts letters of course). Hunk was always there for Lance whenever Marco was giving Lance a hard time, and they spent a lot of time at each other's houses. They were brought into each other's families: Hunk became a McClain and Lance became a Garett. They were brothers and would do anything for the other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Since their families were so close, Hunk and his parents were there for Lance and his family when the evil wizard Zarkon broke into their house killed his mother. Lance was the only one who actually watched it happen because, since he’s the youngest, he spent most of his childhood at home with his mom.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was only seven when he watched his mother die. Lance just took the trash out and was walking back inside when he heard the shattering of a plate.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>CRASH</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Lance hurries back into the house. “Mamá?! What-”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>He stops in his tracks when he sees a male wizard pointing his wand at his mother. The man didn't even look human. His skin has an unearthly purple tone while his fingers look long and wrinkly. This is something that Lance would only find in his nightmares. He doesn't seem real. He couldn't be.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“MOM!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>His mother turns and her eyes widen. “Lance! Get out of here! You’re not safe here!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The male wizard turns and smirks when he sees Lance. “Finally! Ultimate power!” Where one would usually see black pupils with colored irises around it, the man’s eyes were entirely yellow, showing no signs of even being human.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Lance’s mother steps between the wizard and Lance. “I won’t let you hurt him.” She glares at him.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Move out of the way. I don’t need to kill you and the boy. Just the boy will do,” the wizard replies, getting irritated.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Over my dead body!” Lance’s mom exclaims.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The wizard shrugs. “Fine, suit yourself.” He raises his wand and shouts, “AVADA KEDAVRA!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>A flash of green light explodes from the wand and slams into Lance’s mother, sending her back into the wall. Lance jumps out of the way and screams, “NO! MOM!” He turns back and faces the wizard, tears streaming down his cheeks. “How could you do this?!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I warned her to move, but she didn’t listen. Now you’ll face the same fate as she has!” the wizard exclaims, raising his wand again. “AVADA KEDAVRA!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Lance shuts his eyes tightly as the green blast comes from the wand. He expects to be hit, but instead it backfires and slams into the wizard. Lance opens his eyes they widen in shock as the wizard poofs into black smoke and flies out of his house.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“MARCO! YOU IDIOT! YOU CLEAN UP THIS MESS RIGHT NOW!” Isabella shouts from downstairs, interrupting Lance’s train of thought. “I TOLD YOU THAT PLATE WAS HOT!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance rubs his temples and shakes his head. </span>
  <em>
    <span>It was just Marco being dumb</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Lance reassures himself. He isn't watching his mother die again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shouldn't even be thinking about that right now. This is supposed to be a happy day. Besides, his mom wouldn’t want him to dwell on this. She’d want him to remember the happy things. His mom was amazing like that. Sometimes, when Lance was feeling lonely because his brothers and sisters went off to Hogwarts, his mom would tell him stories about her time at Hogwarts. The best memory, in Lance’s opinion, was the moment his parents met. At first they couldn’t stand each other because Lance’s dad liked to push his mom’s buttons and rile her up. They spent a lot of time in detention together, but during those times in detention, they grew closer until it blossomed into something new and beautiful. Lance hopes he finds someone like that when he gets to Hogwarts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“LANCE! GET DOWN HERE NOW!” Isabella, yells from downstairs, breaking him out of his thoughts once again. “IT’S HERE!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance immediately sprints out of his room and down the stairs, tripping over his brother, Marco. He barely manages to stick his arms out to avoid face planting into the ground, but his knee takes most of the blow. “Hey! Marco! What are you doing?!” Lance turns and glares at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Marco smirks up at him. “Trying to trip you. I think I succeeded.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance rolls his eyes and steps over Marco, ignoring his laughter. He finds Isabella, the twins (Hannah and Lucy), Carlos, and his father, Luis.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Isabella graduated from Hogwarts last year, Carlos is two years younger than her so he’s going to be in his final year, Hannah and Lucy are both going into their fifth year, and Marco is going to be in his third year.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, it took you long enough,” Isabella complains, handing Lance the letter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance glares at her and snatches the letter from Isabella. A wide smile spreads across his face, replacing the scowl. “Can I get Hunk over here? We promised we’d open our letters together.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait, Hunk </span>
  <em>
    <span>still</span>
  </em>
  <span> hasn’t opened his Hogwarts letter?!” Hannah asks in disbelief.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Didn’t he receive it in like January? Why would he wait?” Lucy wonders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance rolls his eyes. “I just told you why. We promised we’d open them together.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lucy raises her eyebrows. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Mierda</span>
  </em>
  <span>, I didn’t think that would actually happen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lucy, watch your mouth,” Luis scolds. He turns to Lance. “Sure Lance, you can bring Hunk over. I’m sure he’s-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The doorbell rings, repeatedly, interrupting Luis.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I GOT IT!” Marco yells from the other room. They hear the front door open. “Oh hey Hunk! What brings you-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“DID IT COME?!” Hunk asks loudly. “DID LANCE’S LETTER COME?!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“HUNK! GET IN HERE! I HAVE IT!” Lance shouts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hears the front door slam shut and Hunk rushes into the living room, clutching his letter tightly. Lance notices how worn down it is over the past months that Hunk has kept it. A small smile forms on Lance’s face, happy that Hunk kept his promise. Hunk looks at Lance with an excited smile on his face. “Ready?”</span>
</p><p>

</p><p>Lance nods happily and they both rip open their letters. He unfolds the paper and reads:</p><p align="center">
  <em> <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/50/32/6f/50326f3ff35cf6ef3b5de0c12e628ae8.jpg" alt="lance letter" width="400" height="477" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3671988939" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);" data-pagespeed-url-hash="3671988939" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/></em>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance rereads the first line of the letter numerous times, still in shock that he actually got his acceptance letter. It’s all so surreal! What if this was all just a dream and soon Lance would wake up and none of it would be true?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, that’s impossible. His knee still hurts after tripping over Marco. </span>
  <em>
    <span>That prick</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Lance thinks to himself. He’d avoid talking to his stupid brother as much as possible. Lance didn’t need to be constantly embarrassed and annoyed by Marco’s antics. Well, Lance wasn’t going to let him ruin his time at Hogwarts. He has Hunk to keep him company and to help avoid Marco.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lance, I’ve waited for this moment for five months,” Hunk says. “Honestly, it was so worth the wait! I’m gonna run home and show my parents! We have to send the owl out as soon as possible.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance nods. “Yeah! Then we can go to Diagon Alley together and get our supplies!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“HECK YEAH DUDE!” Hunk exclaims happily. “Oh man, I’m so pumped! Did you hear that they got a new headmaster?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They did?” Lance asks, he turns and looks at his three sisters and Carlos. “Did you guys know about this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Isabella shakes her head no. “I didn’t. Why, did the letter say something?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The letter is from the deputy headmistress,” Hunk answers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Headmistress? Oh, then yeah they must’ve gotten a new one. What is the deputy headmistress’s name?” Isabella wonders.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uhh-” Lance fumbles with his letter before opening it up- “Allura Quinn.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Professor Quinn?! She’s awesome! She’s the head of Gryffindor!” Marco exclaims. “Although, I think Professor Shirogane is cooler. He teaches Defense Against the Dark Arts.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah! Plus, he was in Allura’s grade too!” Isabella exclaims. “They both were in Gryffindor! I mean they were star Quidditch athletes so everyone thought they'd go to the big leagues. Opinions changed when they both were hired as professors.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’d love to stay and chat about this, but I really should get home. I kind of just sprinted out of my house without telling my parents. I’ll see you tomorrow Lance!” Hunk waves as he walks out of the house.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance turns to Luis. “Dad, we have to send in the owl saying I got the letter! Hunk and I need to get our stuff tomorrow!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luis chuckles. “Alright Lance, I will. Get me a paper, find the owl, and I’ll get right on it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lance smiles widely and does as his father asks. </span>
  <em>
    <span>This is the beginning of the greatest years of my life!</span>
  </em>
  <span> Lance thinks happily to himself. He hopes he can make his mother proud.</span>
