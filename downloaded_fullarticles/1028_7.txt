          <div class="userstuff"><p>The world beyond the Veil is soft and indistinct as smoke or mist;<br/>With laughter still light on his lips, he swiftly sinks deep into it.<br/>So beautiful in life’s full flush, with no corpse to remark his death,<br/>My last sight of my old friend’s smile, before I lose him to the haze.<br/>The memory is still sharp now, but dulling fast against the days:<br/>The wear of time and sorrow’s salt can blunt the edge of any wit.<br/>And how does time pass through the Veil? Does he still feel the minutes march?<br/>Does he remember his own name, and does his tongue remember mine?<br/>No flesh to halt the creeping fog, no body to resist its press,<br/>Could force of will and spite alone sustain him among their pale ranks?<br/>Unspeakables turn me away: its truth is not for civil minds.<br/>The old tomes are dispiriting, revealing just enough to tease.<br/>I lose myself between bindings: their words eat up my conscious mind<br/>Throw off the rhythm of my thoughts, leave gaping spaces where<br/>I once lived my daily life and considered mundaner things. <br/>But in my dreams I see him still, untouched by years of grief and pain,<br/>And I can see it in his eyes that if I only called for him<br/>In such a way that he could hear—if I could just draw back the Veil—<br/>I’d have my Star back by my side, as vivid as that final breath,<br/>As vital as the summers spent beneath the spangled galaxy,<br/>Lungs full of vibrant summer air, limbs tangled in the dewy grass,<br/>Full of the vigor of shared youth, each drinking in the other’s sun. <br/>The contrast makes my bedsheets cold, the books less friendly in my hand,<br/>My social graces lose their grace, my chest still aching for his loss.<br/>I seek out still more cryptic texts, pore over cluttered lines of runes,<br/>Until my head aches like my joints, and still my efforts are lukewarm.<br/>The books discourage summer thoughts from finding purchase in my plans:<br/>When one transcends their mortal coil, they cannot linger on the Earth,<br/>Or if they do they’ll never find a way to step back through the Veil. <br/>But traveling beyond the Veil, preserving my yet beating heart—<br/>A tourist to the chilling mists—I still might find my lost love there.<br/>No prohibition in the lore, and though the paper’s frail with age,<br/>The leather slowly moldering, the ink discolored on the page,<br/>I translate an old recipe, unique in its simplicity:<br/>A simmered stew of hemlock leaves and powdered root of asphodel,<br/>And purpose—iron, anchoring, with strength of will enough to stay<br/>Against the subtle draw of peace that’s promised by the beckoning grey.<br/>None have sufficient quality to keep full rooted to the earth <br/>The subscript says, and seems to laugh, to spite my cracked-rib, black-eyed hopes.<br/>But whose purpose could be as strong, whose motivations quite as pure,<br/>As lending hand or heart or arm to beating back the swelling horde<br/>That looms like storm clouds overhead of children, friends and innocents? <br/>And so I make the humble brew of hemlock and white asphodel,<br/>I light the candles, draw the runes, record this tale of my attempt,<br/>Then I shall think on what I have, and who it is I hope to find.<br/>My eyes are aching without sleep, each tendon of my body pains<br/>But when I think of him, I find it swiftly, sweetly drifts away.<br/>I hope that I may visit him, I hope this visit’s not my last,<br/>I hope my research paves the way for more post-mortal reunions,<br/>I hope—I raise the vial now—what follows recounts my success.</p></div>
