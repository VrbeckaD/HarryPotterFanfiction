    <p>Uncle Felix was on highly-secretive, certainly-not-for-their-ears business and had to talk to a man in Scotland. After the events in the theatre he had decided the girls needed another distraction and he was rather reluctant to let them out of his sight, lest they decide to do more detecting. So he took them aboard a train towards Hogwarts. He had not told them what Hogwarts was or where it was exactly. Though the fact that they had to walk through a wall was a rather big clue that this place was unlike anything Daisy and Hazel had ever seen. </p><p>It was of course Uncle Felix's hope that by giving them an innocent mystery and by keeping them occupied, the girls would not start looking for trouble. To which Daisy protested, that they never looked for trouble but rather trouble had a tendency to find the Detective Society, typically in the form of dead bodies. It wasn't their fault people kept killing each other, although Daisy didn't exactly look sad about this fact. Hazel, however, still detested the sight of dead bodies. It made her nauseous and she felt that it always would. It was certainly the worst part of being a detective. </p><p>Had the two young girls been paying attention, or believed in magic, they would have figured out that Hogwarts was a school for people with a special gift. It was a school for Wizardry and Witchcraft and had existed for centuries. Many people claimed it was the safest place in all of Britain, a fact that would soon be disproved. </p><p>But the incident had not yet occured when Uncle Felix arrived at Hogwarts with Daisy and Hazel. They were greeted by two fourth year students and a teacher. The teacher offered to escort Uncle Felix to the Headmaster, Armando Dippet who he had an appointment with and a long friendship. The two students offered to show Daisy and Hazel around the castle, something which they happily agreed to. After all, they were detectives and a good detective always tried to watch their surroundings and find out as much as they can. Even if nothing had happened, just yet.  </p>
