  <span>“Why is this so damn hard?” Seamus whined, tossing his quill down and glaring at his parchment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know what else is hard?” Blaise said, raising an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Seamus levelled a glare at him. “This book I’m about to beat your ass with?” he said, resting his hand on the textbook in front of him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blaise snorted, leaning closer. “Please, you wouldn’t damage my ass, it’s too perfect.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or so you think!” Seamus said. “Don’t distract me! If I don’t do well on this exam, then I won’t stand a chance getting into the Healer programme!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shaking his head, Blaise leaned back in his chair. “If anything is going to hold you back, it’s your tendency to blow things up with even the most rudimentary spells.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t blown anything up in over a week!” Seamus hissed. “And the last time was your fault!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blaise raised an eyebrow. “How was that my fault?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Seamus’ face reddened. “Because you stuck your bloody hand down my trousers right when I was casting!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yeah,” Blaise said with a smirk. “I forgot about that. You did look like you needed a hand though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Seamus’ hand tightened on the textbook, and his eyes narrowed. “And people call me easy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blaise grinned, leaning closer again. “I’m always easy for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rolling his eyes, Seamus picked up the textbook and hit him lightly on the head with it. Blaise scowled at him, but quickly leaned forward and kissed him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Seamus kissed back for a few moments, and then whacked him again for good measure.</span>
