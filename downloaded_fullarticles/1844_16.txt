    <p>
  <span>There was something special about the sharp scent of salt water in the morning. With twilight blooming through the light-polluted bay, Percy stretched his arms out, pouting at the waves. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Better than coffee,” his fishing partner called, letting down one of their nets even as the faintest shards of yellow and orange peeked above the horizon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You say that now,” he replied, rubbing the last of the water from his face as he got to working prepping their boat for the morning. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His partner laughed, a croaky, bubbling thing. “Give it another month, Jackson,” he said. “She only gave you a little love tap.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She, of course, was the ocean. Percy was half-certain the man had a love affair with the Atlantic. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pair bobbed in mostly-silence while the sun made her way into the dawn and early morning. Nearly a month had passed since Percy first graduated from the fish shack to being Joseph Crowley’s assistant on the main boat. Since, he’d fallen into a sort of rhythm as he kept himself above the red working two and a half jobs between monster attacks and Camp Halfblood training workshops. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Three months ago, he’d have thought he would be at camp full time, training the next generation of demigods. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Three months ago, he hadn’t buried one of his best friends. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Storms rolling in,” he called out to Crowley, glancing between his phone’s radar app and the thick cumulonimbus clouds building up under the roiling waves. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Already?” Crowley said, moving over to check the radar himself. “Thought it wasn’t supposed to come in until late afternoon.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percy shrugged, shoving his phone back into its waterproof bag. “Guess it’s moving faster than we thought. Should we head in? The waves are already looking nasty.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Crowley hummed for a moment before nodding, moving to his nets to pull them in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percy got to work.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>The rain beat against the store’s windows as Percy sliced and prepped fillets from the day’s catch. Beside him worked a girl about two years younger than him, thick-framed glasses hiding her eyes as she packaged each fillet and vacuum-sealed it. Near the front of the store, tidying up a spilled bucket of nightcrawlers, Crowley hummed some old folk song, occasionally letting a word or four slip out. There was a quiet sort of calm about the small store that sank into the bones of whoever wandered in, a sort of timeless liminality that sat in their organs and settled there, heavy but not unkind. Restful in restlessness or perhaps the reverse. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Regardless, Percy enjoyed it. Whether chopping up the poor fish to sell in the farmer’s market or shove onto the shelves or mopping the deck, as Crowley’s niece liked to call any and all cleaning chores, he liked the peacefulness of the shop and seeing all the little cogs and bits come together because of him. Creation instead of destruction, he supposed, as dorky as that sounds when it comes to sweeping up some trash or scaling a fish. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Crowley was good, too, about his ADHD. The man had a preternatural sense of when Percy needed a prod or some help or just to be left alone to figure shit out. He seemed to know before Percy did when his executive dysfunction was acting up or when he was so restless he just needed to run out to the boat and clean the sucker up and all around climb around the decks like a damn monkey. His niece, the girl working beside him, was a high school student about a few weeks out from graduating. She was autistic, with an array of symptoms that let her hide in plain sight if you didn’t pay attention or spend too much time around her. Crowley had mentioned that she’d been on the edge of autistic burnout, pushing herself too hard to seem neurotypical and that his brother, her father, hadn’t helped. Just like Percy, something about the shop seemed to calm her, and she mentioned her shutdowns lessening in number and he noticed her stimming happily more often, little hops and hums and spins that seemed to brighten the place up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was almost like home. Maybe that was pathetic, that the place that he felt most at home was a mortal’s fish shop, but it was true. Every since </span>
  <em>
    <span>his </span>
  </em>
  <span>death, Camp Halfblood held one ghost too many. He might travel back every month or so to teach the new kids, because they deserved to not be abandoned by yet another person, but he couldn’t stay there. Not until he got over this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And home..he was always welcome there, he knew that, and he felt at home whenever he was with his parents and baby sister, but it wasn’t enough, as terrible as that sounded. He had no connection to the apartment, and with the high cost of rent and his unwillingness to live at their place and put them in danger meant they couldn’t afford to have a room for him all to himself. Sure, they could always pull out a cot or leave blankets on the couch for him, but it wasn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>his </span>
  </em>
  <span>home. He wasn’t sure if that made sense, but it did in his chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His own apartment was a studio that had, surprisingly, a kitchen and private bathroom, but enough floor space for a small twin bed— no frame— and a bookshelf. If he squished it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hadn’t chosen to buy and squish one in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t need much, honestly. A lifetime of living on the edge of homelessness with his mother had meant he didn’t have all that much to begin with, and between traveling from home and camp, he’d gotten used to keeping his belongings small. Anything that wasn’t something he’d need on a frequent basis, he’d left at his mom’s or, for the most part, his cabin. Unless he had a younger sibling running around from before the war and his dad hadn’t told him, any Poseidon campers would be at the most almost three years old and probably nowhere near on the camp’s radar. His cabin was safe to use as storage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jackson,” said Crowley, dragging him from his thoughts. “I need you to go tie down the boat with the extra ropes. The storm is looking even nastier on the radio. I’d bring it up into the shed, but the small motor boat is already being worked on in there and I can’t risk it being outside in its state. If lightning starts up, finish up whatever you’ve done that far and get your scrawny ass back inside. I don’t need my best navigator getting friend by mother nature herself.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aye aye, Cap’t,” he said, setting down the knife and fish he was filleting. “Katie,” he started, catching Crowley’s niece’s attention. “I’ll be back in a few. Don’t get guts everywhere again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was one time!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He snickered and gave her a peace sign, jogging over to the sink to wash the fish off. Less than five minutes later, he was dragging a thick pile of ropes to the boat, arms only aching a bit. Say what you will about sword fighting, but it sure built up his arm muscles, swinging that thing around. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the clouds rolled in faster and darker, Percy worked on securing the boat as best as he could manage. It helped that he could keep the water around him calm with the docks being mostly abandoned. Tying up the boat would have been ten times harder with salty water spraying him in the face every three seconds. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something about this storm felt unnatural. He wondered distantly if his father and Zeus had gotten into another fight. According to Annabeth, who was still working on the rebuilding of Olympus, the nasty early hurricane that had struck New Jersey was a result of Poseidon claiming Zeus had no sense of fashion just within the storm god’s earshot. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Toddlers, the lot of them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lightning arced across the sky as Percy finished the last rope. He cursed, eyeing the almost bloodshot sky warily. Zeus was still pissed off about his demand a few years back and there had been way too many close calls with lightning to count since. A good sign to go in, then, he figured. The boat was as secure and protected as he could make it. As he turned into the wailing wind, he debated the intelligence of keeping his water invulnerability on up until the door before realizing Crowley would definitely notice him being bone dry. Gearing up for the sprint back to the shop, he got ready to drop the invisible ‘shield’ when something flashed in the corner of his eye. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Turning, a cold shiver raced along his spine. Something felt wrong.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As if controlled by magnets, his eyes took a long, slow passage from the docks to the water, widening as a sea monster the size of several large coach buses emerged from the waves. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even as water raced across the dock and pulled at his magically dry feet, his hand went to his phone and the pen in his pocket, blood roaring in his ears. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuckity fuck fuck fuck,” he said intelligently, backing up several steps and hitting the ‘emergency’ button one of the Hephaestus kids had installed on this generation of demi-phone. “I don’t suppose you’re one of my half brothers come to say hello, huh?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It roared and spat a boulder at him, which he deflected with a tentacle of water. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Guess not,” he said faintly, transforming his pen into Riptide. Slashing the sword in front of him, he held out a hand and made the universal ‘come at me’ sign. “Let’s do this, fish fry.”  </span>
