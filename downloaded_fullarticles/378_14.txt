    <p>The stars shine luminously from above, breaking through the crisp darkness. </p><p>Bright flickers of light unreachable by this world, yet still oddly familiar. Intimate, these never-changing fixtures plotted against the heavens — small reminders of mystery and the unknown. From somewhere in the distance the throaty melody of forest wildlife, of toads and crickets and leaves rustling as small critters scurry across branches, plays against the twinkling backdrop. Grass sways calmly in the easy night breeze — and stars glimmer one moment, until they don’t the next.</p><p>The image dulls as thick fog rolls in out of nowhere, and the forest melody pauses all at once as if halted by a conductor’s hand. The interrupting billows just hang there silently, the last pitch reverberating for a moment within the echo chamber of heavy mist, until all falls into complete silence. The fog slowly expands skywards to consume the glow of every star and intertwines delicately between the blades of grass below, like newly spun cotton candy, obscuring everything that it comes into contact with. The air is fragrant; almost sweet. </p><p>A few moments pass before a ripple disturbs the thick blanket of white. Points of light appear one by one and intensify as if hooked to a dimmer switch, imperceptible at first until there is no mistaking their presence. The mist parts and lifts skyward like an ethereal curtain, presenting a new scene that has materialized on the field.</p><p>A group of large tents rests atop the grass now, the long sharp curves of the draping panels creating loud, geometric contrast to the vast, silent expanse of surrounding space.</p><p>The tattered fabric shines with vague fluorescence, the alternating strips of black and white infused with an otherworldly gloom that is only barely there against the curiously ash-gray surrounding sky. Nature’s colors have been washed away — the vibrant green of the grass, the rich brown bark all muted — and replaced with the radioactive texture of dark energy instead. </p><p>The stars have been pushed back into the black night and obscured completely now behind the diffused mist and the lights, and only this strange new world is left visible to the human eye in its wake. Tent after utterly motionless tent reaches into the distance, all enclosed in a perfect circle of black iron fencing, the severe points of each post mimicking the shapes they surround and keeping all of the colors and movement out.</p><p>A wind stirs the trees and picks up momentum, and a single leaf begins to tumble over the grass. It sputters across tall green blades before finally finding purchase against the ornate, Victorian molding of the gate, going no further for a moment despite the insistent wind. Everything inside is gravely still — and then the fabric of the tents reacts, as if on a small delay, rippling into life as the surrounding forest sounds return all at once.</p><p>A resounding <em> pop </em> splices its way through the silence and echoes against the surrounding trees, the familiar precursor of a new arrival. A cloaked figure appears out of nothingness, a woman, slight in size and hesitant in her gait. She pauses for a moment as she stares at the sight in front of her, with concern perhaps, or fear, or maybe merely wonder. </p><p>But she trudges onward, in the direction of the black and white stripes and the fog and everything else that lies within it all. The misty air encloses her, ushering her on with a mind of its own, as she moves herself closer and closer to the entrance gates ahead that begin to glow brighter as she approaches — a glow that draws anyone who sees it in with the thrill of anticipation for whatever oddities surely lie inside, mixed with a fraction of dread about the same.</p><p><em> Cirque de Lune </em> is scrawled elegantly atop the gate in the same wrought-iron, but gleaming brighter than anything else around it, highlighting it against the backdrop of colorless tents. But the circus is not open to guests. Not yet. The space behind the gate is empty and still, no sign of life, seemingly abandoned except for the large black sign pinned squarely into the grass. </p><p>
  <em> Opens at Nightfall. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Closes at Dawn. </em>
</p><p>The woman reaches the entrance moments later and wraps her hands around the cold metal, thwarted by the locked gates that greet her and the sign that informs her that they won’t be opening for another 16 hours at least. She gives the fence a diminutive shake with her fists, but it’s no surprise that the gate gives no sign of budging. She releases her hands and takes a step back, running a hand through her hair and resting it at the nape of her neck.</p><p>“Fuck,” she whispers, and her voice quivers at the end of the word. She turns around to look in the direction she came from, feeling exposed while still outside of the safety of the gate, but the path she had taken from her arrival has been consumed by the fog. Erased from the world.</p><p>“Hello, Jonna,” a deep voice pulls her attention back as she whips her head around again with a gasp. A tall man dressed in a suit the color of a starless night is leaning motionless against the gate, which stands wide open now. His complexion matches the pale glow of the tents, and if she hadn’t known he was there, he could have blended into the background, unnoticed. His dark hair falls forward onto his shoulder as he stands upright and reaches a steady hand toward her, which she takes in her shaking one. “We’ve been expecting you.”</p>
