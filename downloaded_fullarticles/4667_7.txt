  <b> A Graduation Prank</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Part 1</b>
</p>
<p>"Congratulations to the class of 2024!" Uncle Neville, I mean, Headmaster Longbottom said to the Great Hall on the Friday before the Sunday of my graduation from Hogwarts. "I hope everyone enjoys the dessert and the seventh years may begin going to the Hogsmeade carriages for their special overnight trip." All the seventh years clapped and whooped. They were allowing us this freedom with a party planned by the Head's. I think it was to keep the younger classes from joining our graduation festivities. I was very excited, for multiple reasons.</p>
<p>“Do you think I could get out of this by saying I'm allergic to the bed at the Three Broomsticks?" asked Carla, my very shy, conservative best friend.</p>
<p>"I don't think you deserve to be in Slytherin if you don't try!” I took a cookie and stood up from the table. “I, on the other hand, am rather excited.”</p>
<p>"Of course you are Rosie,” Scorpius came up beside me and kissed my cheek. “Your cousin has only been planning this graduation party for three years, and you've only been trying to sabotage it for four," He said sarcastically. I kissed him on the lips to shut him up. I didn’t want Albus to hear, because even though Scorpius was his best friend, Scorpius was also my boyfriend, so he'd been able to keep my big plan a secret so far.</p>
<p>"Let's go," I grabbed Scorpius’ hand, “see you there Carla?" She shrugged taking a bite of her cake.</p>
<p>Scorpius and I walked hand in hand down the corridors toward the carriages. I looked at him as we walked, trusting him to guide the way. Who knew that when my father pointed out the boy at the train station, destined to be my mortal enemy, would turn into my gorgeous boyfriend. His blond hair was long, too long for his Auror training, but he knew he would have to cut it soon, however reluctant he may be. I was admiring the curve of his nose and the beauty of his grey blue sparkling eyes when he noticed me staring. He smirked at me, pulling me quicker down the hallway. I giggled as I kept to his pace. I was so happy in this moment, I never wanted this to end, and I really hoped it didn't have to. This all started back in the summer before fifth year right before school started.</p>
<p>Al, Scorpius,and I had always been friends: we were all in the same house, we all liked Quidditch and we just got along splendidly. But, that summer Scorpius’ mother had been ill, and passed away at the end of June. After her services Scorpius and his dad took a two month vacation to France. This had been the first summer since first year the three of us didn’t spend joking around on the Quidditch pitch behind the Burrow (where
my family lived to help my aging grandparents), or at the pond behind Malfoy Manor trying to splash each other without ending up fully soaked, or sitting around the fire at night at Godric’s Hollow listening to Teddy or Uncle Harry tell us stories that would make us laugh until we couldn't breathe. In short, we missed him that summer. He and I had written a few exchanges over owl post, but they had been brief and usually about anything other than ourselves.</p>
<p>When I heard Albus had invited Scorpius over for dinner with the whole family the night before we left for school that year, I asked my mum why I felt like I was going to throw up. She had just laughed nervously and assured me I was just excited to see my friend. </p>
<p>But after that summer apart, something had changed between us. Our hugs lasted longer, our fingers would find each other without a thought, and we spent more time alone together than we did with Al. It felt natural and right when we were around each other, and that was the beginning of how we ended up here today.</p>
<p>"Come here Rose,” Scorpius said as we reached the carriages pulled by thestrals that neither of could see. We seemed to be the first people to arrive.</p>
<p>"Come where?" I asked signifying we had reached our destination.</p>
<p>"Here," he opened the nearest carriage door and pulled me into it with him. "We have about five minutes before anyone else shows up." He started kissing my neck as he leaned over me to pull the carriage door closed.</p>
<p>"What did you have in mind?" I asked with a smirk because I knew exactly what he was thinking. It was like the first time he kissed me it was like I could read his mind. It had been the end of fifth year when it finally, and I mean finally, happened. We were outside by the lake studying for OWLS when Al announced he had a girlfriend.</p>
<p>***<br/>
<i>2 years ago</i></p>
<p>"You, a girlfriend? Are you sure she said yes?" I teased, my cousin was not well known for his smoothness with the ladies, that was more well attributed to his older brother, James. Scorpius, who was sitting beside me across from Al who was sitting on the stump of an old tree, nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>"Sod off," Al said, standing while gathering his books.</p>
<p>"Are you leaving?" Scorpius said with a fake pout.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm sick of watching the two of you flirt and dance around the fact you fancy each other, so yes. I am going to go study with Michelle. Have fun with your <i>studying</i>." He said the last bit so sarcastically I could practically feel the disgust oozing off his lips. </p>
<p>When he was too far away to hear me I turned to Scorpius who had buried his face in his History of Magic book, "Are you learning about how my mother created all new legislation for the treatment of magical creatures?" I asked laughing at how deeply engrossed he was pretending to be. I reached a hand out and lowered his book to reveal his face, which was usually very pale but was now sporting a deep pink blush. "What are you—,” he cut me off by taking my face in his hands, his book forgotten on the grass.</p>
<p>My breath hitched, I was certain my face was blushing more furiously than his, I was also certain this was the moment he was going to kiss me. And I was right. It was a sloppy 15 year old's first kiss, complete with awkward teeth smashing and nose clashing, but it was also wonderful.</p>
<p>I knew he knew what I was thinking because after the initial lip contact he didn't release me but pulled me closer. We sat there with our lips together, kissing, breathing in each other's scents for almost a whole minute before we heard my cousin Lily call out from behind the old tree, " I KNEW IT!" </p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"Maybe I can give you a little preview of what I have planned for later," he raised his eyebrows as he said this and the passion and lust in his eyes made me speechless. It wasn't often I had nothing to say but Scorpius just knew how to shut me up. I nodded quickly, and cast a quick silencing charm on the carriage.</p>
<p>He knelt on the floor of the carriage in front of me, and placed his hands on my exposed knees. I raised an eyebrow at him. He placed a tender kiss on my right thigh and then my left all while working is hands up the side of my legs. He pulled me forward so my bum was barely on the seat. He was about the slip a finger under the elastic of my knickers before I stopped him, grabbing his face and pulling him up from the floor onto the bench next to me.</p>
<p>He pouted as I turned to face him, crossing my legs. Although I loved it when he kissed me <i> everywhere </i>, I didn’t want any true intimate time we had tonight interrupted by rowdy anxious seventh years excited for the party. I kissed him on the lips, running my hands through his hair. </p>
<p>"Later," I whispered in his ear before grazing my teeth along his earlobe. I kissed his neck and felt the vibration of his laugh on his throat.</p>
<p>"You drive me absolutely crazy," he pulled me in for a hug, kissing the top of my head.</p>
<p>"I love you," I said quietly into his chest.</p>
<p>“I love you," he replied into my mane of red curls.</p>
<p>And then, as if right on cue the door to our carriage opened to reveal my cousin Roxanne (who was a Gryffindor), and her boyfriend Frank Longbottom (who was also a Gryffindor).</p>
<p>"Hey!" I said pulling away from Scorpius’ embrace.<br/>
"These seats taken?” she said with energy as she hopped in, Frank right behind her.</p>
<p>"Hey dad," Frank called out to Uncle Neville from the door of the carriage, “Mark Rose and Malfoy as checked in!”</p>
<p>Scorpius and I glanced at each other with a slightly embarrassed look and each stuck a hand out the door without showing our faces to prove we were here. We closed the door and our carriage began moving.</p>
<p>"Are you excited for whatever Albus planned for this party?" Frank asked. Roxanne and I smirked at each other, we had been planning a small sabotage for Albus' party since we found out he (the Head Boy) and the Head Girl (a girl from Ravenclaw), would be planning the seventh year graduation party. It had mostly been Roxanne's idea, she inherited her mischievous brilliance from her father, and my uncle, George. Really we weren't doing anything too extravagant, just something to make the night a little more interesting.</p>
<p>“Very," I smiled.</p>
<p>We sat discussing our plans for after Hogwarts for the rest of the ride to Hogsmeade.</p>
<p>***<br/>
<i>3 weeks ago </i></p>
<p>"ROSE! ROSE!" I heard my name being called loudly from the top of the Slytherin girls dormitory. I was sitting on my bed reading a book for Muggle Studies.</p>
<p>"Did you hear my name?" I asked Madeline who was doing her makeup with her bedside mirror. She just shrugged, Mads was never big on conversation when it wasn't something to do with her.</p>
<p>"ROSE! COME UP HERE!" said the voice again, this time I could tell it was Scorpius. I dropped my book, put on my slippers and rushed up the seven flights of stairs (why the first years didn’t get the bottom floor I'll never know). When I reached the top of the stairs, out of breath, Scorpius was there holding a piece of paper with a giant un-Malfoy like smile on his face. "I got in!" he pulled me into a tight squeeze and held me close.</p>
<p>“To the Auror training program?" I said, struggling to speak in his tight embrace.</p>
<p>“Yes!" he let me go just long enough to flash the letter at me, then pulled me into a deep kiss. It felt like heaven. </p>
<p>For the past couple of weeks, between his interview and now, he had been somewhat distant, so this deep kiss and embrace really meant the world to me. It felt like everything was okay again. “I'm so proud of you," I said between kisses. "I have that bottle of elder wine hidden in our place just waiting for this moment, fancy a drink?”</p>
<p>He pulled me along out of the Slytherin common room toward a dungeon room we had found in sixth year and claimed as our own. We mostly used it to make out and talk without interruption from interfering family members and professors. It was our secret get away. When we reached the room he pulled me in, charmed the door locked, and placed a silencing charm, the usual routine.</p>
<p>I ran over to the place where I stashed the wine and pulled out two glasses. I poured us each a glass and we toasted, "To your future!" I said.</p>
<p>"To <i>our</i> future!" he corrected me. I smiled at him as we downed our glasses of wine. Then we sat there on our spread of blankets and cushions, talking about his training, and my anxiety about not hearing from St. Mungo's about the Healer training program yet. It was when the whole bottle of wine was gone we realized how long we had been talking and how much we had really missed each other the past few weeks. "I love you." Scorpius said to me with such intensity I was shocked. We had started saying "love you" earlier this year, but <i>I</i> love you seemed that much more intense. </p>
<p>"I don't think we should have finished that bottle of wine,” I said.</p>
<p>"No,” he said and inched closer to me, placing one hand on my neck and looking directly into my eyes. "You are the most beautiful, kind, wonderful, crazy person I have ever met and I am madly in love with you.”</p>
<p>My eyes were welling up for reasons I didn't know, "I love you too," I choked out before he pulled me in for the most intense kiss of my life. He got rid of both our wine glasses, making space on our blankets. He weaved his fingers into my hair and kissed me, not just kissed, but <i>kissed</i>. I couldn’t help but let out a moan when he sucked on my lower lip and slipped a hand up my shirt. I scrambled to untuck his shirt from his trousers and worked on the buttons. He unhooked my bra underneath my shirt and we broke apart for a few seconds to rid ourselves of our offending clothes. Now I was naked except for my school skirt and the stupid slippers I had thrown on earlier and he was topless. </p>
<p>His body was lean and I could see where his muscles were more defined from his new Auror training workout regiment he was following. I was on the softer side, not very pudgy, but definitely not stick thin, how could I be with all of Grandma Weasley’s amazing cooking?</p>
<p>He stared at my body, as I stared at him, soaking it all in, his eyes roaming from my skirt to my chest and then my face. "I love your freckles," he said and started kissing all of them starting on my clavicle and moving to my breasts. I lay down on our blankets as he kissed me down my body and back up to my face. He slipped a hand under my skirt and met my eyes for approval, I was so turned on and flushed from the wine I could only nod a yes, I needed him to touch me. </p>
<p>"Tell me is this what you want Rose?" His finger slipped beneath my knickers, running his finger along me. I whimpered, I needed more. “Rosie, you're so wet," he ran his finger the other way and I shuddered as he reached my most sensitive spot. He used his other hand to slip my knickers down my legs, only leaving my skirt. He switched his finger to his thumb and started rubbing my clit.</p>
<p>“Scor," I moaned, arching my back as this wonderful feeling pulsed throughout my body.</p>
<p>"More Rose?" he asked as he continued moving his finger while kissing my neck. My hands were almost assuredly leaving marks on his back as I clutched at him with pleasure. I started furiously kissing his neck when I felt his erection straining against his trousers into my leg. He must have took that to mean yes because he inserted one, and then two fingers into me while still working his thumb. I could feel my pent up pleasure from before growing, begging for release. </p>
<p>Then it hit me, an orgasm like I had never experienced. I don't know if it was the wine or something Scorpius did differently but it was amazing. He removed his hand from beneath my skirt and reached my hand down to undo his belt. He helped me by standing to remove his trousers and pants, I took the time to remove my skirt. Now, I was entirely naked, as was he.</p>
<p>His manhood was extremely hard as I touched him, using my hand to massage it. Just seeing how his body was reacting to mine was enough to make me more wet than I already was, I moved to lower my mouth onto his erection when he choked out, “If you do that I will not last two more minutes," I kissed him on the mouth and moved us so he was laying down and I was straddling him. "What are you doing love?" he asked through kisses as I started grinding myself against him, his dick very near my entrance. </p>
<p>I moaned in annoyance when he held my hips to stop the grinding. "If you keep doing this I am going to have sex with you," he stated. I nodded in response. Even though we hadn't gone there yet, I knew he was the one I wanted to lose my virginity to. I also knew I wasn't going to be his first. His first was some girl he met in France that summer he had been there with his dad, knowing this actually made me more comfortable with the idea. "Are you sure?" he asked, still holding me hovering above him.</p>
<p>"Yes," I sighed, leaning over to kiss his face.</p>
<p>He flipped us over and lowered himself onto me. He guided himself to my entrance, all while whispering in my ear how much he loved me. I gasped when he entered me, "You okay?" He asked. After analyzing how he felt inside of me, relaxing my muscles, I nodded. After the initial shock it actually felt good. The sensations spread throughout my body as he slowly moved in and out. It felt good, even if it was a little sore at first. It was getting better as he continued moving his hips and grinding himself against me as he moved up and down. Then, he started using his hand to accompany his motions, and oh my Merlin it was amazing. </p>
<p>I moaned as he started moving everything faster. "Scor, kiss me please," I moaned into his neck as the tingling sensations took my breath away as my bundle of nerves started building. He kissed me hard as he kept moving his hands and hips faster, and then slower, harder and then more gently.</p>
<p>"Rose," he groaned, "I’m so close..." I didn’t respond but kept kissing him. I was enjoying this closeness, I felt like we were one being. Then he stopped moving after one more thrust, but continued working my clit with his hand. The wave of pleasure of my second orgasm of the night shuddered through me, taking away all my senses for a brief second. He removed himself from me and held me close, and it was perfection.</p>
