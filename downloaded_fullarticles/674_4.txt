    <p>The Fidelius is such a useful defensive measure that there must be a reason it isn't more common. Why wouldn't all the horcruxes be hidden under them? Why wouldn't all the Order safehouses be under them? Here are some rules that I think make sense.</p>
<p> </p><ol>
<li>The Fidelius hides the Secret inside the Soul of a Secret Keeper. One Soul can hold one Secret. If Dumbledore is holding the Secret for Grimmauld Place, he cannot be Secret Keeper for any other place.</li>
<li>This is Soul Magic. Though it's called the Fidelius "Charm", it can only be done by someone who has studied magics that are not legal in Wix Britain. It's not illegal to cast the Fidelius (because the Wizengamot doesn't understand it enough to have specifically disallowed it, and because the name 'Charm' is misleading), but to learn enough magic to be able to do so, you'll need to study from books that have been illegal in Wix Britain for a long time. People who can cast it include Dumbledore (the books weren't illegal when he first read them), Bill Weasley (he studied them outside Wix Britain), Voldemort (he doesn't give a shit about the law). Basically you need to be old, dark, or well travelled.</li>
<li>Because it is Soul Magic, you can't hold a Secret if you have a damaged soul. Death Eaters, who have a brand on their soul, need not apply. Harry can't be a Secret Keeper until the horcrux is removed. Voldemort can't be a Secret Keeper unless he somehow manages to fully repair his to his pre-horcrux state. (In my head-canon, Peter was an un-marked Death Eater until after Voldemort got his first homonculus body. He would have been a poor spy if his friends would have noticed him suddenly refusing to roll up his sleeves in hot weather. But once he was Voldemort's ONLY follower, he wanted him branded and marked.)</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>(Also, a mistake in canon: Shell Cottage was under Fidelius with Bill as the Secret Keeper - but Ron tells Dobby where it is, so he can take the prisoners there at the rescue from Malfoy Manor. Ron shouldn't have been able to speak about it, since he wasn't the Secret Keeper!)</p>
