<p>Hermione Granger, orphan daughter of Healers from a small village outside of Redenham, sat quietly with her hands manacled in her lap. Her parents had died the month before whilst trying to stop the plague that was ravaging their small town. When they became ill, she was sent away to the local church. There she was subjected to the cruelest of tortures imaginable. Father Declan left her for days without food or water, tied to a crucifix as he attempted to perform multiple exorcisms.</p>
<p>Her parents never thought she was possessed, just special. See, when Hermione was asleep she would sleepwalk. Sometimes, she would move things with her mind and other times she would cure the sick or heal the elderly. Her parents thought she was a gift from God; Father Declan believed she was a curse.</p>
<p>The townspeople were dying and scared. When Father Declan declared her death to be their salvation, they bought into the lies. Hermione was loaded onto a cart, with two knights on horseback on either side of her, to be sent to the Church in Salisbury south of Wiltshire. Father Declan believed that they would be able to ‘sort her out,’ there. Hermione knew better, she was on her way to her death.</p>
<p>Was it so bad though?</p>
<p>She would be with her parents and her grandparents soon. She would see sweet Dudley Dursley, who was one of the first casualties of the plague. He was also Hermione’s betrothed and first and only kiss. Sure, it was chaste and on the forehead, but she cherished the moment, even more so after he passed.</p>
<p>A jarring thump in the road broke her from her thoughts of the sweet soft-spoken blonde boy with blue eyes so light, she often thought of sea glass. They weren't moving and there were shouts at the front of the wagon. The Finch-Fletchley’s wheat wagon was repurposed as her temporary traveling cell as the entire family had died and there were no relatives to inherit their belongings.</p>
<p>The Church <em> humbly </em>accepted their lands and gold in payment for praying for their departed souls. Hermione and her parents were disgusted that the money had not gone to feed the orphaned children in their village. Her parents had voiced their opinions at a town meeting and were called heretics and non-believers. They fell ill several days later.</p>
<p>The Knights continued to yell at each other while Hermione stretched her throbbing back. They had been traveling since early morning and she ached to run and stretch her limbs. She could if she wanted to, she could outrun the two overweight knights that were appointed the task of delivering her to the church. She may be able to outrun <em> them, </em>but she couldn’t outrun their arrows.</p>
<p>“Whore! Get up and fix the wheel!” Clayton, the larger of the two shouted as he doubled back to the rear of the wagon on his horse.</p>
<p>Hermione sat with her back straight, “Begging your pardon?”</p>
<p>Jasper, the second in the idiotic pairing crossed himself whilst mumbling to Clayton. “I told you shouldn’t have spoken to the witch. She’s cursed us. She’s cursed us.”</p>
<p>Had Hermione not been ingrained from a young age to never roll her eyes, she would have. “I haven’t cursed you, Sir Jasper.”</p>
<p>The tall and rotundus man squeaked and promptly fell off of his horse. Hermione resisted the urge to giggle. Clayton didn’t share his kinsmen’s fear. He turned to Hermione and thundered, “Fix the wheel, you urchin!”</p>
<p>“I haven’t the faintest idea how to fix a wheel. I’m a woman.”</p>
<p>“You’re a peasant is what you are and you know what happens to peasants when they don’t follow orders?” he leered at Hermione, her entire body erupting into goosebumps. She knew exactly what happened to peasants.</p>
<p>Her parents had worked their entire lives so Hermione would never be in the position she was in now. A peasant at the mercy of richer men above her. Even a penniless knight of the Church was infinitely higher than her. While she was in the Church’s prison in her village, she was given gruel to eat once a day. Sister Riley had already warned her what a peasant had to do in order to eat, in order to survive.</p>
<p>Now more than ever, Hermione wished she had been born a man. She would never have been in this position, had she had been a man. A woman could not inherit anything after their patriarch's passing.</p>
<p>While Hermione was sitting in her cell, she wished she had never been born at all. It was as if fate or God was playing some cruel joke on her. As if she was being punished for something she had done, except Hermione knew she had never done anything that was not done in the Lord’s light.</p>
<p>Noticing that Clayton was still leering at her, she pulled her ratty shawl closer to her chest. Her clothes had been taken from her after the Church seized her home. She had been given a plain grey dress that was so worn out, there were holes along the seams at about the hem. She was given a black shawl to go over her shoulders by Sister Riley.</p>
<p>Sister Riley claimed that if men thought her to be in mourning, they would leave her alone and it would protect her virtue. Based on the look in Clayton’s eyes, Hermione didn’t think her virtue would remain intact for very long. Clayton was a man who preyed on the weak and despite her bone shattering fear, she refused to show the man how terrified she really was.</p>
<p>Jasper, who was still praying whilst clutching a wooden cross, was completely oblivious to what was going on. He had yet to re-mount his horse and was sloshing about in the mud. Hermione’s wagon was unmoving as the wheel was in fact stuck in a ditch. Hermione was about to point it out when Clayton began to dismount his horse.</p>
<p>“Jasper! Tie up the horses and fetch them water, we are camping here for the night.”</p>
<p>“Sir, Father Declan said we should not stop. The Lord –”</p>
<p>“Who was put in charge, me or you?”</p>
<p>“You, sir.”</p>
<p>“Get water and feed the horses.”</p>
<p>Jasper tied up the horses to a nearby tree. When he was done, he announced his departure to find water, leaving Hermione alone with Clayton. Thankfully, he mostly ignored her as he removed his bastinet from his head, leaving his body armor on. Setting the shining silver headpiece down, he began to set up the campfire for the night.</p>
<p>Darkness was falling quickly and Hermione shivered despite her resolute decision not to show Clayton any weakness. She could hear Jasper stumbling around in the woods whispering words of prayer to mask his fear. Clayton chuckled when Jasper yelped after stumbling into, what sounded like, a tree. Wiping black hair as dark as pitch from his grey soulless eyes, he scratched two rocks together until they caught fire on the driftwood.</p>
<p>“You planning on staying on that wagon all night, whore?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Hermione replied stiffly. If she made it to the Church without Clayton touching her she would be alright. She could die a virgin and the lord would grant her into heaven. She would see her parents.</p>
<p>The humorless chuckle from the knight spoke volumes. “Do you really think a bit of wood is going to protect you?”</p>
<p>“It’s against the law,” Hermione stammered. Where was Jasper? He was a good Christian. He would never allow something as horrible as… as… he would never allow anything to happen. Her eyes were wide as she searched frantically for Jasper.</p>
<p>“Looking for the useless idiot? The river is an hour walk behind us. Jasper may be a good Christian, but he’s terrified of witches and demons and he’s convinced you’re one. He’s more likely to burn you alive than save you from the likes of me.”</p>
<p>“The likes of you?” Hermione whispered.</p>
<p>Clayton’s grey eyes lit up, bright in the night. “Knights who take <em> pleasure </em> in war. Jasper fights to protect his family. I fight because I love to <em> kill. </em> I <em> cherish </em> the feeling of running through bone and marrow with my sword and watching the life leave my enemies eyes. You think Father Declan knows <em>power</em>? He knows nothing. I am a harbinger of death. I am power.”</p>
<p>Hermione met his eyes, bright with arousal. “You’re going to burn in hell.”</p>
<p>He lifted one armored hand and for a moment Hermione feared he would hit her. Instead, he clapped his hands together and laughed riotously. “There’s no such thing as heaven or hell, peasant. Only the dead and the living and those who are foolish enough to buy into the church’s shite.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s head shot upward immediately as if waiting for lightning to strike. Surely, the lord in heaven would never allow a non-believer to besmirch his name? Hermione sat in bewilderment after nothing happened for several moments. A cold, rotting breeze was ghosting uncomfortably across her right cheek.</p>
<p>“Waiting for your lord to save you?” Clayton whispered in her ear. Hermione stumbled backward deeper into the wagon as Clayton towered over her. “There is no one to save you. You’re a whore and whores have only one use.”</p>
<p>Hermione scrambled backward, her bound hands in front of her defensively, until she reached the front of the wagon. She was trapped. He stepped fully onto the wagon, jerking the flimsy thing as he advanced towards her.</p>
<p>Hermione’s body shook with fear. If she ran, he would kill her, or worse capture her and claim she tried to escape after punishing her and then killing her so she couldn’t refute his claim. Even if she did tell people he lied, who would believe her? She was a woman. She was nothing, a nobody.</p>
<p>He unbuckled his belt and dropped it over the side of the wagon. Hermione dug her nails into the iron on the manacles. <em> If she ran, she was dead. If she ran, she was dead. If she ran, she was dead. </em></p>
<p>When he closed the last step to hover right above her, she screamed. She screamed until his meaty fingers closed around her throat and she choked. She heard several shouts coming from deep in the forest, but she knew it was no use. They were too far and they’d never get to her in time.</p>
<p>
  <em> Daddy! </em>
</p>
<p>Clayton was tearing viscously at her dress. The seams tore with a loud rip that echoed into the dark cold night. The tearing of her clothes and his hands that followed broke her and took whatever dignity she had been holding onto with it. She begged, pleaded, and sobbed as the monster hovered over her laughing.</p>
<p>She swung her manacled wrists at him but he caught them easily and pinned her arms above her head. Her dress was torn open and her chest was exposed. Tears, stung her eyes as she struggled underneath his weight.</p>
<p>“Where’s your precious Lord now?” he sneered as pushed himself onto her.</p>
<p>“Please,” she whimpered. “Don’t do this.”</p>
<p>With his free hand, he slapped her across the face. A bright light burned her eyes and she closed her eyelids tightly. As soon as her eyes closed she felt the weight of Clayton lessen.</p>
<p>Her ears rung and her head felt as if it was going to set on fire. Her ears made loud popping noises that only worsened her headache. She struggled to open her eyes, as she felt darkness overtake her.</p>
