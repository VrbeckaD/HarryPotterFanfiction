    <p>Sirius is running on two hours of sleep within the last 48 hours, seven cups of coffee - <em>or was it eight? -</em> and too much Panic! At The Disco when he meets the love of his life.</p><p>Now, mind you, he’s only 19, and he doesn’t even know the guy, but he already <em>knows</em> they’re bound to fall in love, get married, buy a house with a picket fence and have three children. And a dog. A big dog.</p><p>Anyway. The point is - <em>love of his life</em>. Right there in this small, suburban cafe.</p><p>“Reggie, I’m in love,” he says instantly, not taking his eyes off of this angel of a man. He’s got the smile of an angel, anyway. And hair, too - angels have curls, that’s just scientific.</p><p>“The fuck are you on about?” his brother replies, with too much snarky confidence for a 14 year old. He’s been spending too much time with Lily, Sirius reckons. Bad influence and whatnot, that girl.</p><p>“That guy in the corner,” Sirius still hasn’t taken his eyes off him, by the way. “The curly haired one, with the laptop. And don’t swear.”</p><p>“Who’s he? Like a boyfriend or something? I’m leaving if you dragged me here just to make out with your stupid boyfriend, you were supposed to help me study!”</p><p>“What? No, he’s not my boyfriend, I’ve literally never seen him before.”</p><p>Regulus blinks. “And yet you say you’re in love?”</p><p>“Yes, I’m quite positive I am. Don’t you think our kids would look beautiful?”</p><p>“You’re insane.”</p><p>“You think they’ll have curls? I hope they will. Or the freckles.”</p><p>Regulus sighs and runs his hand through his hair - now that’s a habit he’s picked from James. Sirius really needs to find more respectable friends to hang with when he’s minding his little brother. Not like Regulus really needs minding to anymore, but still, Sirius is responsible for him, so he guesses he should find some positive influences.</p><p>Love Of His Life seems like a good sort, which is fantastic. Sirius can bet he studies something smart like literature. Or maybe physics.</p><p>“Listen,” Reg says, punching him in the arm. “You’re a fucking mess but-”</p><p>“Don’t swear,” Sirius says, absentmindedly - he’s really wondering what Love Of His Life’s taste in music is. He seems like an Ed Sheeran type, and Sirius definitely doesn’t mind that. He could learn some Ed Sheeran songs on his guitar - that’s quite romantic, isn’t it?</p><p>“- go ask him out or whatever. I’ll get us something, and then you’re helping me.”</p><p>With that, and an eye roll - honestly, <em>way</em> too much time with Lily - he leaves Sirius to his own.</p><p>Usually, Sirius wouldn’t just saunter towards a guy <em>that</em> fucking cute, oh no, he’d need some sort of back up or pep talk, from James, preferably. But today, he’s a mess, and lack of sleep makes him incredibly reckless and equally detached from reality, so indeed, he walks towards the table.</p><p>Love Of His Life looks up at him when he sits down on the other side, confusion spread on his face.</p><p>“Hi,” Sirius says, smiling. He hopes he doesn’t look as messy as he feels - his hair might be a bit wild, but he’s been told that looks hot, so he figures it’s fine.</p><p>“Hi?” Love Of His Life replies.</p><p>“So I noticed you sitting here, and I thought I’d say hi. Which I already did. But still. Hello.”</p><p>He raises a brow at Sirius. So Sirius, as he tends to do when both sleep deprived and thoroughly caffeinated, just keeps on talking.</p><p>“I’m here with my brother - helping him with homework, like a responsible older sibling and all that jazz. What are you working on? I bet it’s something smart - you look smart, at least. It’s the jumper, y’know? You wouldn’t mind if we sat with you, maybe? I just thought - you’re sitting alone, I wouldn’t mind the company, for sure, and you seem smart and nice so who knows, maybe Regulus will learn something - I’m the one that’s supposed to be teaching him but I know fuckall about history, honestly - I’m doing art, actually. Are you a history guy? You seem like a history guy?”</p><p>“I’m so sorry for him,” Regulus says, sitting down next to Sirius - and kicking him, definitely on purpose. He sets down a cup of coffee for Sirius, and a hot chocolate for himself.</p><p>“Is he high?” Love Of His Life asks. Sirius giggles to himself.</p><p>“He’s sleep deprived and had too much coffee. And also he’s gay.”</p><p>Love Of His Life blinks at that. “And that’s relevant how…?”</p><p>“Well, he gets like that around guys he likes. Idiotic, I mean.”</p><p>“Oh,” Love Of His Life seems startled, but Sirius can see a blush on his face, and he’s suddenly not mad at Regulus being here anymore.</p><p>“Are you single?” Sirius asks, because again - too much caffeine. Whatever filter he has is long gone.</p><p>“I really am sorry, he’s a fucking twat when he doesn’t sleep.”</p><p>“Swearing, Reggie.”</p><p>“You swear all the time!”</p><p>“I’m the big brother, I can.”</p><p>“And yet I have to do this shit for you,” Regulus says with a huff. “Listen. He likes you, and I promise, he’s actually surprisingly tolerable when he’s had enough sleep and no one lets him touch caffeine. So if you’d humour him and give him your number, or whatever, we’d get out of your hair now.”</p><p>Love Of His Life blinks in confusion again. “I don’t think it’s a good idea.”</p><p>Sirius cocks his head in what he hopes the guy considers cute. “Don’t be like that. If you’re not gay, I get it. But if you are - even a little bit, what’s there to dislike about me, huh? I’m obviously the best looking guy you’ll ever find.”</p><p>“And bloody humble too,” Regulus mumbles to himself - Sirius kicks him.</p><p>Love Of His Life - Sirius should find a shorter nickname, or ask for his name - laughs at that.</p><p>“I don’t really care much for appearance.”</p><p>“Oh, everybody says that but deep down I’m sure you wouldn’t hate dating someone with a face like mine.”</p><p>“I’m blind.”</p><p><em>Oh</em>.</p><p>“Shit,” Regulus says - Sirius kicks him again, more out of habit than anything - “sorry, I-”</p><p>“I get it, hard to notice. I don’t mind,” he smiles that cute, soft smile again - Sirius remembers why he fell in love all that 15 minutes ago. “Are you still so set on dating me?”</p><p>“Yes,” Sirius says without a further thought. “I don’t care. I’m in love with you.”</p><p>Angel - shorter, but still not ideal - laughs again. “Leave that for when we know each other a bit more and maybe you’ve had more sleep.”</p><p>“Get used to this,” Regulus sighs. “Clinical insomnia, and all. Happens rather often.”</p><p>“I’ll keep that in mind,” he says softly. “So, Regulus, you said?”</p><p>“And my idiot brother is Sirius.”</p><p>“Parents were really into stars, huh?”</p><p>“You could say that,” Regulus mumbles half-heartedly.</p><p>Their family is still something they rarely talk about. Ever since they left home - the moment Sirius turned 18, he packed their most important belongings and dragged Regulus out of that hellhole - it was something they just didn’t speak of. It’s a bit less touchy, now, but they mutually agree it’s best left alone, to discuss at a later date, maybe when Reggie is a bit older.</p><p>“Mine were into mythology. It’s Remus.”</p><p>Sirius smiles brightly, and Regulus groans.</p><p>“Stop being so gay,” Reg hisses.</p><p>Remus laughs. “You said you’re learning history, right?”</p><p>“Yup. French revolution at the moment.”</p><p>“Just so happens I’m majoring in history. How about Sirius gets me a hot chocolate, and I’ll help you out?”</p><p>Sirius blinks. So does Regulus.</p><p>“Will you go on a date with me, then?”</p><p>Remus shuts his laptop and scoots a bit closer to them.</p><p>“Let’s start with my number first. Ask me again when you’re functioning like a normal human.”</p><p>*</p><p>The time in the cafe flies by like nothing.</p><p>Remus has a lovely voice, Sirius comes to realize. Even when he’s talking through decapitating French monarchy, he makes it sound soothing in a way. Sirius almost thinks he could fall asleep while listening to it, and that’s a gigantic compliment.</p><p>He’s also unlike any teacher Sirius has ever had. He’s patient in explaining everything to Regulus - he pauses to let the kid take notes (either when Reggie tells him to, or Remus himself can hear the pen scribbling away on a notepad), goes into further detail or repeats things when he’s asked, hell, even the gentle expression on his face is unlike Sirius’s memory of school. It was always harsh, private tutors, and he either got things right or got smacked with a wooden ruler.</p><p>Probably shouldn’t point that out, though. The depths of his childhood drama aren’t exactly something he wants to share just yet.</p><p>Mostly cause he <em>really </em>wants Remus not to run away. Skipping the fact he’s incredibly gorgeous and Sirius is positive he’s in love (Remus is going through the exact timeline of the revolution, date by date, when Sirius names all their future children in his head), he seems like a cool guy all around, and someone that can actually properly help Reggie out in school - Remus has done a better job during the last two hours than Sirius has for the entire year.</p><p>And, Remus is still here, even after the first hand experience of Sirius, caffeinated and sleep deprived. Not many people can handle that - which means maybe, just maybe, the whole insomnia thing won’t turn into a big deal. Sirius does acknowledge it, but he doesn’t like to think of it as much - he can’t fall asleep like a normal person sometimes (‘sometimes’ being usually four days a week), so what about that? James and Lily make it seem like it’s going to kill him, but it’s not like it’s a drug addiction or anything. He’s just a little manic sometimes, and depressed other times. And then unable to concentrate and constantly exhausted most of the time.</p><p>Point is, he can deal with it, therefore it’s not a big deal. So Remus shouldn’t be coaxed into thinking that it’s a big deal, because Sirius likes him the way he is now - not making a big deal out of Sirius being, well… Sirius.</p><p>“Hey, asshole!”</p><p>Then there’s the fact that lack of sleep makes him a bit detached from reality, so he hadn’t realized Regulus was trying to get his attention until just now, when he jabbed him with his elbow. That’s just something Remus has to get used to.</p><p>“What? Are you guys done?” he says, blinking to try and get some sense of his surroundings.</p><p>Regulus sighs in a way so dramatic it can only be achieved by a 14 year old boy.</p><p>“You’re crashing,” he says. “Which means we should leave.”</p><p>Sirius makes an offended sound. It’s as if Regulus thinks he’s the older one!</p><p>“I’m not,” Sirius says. “I’m just… thinking. About things. Important things, I’ll have you know.”</p><p>“You’re <em>spacing out, </em>is what you are. Which means you’re finally gonna go to bed, I fucking hope.”</p><p>“Don’t swear. And I just had coffee!”</p><p>“I got you decaf.”</p><p>Sirius blinks. “And <em>why</em> would you do that?!” Sirius says, offended, because honestly, there’s no greater offence than decaf coffee. The caffeine is the whole bloody point!</p><p>Sirius’s brain functions are lowered due to lack of sleep, so he doesn’t even register that somehow he didn’t notice it was decaf while drinking (if he did realize that, he would be greatly offended with himself - 4 years of being addicted to caffeine and what did that give him? Not being able to taste <em>decaf?).</em></p><p>“Maybe,” this time Remus speaks, seemingly highly amused by the ongoing conversation. “he’s, uh, <em>concerned </em>about your sleeping habits and wants you to go to bed?”</p><p>“I’m an adult, I go to bed when I want to!”</p><p>“The last time you slept was when James drove us to Ikea, and that was yesterday evening. For like 30 minutes.”</p><p>“How do you know I didn’t sleep at night, huh?”</p><p>“I could bloody hear you pacing around in the kitchen, and you were there when I woke up too. We’re going home before you fucking pass out.”</p><p>“Don’t swear. And I’m fine, honestly.”</p><p>He yawns, then, so his body doesn’t seem to think so. Regulus rolls his eyes, and Remus giggles.</p><p>“I think it’s best you go.” Remus then pulls his phone out and hands it to Sirius. “Put your number in, so I can make sure you did as you’re told and slept for at least a few hours.”</p><p>Sirius beams at that, grabbing the phone with probably too much enthusiasm. He makes sure he’s put his number in correctly three times (and sends himself a text just in case) before he carefully places it back in Remus’s hand. With that, their hands touch, and Sirius feels a shiver go up his spine - Remus’s hands are smooth and so <em>warm.</em></p><p>Sirius definitely wouldn’t mind them in his own hands. Or on his body. <em>Or around his-</em></p><p>Okay, yeah, definitely time to go home before he gets too carried away in any fantasies, next to his little brother as well.</p><p>“Oh, uh,” Sirius finds himself saying when he gets up. “D’you… need help getting home? Or something?”</p><p>Remus smiles at him. “I came here by myself, you do realize that?”</p><p>Sirius feels his face flush. “Yeah, I mean! I don’t want to sound rude or stupid but I thought I’d just ask, I dunno, I’ve never known a blind person before so I kinda have no idea what’s the socially acceptable thing to say but it seemed rude to just leave you. Even though I know you’re an adult that can mind himself and I’m sure you’re capable of traveling by yourself I didn’t want to imply you don’t-”</p><p>“Stop. Talking,” Regulus hisses, pulling Sirius out of the booth. “You’re being an idiot again.”</p><p>“Ah, no, I don’t mind, honestly. Takes time getting used to it, I know. I’ll be fine, though, I promise.”</p><p>“Next time,” Sirius says. “I’ll get you a ride home on my bike.”</p><p>“Bike? Like a motorbike?”</p><p>Sirius beams proudly. “Yup! She’s my baby - built her myself.”</p><p>Remus’s brow furrow. “Please don’t tell me you drove here with your younger brother while you’ve slept for a total of half hour since yesterday.”</p><p>“Oh, please, who do you think I am?” Regulus asks. “I’d never let him drive the bloody thing when he’s <em>like that. </em>We walked, we don’t live far.”</p><p>“Good. Let me know when you get home, then,” Remus smiles the gentle smile again, and despite the caffeine crash and his body screaming at him from fatigue, Sirius feels he could run laps around the building right now cause of the happy, bubbly feeling in his stomach.</p><p>“You too. I’ll see you around, Remus.”</p><p>Sirius and Regulus walk home in silence - mainly because, as much as he hates to admit Regulus was right - Sirius really <em>is </em>crashing. The manic energy he usually has whenever he surpases 30 hours of no sleep is through and gone, so now he’s nothing left but the overpowering fatigue.</p><p>His whole body feels heavy; Sirius is glad Regulus is there, supporting him while he walks, cause he finds it hard to concentrate on going straight - his eyelids are closing by themselves, and there’s a dull ache starting to build in his head and nausea creeping in.</p><p>At least he knows he’ll sleep. Not for much, but maybe he’ll get a few hours, at least.</p><p>He doesn’t register them walking up the stairs, or Reggie opening the door to their apartment - it’s small and cramped, with two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a lounge-slash-kitchen; the sink breaks way too often, the walls are paper-thin, and the shower is not meant for Sirius’s height so he bumps his head into the showerhead every night without fail. It doesn’t compare to Grimmauld in the slightest, but it’s theirs, away from their parents, so neither of them ever really complain.</p><p>Sirius wiggles out of his shoes - he curses the fact his motorbike boots are almost knee high and have seven or so straps; they’re a pain to take off, but damn him if they don’t look good. He then throws his jacket onto the couch, and heads towards his bedroom.</p><p>“Will you be okay for dinner?” he finds himself asking - he’s not sure if he’ll be awake til later at night, and the fridge is probably empty (he notes in his head that he needs to go grocery shopping first thing tomorrow before work). He might be dead on his feet, but he’d hate himself if he didn’t make sure his brother is okay.</p><p>“Yeah, I’ll call Lily and ask her if she’ll pick something up for us,” Regulus says, waving Sirius off. “Just- go to bed, kay?”</p><p>Sirius feels a strange sting at that - Regulus shouldn’t have to rely on <em>Lily. </em>Sirius should be the one sorting out the food, and his homework, and making sure all is right with his brother. But his stupid fucking sleep deprivation makes it so he can’t, so James and Lily have to check in with Reggie, and then Regulus has to worry for Sirius, when he shouldn’t have to.</p><p>Sirius is the older brother, the one that should do the worrying. The one that should be responsible. How is he better than their bloody parents if he can’t even take care of Reggie?</p><p>“Mhm,” he settles for, because he feels his throat squeeze uncomfortably, in a way too familiar manner.</p><p>Sirius takes one last look at his brother - who’s unpacking his schoolbooks onto the kitchen table (his favourite place to study, cause he’s in close proximity to the kettle) and with that, he sleepily stumbles towards his own bedroom.</p><p>He only bothers to take off his jeans and socks, and then he crawls under the duvet and collapses onto the bed.</p><p>Sirius somehow remembers to text Remus - it lifts his mood a little, to remember that, despite the probably uncomfortable amounts of pestering, Remus still wanted Sirius to text him; there’s hopes for an actual friendship there, Sirius thinks. Remus doesn’t reply immediately, so Sirius plugs in his phone to charge and leaves it on the nightstand - he’s too tired to wait up for a text back.</p><p>He’s exhausted enough to know he <em>will </em>sleep, so thank God for that. And maybe, if he’s lucky, he’ll dream of something nice.</p><p>Or, if he’s extra lucky, someone nice.</p>
