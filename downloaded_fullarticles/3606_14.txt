    <p align="left">Sirius threw his book across the room, startling Remus from his studying, almost spilling his ink pot across his bed. Sirius stretched across his bed, and wiggled his eyebrows suggestively. Remus finished writing his sentence on the effects of the <em>Protego Duo </em>charm, pretending he didn’t hear Sirius’s frustrated sigh.</p><p align="left">“Moony, we’re alone,” Sirius said when Remus didn’t leave his bed like he wanted.</p><p align="left">He thought he couldn’t be any more obvious about his desires – Remus should get up off his bed, join Sirius on his, and make the most of their very infrequent alone time. For once, the dorm was empty, James and Peter were preoccupied somewhere and they weren’t going to return for a while.</p><p align="left">Unfortunately, Remus kept writing, his quill scratching across his parchment. He was sat cross-legged on his bed, his homework rolled out across the sheets. His collar was crisp and his shirt was neat, Sirius wanted to ruffle him up, wrinkle his shirt and mess up his combed hair.</p><p align="left">“Moony,” Sirius said.</p><p align="left">“Yes, Padfoot?” Remus asked. He was clearly pretending not to be interested, but Sirius could see the tiny upturn of his mouth.</p><p align="left">“If you don’t come over here right now, I will be forced to entertain myself,” Sirius said.</p><p align="left">“Feel free,” Remus said, glancing up briefly before continuing his writing.</p><p align="left">“I will watch you the whole time, you won’t be able to concentrate,” Sirius warned, “And you know I can be <em>very, very </em>loud.”</p><p align="left">Remus made a big show of sighing and rolling up his parchment. Sirius was sure he took almost fifteen minutes to pack away his ink pot and quill. By the time Remus walked to Sirius’s bed, Sirius had grown too impatient to wait. He grabbed Remus’s wrist and yanked him onto the bed, eliciting a gasp from his boyfriend.</p><p align="left">“Very impatient,” Remus laughed.</p><p align="left">Sirius kissed Remus, pushing him down onto his bed. Remus smiled against his mouth, running his fingers through Sirius’s hair. Remus tasted like the pumpkin juice he’d just drank. He pulled away from Sirius enough to loosen his tie and drop it on the floor. Sirius used ink-stained fingers to unbutton his shirt, revealing a tantalising sliver of skin.</p><p align="left">They’d been dating for almost two months now, and they’d barely had any time alone. James was always there, and if it wasn’t James it was Peter, and if it wasn’t Peter it was Lily, or a Professor, or detention keeping them apart.</p><p align="left">It was like everyone in Hogwarts was running interference, but that couldn’t be possible because no one knew about their relationship. They were keeping it a secret because it was simpler, easier, and a lot naughtier. Sirius could imagine the look on James’s face when he found out.</p><p align="left">He stopped thinking of James when Remus kissed his way down his jaw. His mouth left a trail of fire down his neck. Sirius ran his hand down Remus’s chest, over his waist, onto his hips. His fingers ran along the waistband of his trousers, making Remus sigh against his neck, his hot breath ghosting against his skin.</p><p align="left">Remus sank further down on the bed, pushing his leg between Sirius’s. His thigh brushed Sirius in just the right way, making him gasp. Remus caught his mouth in a deep kiss, tasting his tongue. Sirius moved over Remus, pressing him further into the bed, wanting to be closer, wanting to shed the clothes that still kept them apart.</p><p align="left">Sirius felt Remus’s stubble rough his jaw, and he kissed his way down his neck. He licked the length of his collar bone, his fingers finding the scars that criss-crossed his back. Remus’s breathing sped up, his heart hammering in his chest, as Sirius kissed a trail from his collarbones to his hip bones. He grazed his teeth across them, his fingers unpopped the top button of Remus’s trousers.</p><p align="left">“Wormtail, no,” James’s voice got louder as he climbed the stairs.</p><p align="left">“No, piss off,” Sirius whispered against Remus’s hips.</p><p align="left">“Padfoot,” Remus said.</p><p align="left">“No,” Sirius said, emphatically.</p><p align="left">James’s voice was louder, he was almost at the door, “For the last time, no, Wormtail!”</p><p align="left">“<em>Come on</em>, you lend it to Padfoot all the time,” Peter’s voice followed, quieter.</p><p align="left">“What are you yelling about?” Lily asked, her voice quieter as she probably stood at the bottom of the dorm stairs.</p><p align="left">Remus pushed on Sirius’s head, pushing him away. He sat up and fastened his trousers. His fingers quickly buttoned his shirt back up. They had however long it took for James to annoy Lily, and then come into the dorm after she’d rejected him. Sirius thought that was plenty of time. Surely enough to keep kissing, and to hear Remus moan his name once. Just once, that’s all he wanted.</p><p align="left">“Moony, no,” Sirius whined, watching all his hard work become undone.</p><p align="left">Remus kissed Sirius softly, apologetically. He wasn’t enjoying this forced separation either, especially when Sirius’s mouth had been so close to unravelling him. He tightened Sirius’s tie as they kissed. Remus yanked away from Sirius when the door slammed open.</p><p align="left">“If you ask me again, I’ll murder you,” James said. He almost tripped over Sirius’s charms book. He bent down to scoop it off the floor and shot Sirius an amused look, “Flitwick piss you off, Padfoot?”</p><p align="left">“Someone did,” Sirius pouted.</p><p align="left">Remus, fully dressed except for his tie, nudged him with his foot. He got up off the bed, and unrolled his parchment again. He dipped his quill into his ink pot. James kicked off his shoes, and sat on his bed. Peter stayed in the doorway, staring at James with wide eyes.</p><p align="left">“What do you want, Wormtail?” Remus asked, continuing his homework as though nothing had happened. That wasn’t true, of course, he could still feel Sirius’s hands on his skin and his mouth on his hip.</p><p align="left">“I want Prongs to lend me his cloak,” Peter said.</p><p align="left">“Why won’t you? You lend it to me all the time,” Sirius said, using his wand to call his charms book back towards him. He opened it to a random page but didn’t bother to read it.</p><p align="left">“Yes, but I lend it to you for mischief, Peter wants to use it for...” James shuddered, “I can’t even tell you what.”</p><p align="left">“Wormtail,” Sirius sang, sounding proud, “Things with Hannah are going well then?”</p><p align="left">“Very well,” Peter said, blushing right up to his ears. He turned to plead with James, “And I just need the cloak for an hour. Two, at most!”</p><p align="left">Sirius scoffed, “Yeah, right.”</p><p align="left">Remus threw a ball of parchment at Sirius to shut him up and it hit him on the nose. Sirius stuck up his middle finger in response.</p><p align="left">“I’ll clean it after,” Peter begged.</p><p align="left">“EW!” James covered his ears with his hands, “Ew, Merlin, no! Never say that again!”</p><p align="left">“How would you clean it?” Remus asked, clearly amused.</p><p align="left">“<em>Scourgify?</em>” Peter asked.</p><p align="left">“Wormtail, for the final time, in front of two witnesses, I will not lend you my cloak so you can have sex with Hannah. If I’m not having sex, you certainly can’t,” James said. He pointed his wand at Sirius as soon as a smile crept onto his face, “If you laugh Padfoot, you’ll be banned from the cloak too.”</p><p align="left">Sirius held his hands up in surrender, “No judgement. I’m not having sex either.”</p><p align="left">“Though not from a lack of trying,” Remus teased.</p><p align="left">“Shut up, Moony,” Sirius said, glaring at him.</p><p align="left">Remus stuck his tongue out at Sirius, and rolled up his finished homework. He packed up his ink pot and quill, and Sirius noticed he was much faster now he wasn’t teasing him. He stood up, grabbed his discarded tie from the floor, and headed for the door, side-stepping Peter who was still staring pleadingly at James.</p><p align="left">“Moony, where do you think you’re going?” Sirius demanded. Under James and Peter’s eye, he couldn’t say what he wanted to say but he was sure his arched eyebrow articulated it very well.</p><p align="left">Remus shrugged slightly. They weren’t going to get their chance now. James had unrolled his very late Defence Against the Dark Arts homework, and Peter was one step away from getting down on his knees to beg James. It was over, their moment was gone.</p><p align="left">“Somewhere where I don’t have to hear about your sex lives,” Remus opened the dorm door, he glanced back at them all, “Or lack thereof.”</p><p align="left">“Yeah, like <em>you’re </em>any better off,” James muttered.</p><p>Remus stuck his middle finger up and backed out of the room. Sirius closed his book when the door closed and flopped backwards on his bed. He stared at the ceiling with frustration, they’d lost their chance. They wouldn’t be alone now for at least another month, that was just their luck.</p>
