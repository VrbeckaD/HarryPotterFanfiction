<p>As the plane lands in Mystic Falls I feel a barrage of emotions crash into me. There was excitement and anticipation as I will be seeing my siblings after a long time. Even though we’ve kept in contact through letters and cell phone whenever possible, it’s not the same. Sadness as I won’t ever be seeing my parents again. It was a blow to hear that they died on the same day that I survived the killing curse again.</p>

<p>
  <em>Flashback</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I took a deep breath as I switched on my phone to see 98 missed calls from Elena, 70 missed calls from Jeremy and 41 missed calls from Aunt Jenna. I furrowed my eyebrows in confusion when I saw that there were none from my adopted parents Miranda and Grayson Gilbert. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Two months have passed since the Battle of Hogwarts as people have been calling it and it has been a blur of funerals, tears and alcohol. I have been cooped up in Grimmauld Place and today is the first time that I cleaned myself up. I knew that I owed it to my family at least to contact them and let them know that the war was finally over. I then called Elena.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Hello? Lea? Finally! Do you know how long we have been trying to reach you?” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Hey Lena. I swear I’ll explain everything to you. Can you put everyone on the speaker phone?” </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I tried to keep no secrets from my family. It was hard enough belonging to another world and being across the pond. Keeping things from them would just increase the distance between us in a way that will not be geographically. I heard some rustling from the other end.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Lea?”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Hi Jer. Mama, Papa, you there?” After a few minutes of silence on the other end, Elena said, “They’re not here. Tell us what happened that you couldn’t call us weekly like you said you would. We thought you were dead! Do you even realize what you put us through?”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“I’m so sorry guys. I didn’t mean to put you through that. It’s just that… I’ll start from what you last knew. You know that we were hunting objects that would help us kill Riddle right? There was one in Bellatrix Lestrange’s vault in Gringotts so we broke into the bank and then escaped on the back of a dragon –“</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“You what?!?” Elena and Jeremy shouted.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“I know, I know, it was a crazy idea but it worked.” Then I proceeded to tell them about the diadem and the battle. I didn’t tell them about our capture at Malfoy Manor because even though they knew it was bad they didn’t need to know <strong>how</strong> bad the whole war was. But there was one thing I couldn’t miss no matter how much I wanted to as it was an important part and one that was affecting me in ways that I couldn’t properly explain without them knowing the how.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“How could you just give yourself up like that? Were you so selfish that you didn’t even think about us before just giving yourself up to die?” Jeremy exclaimed.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“ It was the only way to finally end the war. I couldn’t live knowing that there was a part of him in me and who knows that he wouldn’t have ended up possessing me or something after I killed him. It was the only way I could see.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“You are never doing anything like that again. I have half a mind to put you on suicide watch” Elena said.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“I don’t have a death wish Lena. I’m pretty sure that I don’t have any soul shards floating in my head so the chances of it happening again are zero.” I said.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“When did the – The Battle of Hogwarts, was it? – happen?” Jeremy asked.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“The war ended on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of May. I know I should have called before today but I really wasn’t in the right state of mind. I still am not actually but the funerals finally ended two days before, at least the ones that I wanted to go to, and I figured that it was high time that I called.” I admitted to them.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“Lea, there is something that you need to know.” Elena said.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“I am out of here.” Jeremy muttered and I heard the sound of a door being banged shut.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“What is it?” I asked, worried.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“On May 2<sup>nd</sup> I was involved in a car crash. I survived it but our parents didn’t.”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>End Flashback  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>I missed their funeral since I didn’t even know they were dead when it happened. Being the Girl-Who-Lived-Again was an even more bitter pill to swallow when another set of my parents died while I survived again. Elena must be feeling like the Girl-Who-Lived herself. No matter what the masses thought, it was not a title to raise your champagne glass over.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I cleaned up my act as I knew that I needed to be there for them. The British Wizarding World think that I am going to be with family which I will be. Just not Petunia and Vernon Dursley.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Only Professor Dumbledore, Snape and Professor McGonagall were aware that I was adopted by the Gilberts when Aunt Petunia tried to send me off to an orphanage and Papa happened to be a visiting doctor and he took me in. Papa had been visiting Britain a lot during that time as he was helping a fledgling branch out so they passed me off as Elena’s fraternal twin and told everyone that I had been too sickly and needed the medical attention in London. The three of them kept my disappearance quiet and got quite the surprise when they found out that I was in America. I consented to living with the Dursleys until I was seventeen with a few rare visits to Mystic Falls thrown in for the blood wards that thankfully held even after a decade and because it gave security to my family if nobody knew that they existed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Taxi that I had rented pulled up to 2104 Maple street. There was stinging in my eyes at the sight of my house after such a long time but I stubbornly held back my tears. I will not cry.</p>
