    <p>It had been two years since Draco’s trial, he’d been sentenced to house arrest for six months and lost the use of magic for those two years. During that time, Draco had decided to integrate himself into the muggle world. Although he was grateful for Potter’s testimony, he did suffer from crippling depression in the six months he was stuck in Malfoy Manor. That was one particular place he never intended to return to.</p>
<p>Draco had bought quite a nice flat in London and decided since he couldn’t apparate, floo or fly he’d learn to drive. Currently driving down the A1 towards Edinburgh in his Mercedes, sat beside him his best friend. He often commented on the luxury some muggles tend to live in. Draco had done a lot of soul searching in his painful two years without magic, realising his utter mistake. </p>
<p>The Malfoy family had lost quite a lot of money due to reparations, but still held ample resources even afterwards. Narcissa had sold the Manor and moved to the south of France, she once commented she belonged there. It always brought a smile to Draco’s face.</p>
<p>These days, Draco kept to himself mainly - the only friends he had left from school being Pansy and Blaise, he did have quite a decent amount of muggle friends too, his best friend being a girl called Louisa.</p>
<p>Louisa emitted a confidence Draco envied, at five foot nine and long honey golden curls flowing elegantly down her back, she was never short of a date. It amused Draco that she was wildly uninterested in an actual relationship. Though Louisa did struggle personally, he’d met her at a support group for PTSD connecting immediately.</p>
<p>“Are we nearly there?” asked Louisa, still staring down at her new Joan Jonker novel. “Not long now” Draco smiled turning his head towards her briefly. “I’m starving,” she sighed, closing the cover of her book. Louisa opened the glove compartment and slid the book inside.</p>
<p>“I know you told me about the whole magic thing, but do you think this Potter bloke is actually going to return your wand?” She said, scowling at the open glove compartment. It had been an interesting conversation to say the least, Draco had expected Louisa to immediately conclude he was insane, especially since he couldn’t actually <i>show</i> her the proof, but as fate had it, Louisa’s older sister Bethany was a muggleborn witch, it was evident she loved her sister with her whole heart, Draco sometimes wondered what it would be like to have a sibling, or maybe someone who loved him as much as Louisa loved Bethany.</p>
<p>When Draco first met Bethany, she looked at him critically and told him if he hurt her sister she’d break his neck. The smirk that formed on Louisa’s lips could rival his own, she carefully told her sister that he was in fact gay, and if he wasn’t she wouldn’t be interested anyway. Draco protested highly at this.</p>
<p>Draco shrugged his shoulders, his hands gripping the steering wheel hard enough to turn his knuckles white. “Probably not,” sighed, up ahead a roundabout sign posted for Edinburgh North stood at the side of the road, he turned his indicator on and waited for the traffic to clear. “I haven’t seen him for a long time” he admitted. </p>
<p>Louisa made a tutting noise and nodded. “Alright,” she bit her lip and closed the glove box. “Well do you know where he lives?”</p>
<p>Draco shook his head “I only know what Granger told me, he’s doing a Quidditch match in Edinburgh and she bought me tickets” he laughed. Louisa raised an eyebrow, there really wasn’t anything unattractive about the blonde, if Draco hadn’t preferred men he’d have snapped her up in a second. “You didn’t tell me <i>that</i>” </p>
<p>Draco smirked at her, turning the wheel as they drove round the roundabout, signalling off at his junction. “Buckle your tits Louisa, you’re about to see some hot sweaty men with wood between their legs.” He winked.</p>

</center>When Draco finally arrived outside the arena, he could feel his heart beat wildly in his chest. Turning into the mostly empty car park, he remembered other wizards probably did not drive cars, it was an easy thing to forget if he was honest. Finding a space was easy though, which was the only upside to this whole debacle.<p>“Here we are,'' he smiled, parking his car beside a rather luxurious black Bentley. Louisa’s eyebrows shot up immediately as she saw the man exit the car. “Holy fucking hell, who is <i>that!</i>” she exclaimed, pointing through Draco’s black tinted windows at the man standing beside the black Bentley. Draco turned his head, he rolled his eyes. “Well, it seems we didn’t need the tickets to see Potter.” Louisa shot a sideways glance at Draco, a scowl on her face.</p>
<p>“That’s Potter? You said he was gangly and gross.” she moaned, shaking her head. Draco shrugged his shoulders, giving Harry a quick once over with his eyes. “He’s not bad,” he said, nonplussed. Sliding his Gucci sunglasses up his nose, Draco opened his car door and slid out. </p>
<p>Louisa immediately followed suit, brushing down her skin tight jeans from invisible dust. Pushing her own sunglasses up her nose, she moved quickly around the car and stood beside Draco, folding her arms.</p>
<p>Potter turned around, his eyes resting on Draco almost instantly. “Oh, Malfoy.” he said, his eyebrows knitting together. Louisa was right, of course she was. Gone was the gangly, undernourished boy he once knew, stood before him was some sort of fucking golden Adonis. Draco groaned inwardly. “Potter.” he greeted, nodding his head. Harry’s eyes moved to Louisa, he gave her a quick up and down look, before offering a smile. “Hello.” Potter said, nodding again towards Louisa, who was rendered speechless. There really wasn’t a single part of Potter that was unattractive, not in the slightest. Draco was sure it was the worlds way of fucking with him just once more, just for shits and giggles.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m actually here to see you,” Draco said, he kept his tone as neutral as possible even with his inner turmoil going on. “I actually got the tickets off Granger..” he trailed off, gauging Harry’s shocked expression. The man was all rippling muscles in his tight t-shirt and jogging bottoms, a golden tan that looked as though he’d been bathing naked in the sun for months. Draco really needed to get the image of Potter sprawled over a deckchair completely naked out of his brain.</p>
<p>“Oh?” Potter replied, a slight smile forming on his lips. “Why would you want to see me, Malfoy?” he asked, his eyes flicked towards Louisa once again, Draco frowned. He wasn’t surprised Potter would find Louisa attractive, the woman could pull any man she wanted to by just clicking her bloody fingers. It was a trait Draco wished he had for himself. The last Draco had actually heard from Potter was he was dating Ginny Weasley, who was also part of a Quidditch team. Holyhead Harpies, as he remembered it.</p>
<p>“Well, you see…” Draco looked down at his feet, he felt somewhat uncomfortable asking this particular question, he’d rehearsed it in his head for two years now, but now the day was here how do you ask your former rival for your bloody wand back? Especially the one he took from you?</p>
<p>“You have my wand.” he finally said, narrowing his eyes. Potter let out a short laugh, nodding his head. “I do, I’ll give it back to you after the match.” Draco was unsure why the dark haired wizard looked so amused by the question, he could feel irritation bubbling under the surface.</p>
<p>“Thanks.” Draco finally said, turning his head towards Louisa, who had not said a single word. Louisa cleared her throat and looked up at Potter, Draco could tell she wanted to say something this was what she usually did - the woman always needed to think about what she said before she actually said it. </p>
<p>“Are you straight?” she asked, her eyes never moving from Potter’s face for one second, the man’s cheeks pinked slightly, he ducked his head down and cleared his throat. “Err, no.. I’m not.” he stammered, rubbing the back of his neck.</p>
<p>Louisa rolled her eyes, linking her arm through Draco’s. “Why are all the hot ones gay?” she moaned, she pulled her sunglasses up on to the top of her head and nudged Draco lightly. Draco let out a snort of laughter. “I knew you wanted me, you saucy bint.” Louisa rolled her eyes again, shaking her head in dismay. “Come on, let’s find our seats.” </p>
<p>Nodding in agreement, Draco quickly arranged a place to meet Potter after the match and they went off towards the arena together, leaving Potter stood beside his Bentley looking utterly confused.</p>
