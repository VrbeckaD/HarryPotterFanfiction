  <i>Peaceful Beginnings School for Young Leaders was established in 113 ICD and is one of the oldest and most prestigious preparatory schools in the PANDA cluster. It focuses heavily on both the broad socio-historical context which lead to the foundation of the Intergalactic Council and present cutting edge research into space travel. Students will receive an education from some of the brightest minds in the galaxy and have access to resources and travel to pursue their chosen fields.<br/>

</p><p>—-</p><p>Fleur slings her bag over her shoulder and pulls her hair off her neck for what feels like the fiftieth time that day. Even tied up, it seems to cling to her neck with the heat, making her even sweatier and more irritable. She hates giving the impression of someone who sweats.</p><p>"Which building is it again?" Her father asks. Fleur carefully slides her communicator out of the front pouch of her bag and shades her eyes to look at the screen, still adjusting to the bright outside light.</p><p>"1G," Fleur reads, before switching over to the school map that had automatically uploaded when they checked in that morning. "It's over this way."</p><p>"So, your first day!" Her mother says, still managing to sound cheerful in spite of the fact that she's carrying a box in one arm and wheeling a massive suitcase with the other. Fleur does not feel cheerful, and all she has is a duffle bag and her communicator. "It's so exciting!"</p><p>"Yes," Fleur says. Her father looks about as thrilled as she feels, although Fleur thinks it's probably less due to the heat and more due to the boarding school thing. It's an excellent school, and both her parents prioritize education, but it's far and it means being away from them and Gabrielle for the first time in her life.</p><p>Her mother's stream of overly bright small talk is cut off as 1G looms up above them. It looks a bit intimidating, Fleur thinks, looming and solid with an actual tower smack-dab in the middle. She tilts her chin up and looks intimidating right back.</p><p>"This is it, I think," Fleur says, when neither of her parents say anything for a moment. It's probably the tower; it does seem a little excessive. Her mother nods and somehow wriggles the door open so Fleur and her father can squeeze in. The inside of the building is loud and chaotic, but that's honestly a bit of a welcome sight to Fleur. The outside was so staid and stern-looking, it's nice to see the roiling mass of teenagers trailing confused parents and the occasional frazzled teacher trying to direct traffic.</p><p>"What's your suite number?" her father asks, raising his voice a little to be heard over everyone.</p><p>"Eighteen," Fleur says, pointing up the massive center staircase. "It should be on the second floor, fourth door down the left." Her mother sighs and readjusts her box, but doesn't complain about lugging everything up a flight of stairs.</p><p>The door to Suite 18 is mostly open, a girl with pretty, natural hair leaning against the frame and talking to someone inside. She turns around when she hears them approach and smiles.</p><p>“Are you in eighteen with us?” she asks Fleur, tone friendly. Fleur nods and forces a smile. She tends to clam up around new people in a way that she knows comes off as rude and supercilious; she’s determined to at least make an effort to avoid that. She isn’t here to make friends, but allies never hurt.</p><p>“I’m Hermione,” the girl says, actually offering a formal handshake. She keeps talking in her brisk, businesslike tone as she herds Fleur over to one of the beds. Fleur doesn’t particularly care to be herded, but she can hardly let go of her newfound attempts at social grace so quickly. “That’s Nym- er, Tonks, over by the window. Our last roommate hasn’t shown up yet. Hopefully she-” Fleur tunes Hermione out, taking the opportunity to study her other new roommate. She’s got interesting features, Fleur muses. They’re bold and a bit too large for her face, made more emphatic by her close-cropped bright pink hair. Standing by the window, lit up by the sun with her arms stretched out toward the warmth, she makes an oddly compelling picture.</p><p>She turns and sees Fleur staring. Fleur expects irritation or embarrassment, is already starting to tilt her chin up a little in retaliation, but Tonks just laughs.</p><p>“I must look totally sun-drunk.” She pulls a face, and Fleur just sort of keeps staring at her, unsure how to respond. Tonks doesn’t seem put off by her silence. “I don’t get much sun, normally. I spend a lot of time in space. We have sun lamps, of course, but it’s not really the same.”</p><p>“Right,” Fleur says faintly.</p><p>“I’m Tonks,” the other girl says. “Well,” she rolls her eyes, “Nymphadora, actually, but I’m jettisoning that cargo as quickly as possible, you can be sure.”</p><p>“Fleur.”</p><p>“Did you need a hand with your bags?” Tonks asks, peering around Fleur at the rest of the room.</p><p>“You packed almost as much as me, I think,” Hermione says. Fleur fights down a sigh and turns around as well. Hopefully their last roommate will be less nosy. And quieter.</p><p>Fleur forces a smile. “You never know what you might need,” she says, floating over to her belongings and skimming a hand across the duffle.</p><p>“Yes,” a tiny frown line appears between Hermione’s brows. “I hope I’ve brought enough books.”</p><p>Fleur isn’t entirely sure how to reply to that.</p><p>“Well,” Fleur’s mother says, gently turning Fleur around to face her. “That’s everything, I think. We should probably leave you to settle in.” She looks reluctant to leave, and Fleur pulls her into a hug with a sudden gush of fear. She feels so young, all of a sudden, alone for the first time in her life with no one she knows nearby. Her parents hug her from both sides, and Fleur can’t even bring herself to be embarrassed at how she’s clinging to them. Too soon, they say goodbye and leave her alone in the room, biting her lip and determined not to cry.</p><p>She walks over to her boxes and starts cutting them opened, determined to seem efficient and grown up.</p><p>“Have either of you picked which beds you want?” Fleur asks, keeping her eyes down until she’s absolutely sure she won’t tear up.</p><p>“Sort of,” Hermione says, heading back toward the bedroom. All the dorms are set up in the same way. They each have a small kitchen and living room off the communal hallway, with a single bedroom and bathroom down a short corridor. The bedrooms for first year students are all built for four people, with two of the beds lofted above the other two. Hermione has claimed one of the bottom bunks, with Tonks opting for the top bed across the room.</p><p>“Next to the window,” Fleur says, raising an eyebrow. She immediately questions herself. Too mocking? She relaxes slightly when Tonks grins.</p><p>“I can’t believe I’m already predictable.” Tonks pulls a faux-distressed face and Fleur laughs. Her real laugh, the one that makes her snort a bit and that she never uses if she can help it.</p><p>“I’ll take this one, then,” she says, spreading her fitted sheet out on the bed under Tonks’ and hoping no one noticed the snort.</p><p>“Hello?” Someone calls from the living room. Hermione squeaks a bit and leaps off the bed.</p><p>“Welcome!” she calls, already barrelling toward the mysterious fourth member of their suite. Fleur can practically see the clipboard materializing in her hands.</p><p>“She seems...friendly,” Fleur says, tilting her head back to look up at Tonks. She is thinking something closer to ‘annoying,’ but she doesn’t want to alienate her roommates from the jump.</p><p>“Yeah,” Tonks replies. She stretches out on her bed for a moment and then climbs down the ladder. “I guess we should go help?”</p><p>Fleur suppresses a sigh. Tonks’ bizarre confidence may be interesting, certainly more than Hermione’s anxious hovering, but Fleur isn’t particularly here to make friends. She already has friends.</p><p>Well, she has Gabrielle.</p><p>Her heart sinks a little. Gabrielle, who is now several solar systems away and busy with her own schooling besides.</p><p>She gets up to go help her new roommate unpack.</p><p>Hermione has a pretty, freckled, ginger girl nearly backed up against the doorway. There are loads of other freckled gingers carrying boxes and bags and what looks like a poorly gift-wrapped toilet seat. Fleur doesn’t ask.</p><p>“Hello,” what looks like her new roommate’s mother says. Her smiles goes a little tight as she eyes the hemline of Fleur’s skirt and Fleur smiles at her more widely, sauntering over.</p><p>“Goodness,” Fleur says, “I hope we don’t need to fit all of you in here.”</p><p>Roommate girl rolls her eyes. Mother makes a quiet little tsking sound and pats her shoulder. One of the boys is too busy staring at Fleur with a vaguely glazed expression to react, but the other stifles a laugh behind his hand. Fleur smirks a little.</p><p>“This is Ginny Weasley,” Hermione says, taking over introductions without being asked. “She’s our fourth roommate. Ginny, that’s Fleur, and Tonks. These are Ginny’s brothers Bill and Ron, and her parents.” Hermione is bouncing a little on her toes.</p><p>“I see you’ve met the official welcoming committee,” Fleur says, waving a languid hand at Hermione. She mostly does it to see if she can make Ginny’s mum’s mouth go even tighter.</p><p>“I’ve brought my own,” Ginny mutters. That makes Fleur like her a bit, in spite of herself.</p><p>“Ginny,” her mother scolds.</p><p>“Nice to meet you all,” Ginny says, with an enormous fake grin. “Ever so glad I’ve found the place.”</p><p>“Pretend you’re not an asshole for at least the first night, Gin,” Bill stage whispers to Ginny. Fleur can’t tell if she’s irritated or pleased that she’s not the only one who finds antagonizing Mrs. Weasley enjoyable.</p><p>“Bill led us right to the building,” Mrs. Weasley says briskly. “He’s a fourth year here, so if you girls need anything you can ask him.” She says this mostly to Hermione, who has apparently been deemed most acceptable of the lot of them.</p><p>The other brother stops staring at Fleur for long enough to look irritated.</p><p>“I’m in my third year, here. I know the campus just as well.”</p><p>“Of course you do, Ron.”</p><p>Fleur briefly debates flirting with one or both of the boys, but having them potentially hanging around in the following weeks is more of a deterrent than irritating Mrs. Weasley is an attractant.</p><p>“I’m sure we’ll find our way around. In fact,” Fleur turns to her roommates with an expansive gesture and attempts a welcoming smile. “Why don’t we all walk around to look for our classes together tomorrow.”</p><p>“Sure,” Ron says. Fleur is rapidly shuffling through her mental file of faces to indicate ‘fuck off’ without alienating her roommates, but fortunately Ginny beats her to the punch.</p><p>“You,” Ginny says firmly, “are not invited.” She turns to the rest of her family and makes shooing motions. “I’m settled. Thank you all for coming, love you loads, please clear out.”</p><p>“Well,” Mrs. Weasley says hesitantly. “I’ll keep the communicator on tonight, just in case you need us.”</p><p>“Lovely. Thanks,” Ginny sets down her last box, accepts hugs from her parents and brothers, and then waves them down the stairs. “Fucks sake,” she mutters, as soon as the door shuts. “Sorry about that. Have you all picked beds?” She asks this last bit over her shoulder, already heading down the hall to the bedroom.</p><p>“We can move,” Hermione offers hurriedly.</p><p>“Nah, I can sleep wherever,” Ginny calls back. Tonks has picked up approximately three boxes and is walking down the hall already, so Fleur half-heartedly grabs the smallest bag and follows.</p><p>It turns out to be lucky she’s barely holding anything, because Tonks collides with the wall halfway and nearly drops a box on her toe. Fleur catches it just in time.</p><p>“Whoops,” Tonks says.</p><p>“Maybe a few less boxes next time?” Fleur says, amused in spite of herself. Tonks just shrugs and laughs, dropping her armful in the corner.</p><p>“Should we unpack?” Hermione asks, eyeing the slightly disaster-zone room. From the neatly folded quilt on her bed and the row of shoes peeping out from underneath, Fleur gets the sense Hermione has already unpacked.</p><p>“Are you kidding,” Tonks says, hopping a little. “Actual proper gravity? I don’t even need to secure everything right away. Planets are awesome.”</p><p>Hermione looks less than thrilled, and for once Fleur actually feels a twinge of sympathy with her. She prefers her space to be neat, also.</p><p>“Agreed. I’m starving, let’s go find the dining hall.” Ginny tucks in the last corner of her blanket and then jumps from her top bunk to the floor.</p><p>“You daredevil!” Tonks exclaims, laughing. She starts eyeing the ladder of her own bunk. Fleur, thinking of the incident in the hall, makes an executive decision.</p><p>“I’m hungry, too,” she says. “We can eat and then unpack.”</p><p>Hermione eyes the boxes again, but doesn’t protest.</p><p>The dining hall is ridiculously far from their dorm. They have to slog past the second, third, and fourth year dorms before they can get there. The only housing buildings farther away are the fifth year ones, and that’s because most of the older students have hoverboard permits.</p><p>“This is ridiculous,” Ginny groans, dragging her feet dramatically. They all laugh and she preens a little.</p><p>“At least we’ve got a kitchen,” Tonks says optimistically. “And I heard there is a fairly well stocked pantry near the dining hall. We can use some of our food credits there.”</p><p>“Cooking?” Ginny sounds skeptical. “Who cooks? We’re sixteen, not sixty.”</p><p>“I like baking,” Fleur says. It flies out without conscious thought, the environment of camaraderie pulling an unexpected candidness from her. Fleur doesn’t like to give away facts about herself so easily, especially not truthful ones. Then again, this is all new. This is for five years, not the usual six to eight months, hopping from program to program to soak up as many credentials as she possibly can.</p><p>“Good. You two can be the official chefs of the suite.” Ginny says, breaking Fleur out of her thoughts. “Hermione and I will just laze around and eat.”</p><p>Hermione, who doesn’t look like she’s lazed a day in her life, looks somewhat apprehensive at this. Tonks laughs and elbows Ginny.</p><p>“See if I make anything for you! I’ll just trade Fleur for baked goods and you two will be left with long treks to the dining hall.”</p><p>“Rude of you,” Ginny grins.</p><p>Fleur feels inexplicably annoyed at the easy way Ginny and Tonks seem to banter. They continue ribbing each other back and forth, with Fleur and Hermione following like awkward shadows, all the way to the dining hall.</p><p><i>I don’t need friends, anyway,</i> Fleur tells herself, more confidently than she feels.</p><p>They’re approaching the dining hall when they’re stopped by a boy holding a stack of fliers. His clothes are neat and the trousers look freshly pressed, but his mass of unruly dark hair makes them look somehow borrowed.</p><p>“Are you four first years?” he asks.</p><p>“Is it that obvious?” Ginny replies, bravado faltering a little. The boy smiles and shakes his head.</p><p>“I just haven’t seen any of you around before. Welcome to Peaceful Beginnings.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Hermione says, peering around Tonks’ elbow. “What are those?”</p><p>“Oh. I’m recruiting for my club.” He starts passing the fliers around. “Don’t feel any pressure to come, but I know first year can be really overwhelming and it’s nice to have a group of older kids to ask for advice.” He smiles at each of them and makes eye contact as he hands them the papers. “I’m Harry, by the way.”</p><p>“Biodiversity Protection Squad,” Hermione reads, brow wrinkling a little in confusion. Harry laughs.</p><p>“It’s not a very catchy name, I know. Clubs have to have ‘demonstrable academic value’ to be established, you know how it is.” They all smile even though they don’t, really. “We see a lot of cute animals and are always willing to help out our younger members,” Harry beams. The expression sits on his face approximately like the neat clothing. It’s artificial, somehow.</p><p>“Sounds cool,” Ginny says, smiling and tucking a bit of hair behind her ear.</p><p>“I’ll let you guys go eat, but feel free to come to our first meeting! The time and location are on the flier.” Harry waves and moves on to another group of students.</p><p>“Come on,” Tonks says, folding up her flier and sticking it in her pocket, “I’m starving!”</p><p>Between eating and unpacking and trying to avoid stepping on any toes (physically or metaphorically), the evening whirls by. It’s fine for a while, even a little nice.</p><p>It’s not until later that night, in the quiet dark of the bedroom, that it hits Fleur all at once.</p><p>It’s barely dawn back home, but maybe…</p><p>
  <i>You awake?</i>
</p><p>Her communicator chimes a second later, and Fleur quickly turns off the volume.</p><p>
  <b>Obviously!!! Mum and dad have me on the run up to school schedule. It’s dreadful.</b>
</p><p>Fleur smiles at the tiny picture of Gabrielle at the top of her communicator screen.</p><p>
  <i>Eleven years old and already sick of watching the sunrise?</i>
</p><p>
  <b>I can watch the sunrise in my bedroom at a reasonable hour. In higher resolution, even.</b>
</p><p>Fleur thinks of Tonks, arms outstretched and blissfully happy. Sun-drunk.</p><p>
  <i>It’s not the same though, is it?</i>
</p><p><b>Too early for philosophy</b>, Gabrielle writes. <b>Ugh. Mum’s getting on me about communicators before lunch. Talk soon, love you</b></p><p>Several solar systems away, Fleur falls asleep with a slight smile on her face.</p><p>Maybe this won’t be so bad after all.</p>
