    <p>Beech Logde</p><p>Second of September 1998</p><p>She fell out of the sucking, twisting void of apparition and landed gracefully on the forest floor. It was early afternoon. Pale sunlight played in the treetops and a gentle wind brought with it the scent of early autumn, rich notes of the first fallen leaves, perfume of the still blooming flowers. </p><p>She had carefully packed the meagre possessions she had kept in her rooms, her precious books and the few items of clothing she owned, and left without looking back, still feeling anxious and confused about the events of the night before. A shiver went through her spine, but she was determined to forget. This was a new start. A new life. She was resolved not to wallow on things that could have been.  </p><p>In her left hand she carried a woven wicker basket. Clutched in her right hand was a piece of parchment. As she read it and concentrated on the words Miss Hermione Granger lives in Beech Logde in Muir of Ord, near Carnoch woods , a winding path materialized in front of her. She crouched down and opened the basket. As soon as the little door swung open on it´s hinges, an orange smushed face peeked out, and the rest of Crookshanks emerged lazily. ”Go on Crooksie, it's where we live now.”. </p><p>She picked the basket up and followed the narrow, overgrown path towards the small cottage. The path was lined with beech trees, the trunks like pillars holding the green leafy roof, forming a sort of airy tunnel. Large oaks stood in a circle around a small garden which was littered with acorns. She could imagine squirrels  and other small critters leaping from branch to branch, over joyed by the abundance. The garden had gone wild, but looked charming nevertheless. The view reminded her of Mary's secret garden. </p><p>There was a grumbling stone wall surrounding the plot, with an iron wrought, rusty gate that was now stuck permanently open, tightly surrounded by the rose bush that had slowly engulfed it. She stepped in to the yard. The vegetation was waist high, only a tapering foot path going from the gate to the door. The shattered remains of a greenhouse behind the cabin came in to view. Inside and around it was broken glass and rotted parts of the old frame stuck up in weird angles from the ground. Long grass seemed to have taken over the area and an old ash tree had fallen on, - and in the structure. She slowly took the place in as she circled the cottage. It was old and clearly no one had used it for decades. Vines grew up the stone walls wrapping the tiny house in their tight embrace, the windows looking like dark eyes under the creeping leaves. The roof looked intact, though there seemed to be some sort of an abandoned nest next to one of the two chimneys. It reminded her of Hagrid´s hut, though it wasn't round, nor did it have a pumpkin patch. </p><p>As she rose up the three cracked stone steps leading to the door, she felt the strange urge to knock. Stupid really. It was her´s now, and there was no one here. She opened the door tentatively, almost waiting for an attack. </p><p>She was right, sort of. A house elf was dusting the empty bookshelves and cried out loudly when it saw her. She shrieked, but before she could think of anything to say, the small creature had started to explain. ”Oh Miss Hermione has come, and Winky has only started, Mistress Headmistress McGonagall sent Winky here to help, but Winky has had a lot to do, and there is still much work left”! ”Would Miss want some tea? Winky has cleaned the kitchen and after Winky has finished with the shelves, she shall wash the floor.” The elf  spoke fast with a high note.   </p><p>” Winky, how lovely to see you again”, she said earnestly. ”I would love some tea thank you, but only if it is not too much, you seem to be busy”. Sent here to help her, eh? Well - all and all, if she had to live with someone, Winky would have been her first choice. The only choice.</p><p>She looked around. The cottage was basically one large room. There was a little kitchenette with a wood burning stove on the left, white and blue Morroccan styled tiles adorned the wall between the desktop and the upper cupboards, which were eye-waterlingly bright orange. They must have been very fashionable when the place was last refurbished. Early sixties´ by the looks of it. There was a small wooden kitchen table and three mismatched chairs. The whole kitchen was sparkling clean. Winky had clearly kept her standards. A worn out tea set was placed to dry over a towel, as were the other dishes. There was six of everything. Large plates, small plates, soup bowls, glassware, tea cups, forks and so on. They were old but charming in their way.  A bathroom was situated on the far wall, behind a creaky door. Furnished with a small copper tub, a tiny cupboard, and a green porcelain toilet seat and sink. She felt the urge to smirk. The only green things were the toilet fixtures, Minerva truly had had it out with the Slytherins from the start. </p><p>Next to the bathroom was a small pantry or a storeroom without a door, and on the right wall a sleeping alcove and a fireplace. Winky had already dusted the mattress, the covers and pillows as there wasn't a trace of the same fine layer of gray dust, that rested on the other surfaces. She liked it - the Beech Logde. It smelled unfamiliar, and un-inhabited, but it felt promising. No rooms, no corridors, no places to hide. Minerva had thought of everything. Bookshelves covered every wall from floor to ceiling, and the vines that crept on the outer walls framed the windows elegantly. The window sills were deep as the stone walls were almost two feet thick. She rummaged in her bag and pulled out a minute clay pot with a small Mimbulus Mimbletonia, only the size of her pinky – a departing gift Neville had given her the same morning. She put it gently on the sill.</p><p>After sitting down for tea with Winky in the two old, overstuffed armchairs by the hearth they made a list of the things that needed to be done, color coded by urgency, to get the place habitable and running. It hadn't always been easy working with Winky, but their months together working in the hospital wing at Hogwarts had made them come to an understanding. She had learned a lot from her S.P.E.W. days. She knew now that Winky needed to work because she thought it was the right thing to do, and Winky had compromised by treating Hermione as an equal rather than a master. She was a bossy little thing and had high standards in everything she did. They had done their work together from making the necessary potions for the ward, to healing broken bones, distributing medicine and staying up at patients bedsides in to the small hours of the morning. The thought of owning an elf would have made her stomach turn just a few years ago, now she knew most of them needed a family to bond themselves to, in order to live content and fulfilling lives, and who was she telling anyone what they needed anyway? </p><p>While Hermione started to arrange her brewing equipment in to the pantry next to the loo, Winky washed the floors, scrubbed the bathroom and pulled from her brown leather handbag crisp new linens for Hermione's bed and a smaller set for the small cupboard she had chosen to nest in, in the kitchenette.  Hermione was lost in thought, sorting her different sized cauldrons from her ever useful beaded bag when Winky pulled the hem of her skirt. ”Miss, there is an owl, a naughty, biting owl, bitey owls don't get treats!”. The owl in question sat eyes wide on top of the bookshelf nearest the kitchen and gently hooted, looking somewhat disappointed for the lack of refreshments. The envelope Winky had wrestled from it was thick and heavy and carried the achingly familiar green script and the crest of Hogwarts. Miss Hermione Granger,  Potions lab, Beech Logde, Muir of Ord. Inside was three envelopes and a neatly folded parchment she quickly unfolded and read on:</p><p>Dear Miss Granger<br/>
I hope you find your new lodgings acceptable, I know they have been neglected for a long time, but I took the liberty of sending Winky there early this morning, to make preparations. I hope you will give her the home she so sorely needs, she shall remain in Hogwarts´ employment, but for all intents and purposes, she now belongs to you. She was quite adamant about accompanying you, as she has become deeply fond of you during the last few months. I also propose that you keep the delivering owl as the cottage isn't attached to the floo-network. It would be prudent to have some sort of method to communicate with the outer world.<br/>
Your N.E.W.T. Scores are in one of the envelopes. I also took the liberty of filling up your application for the war veteran pension and enclosed  their response to said application. In addition, I was contacted today by Healer Tursnip from St. Mungo´s, who appears to have a proposition for you. They weren't aware of your departure from the school and I agreed to act as a courier for their offer. If you take up on their proposal, I shall visit you tomorrow and bring with me Professor Hagrid, Professor Sprout and Mr. Longbottom who is, as you well know, from this morning forward training under Professor Sprout. Owl me kindly this evening, concerning the St. Mungo´s business. If you turn them down, I shall visit alone.<br/>
Yours sincerely<br/>
- Minerva McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts.</p><p>She let out a sigh, war veterans pension. Was she truly this damaged?  A pensioneer, at nineteen. She opened the envelope. Dear Miss Granger – we are happy to inform you that you shall receive a compensation of nine galleons a month as a war orphan until your 21 birthday, the funds will go straight to your vault at Gringott´s -nine galleons for being an orphan. Great. Grand. She would gladly pay more if she could had her parents back. She felt an angry blush settle on her cheeks. On the other hand she needed be reasonable, she needed  to eat. And pay rent. Minerva would argue this no doubt, she had gifted the cottage to her, but she didn't want to be a charity case, someone to be pitied, living out the kindness of others. She put the letter away without finishing it. </p><p>The second one she opened was her N.E.W.T. Scores. Her hands shook slightly when she tried to carefully pry the envelope open. She had calmed down somewhat during the years. Grown up, perhaps. She remembered how she had felt while opening her O.W.L.s, and just couldn't manage the same level of enthusiasm anymore. Ron had mocked her for being disappointed with her one exceeds expectations back then. Ron. How far had he slipped. And how quickly. War worked like that, she supposed. He felt like a complete stranger now. He had been there, by her side for years and years, through it all, and now he was gone. </p><p>She had gotten eleven Outstandings. She felt  wanly pleased rather than happy or content, really, how had this felt so important once? She slipped the results back in the envelope. There was the one from St. Mungo's left.  </p><p> Dear Miss Granger, </p><p>We thank you of your contribution on the aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts´, and we have had this proposition ready and waiting until you had officially graduated. Healer Spleen was most taken with your hard working attitude, quick ability to learn, and of your passion for brewing the potions so ambitiously, altering them to be more efficient. We propose to you a sort of research grant, a scholarship if you will, if you would continue your exceptional work with the experimental potion you started brewing during the summer. We offer you anything you shall need, both  funding and resources. The potions patent shall of course be yours, but we would like to aid you in getting the potion ready for large testing groups and eventually to be used in the hospital, (and wizarding hospitals around the world) as it would be dearly needed. Would you reply, post haste, so we can start the preparations at our end. </p><p>Your´s sincerely </p><p>Healer  Augustus Tursnip, internal injuries ward, St. Mungo's. </p><p>Her mouth hung open, she felt the feeling of warm satisfaction and nerves taking over her entire body. Well this..This was a dream come true! She could continue her research and get the resources, and St. Mungo's would support her on her quest. She didn't have to be only a shell shocked head case people would talk down to in a condescending way. She beamed at Winky and dug through her beaded bag for parchment and a quill. She scribbled a hasty ”Yes-thank-you-of -course-when-shall-we-meet-to-discuss-the-details ”-reply to St. Mungo's  and a quick ”Yes!-Please-come-over!” note to Minerva. That's why Minerva had wanted to bring Sprout, Neville and Hagrid, to get the garden and greenhouse kick started for her research! She also wrote down the orders of  the new mail order catalogues from Potage's Cauldron Shop and the Slug and Jigger´s Apothecary. There was plenty of things she would need.</p><p>After emptying her potions equipment in her makeshift lab, she started filling the bookshelves. It was by far her favourite thing, a task that should be done with care. It was truly a wonder, she thought, accioing book after book from the capacious depths of her bag. Had they kept dragging all of these tomes while on the run? Sure, she'd gotten some new additions to her collection during the summer.  Would she dare ask Mrs. Weasley to send over the old ones that she had abandoned at the Burrow before they had started their hunt for the Horcruxes. The shelves were slowly filling themselves as she would rummage through her bag and come up with volume after another and sort them in to neat piles on the floor, then taking her time to decide how to shelf them. She had quite the stock, but still there was empty spaces, maybe she could put in some photos or trinkets here and there. She just hadn't any. Well maybe she could look through the cabinets and find something. It was definitely starting to look like home.</p>
