    <p>The tiny pinprick of flame hovering over the candle wax flickers out, and Harry sighs. </p><p>He's done it again<em>.</em> </p><p>Getting to his feet, he glances around furtively, hoping nobody saw. Well - even if they did, they wouldn't attribute it to him and his strange, inexplicable ability. </p><p>He steps over to the ghost-like lamps that had been cheerily lighting the room before he managed to silence them, and slowly, methodically, <em>manually</em> lights them with a match. The rough groan the friction makes as he strikes it puts him on edge each time he lights another one. Eventually, the large sitting room is cast in a soft light, and Harry can return to the velvet loveseat and settle down again.</p><p>It's late - the grand grandfather clock in the corner of the room shows the time to be nearing midnight. It's shadow stretches up belligerently to the high ceiling, obscuring the art work that Harry's father had painstakingly had painted on the year before. Harry finds the overly-bucolic cherub's constant stare mildly unnerving, if he's honest. Not that he's ever voiced so to his father- now <em>that </em>would just be asking for an argument. </p><p>Humming slightly, he picks up the book he was reading: A Brief History of Astronomical Knowledge. It's good - he's managed to sprint through the first five chapters just tonight. He reads in silence for a further five minutes, waiting for his heartbeat to return to normal. It always beats a little faster when he accidentally does something he knows he shouldn't.</p><p>He's not surprised, though, when his concentration is broken by a door opening on the other side of the room. Sighing internally, he turns his head slightly, watching as one of the maids slips in. Her face softens when she sees the sight: Harry, clad only in his nightgown, knees tucked to his chest, hair messy and green eyes sleepy but glinting warmly and sharply in the low light. </p><p>Although incongruously dressed, he looks right at home in the huge wood-panelled drawing room, shadowed on either side by floor-to-ceiling rows of beautifully bound books. </p><p>The maid walks over slowly, carefully, still feeling dwarfed by the opulence on display. She's new, just come up from the village - not yet used to the Potter's grand Georgian home.</p><p>"Good evening, Sir," she says, voice ringing clear despite her nervousness. "Lord Potter has instructed you to be in bed by midnight so that you can wake up fresh and bright tomorrow." </p><p>Harry wonders how his father would have delivered that message to her. It must irk him to have to impose a bedtime on his young Omega; he probably shouted.</p><p>He won't make her life difficult.</p><p>"Of course," he replies quietly, marking the page with an old scrap of leather he's been carting round as a bookmark, and placing it gently on the glass side table, next to the crystal glass of whiskey. It's sides are marred with the evidence of his drinking this evening - absolutely forbidden by his father, and illegal anyway. Harry is too young, even without mentioning his secondary gender. He likes the burn of whiskey as it slips softly down his throat, likes that he's breaking the rules. It makes it taste better. </p><p>The maid dutifully ignores this small act of rebellion, scurrying over to clear up the evidence. She's probably been informed of Harry's illicit understanding with the rest of the staff. Especially tonight, they won't begrudge him a drink. </p><p>Harry prays she won't ask him about it. But of course she does - why would she not?</p><p>"How are you feeling about tomorrow, Sir?" she asks, bravely sending him a grin. They walk out of the main doors together, Harry peering up at the portraits they pass on the way. No omegas up there - just alpha after alpha. </p><p>He smiles, tries to conjure up a slight slither of excitement. It must not work very well as her salacious look dims a little. He decides to be honest. After all - he won't be seeing her again after tonight.</p><p>"To be frank, a little nervous," he admits wryly, looking down at the claret coloured carpet. "I don't feel ready to leave here. Especially not with <em>him</em>. I've held one conversation with the man - and we both know how well that went." </p><p>The words have their intended effect, and she lets out a quiet laugh. It somehow makes Harry feel slightly better. Slightly. He scrubs a hand through his dark mop of hair, pushing it off his face. </p><p>"Understandable, Master Potter. But you have to take the good with the bad too - his home is so <em>grand, </em>there'll be so many people to meet, a whole new way of living. In fact, it's the beginning of your new life, Sir!" she chirps proudly, completely missing the wince that Harry fails to repress. He makes a vague noise of agreement, thinking about his husband-to-be. </p><p>Tom Riddle. </p><p>See, really, what she <em>means </em>by whole new way of life is that Harry is being<em> mated</em>. He's seventeen, hasn't been allowed to venture outside of their region (aside from one memorable trip to the French Countryside), has had great pain taken to ensure he's never even so much as held an unsupervised <em>conversation</em> with an alpha - and now he's being sent to live with one. One that he has met on one, terrible occasion, which did not end with falling in love, sparks, or declarations of feeling. </p><p>Frowning, he subtly smells his wrist.</p><p>He can still smell the other man - hot, spicy and a little sweet - from where he'd smeared his scent all over the other boy before he left. Last week. And even though it's undeniably faded, he can <em>still</em> smell him, still feels his heart rate pick up and his body flash hot, every time he catches the scent. Harry knows it's simply biology. But while Riddle is frustratingly, achingly attractive, he is also frustratingly, achingly <em>dangerous</em>. </p><p> </p><p> *</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>[A week earlier]</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Harry tries not to fidget, waiting in the adjoining room being fussed over by a staff of at least four. He just has to grit his teeth and let them fuss. In his opinion, any more than what they've done is just overkill - he likes his buttery soft, taupe trousers and tightly tailored jacket. They've managed to somewhat tame his hair into <em>politely</em> framing his face (instead of <em>aggressively</em>, like usual). But after having his cheeks and lips pinched periodically by the chubby, calloused fingers of the head maid, he's ready to fight them off one-by-one.</p><p>His nerves are making the blood rush to his head, and he strains his ears, trying to pick up glints of the voices in the other room over the excited chatter of the staff. Today is the day he is to meet the alpha his father has decided on for him. He has a rough idea of who it could be, but so far he's just heard snatches of a rough, low timbre - the tone pitched low enough that Harry can tune his hearing solely on it. He's <em>dying</em> of curiosity, and a little offended that he's been kept waiting in this holding pen of a room until his father decides the time is right to reveal him.</p><p>Harry know's that whilst he's an ace, he's still nothing more than a useful playing card. He tries not to think about what he's being traded for. </p><p>Right away, he knew when the alpha had arrived. The house staff had been in a flurry of activity all morning, so he was aware someone was coming. But the moment the alpha stepped foot in the reception room, Harry just <em>knew</em>. He'd stopped what he was doing, all senses suddenly straining to catch a glimpse, a scent, anything of whatever <em>thing</em> that had just made the pressure and temperature in the house flare for the briefest second.</p><p>Harry understands then, that his father has done well. He's done <em>very well.</em> This is not an alpha - this is a pureblooded <em>beast</em>. And, he realises, this means there is only one man who could possibly be standing in the room two doors away from him. </p><p>Imagining the glee on Lord Potter's face at this triumphant success makes Harry feel vaguely nauseous. </p><p>He's too late in realising that the voices in the other room have stopped. </p><p>The butler is suddenly in front of him, lips thin in a condescending (as always) smile.</p><p>"Let's go, Sir," he murmurs with annoying, quiet carefulness. Harry can't stand people that think he's fragile, just because he's an <em>Omega</em>. Before he has a chance to speak, he's being gently shepherded before the entrance to the other room , which opens immediately. The movement of the door sends a waft of the scents percolating in the room right into his face, and he's too stunned to move for the first few seconds.</p><p>It's difficult to explain - he's never quite encountered anything like it. </p><p>It's not really a scent, although straight away he knows he'll never forget it for as long as he lives, so much as a feeling. It doesn't push him out of control or make him want to swoon or anything like that, like the rumours Harry's heard. It is undeniably powerful though: he<em> does</em> feel the urge, bearing down silently but insistently, to please whoever it's coming from - to make sure he doesn't ever piss them off, to hide, run, make himself small. He can't quite tell if he wants attention from this alpha... or wants anything <em>but. </em>Regardless, he's so surprised and off-kilter that it takes a subtle push from the manservant guarding the room in order for Harry to walk forward. </p><p>He still hasn't looked up. He can't - manners dictate that eye contact can only be given if he's spoken to. It's been beaten in to him (well - more like starved) enough times that even though he's feeling unbalanced he manages to follow it through, even if only by reflex. The carpet is an ostentatiously deep bruised purple, well-trodden but clean, and stretches out like a horizon in front of him. He sees shoes, makes himself count the pairs even as he feels all the hair on his arms stand up. </p><p>His father's, obsequiously shiny, large, one leg crossed over the other.</p><p>The laced boots of the servant waiting on them.</p><p>The final pair: black, pointed, unfamiliar. Ankles crossed casually. Harry can't tear his eyes away. </p><p>His father clears his throat as if embarrassed. <em>Nervous maybe</em>, Harry muses.<em> Isn't this a </em><em>surprise</em>.</p><p>"Well, Harry. Introduce yourself." His father's voice is characteristically gruff, the sentence more of a series of barked words than anything more cohesive. Harry snaps out of it, speaks, and then raises his eyes. </p><p>"Nice to meet you, Lord Riddle. I'm Harry Potter, sole heir to the Potter line."</p><p>The man that meets his gaze is unfairly beautiful. Dark black hair perfectly coiffed, contrasting with a pale angular jaw with a faint echo of stubble. The man's nose is straight and pointed, leading down to a plump cupid's bow, countenance giving nothing away. His eyes are what stops Harry in his assessment.</p><p>Dark blue, cold, assessing. Horrifyingly astute, Harry realises. He wants to look away but he doesn't know if he can. It feels like the man's steady stare is running over Harry with intent, gazing <em>into</em> him, slipping insidiously into his mind. He suddenly feels the man's power flare in the room, a brief doubling of gravity, making his fingers tremble from where they're clenched into surreptitious fists. </p><p>Funnily enough, it's his father who saves him.</p><p>"Seventeen. Obviously unspoiled," he announces proudly, as if describing his favourite gun. Safely ensconced in his head, Harry bares his mental teeth and gnashes them together. </p><p>He breaks eye contact to look (glare as much as he can get away with) at his father - who <em>is</em> sweating slightly, hands clasping each other in a surprisingly obvious show of apprehension - but can still feel the weight of Riddle's gaze boring into him. His scent, his<em> presence</em> is off-putting. Makes it difficult to think.</p><p>Riddle ignores Lord Potter, to Harry's surprise. "How did you know who I am?" The question is asked curiously, lazily, the words perfectly pronounced - no hint of any accent. Harry wants to curl up inside his voice and go to sleep. </p><p class="p1">He tries to avoid eye-contact, but trying to avoid those eyes is like trying to swim through honey. He finds his gaze dragged back, syrupily, against his will. <em>What does he say? </em></p>
