    <p>Harry spun his finger slowly over the coffee cup in front of him, not touching the spoon but stirring it all the same. With his other hand he held a book depicting the use of magic from a non-magic user's perspective. It was quite an interesting read, seeing how close some people were to the truth, and how far off others were. No matter what Draco had to say about non-magic users<strike>   </strike>or muggles, as was the slang term for them<strike>   </strike>Harry would never cease to be fascinated by them.</p><p>Harry had been raised by muggles, by his awful Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, after his adoptive parents had died. Harry only had vague memories of his birth parents, having been found in the forest by his adoptive parents when he was just three years old. Lily Evans and James Potter had been magic users, so it was just good fortune that their adoptive son was born with such vast magical abilities.</p><p>When Harry was seven, Lily and James had died in a duel against a dark magic-user, a wizard, going by the fact that the man had used a wand. After their death, Harry was sent to live with his muggle aunt and uncle, who hated Harry because he was a "freak" for having powers. It was a wonder Harry turned out as well as he did, considering how often his relatives put him down.</p><p>"Harry, there you are!" A voice called out in the pub, pulling Harry from his reading. Harry looked up and saw a mop of red hair weaving its way through the crowd towards him. It was Ron, one of Harry's closest friends. The second-youngest Weasley could be quite hot-headed and brash, but he was always there for Harry when the black-haired teen needed a friend.</p><p>The green-eyed boy marked his place in his book and put it down, waiting for his friend to join him at his booth. When Ron reached him, cheeks rosy from the May cold outside and slightly out of breath, he sat down and pulled off his scarf. "Mate, I thought you said you were gonna meet 'Mione and me at Florean Fortescue's fifteen minutes ago; have you been here the whole time?"</p><p>Harry grinned sheepishly, rubbing a hand over the nape of his neck. "Sorry, Ron, I must've lost track of time. Come on, I'll pay my bill and we can head over, maybe even stop by your brothers' shop." Harry stood and threw a few coins down onto the table and took one last large gulp of his coffee, trying to drain as much of it as he could before leaving. He then stuck his book into his bag and motioned for Ron to lead the way.</p><p>When they exited the back of The Leaky Cauldron, Ron pulled out his wand and tapped a familiar pattern on the alleyway's brick wall. The bricks fell away to reveal the entrance to Diagon Alley.</p><p>Diagon Ally was a place for magic-users to congregate and share knowledge. Different shops sold different thing, from books<strike>   </strike>both to help with all kinds of magic and for fun reading<strike>   </strike>to ice cream, to familiars (a magic-users animal partner), to magical pranks, to a million other things; anything your mind could come up with, Diagon Alley and<strike>   </strike>by extension<strike>   </strike>Knockturn Alley could provide it.</p><p>Just as the two magic-users stepped into Diagon Alley and began walking towards where their friend Hermione was standing, Harry felt the pendant he was wearing around his neck heat up in warning. Harry stopped, immediately knowing what it meant. He had charmed the pendant to grow hot when someone had entered his home without his permission, alerting the wards around his apartment.</p><p>"Someone's at my apartment, Ron," Harry said sharply, before turning on the spot, collecting his magic and opening the fabric of space to allow himself to walk through it, affectively teleporting to his home. As per usual, he saw wonderful lights and strange branches as he traveled, before it disappeared and he was standing outside his apartment building.</p><p>Harry lived in muggle London; there were towns scattered across Britain that were solely inhabited by magic-users<strike>   </strike>like the one that Ron lived in<strike>   </strike>but Harry liked the ebb and flow of the muggles living their lives.</p><p>The young magic-user dashed inside, waving his hand to undo the lock; he didn't have time to take out his key and do it the muggle way. He stepped into the elevator and jammed the button for the third floor. He tapped his foot impatiently, wishing he could've just teleported straight into his apartment. He couldn't, of course; he had set his wards up to not allow anyone to teleport into his home, including himself. He made a mental note to fix that.</p><p>When the elevator door finally opened on the third floor, Harry ran down the short hallway, skidding to a stop in front of the door marked <em>304<strike>   </strike></em>his apartment. He took a deep breath, preparing himself for a possible fight, before pushing his (unlocked) door open with a small burst of magic.</p><p>Harry entered quietly, muffling his footsteps with magic, hands raised in preparation for an attack. He looked around, checking each room thoroughly before moving onto the next. When he reached his living room, he saw two people standing there, waiting for him. One was a woman, with silky red hair and eyes that seemed to be cataloguing everything. The second was a man, wearing a nondescript suit and a bland smile on his face.</p><p>"Who are you two, why are you in my apartment, and do kindly speak fast; I don't have a lot of patience when it comes to intruders," Harry said coldly, hands twitching at his sides, itching to <em>force </em>the two people out of his apartment.</p><p>"Mr. Harry James Potter, I presume?" The man in the suit said, smile polite and calming; Harry didn't feel calm, but he nodded anyway. "I am Agent Phil Coulson and this is my associate, Agent Natasha Romanov; we work for SHIELD, that's the Strategic-"</p><p>"Yes, I know what SHIELD is," Harry said, looking at these two with new eyes. They were government agents, and they were in his apartment, which couldn't mean anything good, really. "What I want to know is why you're here. And if you're here because of my abilities, then why come now? I've had magic my whole life and I was never a threat, why would I be considered one now?"</p><p>"We were always keeping an eye on you, Mr. Potter, ever since you <em>magically </em>appeared in a forest with no record of your birth. We keep an eye on all extremely powerful magic users, if it makes you feel any better," the red-haired woman<strike>   </strike>Natasha, Harry thought her name was<strike>   </strike>said with a wry smile. Harry stared at her with a waiting expression, and she continued. "We're here because the world needs your help."</p><p>When she didn't continue speaking, Harry rolled his eyes and cracked his knuckles, feeling quite antsy all of a sudden. "Elaborate, if you'd be so kind."</p><p>"Are you familiar with Norse mythology, Mr. Potter?" The bland man<strike>   </strike>Agent Coulson<strike>   </strike>asked, taking a step closer to Harry.</p><p>"Of course, I was raised with all different types of mythology for bedtime stories; Norse, Egyptian, Greek, Roman...What does that have to do with me being needed to save the world, though?"</p><p>"Those myths are actually true; the Norse gods<strike>   </strike>Thor, Odin, <em>Loki</em><strike>   </strike>they're all real, just aliens from another realm. A year ago, Thor came to Earth, it's how we found all of this out. Now, however, his brother Loki has come to Earth, and not with nice intentions. He attacked a SHIELD facility and brainwashed a few good men with this scepter of his. He leveled an entire base and then disappeared with an object called the Tesseract."</p><p>Harry took a moment to take everything in. Okay, so the gods that he had been raised hearing stories about were all real; the nine realms were real. They were actually just aliens, and now one of them (Loki, who had always been one of Harry's favorites, for some reason) had invaded Earth, mind controlled a few people, and then disappeared. Plus, he had the Tesseract, which Harry had heard of through the magical community. It was a big deal.</p><p>"Alright," Harry said slowly. "I still don't see what this has to do with me. There are millions of powerful magic-users in the world, Agent Coulson; why did you choose me out of all of them?"</p><p>"We were searching for Loki through various countries' agencies when your name popped up on our server. Eighty-six percent facial match to Loki. Plus, you are incredibly skilled at magic. Adding all of this together, along with your mysterious appearance on Earth when you were three years old and the story about Loki's child Thor told us when he was on Earth, we have come to the conclusion that you are Loki's son."</p><hr/><p>Harry's magic had always been different from everyone else's. While wizards and witches<strike>   </strike>like his parents<strike>   </strike>needed wands to do magic, and Casters needed words and spells to do magic, Harry had never needed any of that. All he needed was intent, and he could make it happen. If we wanted a feather to float, the feather would float; if he wanted to blast someone backwards, he would blast someone backwards.</p><p>He could do so many things that others couldn't. He could cast illusions, making people see whatever he wanted them to. He could teleport, which very few magic-users could actually do. He could waltz through people's dreams, even create dreams to send to people. There were so many things that he could do that made no sense to regular magic-users.</p><p>Now here he was, with a man telling him he was the son of a god. A magic-using god. A <em>Mage. </em>And didn't that word just fit him? Didn't all of this craziness just make sense? He wasn't of Earth<strike>   </strike>of <em>Midgard</em><strike>   </strike>but from Asgard instead. He didn't have human magic, he had Seidr. Everything clicked into place, and Harry <em>knew </em>that this was true. He <em>knew </em>that he was Loki's son. The only thing he didn't know was why he had been abandoned on Midgard fourteen years ago.</p><p>So he followed the SHIELD agents. He followed them to the roof of his apartment building<strike>   </strike>sending a message to Ron to tell him that everything was fine and that he'd be gone for a bit<strike>   </strike>and into an almost-invisible aircraft (apparently called a quinjet), which them lifted into the air, headed towards America. Agent Coulson gave him a file and Harry dutifully read it.</p><p>It was filled with reports on the people he'd be working with, like Tony Stark (Harry knew who Iron Man was), Bruce Banner (yup, he knew about him, too) and Steve Rogers (come on, <em>of course </em>Harry knew who Captain America was!). Harry was even given information about when Thor had visited (see: banished to) Earth the year previous, and Harry felt his chest tighten at the information about the Destroyer that his father<strike>   </strike>his <em>father!</em><strike>   </strike>sent.</p><p>Four hours later (quinjets were seriously fast) they landed on the top of a <em>flying </em>aircraft carrier. If Harry wasn't already impressed, he certainly was now.</p><p>Agents Coulson and Romanov led him across the deck and then inside, leading him through a maze of hallways until they reached a control center. There was a large wall of window that looked out at the sky. If you walked down some steps you would reach rows of people working diligently at different computers. Right in front of where Harry had walked out was a table that looked like it belonged in a conference room.</p><p>Sitting at the conference table were two men, one blonde and bulky, the other black-haired and smaller, almost hunching in on himself. Harry easily recognized these two as Steve Rogers and Bruce Banner, and they both looked up as Harry and the two agents entered.</p><p>"Dr. Banner, Captain Rogers, it's good to meet you, I've heard a lot about your work," Harry said with a polite smile, offering his hand. Both men stood and shook it, even if they looked slightly confused.</p><p>"I'm sorry, I don't know who you are," Captain Rogers said apologetically. "I thought they had told me about everyone they were bringing in." Dr. Banner voiced a similar sentiment.</p><p>"It's completely alright. My name is Harry Potter, I was brought in for my magical abilities and my...<em>unique </em>perspective on the Loki issue."</p><p>"Magical ability?" Dr. Banner asked, eyebrows furrowing.</p><p>Harry couldn't help the smile that over took his features. "Yes, Dr. Banner, you heard me right. I'm a Mage, a special kind of magic-user. SHIELD thought it would be good to fight fire with fire, as it were."</p><p>Before either of the other men could reply, a SHIELD agent turned around and looked at Agent Coulson. "Sir! We've found him. He's in Stuttgart, Germany; a laptop camera picked him up outside a gala event. I have the coordinates for you, Sir."</p><p>Agent Coulson nodded, then turned to face Agent Romanov with a tight smile. "Natasha, find yourself a pilot and bring Captain Rogers and Mr. Potter to go get Loki. I expect you there and back in record time." Agent Romanov nodded and turned around, walking away. She motioned for Harry and Captain Rogers to follow her, and the two men did so, scrambling after her.</p><p>Both Agent Romanov and Captain Rogers suited up, the red-haired woman pulled on a leather jumpsuit and glowing bracelets that looked like they packed a punch, the Captain in his signature Captain America outfit. Harry, himself, pulled his dragon-skin robes out of the bag he had brought with him. He’d had the robes made specially for battle in Diagon Alley years ago, and he had worn them many times over since buying them. He knew they would serve him well here.</p><p>The quinjet ride felt impossibly long with the three people feeling so antsy, and it was close to nine o'clock when they finally reached Stuttgart, Germany. As they pulled the quinjet up above the art museum black tie gala event, they saw Loki standing above a crowd of kneeling people. The god pointed his scepter at an elderly man standing defiantly, and Captain Rogers was quick to jump off the back of the jet, landing in front of the old man and effectively saving his life.</p><p>Harry was about to teleport himself down to join the stand off that was quickly turning into a fight, when Agent Romanov stopped him, telling him that they didn't want to give away his presence just yet. So instead, Harry watched from the sky with narrowed eyes as Captain America fought Loki. The Captain was soon joined by Iron Man<strike>   </strike>who took over the quinjet's speakers to blare ACDC<strike>   </strike>and together the two heroes took down Loki. All Harry could think was how it had been <em>way </em>too easy to take a master of Seidr down, and he filed that thought away for later.</p><p>As Captain Rogers and Mr. Stark spoke once back on the quinjet, Harry approached Loki, not quite meeting his eyes in respect but refusing to act afraid. "I'm going to bind your magic," Harry explained quietly as he rose his hands over Loki's own. After a few seconds, a green glow appeared then faded, revealing magical handcuffs locking Loki's wrists together. It put a weight on Loki's magic so that the Asgardian couldn't use it without extreme difficulty. It wouldn't stop him completely, but it was better than nothing.</p><p>Loki glanced down at his wrists, twisting them in the bindings, then looked up at Harry with a mixture of curiosity and annoyance. He opened his mouth as if he was about to say something, then looked worriedly at the ceiling as thunder boomed across the sky. The Captain made a wisecrack about Loki being afraid of lightning, and the god replied with, "I'm not overly fond of what follows."</p><p>Harry's eyes widened and he whipped around to face the Captain and Mr. Stark. "Thor," he said urgently. Just then, there was a bang from above, and Stark's faceplate snapped down. The back of the quinjet popped open and a large blonde man appeared, eyes zoning in on Loki. The man<strike>   </strike>who couldn't be anyone except Thor<strike>   </strike>grabbed Loki and the two flew out the back of the quinjet.</p><p>Harry didn't hesitate to dive out the back of the plane, using his powers to keep himself in the air long enough to follow the two gods. When he saw them land on a cliff's edge, Harry teleported to them from midair, something he would definitely pat himself on the back for later.</p><p>When Harry appeared suddenly, the two men (aliens?) stopped their conversation and looked at him with annoyance and surprise. "Prince Thor," Harry said peacefully, "I know you are here to bring Loki to justice, but he has taken <em>good men </em>hostage and we don't know where they are. He has plans to hurt this world, and we need to know what they are so that we can stop it. Please, let me bring him back with me. You can come with us, of course."</p><p>Thor seemed to relax a bit, still looking at Harry a bit warily, but he let go of Loki and nodded. Harry smiled, about to propose the idea of returning to the quinjet, when suddenly Thor was gone, being thrown from the cliff by a flying Iron Man.</p><p>Harry cursed. "For Merlin's sake, can't anyone be reasonable around here?" he muttered under his breath. Going by Loki's smirk, the trickster had heard him. Harry pressed the communication device in his ear. "Agent Romanov, can you bring the quinjet around? I have a feeling the boys' pissing contest might last a while, and I'd rather have Loki back on the plane before anything else happens."</p><p>Agent Romanov replied in the affirmative, and soon the quinjet was hovering above the cliff where the two Mages stood. Harry grabbed Loki's arm and teleported the both of them back onto the quinjet. Harry suddenly realized that the colors and tree that he had always seen, and was seeing now, whilst teleporting was most definitely the branches of Yggdrasil.</p><p>They waited patiently on the quinjet for about five minutes until Captain Rogers called for a pickup, and then the three men joined them on the flight, all looking slightly ruffled. The rest of the ride was uneventful, though both Thor and Loki kept looking at Harry with un-hidden curiosity. Harry did his best to ignore it, not wanting to give away his trump card just yet.</p><p>Soon enough the group arrived back at the Helicarrier. Loki was escorted to a glass prison cell by a squad of SHIELD agents, and then teased Director Fury (and made a jab at Dr. Banner, which bothered Harry) while the one-eyed man acted far too cocky about having captured Loki, especially considering the fact that there was a high chance that Loki let himself get brought in for some plan they didn't know about yet.</p><p>The mix-matched group of people sat around the conference table in the control center as Thor told them about Loki's army, the Chitauri, and how he planned to try and conquer the Earth. Harry voiced his concern about the fact that Loki had clearly let them take him, but it was dismissed by Dr. Banner, who said that they shouldn't be focusing on Loki. When Dr. Banner insulted Loki, Thor tried to defend him, but backed down when confronted with his brother's actions.</p><p>Dr. Banner asked about why they needed the iridium, and then Mr. Stark entered with Agent Coulson, saying that it was a stabilizing agent, explaining that it would keep the portal from collapsing in on itself and allow it to remain open indefinitely. Harry saw the billionaire attach something to Director Fury's set of computers, but decided to file that piece of information away for later.</p><p>Captain Rogers asked if there was any particular power source that was needed to fuel the portal, and Dr. Banner replied with, "he'd have to heat the cube to a hundred and twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier," to which both Mr. Stark and Harry nodded along.</p><p>While Harry had spent most of his life primarily in the wizarding world, he’d still gotten a regular muggle education as well, because not knowing past-basic math or history or science seemed wrong to him. He’d especially liked science, and went into advanced studies of it<strike>   </strike>he could easily understand what the two other men were talking about.</p><p>"Unless Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunnelling effect," Mr. Stark replied, walking closer to Dr. Banner.</p><p>Harry frowned and looked at the two men and said, "Well, if he could do that, he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet."</p><p>The two older men turned and looked at Harry in surprise, and Harry just smirked. "Finally, people who speak English," Mr. Stark muttered. He then went on to introduce himself to Harry and Dr. Banner, telling them both to call him Tony and teasing Dr. Banner about his...<em>condition.</em> Director Fury entered and instructed both Dr. Banner and Tony to start looking for the cube, which they both left to do.</p><p>Harry prepared himself, knowing that he was the one who would have to go and speak with Loki.</p>
