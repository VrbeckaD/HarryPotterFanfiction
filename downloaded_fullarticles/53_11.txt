  <strong>Hello all! I am 'The Wasp' (there's a backstory behind the name lol) and this is my first time posting on this site. I have an account on FF as well if you want to check it out but I wanted to try my hand here. I'll get straight to it, this is my attempt writing a good story about a very subpar mobile game lol. Hogwarts Mystery is annoying in many ways- energy, gems, wait times, bad characterization with certain characters, etc. But even with all of that, I found myself falling in love with the concept, plot, and characters. It helps that it's part of the HP universe but this is also my first attempt at creating an original character. This game and story is the perfect avenue for it. I will say right now, that while I use the game plot as a base for what will happen I'm not following it to the letter. Too many inconsistencies. But I really hope you all like it. This is the first year out of all seven I will be writing (even though the game hasn't finished yet lol). Anyway, enough of my rambling. Enjoy and rock on! Updates coming frequently!</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>A boy of average build, bright hazel eyes, dark brown hair, and a naturally illuminated face took in the scene around him.</p><p>David Grant couldn’t help but marvel at the sheer grandiosity of the institution he would be calling ‘home’ for the next seven years of his young life.</p><p>Jacob had been right. You really had to see Hogwarts to believe it.</p><p>So overwhelmed was the young wizard, he almost forgot to pay attention to a rather stern looking late middle aged witch dressed in light green robes and a tall pointed hat. Though not frightening, she certainly gave off the impression of being ‘no nonsense.’</p><p>“Welcome to Hogwarts,” she said in a short, brisk tone. “I am Professor McGonagall. Before you take your seats, we must sort you into your houses. There are four houses of which you may be selected- Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin, each one representing a characteristic or trait. Be aware that these houses will be something of a second family to each of you. Faithful deeds and achievements will earn points, while dissidence and failure to act accordingly will result in the loss of said points.”</p><p>She paused for a brief moment, as if entertaining the notion any of the bright eyed first years in front of her might be brave enough to ask a question.</p><p>“Now, I will call each of you by name and when prompted will come up to the stool to be sorted.”</p><p>David, young and inexperienced as he was, knew this much. Jacob had told him about that part when he was a little kid…before he had disappeared that was.</p><p>Jacob was the teasing sort of older brother, not a bully, but also the type that never withheld a chance to remind his sibling just how ‘little’ he was. Therefore, whenever he had questions about Hogwarts, he wouldn’t get very many specific answers. Practically a hero in his eyes, David’s ignorance of his brother’s true machinations while at Hogwarts remained unknown to him until the Daily Prophet ran its headline one fateful morning. Only then did big questions about what he had been up to form in his mind.</p><p>Even so, David knew enough about Hogwarts that the place was HUGE and from the looks of things that wasn’t the only impressive aspect of it. A nighttime sky hung over like a vast sparkling canopy of stars and constellations, candles hung in the air, suspended in place by some spell he did not yet know (his parents had been rather strict on no magic outside of school). But he was also aware of the prying eyes of the older students, even ones not even a year older than him. The brother of Jacob Grant wasn’t stupid. He knew the moment his name was called, the whispers and pointing would commence. Fortunately, he knew how to deflect such gossip- be quick with a joke and a smile.</p><p><em>Disarm them before they even get a chance</em>, he thought to himself, easing out a breath he had been holding for a little longer than previously realized.</p><p>His thoughts were interrupted by a loud, raspy voice that seemed to originate from a dusty, brown looking hat.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Come on and see</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You were meant to be</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And my job quite key</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>To peer inside</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Look and find</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Which house you will reside</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The lion’s den</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Or Slytherin?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Either one will do</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Perhaps Ravenclaw?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>A badger’s crawl?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Which one is for you?</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>So don’t be shy</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The time is nigh</em>
</p><p>
  <em>To begin your schooling days</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Let’s have a chat</em>
</p><p>
  <em>About all that</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And send you on your way</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>The song was quite short, but the rest of the students began clapping loudly as if it were the greatest hymn in the world. He could hear a red headed boy next to him mutter, “So that’s what Bill meant by a song.”</p><p>In any case, the sorting began without another moment as Professor McGonagall began reading out the names.</p><p>‘Badeea Ali’</p><p>A girl wearing a kind of strange scarf covering over her head David had never seen before walked towards the stool where McGonagall placed the hat on her head. It only took a matter of seconds before it called out ‘RAVENCLAW’</p><p>The third table from the right erupted in cheers as the girl gave a bright smile and headed towards her seat.</p><p>‘Charles Billingsley’</p><p>An awkward looking blonde boy with shoulder length hair shuffled on over and did the same as Badeea Ali. The hat took longer this time, but only just slightly.</p><p>‘HUFFLEPUFF’</p><p>The fourth table to the left erupted in cheers.</p><p>‘Ben Copper’</p><p>If the previous boy had appeared awkward, this one was downright terrified. He was sandy haired, with brown eyes, and a body language that practically reeked he didn’t want to be here in the slightest. Nevertheless, he took his place on the stool.</p><p>This time, the hat wasn’t so decisive. It took its time and the longer it stood on the boy’s head the more frightened he became. After what seemed like close to two minutes it finally belted out loud.</p><p>‘GRYFFINDOR’</p><p>The third table to the left immediately stood and hollered, notably much louder than the other two tables had. David knew that was the house Jacob belonged to and it had a reputation for bravery and boldness- that or obnoxiousness depending on who you asked. Jacob, ever the daredevil was a perfect fit, until the day he was expelled of course, in which he became vilified forever. He idlely wondered if he was destined for the same house as his brother.</p><p>After a tall black boy named Andre Egwu was sorted into Ravenclaw it was his turn to be sorted.</p><p>‘David Grant’</p><p>On cue, the whisperings and gossip began.</p><p>“Did McGonagall just say ‘Grant’?”</p><p>“Is that the brother of the guy who went missing?”</p><p>“I heard he went crazy trying to break some curse.”</p><p>He gave no outward sign the chatter bothered him, instead casually hopping the steps towards the stool. It may have been his imagination but he swore he saw some of the Professors at the head table give some whisperings as well. Professor McGonagall, however, gave the smallest of smiles, a gesture that David appreciated. He could do this. He’d made it this far hadn’t he? He wasn’t about to back down.</p><p>Feeling the hat being placed on his head, a quieter version of the noisy rasp entered his mind as though it were coming from his own conscious.</p><p>
  <em>Well THIS is interesting. You are David Grant, the brother of Jacob.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>‘That’s my name last time I checked.’</em>
</p><p>He hoped the attempt at levity wouldn’t be missed by that hat. Indeed, the old piece of topwear seemed to be amused in its tone.</p><p>
  <em>Apple didn’t fall far from the tree did it? And not just in terms of humor. He too, was difficult to sort.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>‘We’re not entirely alike. For example, I happen to know I’m much better looking.’</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You are quite the young wizard, aren’t you Mr. Grant? I see great things in your future, indeed. The only question is where to place you. </em>
</p><p>David thought for a moment, briefly unsure himself. Though not averse to any house in particular (except Slytherin), he could remember the crimson and gold colors that adorned Jacob’s room when they played together. Being a Gryffindor was a sense of pride for both brothers, but the question was, would they have him if the hat chose as such?</p><p><em>You worry what they’ll think of you? </em>The hat probed.</p><p>
  <em>‘Who wouldn’t? Doesn’t mean I’m going to act like a bloody prat am I?’</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Indeed, you have quite the determination, Mr. Grant. The mind is keen and you certainly don’t lack ambition despite your dislike of Slytherin.</em>
</p><p>David’s heart skipped a beat. The hat really wouldn’t put him there, would it?</p><p><em>But I think your intentions are quite clear. Best of luck in </em>GRYFFINDOR!</p><p>The third table from the right, rather than shunning him, hollered and whooped as loud as ever as Professor McGonagall lifted the hat, allowing him to join his newfound companions. Several shook his hand, and although a few were a bit apprehensive, the response was by and large a positive one as a great relief fell from his shoulders.</p><p>The rest of the sorting seemed to go by quicker after that. Various first years, most of whom he didn’t recognize, were assigned to their respective houses. The good news was that Rowan, the only friend he had made thus far, was also sorted into Gryffindor and he happily plopped down beside him. The last to go was an olive skinned boy named Talbott Winger, who went to Ravenclaw.</p><p>Soon afterwards the murmur of the crowd hushed into nothingness as tall man with a long white beard and royal purple robes stepped to the podium. David didn’t need anyone to tell him who this was- Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and the most powerful wizard of his time.</p><p>“Welcome all, to another fantastic year at Hogwarts!” he said in a clear but calming tone that indicated a great deal of warmth yet also wisdom. “To our returning students I say ‘welcome back’, to our newest students I say, we are all quite pleased to see you here. Now, I could continue with an old man’s babble but for now the only statement I wish to say is this- enjoy.”</p><p>Food practically sprouted from the plates themselves as an array of dishes were eagerly fed upon by the hungry teens and preteens in their midst.</p><p>For his part, David was quite thrilled. Nothing could beat his mum’s cooking back home but this definitely appeared to be a close second. Without wasting any time, he dug into some chicken and mashed potatoes.</p><p>“I can’t believe this, Dave!” Rowan nudged him excitedly. “We’re both in Gryffindor. And from what I’ve read, mealtimes happen exactly like these three times a day!”</p><p>“At least someone’s excited,” moaned the boy across from them, whom David recognized as Ben Copper from the sorting. “I’m not even sure I belong here.”</p><p>“You belong here,” cut across another voice near them and they turned to see a tall, lanky red headed boy with shoulder length hair giving them an encouraging smile. “Anyone sorted into this house is here for a reason. My name is Bill, Bill Weasley.”</p><p>He extended his hand which all three boys took, even Ben.</p><p>“Thanks, Bill,” Dave thanked. “I take it you’re no first year.”</p><p>“Third,” he laughed. “So I’m not that far off from where you are. But if you have any questions let me know. Hogwarts can be a little bit intimidating at first.”</p><p>David could tell Rowan was already awestruck and it wasn’t hard to see why. Anyone observing Bill could tell he embodied a very laid back, cool personality, one that was bound to attract other students, especially impressionable ones like Rowan.</p><p>“By the way, this is my little brother, Charlie,” Bill said indicating another red haired boy, one who was much shorter and stouter and had a mouth full of chicken leg. Nevertheless, he smiled and shook everyone’s hand as well.</p><p>“Yu dun haf to ca me iffle ah no,” he said through his stuffed face.</p><p>“Easy does it there, Charlie. Mum will have my head if you choke on your first day.”</p><p>The younger Weasley gave an enormous swallow and replied more clearly.</p><p>“I said, you don’t have to call me little, you know. I’m only two years younger. And what was that rubbish about a song?”</p><p>“What do you mean, rubbish? It was true wasn’t it?”</p><p>“Yeah but you made it seem like a weird test or something.”</p><p>“Didn’t want to spoil the surprise,” Bill winked. “Anyway, you’ll be glad it’s just two Weasleys at Hogwarts for now. Believe me when I say our family is quite the crowd.”</p><p>David laughed as he nudged Rowan.</p><p>“Told ya it wasn’t going to be so bad.”</p><p>“We got sorted into the best house too!” he replied enthusiastically. “I can’t wait to dig into the entire extensive history of Godric Gryffindor!”</p><p>“How bout saving the books until tomorrow?” David teased. “Have a leg.”</p><p>“Don’t mind if I do!”</p><p>The meal continued for another hour or so while the students stuffed themselves to their hearts content. By the time it was over, David had more than his fill and was feeling a tad lethargic.</p><p>The leftovers vanished and this time Dumbledore reappeared at the podium.</p><p>“Another excellent feast if I do say so myself,” he said cheerfully. “However, before I send you off to bed, I must make a few annual announcements. The first, to our first years, the Forbidden Forest is strictly out of bounds to any student of any age here. The second, is Mr. Filch, our caretaker has updated his list of banned items to one hundred and twelve at last count. Anyone desiring to know the specifics can see the posting on his door. Be on the lookout for Quidditch tryouts which Madam Hooch will be post to the board in a couple weeks’ time.</p><p>“Lastly, I would like to extend a personal word to all of you. It has been three years since Voldemort’s defeat, and we are currently living in a time of extraordinary peace. But even peacetime can bring its own challenges. I implore you all to take the opportunity that many did not receive for many years and take advantage of what this place can offer you, both as a student and as a person.”</p><p>With that, he clapped his hands twice.</p><p>“Off to bed you go. Prefects, please escort the first years to their dormitories.”</p><p>And with that the crowd of students made for the Great Hall exit, the first years hanging back to find their respective prefects.</p><p>“Gryffindor first-years!” a female voice called out. “Over here!”</p><p>The ten combined male and female students rushed around a teenage black girl of average height and build, her prefect badge glistening with authority.</p><p>“I’m Angelica Cole,” she said kindly. “I’ll be your prefect this year and as such it’s my job to make sure you know your way around while simultaneously preparing you for life here at Hogwarts. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask. Follow me.”</p><p>She proceeded to give them a grand tour, purposefully lagging behind the other students, whose knowledge of the castle was no doubt sufficient to find their respective dormitories.</p><p>“Be aware that the staircases change constantly,” she explained to them as they made their way to Gryffindor Tower. “Some of them have trick steps, while others move during certain times in the day. Once you get your class schedule, memorizing it will be helpful in navigating them.”</p><p>“That sounds scary,” Ben spoke aloud softly.</p><p>“It’s no big deal once you get used to it and find your way around,” Angelica smiled.</p><p>David for his part, wasn’t overly concerned as he peered over the railing.</p><p>“Wonder what would happen if you dropped a rotten apple from this far up,” he cracked while Rowan, Charlie, and another Gryffindor boy snickered.</p><p>“Moving on,” Angelica said clearing her throat. “You’ll find that there is a unique way of entering Gryffindor Tower. I cannot stress enough that no one is allowed to bring a member of another house into our common room.”</p><p>Soon enough they came across a portrait of a rather plump lady in a pink dress who seemed to be expecting them.</p><p>“Password?”</p><p>“Carpe Vinum.”</p><p>The portrait swung open, revealing an entrance way to a much larger room. Inside was a sight not quite as grandiose as the one in the Great Hall but no less intriguing- the common area consisted of an assortment of comfy armchairs, pillows, couches, and fireplaces, complete with desks and a bulletin board. Upon the mantle sat the portrait of a lion, surrounded by many large windows that had a view of the grounds down below.</p><p>All in all, it was better than David ever could have hoped.</p><p>“This is the common room, where you are free to study, play games, or relax as you see fit,” Angelica told them. “Upstairs are your dormitories with boys being on the left and girls on the right. Speaking of which, it is late, and you all have classes tomorrow. Please come to me if you have any other questions. Good night!”</p><p>They did as instructed and were almost to their respective rooms when the first test of Hogwarts confronted David Grant. A third year, returning from brushing his teeth took a sour look in his direction and remarked.</p><p>“I can’t believe they let you in here. Especially after your mad brother almost single handedly ruined us.”</p><p>David, for his part, was not one to be offended easily, even when it came to snide remarks about his brother. He had heard it his whole life, but Rowan of course did not know this.</p><p>“Back off!” he shouted at the third year. “David’s going to be one of the best Gryffindors there ever was.”</p><p>Touched by the display, he knew Rowan getting beat up on the first night at Hogwarts wasn’t in anyone’s best interests. Best to laugh it off in the best way he knew how.</p><p>“It’s okay, Rowan. Look at the bright side, I could be in this house and look like freckles here at the same time.”</p><p>That brought another round of laughter, including some from inside the third year dormitory.</p><p>The boy flushed red and muttered something that sounded like ‘first years’ before slamming the door shut.</p><p>“That’s the way to handle a bloke like that,” David said to Rowan. “Humor is a great tool to have at your disposal.”</p><p>“Can you teach me?”</p><p>“It’s more of a natural skill if you ask me.”</p><p>Truth be told, however, that kind of deflection was years in the making, a constant practice of hiding his true feelings on the subject. Because reality was, despite being able to laugh off most things that came his way, there was still a longing within the recesses of his heart. He loved his brother and would give anything to see him again. Hogwarts wasn’t just the start of a second home, it seemed as though it gave new life and possibility to find out what happened to Jacob.</p><p>His mother’s words echoed to stymie that notion.</p><p>
  <em>‘David John Grant, listen to me. Your father and I do not want you going on some ludicrous adventure to find your brother or these cursed vaults he was supposedly after. Do you understand me?’</em>
</p><p>
  <em>‘Mom…’</em>
</p><p>
  <em>‘Do you understand me?’</em>
</p><p>In the end he acquiesced to mum’s demands because one did not tell a witch like Heather Grant ‘no’. When she meant business, you had best adhere her words.</p><p>That didn’t make them any easier to follow, however.</p><p>“Hey, Dave.”</p><p>He saw Charlie nod towards him as he put up a poster.</p><p>“Don’t pay any of these people any kind of attention. If they’re going to blame you for what happened with your brother, they’re dumber than a sack of dragon dung.”</p><p>David nodded in appreciation.</p><p>“Thanks, Charlie. Speaking of dragons, that’s quite a poster you got there.”</p><p>“Isn’t it amazing?” the red head said proudly, as the photo of the Hungarian Horntail moved about menacingly, occasionally breathing fire. “Someday I’d like to train one of those beauties.”</p><p>“I’ll stick with safer jobs,” another voice interjected. “Namely things people actually want.”</p><p>An Asian preteen extended his arm out as David took it.</p><p>“Jae Kim at your service. I’ve already taken a brief glance at Filch’s list and I sense an opportunity. You know what they say when something’s been banned.”</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>“A market develops for it. And I’ve got my eye on items I suspect the student body will be keen to get their hands on.”</p><p>Charlie chuckled, while Ben pulled the blankets over his head, not wanting to hear about anything that was possibly illegal.</p><p>“Good night, Dave.”</p><p>“Good night, everyone.”</p><p>Soon, the light was extinguished and the boys on their way to sleep. For his part, David couldn’t help but think back to Dumbledore’s speech. Was he warning them in some way? Or merely issuing a challenge? Either way he didn’t feel up to it, even with the hoopla surrounding him and his brother.</p><p>Achieving some measure of content, aided by the still large amount of food in his belly, the eleven year old drifted off into a dreamless sleep.</p>
