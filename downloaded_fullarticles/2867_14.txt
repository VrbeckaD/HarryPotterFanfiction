    <p>Seamus searched for the perfect train car. He had expectations. (He had been sharing those expectations with his mam for weeks.) If he didn't meet anybody interesting in the train car, he would be extremely disappointed and probably cursed for life. </p><p>"Oh, are you a first year, sweetie?" A girl with long black hair smiled at him as he stopped by the first car. "Oh, isn't he little?"</p><p>This last question was directed to the two boys in the car. They were both freckled and red-haired, sporting identical grins. </p><p>One grinned at the other. "Hi. I'm Gred."</p><p>"And I'm Forge!"</p><p>"Our brother's name is Ron."</p><p>"But he likes to go by..."</p><p>"Ickle Ronnykins," they chorused. </p><p>Seamus nodded, already backing out. "I'll keep that in mind," he lied. </p><p>"Hey, kid!"</p><p>"Yeah?" Seamus asked curiously. </p><p>One boy winked. "We make some cool stuff," he said. </p><p>"Illegal stuff," the other whispered. </p><p>"But if you don't get caught..." Gred (or maybe Forge?) snapped his fingers and turned his twin's hair bright blue. </p><p>"You can have loads of fun," said the blue-haired brother finished. He tossed a pinch of silvery powder onto his hair that turned it back to orange-red. "Just don't tell Filch," he whispered with a wink. </p><p>Seamus nodded with a grin, despite not knowing who Filch was. </p><p>The next car contained a group of girls. One was clutching a broom possessively. A few were ranting on about the most recent Quidditch game. One was studying a book called Quidditch Tactics: How To Not Die A Painful Death. </p><p>Seamus itched to talk about Quidditch, but he kept going. Hopefully there would be a car of first years soon. </p><p>"It's just like the books!" A girl exclaimed from around the corner. "You see, I read about the train in Hogwarts: A History."</p><p>Seamus followed the sound of her voice. There was a girl with bushy brown hair and a huge book in her arms. She was already wearing a her school uniform. "Oh, hello," she greeted. "I'm Hermione Granger." Hermione shifted the book to her hip and held out a hand confidently. "And you are?"</p><p>Seamus shook her hand. "I'm Seamus Finnigan."</p><p>"Nice to meet you. Are you a first year? I am. I'm absolutely thrilled to see Hogwarts for the first time, aren't you? Unless you've already seen it. But even then, you may-"</p><p>"I'm a first year," Seamus interrupted quickly. "But I've seen my mam's pictures."</p><p>"So they move? That's fascinating. You know, my family isn't magical, so we aren't used to such things. I've been reading all about the wizarding world. Did you know that Gertrude Bungle invented sixteen different spells to purify water? It depends what's in the water, you see."</p><p>Seamus blew out a frustrated breath when he realized she was just going to keep talking. "I'll see you later, then," he muttered. Hermione didn't seem to notice when Seamus left. </p><p>"Oh, good! Another first year!" exclaimed somebody in one of the nearby compartments. </p><p>Seamus's face brightened. He reached a train compartment that held two boys around his age. One was pale and chubby, with trusting eyes and a somewhat naive air about him. The other had medium brown skin, a lean, athletic build, and a slight smile on his face. </p><p>"Oh, hi! I'm Neville!" The boy with wide eyes waved childishly. "What's your name?"</p><p>"Seamus Finnigan." Seamus grinned in his easy, good-natured way. </p><p>The other boy, the one who hadn't spoken yet, glanced up. "I'm Dean. Would you like to sit with us?" </p><p>"Yeah, that's be great." Seamus took a seat across from Dean and next to Neville. "Is that a toad, Neville?" he asked, leaning over to look a a strange greenish lump sticking out of Neville's pocket. </p><p>Neville nodded, taking the toad out carefully. "His name is Trevor."</p><p>"That's wicked cool," Seamus breathed. "Is he poisonous?"</p><p>Neville's face turned blotchy red. "Poisonous! Of course not." He clutched Trevor tighter. </p><p>"Oh." Seamus looked rather put out, but he wasn't one to become easily discouraged. "What about you, Dean?"</p><p>"A poisonous toad? No, I don't have one. Is that a wizard thing?"</p><p>Seamus shrugged. "No, not really. Mam has an owl. Aren't you a wizard?"</p><p>"Yeah. I mean, they say I am. But my mum isn't, so I don't really know much about all this."</p><p>Neville nodded kindly. "That's okay. I grew up in a wizarding family, and they thought I was a Squib!"</p><p>Seamus laughed, eyes widening. "Really?"</p><p>"Yeah. My gran wasn't even sure that I'd get a letter. But here I am!"</p><p>Dean bit his lip. "What's a Squib?"</p><p>"It's somebody with wizard parents who doesn't have magic," Seamus explained. "Really rare. I've never met one."</p><p>"I have," Neville told them. "In a family as big as mine, you're bound to meet one."</p><p>"What's your last name?" Seamus asked curiously. Something in Neville's smile was familiar. </p><p>Neville stared down at his hands for a moment. "Longbottom."</p><p>In any other situation, Seamus would have found this outrageously funny. Now, he just smiled triumphantly. "I knew I recognized you!" he exclaimed. </p><p>"What?"  </p><p>"Your mother's name is Alice Longbottom, isn't it?"</p><p>Neville's face crease into a worried frown. "What do you know about my mum?" he asked quietly. </p><p>"Nothing. She was a friend of my mam's back at Hogwarts. You sort of favor her, don't you?"</p><p>"Not anymore," Neville answered forcefully. Seamus knew not to press the subject. </p><p>Dean cleared his throat, breaking the tense silence. "Do both of you have magical parents, then?"</p><p>"I come from a wizarding family," Neville answered. </p><p>"Mam is a witch, but my dad is a Muggle — that's what we call non-magical folk." Seamus grinned. "It was a bit of a shock for him!"</p><p>Dean laughed, but Neville's eyes went wide. "Your mum married a Muggle?"</p><p>"Yeah, what of it?" Seamus sounded defensive. </p><p>"Just... that's when he was around." </p><p>"You-Know-Who? Yeah, that was a bit of a problem." </p><p>Dean was trying to follow the conversation. "Wait, who's You-Know-Who? And what does he have to do with anything?"</p><p>Neville shook his head. "I shouldn't have mentioned it," he said nervously. </p><p>"He's going to learn eventually," Seamus countered. Still, the typically rash eleven-year-old waited until Neville nodded in permission.</p><p>"You're scaring me a little," admitted Dean as Seamus fixed him with a solemn gaze. </p><p>Neville stood abruptly, his toad dropping onto the floor. "I'm going to go take Trevor on a walk," he said, prodding the greenish lump with his toe until it hopped out the door. "I'll see you guys later."</p><p>Dean watched Neville with concern. "Do toads typically go on walks?"</p><p>"People don't like talking about You-Know-Who," Seamus explained. "He'll come back when storytime is over.”</p><p>"You see, before we were born, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named ran around everywhere with his followers. They-"</p><p>"I'm sorry," Dean interrupted. "But what's his name?"</p><p>"Did you not listen? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?"</p><p>"But what is it?" Dean insisted. </p><p>"I don't know," Seamus admitted. "Mam would never tell me and nobody who remembers will say it either."</p><p>Dean frowned, frustrated, but waved Seamus on. "Keep going."</p><p>"So anyway, he and his followers thought that purebloods were the best. Like, the old wizarding families. And they absolutely hated Muggle-Borns."</p><p>"Like me."</p><p>Seamus flushed red. "Yeah. So, they hated Muggles and Muggle-Borns, as well as people who supported Muggles and Muggle-Borns. And they would go around killing and torturing those people."</p><p>Dean looked at Seamus, eyes wide, obviously intrigued. "They're gone, though. Right?"</p><p>"Oh, yeah. It's fine now. I mean, there are still some jerks, but You-Know-Who has disappeared."</p><p>Dean nodded. "How?"</p><p>"He tried to kill Harry Potter. And then... we don't know. He died, vanished, something. Anyway, he's not around anymore."</p><p>"Good."</p><p>Seamus smiled. "Yeah. Good. But hey, don't bring it up. It's kind of a sensitive subject. Especially because the older kids probably remember it."</p><p>Dean frowned. "How long ago was this? When your parents were young, right?"</p><p>Seamus shrugged. "Harry Potter is our age. The one who stopped You-Know-Who as a baby. So... it stopped maybe ten years ago?"</p><p>"A baby? I thought you were talking about an adult!"</p><p>"That's why it's so weird. He could kill a bunch of full-grown, powerful wizards but not a baby." Seamus delighted in Dean's stunned expression. "Crazy stuff, huh?"</p><p>Dean nodded, eyes wide. "He'll be in our classes, then? Since he's our age?"</p><p>"If he goes to Hogwarts at all." Seamus lowered his voice conspiratorially. "I hear they've been keeping him hidden in a dragon's cave."</p><p>"Wicked," Dean breathed, looking appropriately impressed. "So this Harry Potter isn't that short, pale kid?"</p><p>It was Seamus's turn to be confused. "Neville?"</p><p>"No. He had black hair. Super skinny, kinda big clothes. There were a couple guys talking to him. They seemed surprised that his name was Harry Potter, but I didn't really think much of it." Dean waved a hand toward the window. "Somewhere out there."</p><p>Seamus hopped to his feet, grinning hugely. "Of course you didn't think much of it! You're a Muggle-Born, you wouldn't know. This is great!" He was pacing restlessly now. "I hope it was actually him."</p><p>Dean smiled. "Sit down," he said, tugging on Seamus's elbow. "You'll see him soon enough. If it is him, at least."</p><p>Seamus grinned, still breathless from fanboy excitement. “You’re right. So... how do you have a Quidditch jersey?”</p><p>“Quiche?”</p><p>“Quidditch,” Seamus repeated, carefully enunciating. “It’s our sport. You’re wearing Ballycastle colors, but you don’t sound Irish.”</p><p>“Oh. Um, no. This is the jersey for my school football team, back home.” </p><p>Seamus touched the material. “I was wondering. It doesn’t really look like a Quidditch uniform.”</p><p>“What exactly is Quidditch?”</p><p>Seamus grinned. “I thought you’d never ask.”</p>
