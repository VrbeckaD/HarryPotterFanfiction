    <p>Hermione froze outside the train compartment she had just about passed. Like always, Draco Malfoy’s white blonde hair stood out even when you weren’t looking for it. She had noticed him – well, they all had – on the platform while they were waiting for the train. He had stood apart from the rest of the crowd and kept his head down and face carefully blank. It had been Ronald, who they were all realizing lately had a knack for understanding people, who pointed out that Draco had never really looked <em>blank</em> before. He always showcased his emotions, no matter how cruel they were in his youth. Hermione looked in on him now as he sat alone. He was simply staring out the window. Not a twitch of emotion.</p><p>Even in his darkest year they had all been able to read him, watch him fall apart from the sidelines, so seeing him like this sat uncomfortably in Hermione’s chest. She turned back and slowly inched the door open. His eyes snapped to hers though his head didn’t turn in the slightest. He seemed to relax slightly before tensing worse than before. Slowly his head followed his eyes until he was fully facing her.</p><p>“Granger.” He said it so devoid of emotion that Hermione felt she would have been more comfortable had he called her <em>mudblood</em> with a sneer. That at least would be familiar territory.</p><p>“Hi Malfoy,” She replied, “Can I join you?”</p><p>He hesitated and she could see the insults form in his mind. Finally, something she could understand. However, he simply shrugged and turned back to the window.</p><p>Sighing, she slipped in and put up her bags. She took the window seat opposite him and he didn’t object to the proximity. She wordlessly summoned a book from her magically enhanced beaded bag and sat back to get comfortable when she caught him watching her. He flushed and looked away quickly. Of course, a purse with an undetectable extension charm wasn’t typically common, though it was useful, so she didn’t dwell on his curiosity and immersed herself into the world of facts.</p><p>It was several hours later when there was a soft knock on the door. “Any candy from the – oh,” Hermione heard as the door opened. She looked up to see the trolley lady staring wide-eyed at Draco. The fear and hate were clear in her eyes. “Candy… From the trolley?” She forced out, turning completely to look at Hermione.</p><p>“No.” Hermione deadpanned, not feeling especially like being polite in that moment.</p><p>The trolley-lady began to close the door when Hermione had a sudden idea. “Wait! Actually,” She turned to her childhood bully and smiled sweetly. “Draco you like chocolate frogs, right?”</p><p>He started a bit at the use of his given name and didn’t acknowledge her question, but she turned back to the candy-lady anyways. “I’ll take a couple chocolate frogs.”</p><p>The old woman begrudgingly dug a couple of the sweets out and handed them to Hermione before shuffling away.</p><p>“…I don’t really care about chocolate frogs…” Draco said, haltingly.</p><p>“That’s fine,” Hermione responded. “She shouldn’t have ignored you. You’re welcome to have them. I’d just drop them in my bag never to be seen again.”</p><p>Before he could reply, she sunk back into her massive law book but she did notice that he grabbed one after a couple minutes.</p><p>Hermione and Draco stayed silent the entire ride, and then again on the ride up to the castle. Hermione jumped a bit at being able to see the Thestrals, but got over it quickly – having ridden one before. They only separated once they got to the grand hall for the opening feast. Several heads had turned in their direction and the whispers roared throughout the room, but they didn’t even acknowledge each other as they went to opposite ends of the hall to their respective house tables which was sure to dissuade any rumors. Hermione could only hope that little moment of being seen with her would keep the Malfoy heir from being targeted.</p><p>“Hey,” Ginny said without looking up as Hermione sat beside her. <em>The last Weasley of the generation to grace the castle,</em> the thought made Hermione sad. She wished Ron – and Harry – would’ve come back with her for their final year. Her and Ron had called it on their brief fling midway through the summer and luckily it didn’t ruin their friendship at all. In fact, they were closer than ever before now that there weren’t any teenage hormones getting in the way.</p><p>“You disappeared on the train,” Ginny continued, ignorant of the melancholy thoughts that had struck Hermione.</p><p>“Yeah, sorry. I wanted to read somewhere quiet.”</p><p>“That’s fine,” Ginny looked like she was going to say more but Professor – now Headmaster – McGonagall had stood up to welcome them and sort the new first years.</p><p>As the last child was sent to Ravenclaw and the elaborate feast magically appeared on the tables, Hermione noticed the look on the redhead’s face. Ginny was pointedly looking at nothing but the tables surface, even as she reached for the roast potatoes, with her jaw clenched so tight Hermione wasn’t sure she’d be able to eat them.</p><p>“Hey,” She reached over and stopped Ginny from scooping up another spoonful. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“It’s just hard to be back…” Ginny almost met her eye before looking back down. “Bellatrix almost killed me right over there.” She nudged her head in the direction she had almost looked. “I won’t be able to go to the 7<sup>th</sup> floor. I should’ve thought about that when choosing my classes.”</p><p>Hermione’s breath caught and her chest squeezed painfully. She hadn’t even considered what Ginny would feel being back here. Hermione realized that even she subconsciously wouldn’t let her eyes rest on certain spots and she hadn’t lost a family member.</p><p>Hermione steeled herself and looked up. That was the spot where they had laid Lupin, Tonks, and Fred’s bodies during the battle lull. Turning, she looked at the spot where Ginny was almost killed by Bellatrix. <em>The spot where Mrs. Weasley killed Bellatrix,</em> she reminded herself. There was the spot where Neville had killed the snake, Nagini. The spot where Colin Creevey had been laid. The spot where Harry made his final stand. <em>Where Voldemort’s body fell. </em>Hermione would look at all of the spots. Tonight.</p><p>After the feast, as the rest of the students headed to their common rooms, Hermione hung back. She instead went down a path and kneeled at the spot where they had been too late to save Lavender. She went to the Astronomy Tower and remembered Dumbledore. She stared numbly at the spot Harry had told them he was going into the forest to die. She kept the 7<sup>th</sup> floor for last.</p><p>She dragged her feet and took the longest route she could think of but eventually found her way to the wall where she knew the Room of Requirement hid. The tapestry that used to hang here was long since gone. Hermione fell to her knees as a sob ripped out of her throat with no preamble. <em>This, </em>she resolutely remembered, <em>is where Fred Weasley laughed his last. </em></p><p>She didn’t know how long she sat hunched over crying unashamedly. Fred had been a light in all of their lives and losing him had taken its toll. He and George had been a constant in her life and she hadn’t even considered that either of them could be lost – much less only one, leaving the other a hollow shell of a man. Months had passed and George still hadn’t spoken a single word. Most days he didn’t leave his room. Losing Fred meant losing them both.</p><p>It was a few minutes after her sobs subsided that Hermione realized she wasn’t alone. She nearly screamed, whipping out her wand and shoving it at the boy sitting next to her. Malfoy raised his hands in surrender. He stayed perfectly still and was watching her carefully. Slowly she caught her breath and lowered her wand.</p><p>“What?” It came out raspy and hostile.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to scare you,” He said, monotonously. “I came here for the same reason as you.”</p><p>She stared at him, confused. “You didn’t even like Fred.”</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at her. “Crabbe.”</p><p>Hermione felt the horrified expression on her face before she was even conscious of her own guilt. She had completely forgotten about the Slytherin boy who set the Room of Requirement alight, accidentally killing himself and destroying a Horcrux at the same time.</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” She whispered. “I… forgot.”</p><p>“It’s fine. A lot happened that day.”</p><p>“I don’t mean to sound… insensitive,” Hermione began hesitantly. “But I always thought you didn’t really care about them. Crabbe and Goyle…”</p><p>“So did I.”</p><p>It was a short reply, but Hermione understood the weight behind it. It must be hard to only realize how you felt about someone after they died in front of you.</p><p>They fell into a grief-filled silence, lamenting the loss of loved ones. Hermione briefly wondered if this changed their relationship somehow. There was a tinge of understanding that passed between them, even as two complete opposites who spent most of their lives at each other’s throats. It was a mutual respect she knew would go unacknowledged.</p><p>After a few hours, Draco let out a sigh and left without a word. Hermione knew she should go too. Classes started in the morning and even though she had relaxed her teachers-pet ways, she still respected the sanctity of learning and knew she wouldn’t be able to if she didn’t sleep. So, with a sniffle, she got up and followed the familiar path to her home away from home, the Gryffindor common room.</p>
