    <p>"Okay, I understand why we need to work together," Harry says slowly. He closes his eyes and then opens them to give Voldemort a suspicious, narrow-eyed look. "What I don't understand is why we need to pretend we're in a relationship."</p><p>"Because," Voldemort reasons, "No one will believe we're working together if they don’t see why."</p><p>"And you think people will believe that we're working together…because we're in love," Harry says. He's lost. Honestly and truly.</p><p>"Don't get ahead of yourself," Voldemort sniffs as he straightens out his Daily Prophet paper. "We're merely boyfriends. Who said anything about love?"</p><p>"Boyfriends."</p><p>"Are you deaf, Potter?" Voldemort asks, annoyed, and Harry gapes at him, mouth opening and closing soundlessly.</p><p>"Are <em> you </em> serious?"</p><p>"Lord Voldemort is always serious," Voldemort says, eyeing him from above the paper. He raises it, blocking Harry from view and effectively ending the conversation. Harry wants to fucking <em> scream</em>.</p><p>Then Voldemort lowers his paper again, and casually adds, "The sheep won't like it if they think you're only going along with things as my Horcrux. Better my boyfriend than my Horcrux."</p><p>"Can you please…" Harry says, covering his face as he groans. "Please. Don't call me your boyfriend. I don't <em> ever </em> want to hear boyfriend come out of your mouth again."</p><p>"Lover," Voldemort suggests, and Harry makes a mortified noise, his face heating. That was worse!</p><p>"Partner!" he hisses, and Voldemort nods graciously.</p><p>"Good enough, I suppose."</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>"You're…dating Voldemort," Ron says slowly.</p><p>"Fake dating," Harry corrects, frowning. "Get it right, please Ron. And I prefer <em> partner </em> and not boyfriend, while you're at it."</p><p>Ron leans back into his chair and looks at Hermione helplessly, but she only shrugs and gives him a look. <em> 'I don't fucking know either' </em>, her face says. Harry ignores them.</p><p>"Are you…fake kissing as well?" Ron asks tentatively, making a face.</p><p>"Of course not," Harry says, giving Ron a confused look. Ron deflates, sighing in relief, and Harry carelessly continues, "We're obviously kissing for real."</p><p>Ron chokes and Hermione pats his back. Harry smiles at them.</p><p>"You're fucking hopeless, mate," Ron groans.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“This is my horc—boyf—partner,” Voldemort says. He smiles, too many teeth and honestly fucking <em> terrifying </em>, and claps Harry’s shoulder, pulling him to his side.</p><p>Harry’s eyebrow twitches, and he forces a wide smile on his lips, matching Voldemort’s in its intensity.</p><p>“Yes,” he says tightly. “His <em> partner. </em>Nice to meet you.”</p><p>"…Yes," the Muggle Prime Minister echoes. He gives them an odd, disturbed look and slowly backs away.</p><p>"Do you think it's because I'm 19 and you're 70-something?" Harry asks, watching him power walk away. Running, actually, would be a more appropriate descriptor. "Or do you think it's because you're half-snake?"</p><p>"It's probably because we're both men," Voldemort says sagely.</p><p>"You're right," Harry agrees, nodding. "That's probably it."</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>"I don't think this is working out," Harry says blandly and Voldemort looks up at him.</p><p>"Are you breaking up with me?" he asks, and Harry splutters, reeling away to give him a look of shock.</p><p>"What?" he says, "no! We're not even—"</p><p>"Is this a proposal then?" Voldemort continues, unbothered, expression placid. "Maybe marriage is more believable than us being boyfriends."</p><p>"Uh." Harry's mouth opens. He closes it with a snap. Voldemort smiles at him. Harry <em> really </em> should teach him how to smile properly. The amount of bottom teeth in that smile is frankly unnatural. He makes a note to add it to their Redemption Tutoring, right after proper conversation topics that don't include Muggle slavery or torturing techniques.</p><p>"I'm glad you brought this up," Voldemort says solemnly. "I have prepared for this very moment."</p><p>Wordlessly, he summons a thick stack of documents and it lands with a solid thunk in the table between them.</p><p>"I don’t want to know what that is," Harry groans, covering his face. He deeply wants to rethink the life choices he's made that have led to this. He really should have let Voldemort kill him that day.</p><p>A pause. They stare at each other, neither of them giving in.</p><p>"What is it?" Harry finally relents.</p><p>"My prenup, of course," Voldemort smirks. "Can't have you running off with my hard-earned Galleons, can we?"</p><p>Harry's eyebrows shoot up all the way to his hairline and he gapes at Voldemort.</p><p>"You live in your followers' homes," he says.</p><p>"I do."</p><p>"You don't even wear <em> shoes</em>."</p><p>"I don't."</p><p>"Between you and me," Harry says loudly, rising up to his full height. Not very impressive, but still, Harry tries. "I'm the one who needs a prenup here, you–you–you <em>gold digger</em>!"</p><p>"Of course," Voldemort says, nodding easily. He doesn't even sound insulted. He doesn't even threaten to <em>Crucio</em> Harry for once! </p><p>(He really is improving, Harry thinks proudly.) </p><p>Voldemort waves his wand again and another stack of suspiciously prepared papers appears beside the first one. "Already done. You should be thankful that Lord Voldemort is very generous and kind."</p><p>Harry stares at the papers.</p><p>"It would be a waste not to look at them," Voldemort prods, and Harry sighs.</p><p>"Fine," he relents.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>"Why does it say…<em> Lord Voldemort</em> …on our <em>marriage certificate</em>?" Harry asks, voice strained and steadily increasing in pitch.</p><p>"Because. That's what's on my birth certificate."</p><p>"Er, no?" Harry says in disbelief, gaping at the other man. "I think I would know. I'm pretty sure your birth certificate says—"</p><p>Voldemort raises an eyebrow and gives him a Look before That Name can even pass through his lips. Harry closes his mouth.</p><p>"Check it," Lord Voldemort says, voice cool as he lifts his chin. He raises his non-existent eyebrows. "I dare you."</p><p>Harry checks. It <em> does </em> say Lord Voldemort.</p><p>"Who did you threaten?" He can't help but ask, and Voldemort only smiles at him. He's getting better at it, Harry has to admit. He pats himself on the back. He can probably take out <em> smiling practice </em> from their schedule now.</p><p>"No one. Who do you think I am?"</p><p>"…an evil Dark Lord?"</p><p>"That's a slur," Voldemort says seriously, disappointed. Harry feels strangely chastised. "I'm reformed. I prefer misunderstood."</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>"Can you explain to me again how cooperating with Voldemort led to the two of you getting married?" Hermione asks. "Slower, this time."</p><p>"Well," Harry says patiently for the nth time. He puts down his cup of tea. "He said that people would fall for it if they thought we were boyfriends. But then people didn't believe us, so obviously, we had to get married."</p><p>"Yeah," Hermione says dubiously. "<em>Obviously</em>."</p><p>"I'm glad you understand now," Harry says earnestly.</p><p>Hermione opens her mouth and then closes it. She sighs and covers her face.</p><p>"You know what?" she says. She brushes off the crumbs from their weekly tea time biscuits and stands up, smile strained. "You're right. I think I <em> do </em> understand now."</p><p>"That's great," Harry replies, smiling, and Hermione holds up her hand, cutting him off.</p><p>"You're a monster fucker, Harry."</p><p>Harry chokes, wheezing, his face flaming up.</p><p>"I'm not!" Harry lies vehemently. "What–Why–Why would you even think that? This whole thing was his idea and I'm just going along with it!"</p><p>Hermione only raises an eyebrow.</p><p>"We haven't even had sex!" Harry adds mournfully. He very deliberately doesn't pout.</p><p>"<em>Yet</em>," Hermione says. Harry feels his face heat.</p><p>"You think so?" he asks and Hermione coughs.</p><p>"Harry, if you show up naked in front of him, I'm a hundred percent sure I won't see you until the end of the week."</p><p>Harry makes a thoughtful sound at that and Hermione freezes.</p><p>“<em>Harry</em>,” she says, alarmed. “That was not a suggestion.”</p><p>“Wasn’t it?” Harry asks.</p><p>“Harry, please tell me you aren’t going to seduce Lord Voldemort.”</p><p>“I’m not going to seduce Voldemort,” Harry says promptly.</p><p>He's totally going to.</p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center"> </p><p>"…Have you forgotten to put on clothes?" Voldemort asks blandly, his face impassive. Harry deflates from his lounging position, carefully chosen to achieve maximum seduction potential.</p><p>"Is this not working for you?" he asks in disappointment, motioning towards the rose petals and the candles. He really did work hard on that. He sits up and frowns. "I really did think this would work."</p><p>"You should have just asked," Voldemort continues as he starts to peel off his clothes. Harry freezes, his eyes widening in pleased disbelief. "Lord Voldemort is generous and benevolent."</p><p>"Stop with the third person," Harry says, laying back on the bed. He can't stop himself from grinning. "The only one saying your name tonight will be me."</p><p>"Ambitious," Voldemort says approvingly. Harry laughs.</p><p>"Thanks. Learned from the best."</p>
