    <p>
  <span>Anyone who knew Charlie Weasley would say that dragons were his first love. Anyone who was close to him, however, would say that you were his second.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was obvious in all the little ways; how he would (unsuccessfully) sneak glances at you in the Great Hall, how he would be the first to claim you as his partner in class, how when Bill gave you his Weasley sweater, Charlie sulked for days. Then, when Christmas rolled around, he gave you his sweater. He never told you to wear it, and Rowan was the only one who knew that you wore it to bed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Did you love him back? Maybe. Rowan and Penny seemed to think so, and Andre swore the two of you had a thing. If you did have something, you and Charlie kept it secret, for all of Hogwarts was always watching Jacob’s strange sibling. However, all the evidence seemed to point to one conclusion. You wore his shirts and jackets constantly (because they were comfortable, you claimed). You would sneak out in the evenings with him to “discuss matters of grave importance,” though Tulip said she once saw the two of you holding hands by the lake. And when you jokingly kissed every one of your friends’ cheeks under the mistletoe one Christmas, did your lips linger a bit longer on Charlie’s cheek…? He blushed enough for everyone to believe it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He loved you. And maybe you loved him back. No one could ask Charlie, and no one could ask you, not anymore, not after what happened in seventh year. It was too hard to ask him once you died, and you, certainly, were in no position to say what was true and what was not. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With his second love gone, Charlie poured all his attention back into his first. He ran to Romania as soon as he could, brushing aside the worries of his family and friends. No matter how much Molly pleaded for him to wait, and no matter how much Ben cried of the dangers, he left. The call of the dragons was like a siren’s song, and he was unable to resist any longer.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Dragons, dragons, dragons. He had no time for anything but dragons, now. He dove deep into his work, to the point that he forgot to write to his family for weeks. Romance and marriage were dreams that no longer belonged to him. The glances that hopeful girls and boys gave him on the streets or at his job sparked nothing in him. They were not the sort of glances he wanted, and not the sort of people he wanted them from.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you happy?” Bill had asked him once, when Charlie had made a visit back to the Burrow.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes,” Charlie had replied, without hesitation. How could he not be, chasing his dreams in misty forests and craggy mountains? Living out his days among rustling wings and scales, hatching eggs tenderly over a stove-top fire?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bill said nothing, though he knew the truth as well as his brother did. You may have been his second love, but you were also his last.</span>
