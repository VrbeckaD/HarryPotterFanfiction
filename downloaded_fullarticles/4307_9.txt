    <p>Harry hated summers. In the winter he had less chores, there was no plants in the garden to tend to, no weeds, and the Dursleys not wanting neighbors asking questions about why he was shoveling snow when the snow plowers already did so, did not send him out to only attract unnecessary attention from their neighbors. He was on suspension from his school a week before summer vacation leaving him at the full mercy of the Dursleys and their persistent chores. They were cowards, so they never had the courage to physically hurt him, instead opting for ways to make his life harder in a non evidence leaving way.</p><p>Harry groaned in the heat of the noon sunlight, his hands caked in dirt as a result of his punishment of weeding for acting “freakish” as his uncle called it, at school of all places. It honestly wasn’t his fault that he often ended up where trouble would seek him instead of just leaving him the hell alone. He kept weeding, lost in thought as he remembered the details of his suspension and shuddered.</p><p>The teacher that had called him in to talk about his less than acceptable English grades and his chicken scratch handwriting with god knows how many spelling errors had suddenly adopted a cold air around her as she slowly led him into his office. He remembered her cold golden eyes and sinister smile, her possessed whispers, as she slowly tried to descend upon him with her teeth bared,</p><p><em> “I've been waiting and watching you godling,”</em> she had stared at him like a starved lion eyeing a plump, injured prey.</p><p><em>“You’re a strong one.. You smell so good, so good,”</em> He desperately wanted to tell her he was only a freak and a weakling that couldn’t even fend off his own aunt and uncle, that he was in no way strong, that she had the wrong person. But the panic that had overcome him only left his voice dead and his mouth trembling.</p><p><em>"A demigod in these parts are so rare. Let me take you,”</em> He remembers screaming but no sound coming out.</p><p>A hot wave of panic had overcome him as he stood frozen and desperately wishing for help from any entity that cared. The monster called him a godling and a demigod, so he prayed with all the emotions within him that if it were true that, someone, anyone, would help him. Maybe if no one on earth had cared someone up there would. Somehow, without movement, his English teacher, no the monster was thrown across the room with an unknown force. Everything had become eerie quiet and a black wisp of smoke left the teacher and evaporated into golden dust. He remembers the quiet soft voice and the whispering laughter, this time warm and affectionate,</p><p><em>“It’s not up there who cares, but someone down here,”</em> It is then that he had realized that his English teacher and the voice was not speaking in English. His relief was short lived when his headmaster walked into the room and witnessed the unconscious state of his teacher and took him down to the headmasters office to be sorted out with his “parents”.</p>
