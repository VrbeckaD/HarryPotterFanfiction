  <span>    It hadn’t been Regulus’ intention to become a spy, but looking back, he hadn’t had any other choice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>    After ordering Kreacher to leave with the newly discovered Horcrux, all hope seemed to have been lost. Maybe that was what prompted Regulus to finally lurch toward the waterside- that he knew there was no point. An unholy silence seemed to ring from the cavern walls, leaving his breathing and clumsy footsteps to echo off of them mockingly. And the thirst… it had been so unbearable he couldn’t even think straight. Were he able to he might’ve thought about something else- his family, how he’d spent his life, Voldemort, even his professors- but all that preoccupied his mind was finding something, anything to help his painfully dry throat. Regulus scrambled down, cupped a cold, marble white hand and tried to lift water to his lips. Not a drop reached them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>   Something stirred in the shadows all around him; very subtly at first, and then very loudly, as if a large sea serpent were thrashing about just out of his sight. A vague, unsettling fear hung over him then as he peered out, half dead and weak. There was no reason to, for even if he could see he was far too weak to even hold his wand properly, but he gazed out at the invisible monster nevertheless. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>    The events that followed unfolded so quickly that his dehydrated mind could hardly keep up. A skeletal black hand shot up from the water- he mistook it for a snake- to grip him with incredible speed and then, all darkness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    The next thing he knew, he found himself being tucked into a hospital wing bed as if he were a student again. Everything was heavy with some kind of sickly weight, and his throat felt thick. Upon noticing he’d opened his eyes, Madam Pomfrey simply raised her eyebrows knowingly and left- leaving Regulus alone with Professor Dumbledore. Apparently the headmaster had been waiting for some time, for beside the old wizard’s feet lay a handful of crafting magazines and some knitting. He spoke after a prompt pause.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    “Hello again, Regulus. Fizzing whizbee?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>    Dumbledore went on to explain that Kreacher had returned to Regulus as quickly as he could, immediately cracking them back to Grimmauld Place and his absolutely hysterical mother. His secret was safe from Walburga of course, who had taken the liberty of assuming his loyalty had nothing to do with the matter, but Kreacher, knowing the truth, understood that Hogwarts was the only safe location for his recovery. “You're looking quite well after the state you were in.” Dumbledore smiled and hooked yarn over one of his needles again. He’d taken up his knitting over the duration of his ramble. “Madame Pomfrey worked with the skill of a witch ten times her age, if I do say so myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    That was all well and good, but his questions had not all been answered. “And Kreacher?” He would have liked to thank the house elf for saving his life of course, but also feared his safety after their shared peril.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>    “Your friend refused to leave your side until you stopped raving in your sleep. He’s recovered remarkably as well.” At this point he gave another amused smile. “We offered him a place at Hogwarts, but he wouldn’t hear of it.” The knitting and assorted magazines began being gathered up. His wise blue eyes finally settled upon Regulus once again. “I hope you won’t say the same.”</span>
