  <strong> <b>What We Notice.</b> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Sirius has been having the worst day ever, ever. </p><p>It should be a date put down in history. Sirius should document everything that has happened and anything that will happen so that he could have hope whenever he feels like things couldn’t get any worse, later on. He’d remember what had happened that stupidly dull Wednesday, and he’d think to himself, <em>I’ve survived worse. This is nothing.</em></p><p>(Assuming, of course, that he does indeed survive this day, and that he doesn’t end before it does.) </p><p>“Does this look green to you, Black?” Severus asks, sneering. </p><p>Sirius wants to jab Severus’ head on the wall behind them, repeatedly, until the wall is covered by slimy brains that belong to slimy gits. </p><p>Sirius is also feeling quite violent, on an unrelated note.</p><p>“You fucking--”</p><p>“Just give me that! Honestly,” Severus starts, taking the powdered moonstone from Sirius’ hands, and pushing him away from the cauldron, “Can you not read, Sirius? It says--”</p><p>“I can see what it says.” Sirius grits his teeth and refrains from saying (or doing) anything else. He leans against the wall and decides to spend the remainder of the class watching Severus work on their Draught of Peace. Which, when Slughorn told them they needed to brew, kind of felt like the universe spitting in Sirius’ face. </p><p>Not to be dramatic, of course, but Sirius feels he is a second away from setting Severus’ hair on fire, or maybe setting his own hair on fire, or even--</p><p>Sirius furrows his eyebrows when he notices that Severus is adding the powdered unicorn horn already, when it’s one of the very last steps. It also isn’t powdered--the unicorn horn is cut into small thin pieces, and Severus is adding it quite generously.</p><p>“Can you not read, Snivellus?” Sirius asks, mockingly. “You’re supposed to--”</p><p>“I know what you’re supposed to do,” Severus begins, sounding bored, “but this works better.”</p><p>“Does it?”Sirius can’t deal with Severus right now. If he is being honest, Sirius can never really deal with Severus. “I am not screwing this up because of you!”</p><p>“And you won’t!” Severus sounds exasperated, as if Sirius is the one being unreasonable. “It works better if the unicorn horn is cut and not powdered because--”</p><p>Sirius pushes Severus away from the cauldron. The potion is a shade of red that Sirius thinks is all wrong. He sighs and tries to think of a way to salvage it when Severus pushes him, hard, making the cauldron shake. </p><p>“You fucking asshole!” Severus shrieks. </p><p>“Better not do that again, Snivellus, or I swear to--”</p><p>“Boys!” Slughorn is standing between Sirius and Severus in an instant. “What type of behavior is this? 25 points from Slytherin and Gryffindor,” Slughorn announces, and groans fill the room. Sirius’ eyes are narrowed and he’s glaring at Severus. </p><p>Slughorn shakes his head disapprovingly. “Sirius, please switch seats with Mister Potter. You must know, however brilliant you are, that I will not allow this kind of foolishness in my class! The same goes to you, Severus, of course.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Professor,” Sirius mumbles as he collects his stuff. He is relieved, if anything, that he will no longer have to be partners with Snape. That is James, now. Sirius shudders as he thinks about it. He feels sorry for James.</p><p>Speaking of which, James is still in his seat, at the front of the class, messing up his hair. He looks at Sirius briefly, before focusing on Slughorn. </p><p>“Actually, Professor, if you wouldn’t min--”</p><p>“On with it now, boy!” Slughorn bellows as he rubs his temples. James huffs and pinches Sirius’ forearm as he walks past him.</p><p>Sirius isn’t going to hear the end of this anytime soon. He curses at nothing in particular before heading towards James’ now empty seat, setting down his stuff and, for the first time, taking a look at his new partner. It’s Remus Lupin. Sirius doesn’t know much about him, at all.</p><p>Remus acknowledges Sirius with a nod as he sits down. He is crushing the unicorn horn. (<em>The way it’s supposed to be prepared,</em> Sirius thinks. Severus is a prat.)</p><p>“Hello,” Remus says, not looking up from his work station. “James was stirring the potion. I think he was on step two, though I can’t be sure. Just start from there, I think, and we’ll see what happens. Worst case scenario, we’ll have to start again, which may sound bad but we could do seeing that--”</p><p>“I’ll start stirring now,” Sirius says, interrupting Remus. Remus doesn’t seem to mind, just hums in response. He doesn’t even seem to realize that he is ranting. He is so focused on crushing the unicorn horn.</p><p>Sirius reads step two; <em>Stir until the potion turns blue. </em>He could do that. </p><p>He starts stirring absentmindedly and making a list of the things that could go wrong before the day ends.</p><p><em>If one more thing ends up getting fucked up,</em> Sirius thinks, as if he is threatening someone (which is ridiculous), <em>I am going to turn Slughorn’s hair bright pink.  </em></p><p>It doesn’t make any sense. It is a stupid if clause--a stupid thought, but Sirius has it. Once Sirius has a thought he can’t let go of it, no matter how stupid and absurd it may be. Slughorn doesn’t even have any hair, not really. But, Sirius is a man of his word--Of his thoughts? He thinks about it some more, and decides that no matter what happens, even if nothing does end up getting fucked up, he will turn Slughorn’s hair bright pink. He deserves it, and maybe even--</p><p>Remus clears his throat. “It’s blue. Now add--”</p><p>“I know what to fucking add,” Sirius snaps, and he would have felt ashamed if he wasn’t so tired. </p><p>Remus hums again, and he doesn’t seem affected by Sirius’, quite honestly, insufferable attitude. He continues crushing the unicorn horn. </p><p><em>How much do we need?</em> Sirius wonders, as he is searching for… for what, again? He looks at the instructions.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><em>Add powdered moonstone--</em></li>
</ol><p>He needs moonstone. He looks around at their work station, and looks around some more. He sighs before turning his attention back to Remus. “Eh.”</p><p>Remus points at a small, silver plate with silver powdered moonstone on it. Sirius takes it and mutters a “Thank you.” </p><p>Remus hums in response, <em>again</em>. Sirius adds the moonstone (he’s supposed to keep adding until the potion turns purple) and studies Remus.</p><p>Truth be told, Sirius has never really paid much attention to Remus before. Remus is tall, but he doesn’t look strong. He is lanky and pale.</p><p>And scarred. </p><p>Very scarred, everywhere. On his hands and forearms where his sweater is bunched up, some scars on his neck that disappear abruptly under the collar of his shirt, and on his face. Those are the most striking; they look especially ragged and rough compared to the rest of Remus’ features. The scars are mostly pink and healed, but Sirius does notice a fair few that are red and angry, looking new. </p><p>“Where’d you get your scars?”</p><p>Remus is evidently surprised, but he does his best to hide it. He is very good at that, Sirius notices. </p><p>“A car crash.”</p><p>“A recent car crash?” Sirius asks, raising an eyebrow, “or multiple ones, maybe?”</p><p>Remus puts the crushed unicorn horn in a plate and looks at Sirius, expression passive and slightly amused. “Your potion is burning, Black.”</p><p>Sirius breaks eye contact and looks at the cauldron in front of him. Instead of being purple, it is a bile-like yellow that smells of oranges, strangely. Sirius stares blankly at the bubbling potion, and then focuses on Remus, who is already watching him. </p><p>“Eh.”</p><p>Remus laughs, muffled laughter as not to attract Slughorn’s attention. He pushes Sirius away slightly, and stirs the potion three times counterclockwise, two times clockwise and one last time counterclockwise, and the potion turns a pretty pale purple right in front of Sirius’ eyes.</p><p>“You added too much moonstone,” Remus explains, and Sirius is still dumbfounded. </p><p>“That wasn’t on the instructions.”</p><p>“Now we have to wait until it turns pink and smells like--”</p><p>“How the hell did you do that?” Sirius demands, a little irritated.</p><p>“Severus told me that--”</p><p>“There is no way that-that stupid git knew--”</p><p>“Severus is very good at Potions,” Remus states, looking around their table. “He’s very instinctive and such.”</p><p>“What does that mean?” Sirius asks, huffing. “Snivellus can’t even seem to follow basic instructions.”</p><p>“Don’t call him that. And whatever he was doing was probably going to work better, anyway,” Remus says, still rummaging around their station. “Have you seen the syrup anywhere?”</p><p>Sirius sighs and shakes his head. “I could go get some from the--” He doesn’t get to finish the sentence because Remus is already half-way there. </p><p><em>Okay, then,</em> Sirius thinks and takes a look around him. To his credit, everyone seems to be having a hard time brewing their potion. Everyone except Severus, which makes Sirius angry. </p><p>He scowls as he glares at him, stirring the potion in his cauldron and looking very much at ease. James is almost as scowl-y as Sirius sitting next to Severus. </p><p>When James catches Sirius’ eye, Sirius mouths a<em> better you than me, love. </em>James mouths a <em>fuck you </em>with a quite elaborate physical demonstration, as well. Sirius snorts and turns his attention back to the cauldron. Remus is already there, adding the syrup into the now pink potion, looking bored. </p><p>Sirius clears his throat. “He can’t be better than the fucking textbook, now could he?”</p><p>Remus looks amused, again. “He experiments and takes notes. Quite spectacular.”</p><p>Sirius scowls harder. “Doesn’t make him less of an asshole, though.”</p><p>“You know, objectively speaking, you are also an asshole.” Remus stops adding the syrup as the potion turns turquoise. “No offense, of course, Black.”</p><p>Sirius raises an eyebrow, more amused than offended. “You think so?”</p><p>Remus hums, now just looking at the cauldron waiting for it to turn purple again, as the instructions say. He looks serene now, almost, and Sirius is hit with a sudden urge to<em> argue</em>. And he’s never really been one to suppress urges.</p><p>“I think that’s a load of bullshit.”</p><p>“If you say so.”</p><p><em>Fight with me, dammit!</em> Sirius thinks. “I think that you and your little cult are noth--”</p><p>Remus laughs, cutting Sirius off abruptly. “Our <em>cult?</em>”</p><p>And, okay. That sentence’s ridiculous. Sirius bites his lip to keep from laughing. He still wants to argue, mind you. “Yes,” he says, in a low voice as not to show that he’s losing it.</p><p>“Who are ‘we’, then?”</p><p>“Slytherin blood-obsessed gits that think--”</p><p>“You don’t know that,” Remus says, as soon as the potion turns purple. “You also cannot assume it based on positively nothing when--”</p><p>“I very much can,” Sirius says, blood rushing and heart thumbing and <em>excited. </em></p><p>Remus looks at Sirius, eyes alight and fiery. And then they’re not. They’re calm and collected, back to bored.</p><p>Sirius wants to punch him or break his nose; see how well he can contain his anger, then.</p><p>He does nothing of that sort, against his better judgment. He waits until the potion turns purple, again, and then he starts adding the porcupine quills, making sure to watch the potion closely as not to put in too much. </p><p>As Sirius is adding the quills, his mind wanders to multiple places; where did Lupin get those scars? Some of them looked like accident ones, and others looked like they were put there by claws and teeth.</p><p>“Did you valiantly fight a dragon?” Sirius asks. “Is that it?”</p><p>“In what context am I supposed to think about this question?”</p><p>“In the ‘Is that the reason you have so many scars’ context.”</p><p>Remus doesn’t say anything.</p><p>“Just tell me, honestly. I think it ought to be a pretty great story.”</p><p>Remus raises an eyebrow. “I already did. You’re choosing not to believe me.”</p><p>Sirius scoffs. “That’s because it’s a bullshit story full of bullshit, Lupin.”</p><p>“Your potion is red, Black.”</p><p>Sirius’ hand halts instantly. He peers down at the liquid, and a very much purple potion stares back at him. Remus snorts. </p><p>“har-bloody-har, Lupin,” Sirius says, rolling his eyes and going back to adding the quills. He doesn’t need to add much more, though, and a few seconds later, the potion turns blood red. Remus starts stirring. </p><p>“They are cool, y’know.”</p><p>Remus furrows his eyebrows. “Huh?”</p><p>“Your scars. Pretty cool. A devil-may-care type of cool.”</p><p>Remus flushes pink as he continues stirring. Sirius thinks it’s cute, and wants to hit his head, on a hard surface somewhere, instantly. </p><p>Sirius can’t think Remus is cute. He should think Remus is vile and cruel. He is a Slytherin, after all, and they’re cunning and manipulative. Sirius knows this, has a Slytherin for a brother (that he would murder in cold blood had he not loved him. (A small amount, of course.))</p><p>But Remus is cute, and hot. And Sirius is hormonal and frustrated.</p><p>Sirius has never found it hard to get a date in his life, which is definitely something he took pride in. Admittedly, a Potions classroom is probably not the most romantic place of all places, but he can give it a shot. Maybe if Remus went on a date with Sirius, he would tell him where he got his scars. Maybe Sirius could find out where they end and where they begin. And even--</p><p>A loud ‘boom’ sound cuts Sirius’ train of thought, as almost a dozen dungbombs go off at once. Sirius rushes out of the classroom with the rest of the class as an unpleasant scent engulfs them. Everyone is outside the classroom in an instant, and Slughorn gets out last, looking red in the face and queasy.</p><p>“Potter!” He shouts, making his way to James, who is hiding behind a rather terrified looking Peter. Slughorn turns around to address the students before he reaches James. “Class is dismissed. We will continue next time.”</p><p>Students scatter even before Slughorn is done speaking, and Sirius wants to find Remus, but he stays behind waiting for James, who is nodding as Slughorn goes on and on. </p><p>He has the decency to look ashamed, at least. </p><p>When James and Peter finally join Sirius (after 25 points taken from Gryffindor and a month’s detention cleaning trophies with Filch), Sirius is beaming. He throws his arms around James’ shoulders and starts walking, Peter scurrying behind them. </p><p>“That was brilliant, Jamie! I wish I had done it. Probably would have if I had spent one more moment with that git-- sorry about that, by the way. I would never want to get rid of my misery if that misery ends up piled on you. You do know that Jamie, yes?”</p><p>James squints his eyes. “What’s up with you?”</p><p>“What’s up with me?”</p><p>“I thought you were miserable,” says Peter, having finally caught up with them. </p><p> “I argued with Lupin-- well, half argued. Would want to continue soon. I was going to ask him out and then you did that. Probably a good thing; if someone had asked me out during one of Slughorn’s classes I would have most likely said no unless they had a spectacular ass, in which case--”</p><p>“I don’t know why I’m not surprised,” Peter says, snorting. </p><p>“You’re such a slut, Sirius.”</p><p>Sirius laughs, shaking his head. “If you’re jealous, Jamie, just say so, love.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong> <b>…</b> </strong>
</p><p>   </p><p> </p><p>“Your brother and his half-witted, ridiculous, unbelievably arrogant friends are going to wake up dead someday, and I will have killed them!” Severus shrieks as he enters the Slytherin common room, face red and sweaty and robes drenched in dungbomb residue. He doesn’t even wait for Regulus to respond as he hurries up the stairs leading to their dormitories, angrily murmuring and shaking his head. </p><p>Regulus, who is sitting next to the fire and reading a book, looks confused. “My day had been wonderful, Severus, learned all about patronuses and deadly plants. Thank you for asking. How was yours?”</p><p>Remus snorts as he plops down next to Regulus. “You must excuse Severus, Reg. I don’t think he’s having a good time.”</p><p>“Oh, whatever gave you that idea?” Regulus replies dryly, returning to his book. </p><p>Although he is a year younger than him, Regulus is the person Remus is closest to in Hogwarts. They met properly one night, in Remus’ second year, in the hospital wing, after a rather cruel full moon. Regulus was put there for a nasty case of chickenpox. They had both been stuck there a couple of days, and they have been friends ever since. </p><p>“Your brother is a piece of work, though.”</p><p>“Oh, whatever gave you that idea?”Regulus repeats as he glares at Remus. He then snorts, as if he can’t help himself. “What did they do this time?”</p><p>Remus narrates what had happened in the Potions dungeon, and by the end, Regulus looks impressed, though he just nods and doesn’t say anything. </p><p>Remus knows that Regulus admires his older brother; that he wants to be like him. But he also does know that the last time they spoke together at Hogwarts, at the beginning of that school year, both ended up in the hospital wing with broken bones (and prides), having lost house points for unauthorized dueling.</p><p>Remus doesn’t understand siblings, but he is pretty sure that’s not how it’s supposed to be.</p><p>(Or is it?)</p><p>Remus rests his head back and closes his eyes, letting out a breath. The full moon is in about seven days, which would usually mean that Remus didn’t have to deal with the irritable fatigue and bone ache, yet. But his transformations have been getting more and more brutal, and the symptoms far more noticeable. </p><p> </p><p>Remus must have fallen asleep because he is awakened by someone poking his arm gently. He is warm and sedated and doesn’t ever want to get up.</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“It’s dinner time. Want me to get you anything?”Regulus asks, book in hand.</p><p> “No, thank you. I want to go. Wait for me?” Remus says as he pushes the blanket off him, trying to wake up properly.</p><p>“Please take your time, mi princessa.”</p><p>Remus laughs as he throws the blanket at Regulus, which he easily dodges. “Asshole.” Remus pauses for a bit. “Like your brother.”</p><p>Regulus groans.</p><p>As they are walking down the corridor, Remus is leaning onto Regulus slightly for support. Regulus doesn’t comment, as he continues reading his book while walking.</p><p>It shouldn’t have been as easy as it was for Regulus to figure out Remus’ lycanthropy. A few weeks after they first met, Regulus came up to Remus and asked, “Are you a werewolf?” as if he was asking about Remus’ favorite color. Remus stammered and flushed, but didn’t answer. Regulus had stared at him for a long time, then said, “I thought you’d be different, you know. Werewolves. Guess I was wrong. You’re not scary. If given the chance, would you turn me?”</p><p>Remus, having been rendered speechless, shook his head. Regulus studied Remus some more, before finally saying, “I believe you. Can you help me with this History of Magic essay? I keep confusing all the goblin rebellions…”</p><p>And that was that.</p><p>Remus is immensely grateful for Regulus; he doesn’t think Hogwarts could have ever been the same having not been close to him. </p><p>“What are you daydreaming about?” Regulus asks, eyes still roaming through his book. What is he even reading?</p><p>“What are you reading?” Remus asks as they enter the Great Hall.</p><p>“A story.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Well, a story about this--”</p><p>Remus snatches the book from Regulus, skims through the open page, and snorts. “Really? Here, of all places? We’re eating!”</p><p>Regulus, despite turning red, smiles. “You would never guess who I got it from.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Severus.”</p><p>“I definitely didn’t need to know that, Reg.”</p><p> </p><p>…</p><p> </p><p>“Stop staring,” James says, through a mouthful of food. “It’s getting creepy.”</p><p>
  <em>How have I not noticed this before? </em>
</p><p>“No, really, please do stop. It’s getting creepy, Sirius.”</p><p>
  <em>How the hell have I not noticed this before?</em>
</p><p>“What’s up with Black?” Marlene asks, looking amused. “Hey, Black! What’s up with you?”</p><p>
  <em>How hav--</em>
</p><p>“Hey!” James says, snapping his fingers in front of Sirius, making him jerk his head.</p><p>Sirius glared at James. <em>“What?” </em></p><p>“Stop staring!” James says.</p><p>“Stop looking constipated,” Marlene says.</p><p>Sirius sighs, dropping his head on James’ shoulder. “How have I not noticed this before, Jamie? <em>How?</em>”</p><p>James just shakes his head. Marlene looks confused, at first, but then Sirius thinks she decides she’d rather not know. She flips Sirius off and turns her attention back to Dorcas.</p><p>“Stop doing that!” James snaps, shaking Sirius’ head away. “You don’t even know the bloke properly, and adding insult to injury, he’s a Slytherin! Honestly, Sirius, I thought you had standards.”</p><p>“Also,” Peter begins, “that Lupin boy is weird weird, y’know? He keeps disappearing. I heard once that Daphe told Mary that Lucius told her that Remus got his scars when he made a deal with--”</p><p>“How have I never seen this?” asks Sirius, again, louder this time. “And with my stupider, younger brother!”</p><p>Sirius has been staring at the Slytherin table, intently and creepily, throughout dinner. Regulus is reading a book and Remus is leaning on his shoulder, sleeping. Regulus nudges him every once in a while to eat, and he does, then he dozes off again. Lupin looks even more out of place and striking surrounded by arrogant purebloods with sticks up their asses. Regulus says something, and Remus laughs. </p><p>It’s disgusting.</p><p>(Not the laughter; the Regulus. Ugh) </p><p>Peter shakes his head and James pinches Sirius’ forearm. “Are you even listening to us?”</p><p>Sirius nods.</p><p>“Honestly. He’s weird. And he’s a prefect. He’s not--”</p><p>“He’s a prefect?” </p><p>“Yes, he is. Which is precisely why--”</p><p>Sirius is already up and away from his seat. He walks down the Gryffindor table and lodges himself between Marlene and Lily, making Marlene spill her orange juice on her white shirt.</p><p>“Sirius, you bitch!”</p><p>Sirius ignores her. “How are you lovelies doing today?”</p><p>Lily raises an eyebrow. </p><p>“You look ravishing, Lils.”</p><p>Lily sighs. “Okay, what do you want, Black?”</p><p>“You wound me, Evans. Why would I want something?”</p><p>“‘Cause you’re a kiss ass," Marlene coughs. Sirius steps on her foot.</p><p>“Okay, yes, I’m horrible, whatever,” Sirius says, making Lily smirk. “You’re a prefect, Lily, and I was wondering how well you knew other prefects.”</p><p>“Other prefects?”</p><p>“Yes,” Sirius says and bites his lip. “y’know, Slytherin prefects, maybe?”</p><p>“Disgusting. You don’t seriously like Florence, do you? I thought you had class, Black.”</p><p>“I dated you, Marlene, didn’t I?”</p><p>“Oh, fuck you,” Marlene says, laughing. She turns back to Dorcas, who is raising an eyebrow, smiling crookedly. </p><p><em>Oh. </em>There is something there. Sirius is definitely going to pry. Later, though. He focuses on Lily, again, who looks deep in thought.</p><p>“I don’t think you like Florence.”</p><p>“Obviously I don’t.” Sirius snorts and picks up a chocolate cookie. “She scares me.”</p><p>Lily studies him for a moment, and suddenly her eyes widen.<em> “Absolutely not!” </em></p><p>“You don’t even know what--”</p><p>“No, trust me, I do.” She says, pointing a finger toward Sirius. “Don’t even think about it, Black.”</p><p>“But you don’t know--”</p><p>“Leave Remus alone, okay? He doesn’t need you in--”</p><p>“You’re talking like I’m some sort of disease!” Sirius hisses, shaking his head. “Who do you even think you are?”</p><p>Lily shakes her head, taking Sirius’ hand. “Not what I meant, Sirius--No, really! I promise. I’m sorry. It’s just that Remus goes through so much already, and I don’t think he needs you playing with him--”</p><p>“I won’t play!”</p><p>Lily gives him a look.</p><p>“Honest, Lils. I really do want to go out with him.”</p><p>“How do you even know him?”</p><p>Sirius feels like admitting that he didn’t up until two hours ago, give or take, won’t work in his favor. “I know him, alright.” He coughs, trying to be cryptic. </p><p>“Oh-kay, Black. What do you want?”</p><p>“I want you to turn around, and tell me the first thing that comes to mind when you see Remus and Re-- whomever is with him.”</p><p>Lily turns around, then turns back and smirks. “This is what this is about?”</p><p><em>“This</em> is about nothing. So?”</p><p>Lily doesn’t relent. “You think that he and Regulus--”</p><p>“Just tell me!”</p><p>“Well… They do seem pretty close, don’t they?”</p><p>Sirius groans, hitting his head on the table, twice, before Lily stops laughing long enough to stop him. </p><p>“Stop!” Lily says, catching her breath. “Don’t worry about that. I’m pretty sure Regulus likes someone else.”</p><p>“How the hell would you know that?”</p><p>“He likes Florence,” Lily says, eyes bright. “She told me herself.”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p> </p><p>…</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Regulus, please go tell your brother to stop staring.”</p><p>“Hey, Narcissa,” Regulus starts, “please go make your cousin stop staring.”</p><p>Narcissa scowls. “I’d rather eat slimy slugs.”</p><p>“Oh, so you’re on the same page?” Remus asks, amused. </p><p>“Shut up, Lupin,” they both say at the same time, then return to their books. It’s eerie how similar they are. </p><p>“It is rather unsettling, though, isn’t it?” Severus asks, playing with the food on his plate. “Someone, please make him stop.”</p><p>“He’s staring at you, Lupin,” Lucius says, sneering slightly. “I wonder why that is?”</p><p>“Oh, screw off, Malfoy,” Regulus says.</p><p>“That’s cute; you defending his honor. You do realize, though, that--”</p><p>“Lucius!” Narcissa says, voice sharp, “Drop it.”</p><p>To her credit, Lucius does stop, and turns his attention to Goyle beside him, scowling.</p><p><em>The things people do for love, </em>Remus thinks. <em>Or sex. </em></p><p>“I can go talk to him, if you want,” Regulus whispers, even though Remus is sure it is the last thing he would want to do. </p><p>Remus snorts. “Sure.”</p><p>Regulus shakes his shoulder, and Remus’ head shakes with it. </p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>“Don’t be a sarcastic piece of shit, Remus.”</p><p>“Noted, Regulus.”</p><p>Remus <em>likes</em> it, likes Sirius staring at him, likes pretending that he doesn’t like it; pretending like he doesn’t notice.</p><p>He feels like it’s a secret, though, and he’s not sure that it’s a good thing, necessarily. In fact, he’s pretty sure that Regulus would punch him if he says that he’s interested in Sirius. (Or punch Sirius, most probably)</p><p>But Remus doesn’t need to think about that now. He can like Sirius in peace. Or at least, something resembling it. </p><p>
