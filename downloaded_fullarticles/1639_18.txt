    <p>“It’s your fault you know.” An icy voice poured like molten silver in his ear.</p><p>“Shut up” The boy murmured.</p><p>A flash of red and green illuminated his vision then faded away just as suddenly.</p><p>“You left them” the voice hissed.</p><p>Muffled yells cascaded around him.</p><p>“They are all gone.”</p><p>The scent of dust, sweat, and blood met his senses.</p><p>He clutched his head.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“Because of you…” the voice whispered.</p><p>Lifeless, mangled bodies filled his mind.</p><p>“Stop!” the boy pleaded. The voice laughed but faded away as the boy fell to his knees.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry woke in pain, his head throbbing. For a moment he feared it was his scar, but that hadn’t happened in years and was never going to happen again. The once unsightly, obvious mark had finally faded into a barely visible thin white line and was easier to hide under his fringe. He sighed as he sat up and massaged his temples. Just a headache.</p><p>Standing, he pulled on a pair of black jeans and a simple grey tee. Shoving his feet into his trainers, he grabbed his backpack and left the room. He made his way downstairs and into the lobby of the hotel, walking over to the desk. He checked out quickly and exited into the gentle rain outside. He stared up at the sky, rain hitting his face.</p><p>“Where to now?” he muttered.</p><p>Left.</p><p>That’s where. He turned calmly and started walking down the street. He walked for over an hour, simply following his gut. The way he had been doing for the past two years. Ever since He died and Harry…</p><p>“Hey, kid? You alright?” a worried voice called out and Harry turned.</p><p>A man was stood halfway between him and a police car. The driver side door was open and the man was dressed in uniform. Harry blinked in confusion but came to his senses quickly.</p><p>“Oh, yes sir. I’m fine.” He nodded.</p><p>The officer walked closer. “You sure, kid?” he looked at Harry’s skinny form. The rain hadn’t let up and the nineteen-year-old was thoroughly soaked. “Where’re you headed?”</p><p>Harry shrugged.</p><p>“Do you want a lift into town?” the man offered, gesturing to the car.</p><p>Harry smiled but shook his head. “No thank you, officer. But if you could give me directions to the nearest hotel?”</p><p>The officer looked puzzled, “We don’t have any hotels here in Forks. There’s plenty in Seattle?”</p><p>“Oh.” Harry hummed, but shrugged with a smile. “Never mind then sir. Thank you for telling me.” He started to turn and walk away but the man placed a hand on his shoulder. Harry tensed, but relaxed when he looked and him. He was concerned.</p><p>“Why don’t I take you to the station and you can work out some plans, yeah?”</p><p>Harry sighed. He wasn’t going to let him go without some form of help, was he? He nodded and followed the officer to the car and got into the passenger side.</p><p>Harry smiled and rubbed the back of his neck, “Thanks for giving me a ride, sir. Sorry I’m getting your car all wet.”</p><p>The officer shook his head. “It’s no problem. I’m Charlie Swan, chief of police.” He introduced as he started the car down the road. “So, what’s your name?”</p><p>“Harry.” Harry replied with a small smile.</p><p>“Why were you out in the rain? Are you a runaway, or something?”</p><p>“Or something.” The boy had a sad look in his eye as he stared out of the car window at the road.</p><p>Charlie frowned. “Do you have anyone you can stay with? Anyone you can call?”</p><p>Harry shook his head.</p><p>“Is that all you have?” the officer nodded to the backpack on Harry’s lap. It was as soaked through as he was.</p><p>Harry hugged it close to him but shook his head. “I have money.” He said, as though just that would dissuade Charlie’s concern. It didn’t.</p><p>The man sighed. “Would you like to come live with me until you figure things out?” he offered.</p><p>Harry stared at him. “…No offence, but you’ve just met me. What if I’m a criminal or something?”</p><p>“And are you a criminal Harry?” Charlie asked with a smirk.</p><p>“Well, no… but you don’t know that.”</p><p>Charlie laughed. “I like you already kid. And I think that if you were a criminal, you wouldn’t accept a ride from a police officer.”</p><p>Harry looked sheepish again.</p><p>“Look, my daughter moved out  four years ago, so I have a free room.” Charlie offered again.</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>Charlie nodded.</p><p>“Okay”</p><p> </p><p>Harry bit his lip as he stared up at the police chief’s house. “Are you really sure I can stay here? I can pay you back…”</p><p>Charlie smiled, “No need. Just keep the place tidy and you can stay as long as you need.” He unlocked the door and led the boy inside.</p><p>The kitchen is just through there, he gestured off to one side and harry saw an open door that led into a small looking kitchen/dining room. He nodded and followed Charlie through the living room and up a set of stairs. Charlie led him to a door furthest down the hallway. “This is you. I hope you like purple, haven’t touched this room since Bella moved out.” The door was opened, and Harry looked around the room. There was a double bed against one wall with cream coloured sheets. It was neatly made up and Harry set down his bag on it.</p><p>Next to the wardrobe was a desk that had a handful of trinkets on it but was mostly clean. The dark wood matched nicely with the dusty purple walls.</p><p>Harry smiled at Charlie. “Thank you, sir.”</p><p>“No problem.” The officer nodded from the doorway. “My room is just down the hall, and the bathroom is right next to it.” He glanced at his watch. “I need to get back to my patrol now, but there’s food in the fridge. Not much, I’m not the best cook, but you can have anything you want. Just not the beer.”</p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>“I should be back at four. If you want to go out there’s a spare key by the door. Just lock it behind you.”</p><p>“Yes sir.”</p><p>Charlie smiled, “and no more of this sir business. Makes me feel old. Call me Charlie.” And with that, he was gone.</p><p> </p><p>Harry sat on the bed. It was comfy. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he had slept on a bed this soft. He had found it was hit or miss with hotels.</p><p>He lay back with a sigh. He smiled, content. Charlie seemed nice.</p><p>“Too bad you’re nothing but a monster”</p><p>Harry glared. “Shut up. I am not a monster.”</p><p>“Really? Then how come all your friends are dead?”</p><p>Harry stood and growled, “Shut up and get out of my head.”</p><p>The voice laughed but did silence.</p><p>Harry frowned, sitting back down. He looked down at himself. He was still soaked through and was getting the bed wet too. Rummaging through his bag, he pulled out a fresh set of clothes and a towel.</p><p>After a quick shower and some dry clothes, he felt relaxed. He ran a hand through his hair. It was long now, falling just short of his shoulders. The weight of it helped tame the wild mop it was so Harry never bothered to cut it. He found that it had a subtle wave to it which he surprisingly liked.</p><p>His stomach rumbled and he made his way downstairs to the kitchen. Charlie was right to say there wasn’t much food. The fridge was mostly stocked with beer. He hummed and searched the cupboards. Charlie had the essentials, but nothing substantial. In the freezer he found Tupperwares of what were probably leftovers.</p><p>He grabbed a couple slices of bread and put them in the toaster, pulling out a jar of jam he had seen in a cupboard. It wasn’t much but it was something for now.</p><p> </p><p>A little while later Harry was sat in the living room, reading a book, when he heard someone at the front door. It opened to reveal a tall woman with copper skin and long black hair. She was carrying a bag in one hand and had a pleasant smile on her face. She did a double take when she saw Harry.</p><p>“Oh, hello” she sounded a little confused.</p><p>Harry stared at her. He flushed a little. “Hi…”</p><p>“Is Charlie in?” the woman asked, still standing in the doorway.</p><p>Harry shook his head. “He’s at work.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>The two stared at one another for a moment.</p><p>“I’m Harry.” Harry said quickly.</p><p>The woman looked sad for a brief second, but finally stepped inside fully, closing the door behind her. “Sue Clearwater. I just came over to drop this off.” She lifted the bag she was carrying. She placed it down to the side. “So, Harry,” the name lingered longer than it probably should have. “I haven’t seen you around before. How do you know Charlie?” she took a seat in the armchair by the window.</p><p>Harry shifted and put his book down on the coffee table. “We only just met today. I had nowhere to go so he’s letting me stay here for a bit.”</p><p>“That was kind of him” Sue said, though she had a hint of suspicion on her face.</p><p>Harry nervously rubbed his arm. “Do, er, you want a drink..?”</p><p>Sue blinked, but nodded. “A coffee would be lovely. Thank you. Black, one sugar.”</p><p>Harry practically fled to the kitchen. He hadn’t felt such tension since Scrimgeour and Percy visited the Weasley house under false pretences. He set about making a cup of coffee for Sue and tea for himself, using plenty of sugar. He was in need of something sweet.</p><p>He brought the drinks through and saw Sue was on the phone. He set her cup down and walked back into the kitchen with his, giving her some privacy. A few minutes later, he returned, and the woman was watching the tv, sipping at her drink every now and then.</p><p>She turned to look at him when he sat down. “That was Charlie.” She smiled. Harry sensed she was more relaxed with his presence than earlier. “He’s on his way home now. She shouldn’t be too long.” Harry nodded and picked up his book, beginning to read.</p><p>“Fantastic Beasts and where to find them?” sue questioned.</p><p>“Huh? Oh… yeah. Fantasy creatures. Centaurs, Dragons… Werewolves…” he trailed off. “Stuff like that.” He heard the faint voice in his head hiss.</p><p>“Monster” he clenched his fist and looked up at Sue with a forced smile.</p><p>“I love that sort of thing.”</p><p>Sue nodded, “You remind me of my son, Seth.” She sipped her coffee. “He’s around your age I’d guess. When he was younger, he adored when I’d tell him stories.”</p><p>“How old is he?”</p><p>“he turned eighteen a few weeks ago. And how old are you?”</p><p>“Nineteen.”</p><p>Sue hummed. “You look younger than that. I thought you might be seventeen.”</p><p>Harry shrugged, “I get that a lot.”</p><p>“So what will you be doing here in Forks?”</p><p>“I’m not quite sure yet. I’ve spent the last couple years just travelling.”</p><p>”Your parents let you do this?”</p><p>Harry shook his head sadly, “My parents died when I was very little, and the family I was put with don’t really care what I do.”</p><p>Sue gave him a brief look of pity, which Harry hated, but it didn’t last too long. “Maybe you could settle down here in Forks? If you need a job, I’m sure I could ask around.” She offered.</p><p>Harry laughed nervously, “I appreciate the offer, but both my parents and my godfather were loaded. When they died I inherited enough to live at least five lifetimes without needing to work a day.”</p><p>Sue looked at him, shocked.</p><p>“I know, I don’t look rich. I just don’t like flaunting. I’d rather just stay away from attention.”</p><p>“If you’re as well off as you say, why don’t you buy a house or stay in a hotel?”</p><p>Harry shrugged, “I have stayed in hotels in the past, but Charlie insisted I stay here. He even refused to let me pay him back.” He ran a hand through his hair. “And like I said, I travel a lot. Maybe if I find somewhere I like, I could get a house there, but for now I’m not sure.”</p><p>Sue nodded in understanding. “Well, you seem like a good kid. And goodness know Charlie needs company. He has me, but I know he’s been upset since Bella left; even though she and her daughter visit.”</p><p>The door opened and Charlie entered. He greeted Sue with a kiss and smiled at Harry.</p><p>“I see you and Sue have met.”</p><p>Harry nodded, “She was just telling me about your daughter.”</p><p>Charlie smiled fondly, “Ah, Bella. You should meet her some time.” He sat down on the armchair and looped an arm around Sue, who shifted to sit on his lap.</p><p>“That would be nice,” Harry agreed.</p><p>Sue hummed in thought, “Charlie, what do you suppose I bring Seth and Leah over tomorrow?” </p>
