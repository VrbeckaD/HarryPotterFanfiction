          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco looked up from where he was about to sit down after he came back from the loo, and saw his seat taken by some sunglasses that weren't his. He had just overheard a relatively familiar voice. Thinking it was only because he was reminiscing about his school days, though not in the distant past, still were a short time ago. He saw none other than Harry Potter talking with Tom, and couldn't believe his luck. Perhaps the alcohol he was consuming was confusing his head. He set his cup down, and began to think. His friends were taking an awfully long time in the loo. He had glimpsed Astoria, but quickly ignored her.</p><p>
  <em>Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight</em>
</p><p>
  <em>My friends are in the bathroom</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Getting higher than the Empire State</em>
</p><p>
  <em>My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar</em>
</p><p>
  <em>My seat's taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar</em>
</p><p>Harry looked up as Draco said "Potter. It seems your arrogance hasn't changed. That is MY seat." Harry smirked. "And your flattery hasn't changed." Harry scooted over a stool, and took one look at Draco's arms, seeing where the Sectumsempra spell had hit him. "I'm sorry about that. I was in a real bad place. Just as you were, as I assume." He said, as he indicated to the claw-like markings on Malfoy's alabaster skin.</p><p>
  <em>And I know I gave it to you months ago</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I know you're trying to forget it</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But between the drinks and subtle things</em>
</p><p>Drinks upon drinks piled upon Harry and Draco's tabs, both of them now slobbering drunk, and Tom knew he should've cut them off long ago, he had been slipping a sobering potion when he realised they wouldn't notice. They were both apologising to each other for each and every stupid thing they'd done, leaning against one another, trying to remember every instance. So much hatred was bottled up, it was good to let it all go.</p><p>
  <em>The holes in my apologies</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You know I'm trying hard to take it back</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So if by the time the bar closes</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And you feel like falling down</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I'll carry you home</em>
</p><p>Harry kindly offered to pay the fair on the Knight Bus for both him and Draco, as Draco's friends had left earlier in disgust and were absolutely high; and Harry had only come with the intention of getting one drink, not getting absolutely wasted. They both settled their tabs, and hailed the Knight Bus, and set off on the gut wrenching ride.</p><p>
  <em>Tonight</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We are young</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So let's set the world on fire</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We can burn brighter</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Than the sun</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Tonight</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We are young</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So let's set the world on fire</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We can burn brighter</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Than the sun</em>
</p><p>Harry lugged Draco into his apartment and onto his bed, found a sobering potion and a garbage bin, and set them by the bed, then staggered his way out to the Knight Bus. He had to pay more for that, but since when did he care? He left a note for Draco, saying that he would like to talk again when they were sober. They agreed to meet again in a group at the Leaky Cauldron.</p><p>
  <em>Now I know that I'm not</em>
</p><p>
  <em>All that you've got</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I guess that I, I just thought</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But our friends are back</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So let's raise the cup</em>
</p><p>
  <em>'Cause I found someone to carry me home</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Tonight</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We are young</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So let's set the world on fire</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We can burn brighter</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Than the sun</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Tonight</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We are young</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So let's set the world on fire</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We can burn brighter</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Than the sun</em>
</p><p>Draco was again slobbering drunk, but Harry was sober this time. Draco was never good with emotions. Harry hoped to help him. In any way possible. On the way home, he heard Draco say</p><p>
  <em>Carry me home tonight</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Just carry me home tonight</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Carry me home tonight</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Just carry me home tonight</em>
</p><p>Harry nodded at a semi wasted Malfoy, with whom he had been married to for a year and a half. He saw the moon outside his seat in the Knight Bus, and it reminded it so of Remus. Teddy was at Andy's tonight.</p><p>
  <em>The moon is on my side</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I have no reason to run</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So will someone come and carry me home tonight?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The angels never arrived</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But I can hear the choir</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So will someone come and carry me home?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Tonight</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We are young</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So let's set the world on fire</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We can burn brighter</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Than the sun</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Tonight</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We are young</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So let's set the world on fire</em>
</p><p>
  <em>We can burn brighter</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Than the sun</em>
</p><p>Harry sighed as he looked upon his spouse of 79 years. They had both lived long, full lives. They knew it was their time to go. And so, they held each other tight. After all, to the well organised mind, death is but the next great adventure.</p><p>
  <em>So if by the time the bar closes</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And you feel like falling down</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I'll carry, you home, tonight</em>
</p><p>"Do you love me Harry?" "Always, Dragon"</p><p>And so they greeted Death as an old friend.</p></div>
