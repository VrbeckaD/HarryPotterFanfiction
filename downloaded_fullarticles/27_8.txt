    <p>Early June 1993, Malfoy Manor, Wiltshire</p><p> </p><p>The slap, when it came, was hard and sharp, stinging his skin like many tiny needles stabbing him at once. His head wrenched violently to one side, causing a sudden rush of pain to shoot up the side of his neck where the tendons and muscles were pulled harshly with the force of the blow. Stars danced and twinkled in his vision. Where the blow had landed began throb with dull pain.</p><p>Uncontrollable tears gathered in his eyes, making his vision swim. </p><p>When he dared to look up at Lucius, he could see how his face was twisted in anger, his cheeks tinted red with his rage. Spittle flew from his lips as he yelled, the small flecks of moisture hitting Draco in the face.</p><p>Draco knew Lucius was angry because of what had occurred during the last school year. How his plan to get Dumbledore removed from Hogwarts as Headmaster had failed miserably. How he had lost something that had belonged to his precious Dark Lord. And worst of all, the humiliation of Potter tricking Lucius into freeing their house elf, Dobby. </p><p>And Draco had done the one thing he knew very well he shouldn’t have. He laughed. Not at Lucius, no, one never laughed at Lucius and lived to regret it. No he’d laughed because Potter probably thought he’d gotten one over on Lucius and by extension, Draco. That was what was funny to Draco. He knew better though, knew better than to laugh. Knew that Lucius would only see it as Draco laughing at HIM. </p><p>His rage had come lashing out and he’d slapped Draco with the full weight of his strength behind the blow. Draco supposed he was lucky that it wasn’t a punch. And now Lucius could see the tears and the rage crested again. This time in screaming.</p><p>“ARE YOU CRYING? YOU ARE A PATHETIC EXCUSE FOR A SON! HOW I MANAGED TO SPAWN SOMETHING SO DISGUSTING I DON’T KNOW! YOU ARE A DISHONOR TO THE NAME MALFOY! YOU ARE NOTHING BUT WEAK AND FOOLISH AND STUPID!”</p><p>Lucius then raised his wand and screamed something Draco didn’t quite understand and suddenly he felt like a thousand and one knives were stabbing him all over his body, and then he felt like he was on fire. Screams tore themselves from his throat, more tears, this time of pain, rolled fat and wet down his cheeks. He tried to find his voice, to beg his father to stop, to tell him he’d do better. He’d be a better son, a better Malfoy.</p><p>But he couldn’t speak, only scream as the unrelenting pain built and built and built until, finally his eyes rolled back into his head and Draco passed into darkness.</p><hr/><p><br/>He woke in screaming agony, his nerves and muscles jumping in spasms, pain flying through him like he was being cut open and set on fire all over again. He tried to voice his pain but found his voice was weak and hoarse, barely a whisper. How long had he screamed for? How long had Lucius held him under that horrific spell before he’d passed out? How long had he been unconscious? </p><p>By his placement in his bed in his own rooms he knew he had at least been moved. He had been changed into his pajamas too. The sheets and his silk pajamas were seering agony against his skin, but he could not move to either remove the offending garments or get out of the bed. </p><p>He whimpered in pain, though again it was but a whisper in a dark, silent void. It was dim in the room, moonlight just beginning to peek in through the tall windows. So it couldn’t be too late at least. Possibly just before dinner. </p><p>The pain began to get steadily worse now that he was awake. Muscles and nerves jumping and spazzing more and more frequently. Draco tried to curl into a ball like he always did when he was frightened, but the movement sent horrible jagged jolts of pain shooting through him worse than ever. He couldn’t scream, only whimper.</p><p>Finally the door to his rooms opened, light spilling into the room from the hallway in pale gold brilliance. A figure, tall with long black hair and heavy black billowing robes strode into the room and made its way to the bed. A hooked nose, sallow skin stretched over a long face. Severus.</p><p>Draco tried to reach out to him, to implore him to make the pain stop. </p><p>Severus for his part actually looked frightened. Draco couldn’t figure out why. Was he dying? Did whatever curse Lucius had used do irreparable, lethal damage?</p><p>“Draco,” Severus said, an odd sort of restricted quality to his voice, like his emotions were clogging his throat. Draco had never heard Severus sound like that before. </p><p>“I … I’m sorry. I’m so, so sorry. I’m sorry I wasn’t here to stop this. Your mother, she called me hysterical a few hours ago when she heard you screaming, heard Lucius ... “ Severus had to take a breath before he could continue, “Anyway, we moved you into your room. I was afraid to administer anything while you were unconscious. You were thrashing badly even then. I have a couple of potions for you now, I will help you sit up and take them. One is a special potion of my own making that will help with the nerve pain and likely nerve damage from the curse. The other is a relaxant. It may put you back to sleep, which would be best as the first potion works best when you are sleeping.”</p><p>Draco gave a soft grunt of accent, the action causing a lance of fiery pain to shoot through his body. He whimpered.</p><p>Looking pained, Severus gently put his hands around Draco’s shoulders to help him sit up, a soft whimper escaped Draco at being touched. As Severus helped Draco sit up, pain screamed along every nerve ending and muscle he had. If he could have screamed, he would have. </p><p>Once he was sitting up, breathes coming in short, sharp pants, pain shooting like daggers inside him, Severus pressed a vial to lips and Draco automatically opened his mouth allowing the potion to be tipped into his mouth. It was cool and soothing almost instantly in his mouth, only slightly bitter. As he swallowed he felt the feeling spread as it slid down his throat. After the vial was empty, another was placed at his mouth and tipped inside. This one was warm where the other had been cool, and sweet where the other had been bitter. Almost immediately, Draco felt the pain begin to recede, going from unbearable to manageable. His nerves stopped their panicked jumping and his muscle began to relax. </p><p>He felt his eyelids begin to grow heavy after only a few minutes, and barely felt Severus lower him back to the bed. He was asleep before his head even hit his pillow, blessed relief swallowing him.</p><hr/><p><br/>It was morning when he woke up again, his muscles aching slightly, but no more horrible spasms or tremors. Draco could feel his nerves were still giving off the random shot of pain but nothing that wasn’t mangable. </p><p>“Draco,” a soft voice whispered from nearby. Turning his head, Draco saw his mother sitting in one of the armchairs from his sitting area. She had pulled it close to the bed.</p><p>There were purple bags hanging under her ice blue eyes, which were red rimmed from crying. Her normally immaculate hair and robes were disheveled and messy. </p><p>Draco pushed himself up on his elbows, wincing a bit at the protest of his aching muscles. “Mother, how long have you been there? What time is it?” He wanted to ask what day it was but decided against asking for the moment. He didn’t want to find out he’d lost multiple days to sleeping.</p><p>Narcissa took a deep breath and let it out slowly before looking at Draco, her fingers twitching like she wanted to reach out and touch him but was afraid to, in case her touching him hurt him.</p><p>“It’s alright, Mother. I’m okay. The pain is mostly gone thanks to Uncle Severus’ potions. Mostly just aching right now. Something I’m sure a hot soaking bath would help put right,” Draco said, trying to reassure her. </p><p>To Draco’s great shock, tears gathered in his mother’s eyes, clinging to her pale lashes like tiny jewels. “My Dragon, I’m so sorry I couldn’t stop him. I tried to get in the room you were in but your father … he warded the door against me. I felt so powerless, so helpless. Hearing your screams …” she broke off, swallowing thickly before continuing. “I thought … I thought he was going to … to … kill you. I ran to the parlor and firecalled Severus right away. By the time he had gathered what he needed and came through, Lucius had finally lifted the curse and stalked out of the room. He left you … laying there … I thought you … I thought ....” </p><p>Draco shuddered, he could only imagine what she must have thought once she and Severus made it into that room. Swallowing against his own emotions and memories, he looked at his mother and said, “I … I … I know. I know you tried to get to me. Uncle Severus told me you tried before you went to fetch him. I don’t blame you, Mother. You know what Father is like.” </p><p>A shudder ran through his mother and she visibly tried to control herself, closing her eyes and taking deep, shuddering breaths. Finally she seemed to have mastered herself. Opening her eyes, she looked at Draco and said, “I know, my Dragon, I know. I am just grateful that you are well. That Severus was able to help. All that matters is that you’re okay. Nothing else matters.”</p><p>She reached for him then, standing from the chair and sitting near him on the bed, she pulled him into her arms, pressing him to her, arms wrapped around arm in a firm, but gentle hug. He felt her trembling and it sunk in then how truly frightened she’d been, how truly afraid she’d been that she might lose her son. Draco swallowed the lump that came into his throat, squeezing his mother back just as firmly.</p><p>Lucius would not raise his wand again on Draco for another three years.</p>
