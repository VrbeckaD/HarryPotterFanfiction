  <em>"The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters outnumber you, and the Boy Who Lived is finished. There must be no more war. Anyone who continues to resist, man, woman or child, will be slaughtered, as will every member of their family. Come out of the castle now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will join me in the new world we shall build together."</em>
</p><p>Even nature didn’t murmur as the Dark Lord offered life to his enemies—a choice that every living soul there knew wouldn’t be taken by those loyal to the fallen. Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and even Slytherin stood united against a common enemy as Hagrid’s form shook behind the Dark Lord, Harry Potter draped across his arms. As Hagrid moved forward, a chorus of agonized cries rang out until Lord Voldemort’s roar and a wordless spell silenced them. He demanded that Hagrid put him down and the Dark Lord, reveling in his victory, stood over the fallen Boy-Who-Lived.</p><p>
  <em>"You see?" said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and forward right beside the place where he lay. "Harry Potter is dead! Do you understand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!"</em>
</p><p>“How very….sanctimonious of you.”</p><p>The low, raspy whisper seemed impossibly loud as it rang out from one side of the courtyard to the other. A figure—a marionette doll fashioned from a corpse—slowly shuffled to stand in front of the energetic, gaunt figure towering over The-Boy-Who-Lived. Heavy dark robes swept the cobblestone while dark hair swayed with each step. What skin could be seen had a grey-yellow pallor: the distinct absence of blood that no breathing body could have the look of.<br/>
Severus Snape’s head rolled back, exposing the blood and pus that covered his whole front from Nagini’s bite. He fixed tired, pained eyes on the Dark Lord as he cleared his throat of the saliva and blood that had been there.</p><p>“This cannot be.”</p><p>Lord Voldemort didn’t bother to hide his shock initially, but he quickly regained his composure at the gasps of his Death Eaters behind him. He straightened and leveled the Elder Wand with his chest. “I do not know how you survived, but sacrifices MUST BE MADE!” A flash of green light shot from his wand just before the killing curse hit its intended target as the Dark Lord once again sacrificed one of his own.</p><p>There was no unceremonious drop as a man determined to die finally accomplished it. Rather, the second the curse hit its target, so did a bolt of lightning. It looked as if one had thrown a bag of Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder at his chest and it exploded in a massive cloud of ink. It spread, curling around invisible energies that surrounded the traitor and spy inside. It engulfed him, and then the bodies of fallen witches and wizards from both sides until no one could see beyond to the other side. As the darkness threatened to consume more it came to a stop and then, within seconds, withdrew again to the figure in the very center. Everything the blackness touched changed and the bodies of the fallen were no more.</p><p>And there, in the center, stood Severus Snape. Yet…not.</p><p>Long, lank hair and dark robes that hid the 6’2 figure within was replaced with a mop of black curls and a robe not unlike the dark wizard that stood before him. Bare, pale feet flexed on the ground and he slowly lifted his forearm to eye virgin, pale flesh. The figure lowered it again and rolled his head as if the body were a new suit that he was breaking in. Finally a few steps were taken and much like the man the body belonged to, he seemed to glide across the battlefield as he approached a retreating Dark Lord and his followers. Some tried, unsuccessfully, to apparate.</p><p>Dark eyes that filled his sockets stared at Lord Voldemort and that darkness seemed to seep into the veins around his eyes and mouth—a mouth that curved up into such a wide and unusual smile that it seemed unnatural. The figure breathed in, a sound that echoed across the bridge and tilted his head.<br/>
“I’ve been waiting for you for a very long time, Tom Riddle.” Two voices, one silky and deep and the other high and soft, mingled as one as the words lazily slid out. Without uttering another word he turned his head towards Nagini. His hand, the fingers blackened, extended and he watched dispassionately as the snake seized and then seemed to wither in on herself until nothing but a husk punctuated by vertebrae remained.</p><p>Once again, the figure looked at Lord Voldemort who either from shock or the magic that kept his people in place didn’t react. “I’d offer last words,” the smile was almost flirtatious “but I’d hate to spoil the taste.” Whatever magic held He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named released him and the wizard took several steps back in a futile attempt to avoid his fate. Blackened fingers extended once again, beckoning the wizard back to him. The Dark Lord dropped to his knees, grasping the ground and for what seemed like an eternity, the life left him as it had Nagini. He shriveled and decayed, collapsing upon himself as his forearms gave way until finally what remained was a skeleton shrouded in thin grey skin and a black robe. It was seconds, mere seconds, and once he was a pile of bones this deadly version of their former follower snapped his head up towards the Death Eaters before him.</p><p>“Run, hide if you must. I’ll find you. I am Death and all come to me sooner or later.”</p><p>Pops suddenly echoed around the courtyard as the magic that held them still released them. Death Eaters vanished, fleeing from the horror they’d witnessed and once they were all gone, Death turned slowly to regard those who remained. Harry and Hagrid were slowly retreating, seeking the safety in numbers that clearly would do little good. He allowed it, watching them all from hollow, glittering eyes.</p><p>“Once and a while, someone dies who never should have lived. They were made, they were born, and they were cursed and despite all of the suffering in their life and their many mistakes, they remain good at heart and ultimately that goodness causes them to make the ultimate sacrifice.” The explanation was delivered in the same strange duality as he took slow and deliberate steps towards them. “Most go bad, hungry for the things their childhood denied them. Those that do not are an open door. Rarely I feel it necessary to walk through. Rarer still is one willing to let me. He wasn’t, he’s just too tired to put up much of a fight.”</p><p>He stopped when he was close enough to cause the front lines to take a few steps back. The same eerie smile stretched across the younger face of Severus Snape. He tilted his head up, working his jaw just slightly.</p><p>“We are more now, we will be more until I decide I’ve had enough of you.”</p><p>His blackened eyes snapped shut and face twisted into something akin to searing pain. Severus contorted, gasped as if he’d been struck, and fell unceremoniously into heap on the cobblestone. The only movement that came from the figure was the soft rise and fall of his shoulders.</p>
