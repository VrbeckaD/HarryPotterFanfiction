    <p>Tick<br/>Tock<br/>The small clock on the desk infront of him ticked painfully slowly, drawing out his time there for an age.<br/>Tick<br/>Tock<br/>It was a brand new, foldable pocket-clock ('for the wizard on the go!'), and could be set to chirp loudly at certain times. Percy always had it set to when work ended, but he could seldom go home even then.<br/>There was just too much to do.<br/>Tick<br/>Tock<br/>He put his pen down in order to survey what he had written.<br/>How could people care so much about cauldron bottoms?<br/>Percy knew that they were an important part of potion safety,and things had gone badly wrong in the past- nasty burns and such- but really. Need he write twenty four pages worth?<br/>Tick<br/>Tock<br/>He seriously doubted anyone would ever read it. He certainly would never look at it after it was handed in. The clock ticked ever on.<br/>Tick<br/>Tock<br/>"Ah, Weatherby!"<br/>"Mr Crouch!"<br/>Weasley sat up straighter in his seat as his boss walked purposefully into his cramped cubby.<br/>"I've got some important paperwork about that hogwarts affair that I need on my desk by tomorrow morning. The- what's that there?"<br/>"Cauldron bottoms report, sir.", he replied importantly.<br/>Not that it was important, but he might as well pretend.<br/>"Yes, well, that can wait. This is of the utmost importance. I'm trusting you Weatherby. Don't let me down."<br/>"Of course not sir!" Percy gushed, but Crouch had already left.<br/>Buggar. Buggar it all.<br/>He couldn't let Mr Crouch down- he couldn't afford to lose his job if he did- but he was so hoping to go home on time tonight.<br/>He had a date at nine that he wanted to get ready for. Not that he could tell anyone.<br/>Tick<br/>Tock<br/>The clock now read five to five.<br/>Four hours. Surely that could be enough time? His eyes drifted to the report on his desk.<br/>It was just shy of thirty pages.<br/>Oh, bloody hell.<br/>Tick<br/>Tock<br/>He'd better get started.</p>
<p>Nine o'clock approached more and more swiftly with each page he finished. The department got quieter and quieter, as more and more people packed up and went home to their families. This made working easier, it had to be said, but was rather demoralising.<br/>Percy wondered if his family missed him.<br/>Probably not. Mum would be to busy scolding Fred and George, Ron and Ginny would be planning how to get Harry over for the Quidditch World Cup, and Dad would be fretting over some new muggle trinket he'd found.<br/>The work got harder and harder, and his freckled eyelids got heavier and heavier.<br/>How important. Sloggy away at paperwork that was strictly classified information. Whoop-de-do.<br/>Eight o'clock came and went, and the red head started to panic.<br/>He couldn't miss it, this was only their second proper date. If you could call them dates, what with them always having to hide.<br/>But how would he ever finish this by tomorrow?<br/>Abruptly, he realised.<br/>The ministry never closes. <br/>He could come back after the date, in the small hours, and finish it.<br/>Granted, he would need a lot of Mrs Pepper's Perk-me-up potion, but it would give him the best of both worlds.<br/>At ten to nine, he finished his sentance, packed up his things, and apparated home. Clothes changed, hair brushed and teeth cleaned (you never know), he apparated again to the lesser known London pub where he was meeting Oliver- all the whilst ignoring his mothers lecturing about coming back so late.</p>
<p>The pub was crammed.<br/>The front table was full of giddy thirty-something witches on a hen night, spilling treacle champagne over the eachother's glittery night-out robes, and raucously laughing about it. The brides to be wore matching rainbow pins. The was a group of very old witches and wizards, all nursing their drinks and peering over perched spectacles. One had an asbestos white beard that swept the floor- which another promptly tripped over as she went to go to the loo, exposing a patch the creamy young skin under her robes.<br/>A sinister looking group of goblins played cards in the back, and near the middle a large group of very brightly dressed people laughed and talked loudly, knocking back flamboyant looking drinks. Some changed colour and others shot out sparkles as you tried to take a drink.<br/>"Percy!"<br/>Infront of him appeared Oliver Wood, dressed in a very fetching pair of deep red robes.<br/>Percy knew the navy ones he'd chosen were too plain.<br/>"Oliver! How are you?"<br/>"I'm great! This is a great place- how did you find it?"<br/>Oh dear.<br/>"I think I'll need a drink to tell that story!"<br/>"Two butterbeers, coming up!" Oliver said with a smirk, and sauntered off to the bar to get them, which gave Percy an excellent view of him behind.<br/>Maybe he should start playing quidditch, if it gave him an arse like that.<br/>He followed Wood to the bar, and over their butterbeers recounted the story of the terrible date he'd been asked to here.<br/>"It was arranged by a friend of mine- you know Andrews, don't you?- and it was sort of a blind date,"<br/>"The best kind, I'm sure."<br/>They sniggered into their drinks.<br/>"Anyway, the man asked me to come here- which was a good decision, I know- so I met him at midnight-"<br/>"Midnight!" Oliver choked on his drink from laughing, "you thought- let me get this straight-"<br/>"Was that a pun??"<br/>"Shh! You thought a date in a sleazy pub at midnight with some bloke you've never met was a good idea?!"<br/>"I know! God knows why they call me the sensible one! Anyway-"</p>
<p>They kept up this bantering conversation as time ticked on, and Percy forgot all about his important report.<br/>"Haahaa- you- hahah- cannot be seri- heeehehe- serious!"<br/>"I most certainly am! Haha- I told you- hehe- my date was worse!"<br/>"I don't know, Ollie, having an old man try to blow you under the table is pretty bad!"<br/>"But it will never be as much of a tragedy as having the fittest guy in the bar end up sounding like a-"<br/>"Long-suffering chipmunk?"<br/>"Yes!"<br/>They guffawed.<br/>"I say, what time is it?"<br/>"Oh, don't go yet!" begged Wood. "We've only had- hiccup- four rounds! And one of those was those glitter drinks so obviously they don't count!"<br/>Percy's robes were still covered in the stuff.<br/>"Only four! I'll just check, I- bloody hell, it's two a.m.!"<br/>"Oops"<br/>They giggled.<br/>"But I really ought to be going..."<br/>"Where" began Oliver, hands gesturing wildly, "could you possibly have to be at two a.m.??"</p>
<p>Slinking into his cubby at half past two in the morning may have been the worst feeling in the world. Still.<br/>He was going to finish that report tonight, even if it killed him.<br/>And what a tonight it had been.<br/>He still felt giddy when he looked at Oliver, just like he had the first time he'd seen him.<br/>Well. Sort of.</p>
<p>3rd September</p>
<p>Dear diary,<br/>I've decided I've gone off quidditch. My roommate, Oliver, won't shut up about it; this is only our third day at Hogwarts and I'm already sick to the back teeth of the little sod. I'm dreading the rest of the year having to hear about his plans to try out for the team next year, and how he's been flying since he was six and wants to be a quidditch player when he grows up. After a point, I just don't care.<br/>Other than that, school is ok. I don't really have many friends, but lessons are incredibly interesting and I get on with most of my teachers. There are some dicks in my classes, though. They call me poor and weasel and say things about my family that aren't true. Why do they torment me but not Charlie or Bill? We're from the same family, after all.<br/>At least Wood isn't as bad as that.<br/>I do wish we were a bit more well off sometimes. Just so they wouldn't make fun because my robes are old and too short because they were Charlie's. Or that I have an old rat instead of an owl or a cat.</p>
<p>Until tomorrow, diary.<br/>Percy.</p>
