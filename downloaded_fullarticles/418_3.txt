<p> </p>
<p>The summer after seventh year found Harry Potter at the Burrow, his old school bag now full of clothes, snacks, and a bottle of Ogden’s Best Firewhiskey that Sirius had slipped him while his dad and Remus weren’t looking. The light of mid-afternoon poured in through the wobbly glass of the living room window and spilled across the wooden floor. Motes of dust danced in the sunbeam. Try as she might, Mrs Weasley couldn’t seem to banish every speck of dust. Harry didn’t mind—it made the place feel homely and welcoming. Lived-in.</p>
<p>He settled back against the worn, squashy cushions of the sofa, completely content with life for the moment, and watched the twins regale Hermione with stories of their post-graduation camping-trip exploits.</p>
<p>“It’s tradition!” Fred was saying. “Everyone does it after they graduate!”</p>
<p>“I remember ours,” George said, his expression turning wistful. “We nearly burnt the woods down.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I remember that, too. It was in the <em> Prophet </em> ,” Hermione said, sorting through a pile of books.</p>
<p>“Our legacy,” Fred said, his eyes going misty.</p>
<p>“Remember how we tricked Angelina into summoning that Greater Salamander?” George said. “Good times.”</p>
<p>Hermione snorted. “So <em> that’s </em> how the fire started.”</p>
<p>Harry had just finished packing his things. Unlike Hermione, who evidently needed to bring half the library with her for a three-day camping trip, Harry packed relatively light. Even so, his pack was heavier than it looked; the Undetectable Expansion Charm made it easy to fit everything he needed, but he’d never quite got the hang of combining it with the Featherlight Charm.</p>
<p>He and Hermione had stayed at the Weasleys’ last night, though Hermione had been Apparating back and forth from her parents’ house to the Burrow trying to decide on what things she should bring, or if she was even going with at all. Harry, however, had been looking forward to this trip for months.</p>
<p>Just then, Ron burst into the living room, juggling a large, ungainly rucksack (probably containing their tent), his old school bag, and his Cleansweep Eleven. He had his wand clenched between his teeth.</p>
<p>“Y’know, most people use their wands to lift things like that,” Harry told him.</p>
<p>Ron shot him a rather venomous look and dumped everything on the sofa. “I tried that, but the charms on the tent must be interfering with the spell,” he muttered, pulling his wand from his mouth and wiping the spit off on his trouser leg.</p>
<p>Hermione made a disgusted sound. “Really, Ronald!”</p>
<p>“So have you decided to come with?” Harry asked Hermione before Ron could open his mouth, heading off a potential row.</p>
<p>Hermione looked over at her stacks of books and parchment and let out a gusty sigh. “I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Excellent!”</p>
<p>“I still think the time after graduation should be spent working towards building our careers. I can’t believe wizards don’t go to university! We’re expected to get jobs right out of Hogwarts?”</p>
<p>“Come on, Hermione, this is our last chance to just fuck around before we have to be real adults!” Ron protested.</p>
<p>“It’ll be fun! Like when we went to the Quidditch World Cup a few years ago!” Harry said.</p>
<p>“That was so crowded! And so loud! I could hardly get any studying done.”</p>
<p>“It was summer, you shouldn’t have been studying at all! Honestly, Hermione,” Ron said. “And anyway, you’ll never have homework again!”</p>
<p>That had the opposite effect on Hermione. Instead of relieved, she just looked horrified.</p>
<p>“Maybe I shouldn’t go…”</p>
<p>“No, no, you’ve already packed half your library, you might as well come with,” Ron said.</p>
<p>Hermione chewed her lip in thought. “I’m just not much for the outdoors. And it’s the Forbidden Forest...I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“That’s why you should come with us! You know exactly how dangerous things are in there and you can keep Harry and me from...I dunno, accidentally eating poison berries or something,” Ron said.</p>
<p>“We’re counting on you to keep our younger brother and his best mate alive, Hermione,” George said, slinging an arm over her shoulder. He had an uncharacteristically serious expression on his face and Hermione’s cheeks went pink.</p>
<p>“Alright, fine!”</p>
<p>“That’s the spirit! I can rest easy knowing Ickle Ronniekins is in your capable hands,” Fred said, wriggling his arm around Hermione’s shoulder from the other side, essentially trapping her between him and George.</p>
<p>Her face went even redder at that and Harry had to hide a smirk.</p>
<p>Harry and the rest were about to set out on their Ritual Weekend; a tradition that started a thousand years ago. Students of the recently-graduated class gathered together for one last time for three days of “roughing it” in the Forbidden Forest.</p>
<p>Students of all houses would form groups. There were no points, no rules (other than “don’t try to kill each other”), and no professors. Supposedly this would encourage “teamwork, friendship, and inter-house unity.” What it usually encouraged was a lot of burning things in a bonfire, endless prank wars, and drinking of Firewhiskey.</p>
<p>Harry couldn’t wait.</p>
<p>He’d heard all about it from Dad, Sirius, and Remus. How it was one of the highlights of their time at Hogwarts. How Dad had finally convinced Mum to agree to a date. Mostly he just liked hearing Dad talk about Mum, since Harry didn’t remember her, much.</p>
<p>Finally, everything was packed and ready to go. Hermione helped Ron wrangle the bag with the tent into submission and then the three of them set out to the edge of the Weasleys’ garden, where they had a clear shot to Apparate to the meadow just outside of Hogsmeade.</p>
<p>It was four p.m. on Friday, July 17th. The sky was a clear, summery blue with gauzy white clouds drifting lazily across it. It had been overcast in Ottery St. Catchpole, but here the sun blazed its glory. It was warm, too. Harry felt sweat beginning to bead on the back of his neck and roll down his spine.</p>
<p>Hermione had landed just ahead and slightly to the left, while Ron wound up about three yards away. The distinctive CRACK of Apparation echoed across the meadow as more newly-made Hogwarts alumni trickled in.</p>
<p>Lavender Brown, Parvati and Padma Patil appeared together several feet away. Draco Malfoy, Pansy Parkinson, Gregory Goyle, and Vincent Crabbe were next, landing in a knot some yards distant, followed in quick succession by Neville Longbottom—who apparently came alone—Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott, Justin Finch-Fletchley, and Ernie Macmillian.</p>
<p>Blaise Zabini strolled toward Malfoy and the other Slytherins from the direction of the Three Broomsticks. He must’ve already been waiting for a while.</p>
<p>Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan appeared together some ways off, but even from this distance Harry could tell they were holding hands.</p>
<p>Everyone sort of gravitated together, forming a rough circle in the meadow.</p>
<p>“Is that everyone?” Hermione said, slipping into Head Girl mode and scanning the assembled crowd.</p>
<p>“Not quite,” came a smooth voice from almost directly behind Harry.</p>
<p>Hermione’s face lit up while Harry and Ron exchanged disgusted expressions. Unfortunately, Harry knew that voice very well.</p>
<p>“Hello, Tom,” Hermione said, warmly.</p>
<p>Tom Riddle, Slytherin Prefect, Head Boy, and all-around prat strolled over to take his place next to Hermione. Which, unfortunately, happened to be right beside Harry. Harry reluctantly scooted over to make room, and Riddle flashed a disgustingly dazzling smile at him.</p>
<p>Unwelcome heat crawled up Harry’s neck and he averted his gaze quickly, deciding the trampled grass was far more interesting than Riddle’s perfect teeth and dimples.</p>
<p>Harry and Ron had always despised Riddle, Malfoy, and the other Slytherins ever since first year. But this...whatever it was that Harry had started feeling around Tom Fucking Riddle was recent. It didn’t help that Hermione was on friendly terms with Riddle, saying that he wasn’t “as bad” as the rest of the Slytherins, especially in regard to blood purity.</p>
<p>Hermione, while very clever, had a bit of a blind spot for a pretty face. By the time they’d reached third year, Riddle had charmed almost the entire school. Harry, however, didn’t buy his act for a second.</p>
<p>He glanced up, briefly, and caught a glimpse of Riddle’s profile gilded by the setting sun, and looked away again, cursing his pounding heart and the fluttery feeling in his stomach. He refused to think he’d been caught in Riddle’s net of charm. He refused. For one thing, Ron would never ever let him live it down. Harry would have to fake his own death and start a new life in Argentina as an alpaca farmer.</p>
<p>Luckily, after this weekend he’d never have to see Riddle or his stupid pretty smile ever again. </p>
<p><br/> </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry! Watch out for the Singing Nettles!” Hermione called.</p>
<p>Harry pivoted in place and dropped the bag with the tent down in the middle of the path. Ron was right, it was resistant to Levitation Charms for some reason.</p>
<p>“Singing Nettles? Don’t you mean Stinging Nettles?” he asked, glancing at the cluster of plants.</p>
<p>“No, I do mean ‘Singing Nettles.’”</p>
<p>Just then, the breeze picked up, flowing through the trees and sending their leaves rattling. The nettles, now gently swaying, produced a sound not unlike a Heavenly Choir.</p>
<p>“Oh,” was all Harry said.</p>
<p>“Honestly, we covered Singing Nettles in third year Herbology!”</p>
<p>“You can’t expect us to remember third year Herbology. That was ages ago,” Ron said, setting his own pack down and stretching.</p>
<p>“So where should we set up?” Harry asked, deciding to head off another bickering session between his two best friends.</p>
<p>“I dunno, but we’d better find a place soon, or all the good spots will be taken,” Ron said.</p>
<p>“What ‘good spots?’” Hermione snapped. Her hair was coming loose from her bun and curling wildly all over from the heat. An errant strand stuck to the side of her face.</p>
<p>They’d been walking for the better part of an hour, and while it was not as hot in the shade of the Forest, the humidity more than made up for it, defeating even the best of Hermione’s self-cooling charms.</p>
<p>Finally, they found a spot that Harry thought looked promising. Harry glimpsed a small, sunlit clearing through the gnarled branches of thorny brush.</p>
<p>“What about this place?” he called, gesturing to the small opening in the thorns.</p>
<p>“Uh, mate, that’s a bush,” Ron said.</p>
<p>“I meant beyond the bush, you berk.”</p>
<p>Hermione came up to him and inspected it dubiously. “I’m not sure...it doesn’t look easy to get into.”</p>
<p>Harry rolled his eyes and gestured with his wand, muttering a spell Remus had taught him when he was thirteen. The thorny branches peeled backwards and arched neatly overhead, forming a tunnel. “Too bad we don’t have a way of getting through at all. It’s a shame we’re not wizards or anything.”</p>
<p>Hermione gave him a look that could best be described as “withering,” and gestured the bag with the tent through with her wand. The tent bag weakly flopped over a couple of times but eventually scooted itself through the tunnel, and Hermione flounced after, as if to prove a point.</p>
<p>Harry followed, ducking low so the thorns couldn’t catch on his hair. In the slanting, golden light of late afternoon, the small clearing looked almost like something out of a dream. Motes of pollen danced on the breeze, and even the biting gnats weren’t bad here. The thorny scrub trees encircled the entire clearing and above them, the great, gnarled oaks of the Forbidden Forest stretched skyward, with large boughs reaching towards the center of the opening, leaving only a small bit of sky. A large, moss-covered log could be seen above the soft, short grass. The place looked almost too idyllic to be real.</p>
<p>Harry was admiring the place and mentally patting himself on the back for finding such a good spot when he realized he and Hermione were the only ones in the clearing.</p>
<p>He looked back to find Ron, still on the other side of the thorny hedge, staring at the clearing in horror.</p>
<p>“Oi! Are you coming or what?” Harry called back.</p>
<p>“Uhhhh Harry? Hermione? I—I think you guys should come back right now,” Ron stammered. Even in the green gloom of the forest, Harry could see that he’d gone pale as a ghost.</p>
<p>“What? Why?” Harry looked around, almost expecting to see a swarm of Acromantulas descending upon him.</p>
<p>“That’s a Hawthorn grove,” Ron whispered, as if it explained everything.</p>
<p>“Oh, sure, <em> now </em> he cares about Herbology,” Hermione muttered.</p>
<p>“I dunno if I’d call this a ‘grove,’” Harry said, looking around. “Seems more like a hedge surrounding a clearing to me.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you should ask yourself why there’s a hedge surrounding a clearing in the middle of the Forbidden Forest,” Ron hissed, clutching his wand tightly and looking wildly around.</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. “It’s a magic forest?”</p>
<p>“We can’t camp here!” Ron’s voice was on the edge of cracking.</p>
<p>Hermione narrowed her eyes at him. “Oh really now, you don’t actually <em> believe </em> that rubbish, do you?”</p>
<p>Harry looked from one friend to the other, completely lost.</p>
<p>The breeze picked up. Harry could hear a crescendo of Singing Nettles from somewhere in the distance.</p>
<p>“Er. What rubbish?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>Hermione turned to look at Harry now. “That wizarding kind is descended from—” she made a derisive noise— “fairies.”</p>
<p>Harry blinked. “Oh. That.”</p>
<p>Harry <em> had </em> heard that, in fact. But Dad and Sirius had always dismissed it as an old witches’ tale. He’d never really given it any thought.</p>
<p>“Don’t talk about <em> them </em> like that!” Ron squeaked.</p>
<p>“Ron, I really don’t think we have anything to worry about,” Hermione said. “In fact, this looks like the perfect place to set up camp.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Dad and Sirius are purebloods and they always said that ‘descended from the Fair Folk’ thing was a load of crap,” Harry told him.</p>
<p>“My uncles Gideon and Fabian said they’ve seen things…” Ron trailed off.</p>
<p>“And didn’t you also say that Gideon and Fabian are basically the older versions of Fred and George?” Harry asked. “So maybe you should take everything they say with a grain of salt?”</p>
<p>“I wish we had some salt,” Ron muttered. But he grudgingly came through the tunnel anyway. “If we get kidnapped by the Good Neighbors I’m blaming you both.”</p>
