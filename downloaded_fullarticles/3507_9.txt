</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">Scorpius had told Albus that the water in the taps of the prefects’ baths contained different potions that cure spots and softened the skin. He brought Albus along to investigate during the Saturday lunch hour while everyone was downstairs. Although Albus thought he just wanted to placate him with a potion related task. Albus wasn't actually supposed to be there, so they made use of his father's invisibility cloak.</p><p>“And then Rose raised her hand and she has a new little bracelet, it had a rose on it,” Scorpius rambled recalling today's Rose encounter. Albus had heard boys talk about girls breasts and legs. Scorpius, on the other hand, had a strangely romantic, endearing, but nevertheless annoying way of rattling on about Rose, “Isn’t that cute?”</p><p>“Really cute.” Albus echoed back he leaned over the tub and filled a phials with the shining pink bath water and turned the faucet back off.</p><p>“So what do you think Albus?”</p><p>“It's a very weak beautification potion, probably.” Albus said giving the phial a good shake.</p><p>“No Albus, do you think Rose was laughing with me or at me?”</p><p>From the entrance of the room the boys could hear the scraping noise of stone on stone as Boris the Bewildered moved aside to let someone else in the bathroom. Albus felt his midsection get grabbed and pulled towards the back wall.</p><p>“Evanesco!” Scorpius hissed and the bathtub water evaporated from the tub. Scorpius ripped the invisibility cloak from Albus’ hands and threw it over them. Albus’ head hit the floor and he covered his mouth not to let out a groan. Scorpius swished his wand around to put up a muffling charm for them, “You’re head alright mate?” He asked patting Albus on the shoulder. He grunted and sat up rubbing the back of his head.</p><p>“Who is that guy?” asked Albus looking to Scorpius.</p><p>“Michael Wood, he's a Ravenclaw beater.” said Scorpius sounding far too pleased. With a flick of his wand Michael turned some of the taps on the tub. Michael carefully undressed leaving his clothes by the steps. Albus felt so nervous he thought for sure he would vomit. Michael had well-toned arms and muscles and was overall annoyingly perfect looking. When he got his pants off Albus was even more annoyed. Michael was a little bigger than average.</p><p>Michael laid back floating across the top of the water. His foot pushed off the side of the tub so he drifted towards the centre. Albus felt sheer panic his heart hammering in his chest. His eyes darting back over to Scorpius who was also watching Michael very carefully. Michael’s hand smoothed over his abdominal muscles back and forth playfully. Albus saw his cock get plumper as he relaxed in the warm soapy water and enjoyed the sensation of his own hand tickling the dark trail of hair leading to his stomach.  Michael sighed and lurched his head giving a nervous look around before putting his hand around himself. Albus felt like all the air had just been sucked out of the room. </p><p>His strokes started slow at first. He kept his head dipped into the water staring at the ceiling looking very tranquil. But what kept distracting Albus was how irregular Scorpius’ breathing had become. Michael waggled it around as it got stiffer. He pawed at his balls and played with his foreskin. Albus didn’t even fancy Michael, but he still felt stirred into interest. Soon his cock would be threatening to press against the zipper of his trousers. Albus tried to discreetly reposition it in his pants. Michael looked down at himself in time to see a fat bead of pre-cum slide down the side. Albus' eyes looked down to Scorpius groin to see he was palming himself in his hand. Albus’ heart skipped a beat. At first, he thought Scorpius was trying to reposition too, but his hand stayed and then moved outlining his member in his pants. Michael pumped himself faster and faster. His face, chest and cock getting flushed. Michael let out a hiss as a thick stream of cum poured from the head of his cock into the bath. Scorpius' breathing just got louder. Albus' heart continued to hammer in his chest. Scorpius leaned forward his pale blond hair covering his eyes. Albus just watched his mouth go slack,</p><p>“Oh… oh… oh no.” And then he stilled. Scorpius had ejaculated into his pants in front of Albus. Albus felt overwhelmed, but he couldn’t come. He looked from the wet spot in Scorpius pants to the cum floating along top the water as Michael caught his breath. He felt completely unsatisfied.</p><p>Back in their dormitory Scorpius was blushing and took a big breath for bravery, “I guess this is obvious now… but I fancy blokes.” He gave a happy sort of shrug, “I fancy girls too.” he added, ”I didn’t lie about having my eye on Rose or anything.”</p><p>“I think I only fancy blokes.” said Albus eyes avioding Scorpius gaze. He trying to keep the grimness from his voice. Scorpius didn’t look surprised and his smile didn’t fade.<br/> <br/> “Well, you played that really cool, I was the one that sounded like a dying cat the whole time.” That was not how Albus would describe it at all and just the thought of the noises stirred him up again.</p><p>“I thought for sure we’d be caught.” said Albus taking in a shaky breath.</p><p>“It was kinda amazing, wasn’t it?” asked Scorpius with stars in his eyes. Albus could only blush and look away.</p><p>“Albus...” Scorpius was breaking down into laughter.</p><p>“What?” asked Albus slowly. Scorpius pointed to Albus’ groin where his cock was still tenting his pants pushing against the zipper. Albus sighed using his school robe to shield himself.</p><hr/><p><br/> The following Saturday they did not return to the prefects’ bathroom. They sat at their table alone together. Scorpius looked around the room his eyes looking a bit wild. Albus suspected he was searching for Michael Wood at the Ravenclaw table, but he never appeared. Albus had his quill and was writing to his father. Albus attempted this thankless task every few weeks.</p><p align="center">
  <em> Dear Dad,<br/> </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> I was thinking the other day brewing potions is actually a lot like cooking. You measure the ingredients and add them together. Just instead of sugar, eggs and milk it's porcupine quills, dried nettles and crushed snake fangs. How did you feel about potions class when you were in school? I mean Severus was your potions teacher, right? </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> -Albus </em>
</p><p>When Albus was two years old his father quit his job as an Auror. After that day he did all the cooking for their family. Every morning as far back as Albus could remember he would come downstairs to a feast. There were plates of kippers, sausage, bacon and eggs. A tall pitcher of orange juice and the centrepiece a heavy tray holding mountains of toast. Albus could count on that toast being on that table more confidently than he could that the sun would rise.</p><p>His father’s obsession wasn't limited to breakfast, it extended to every meal. There would be chicken at noon and then roast beef at dinner.</p><p>Sometimes a fresh treacle tart would appear next to Albus when he was reading in the parlour. It would sit there meekly wafting its sweet smell. At the end of the night Albus could find his father staring vacantly out the window letting his charms clean plates and wipe down counters.</p><p>Albus had heard that his father use to be brave and hotheaded. The man he knew was quiet and humbled. When Albus wrote to his father telling him what house he had been put in he sent back a chocolate cauldron, Albus’ favourite candy. On his O.W.L.s Albus had gotten an O in Potions, but a D in Defence Against the Dark Arts. His father said nothing to him, but he left a small chocolate cake outside his bedroom door.</p><p>Albus had been informed by teachers, strangers and old dusty newspapers that his father was the most powerful wizard in the world. But the only magic Albus had ever seen his old man cast were charms to make the cooking and cleaning go faster.</p><p>Another entire week came and went. The lunch hour spent at the prefects' bath was a weird fever dream. The only proof Albus had that it really happened was Scorpius’ change in behaviour. He had become a lot less talkative and only mentioned Rose once in the past two weeks. </p><p>Albus’ received a reply to his latest attempt to reach out to his father. His father did what he was infamous for doing. He took nearly a whole week to reply. (It was now Friday evening.) and when he finally did he gave a short answer barely worth the parchment it was written on. And of course, his father had attached a small box with a chocolate cauldron inside.</p><p align="center"><em>I didn’t like potions class.</em><br/> <em> My professor wasn’t very nice to me.</em><br/> <em> Mum says hello.</em></p><p>Albus silently fumed at the table alone because Scorpius had magically vanished on their way down to dinner.</p><p>That night a pale tired looking Scorpius came into the dormitory to find Albus hunched over his copper cauldron on the floor. He hastily dumped porcupine quills into his cauldron and began to peel a shriveled fig with a silver knife as Scorpius skittishly approached, “My dad’s such a git!”</p><p>Scorpius carefully walked around Albus and his brew to sit on his bed. Scorpius nervously watched the knife come close to Albus’ thumb with each pass, “Years he’s done this, years.”</p><p>The shriveled fig went in with a loud splash and Albus began to aggressively stir counting numbers under his breath. Albus pulled his old ingredients chest from his school trunk. It was a banged up wooden box that squeaked when you opened the lid. When it was opened the smell of too many contrasting scents invaded the room.</p><p>Albus dropped a pouch of the pearly white sopophorous beans spilled all over the carpet when he only needed a few. The wormwood and peppermint sprigs were on the scales for only a few moments. Scorpius watched the spoon go around six more times before the colour changed.</p><p>Albus could finally breathe once the cauldron glowed like a pot of honey and a small rainbow sputtered forth from a bubble popping on the surface. He nodded content for a moment, “This is good.” He said pushing the ladle through the potion admiring it’s thick golden texture, “It worked.” </p><p>“It’s too afraid of you to not work.” murmured Scorpius into his pillow.</p><p>Albus took two tin cups from his trunk and with a shaking hand poured them some of the sunshine elixir, “What will this do?” asked Scorpius timidly making room for Albus to sit on his bed, “It’ll cheer us up.” explained Albus handing Scorpius a cup. They admired the golden liquid and the delicious smell greeting them. It seemed alive and always threatening to bubble up again.</p><p>They drank together, it tasted sickeningly sweet. The more Albus had of it the more delicious it tasted. Giddy bubbles were rising somewhere from his stomach sending out excited waves of energy through his every finger. Scorpius drank his slowly. His lips started twitching like he was holding back laughter. He began to giggle Albus did too. Soon they were both laughing at each other laughing until Albus had to make himself stop for air.</p><p>The happiness was continually blooming in his chest and the worry melted off of him, “Did you give me a love potion?” asked Scorpius looking across to Albus. Albus tried to process the question. He wanted to say something smart or flirtatious, but he only managed the real answer.</p><p>“It’s a euphoria potion,” Albus said between gulps, “It’s for depression.”</p><p>“You’re depressed?” he blurted out his light grey eyes widening. The only thing that Albus’ mind could focus on was the hum of some intangible buoyant feeling and the physical sensations on his body. As well as how much the muscles in his cheeks hurt from laughing. </p><p>“I just like making potions for you.” confessed Albus placing his empty tin cup on the bedside table. His body took in how soft quilt under his skin was and he appreciated how Scorpius’ bed smelled different from his own. It was from a musky cologne he used very seldom. It was very overpowering, but it got more appealing as it wore off.  He watched Scorpius smiling to himself with his eyes shut. He was too distracted by the humming of his body to talk.</p><p>Albus wondered if he stopped talking to Scorpius if his crush would go away. He would never do that because he was his only friend. He still wondered in some alternative universe if he had a chance to get over this. Maybe if he didn’t have to be around him all the time it would be easier.<br/> <br/> Maybe if he didn't feel like he had a chance it would be easier. Albus felt so strange these days, he felt like he was always either waiting for an opportunity to tell Scorpius how he felt. Even if he said no, it just felt like it needed to be said.<br/> <br/> “I can’t stop thinking about Michael Wood,” sighed Scorpius. Albus felt his heart in his throat turning to his friend. </p><p>“I feel like I have withdrawals.” laughed Scorpius. He had kind of a guilty look on his face.</p><p>“I hung around by that statue of Boris the Bewildered last Saturday. Michael went in, I think he uses the bathroom every Saturday while everyone was down at lunch to rub one out,” Scorpius turned his head towards Albus with a  pleading look in his eyes, “That means he’ll be there tomorrow at noon.”</p><p>“You wanna spy on him again?”</p><p>“Is that really bad?”</p><p>“Yeah… sorta.”</p><p>It was <em>very</em> bad. Saving their skins when it was an accident was one thing but, <em>this</em> was another. Albus noted how rigid Scorpius got on the bed. The opportunity to see him like that again was too tempting, and the thought of disappointing him was too much to bare, “But… what’s the point of being in Slytherin if you don’t break the rules from time to time, <em>right</em>?”</p><p>Albus’ mind turned to his journal and a particular concoction he had always wanted to tell someone about. And if Albus was going to watch Scorpius fall for another boy he might as well get something more out of it.</p><p>“I could...” He could barely say it.</p><p>“I could make you some special stuff for tomorrow.”</p><p>“stuff?” Scorpius asked slowly.</p><p>Albus felt his face turning red so his eyes drifted away, “It’s a potion that makes getting off feel better.”</p><p>Scorpius laughed trying to sit up, “What are you up to when you’re alone Albus!?” The energy of the laugh propelled Albus up. He felt like it was too late to chicken out now.</p><p>“It’s something I made on summer holiday.” explained Albus stumbling from the bed to his book bag and found his old beat up journal with a basil green cover. He flipped through the pages until he found the entry from last July. The potion was one of the select few that had no name or description of its effects.</p><p align="center">
  <u> <em> pewter cauldron </em> </u>

  <em> pearl dust </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em> powdered moonstone </em>
</p><p align="center">dragon blood</p><p>Albus turned to his ingredients chest he picked up his bottle of dried billywig stings and shook them noting he had more than enough. Flobberworm mucus was mostly to thicken potions so he had gallons of it around. But this still left the bottom four ingredients, “I’m missing four ingredients I’ll need to brew this.”</p><p>“We’ll have to go to J. Pippin's Potions first thing.”</p><p>“This takes nearly six hours to brew.”</p><p>Scorpius looked discouraged, but only for a moment, “So we swipe it from the school and start brewing before breakfast?”</p><p>“Set an alarm charm for half-past four.”</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">. . .</p><p><br/> <br/> Albus woke up a few minutes before Scorpius' charm. He took the quiet moment to watch the green light of the lake dance on Scorpius’ face.<br/> He curled into the warmth of his blankets and fell back asleep.</p>
