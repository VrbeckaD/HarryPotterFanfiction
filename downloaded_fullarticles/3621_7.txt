    <p>"Not a lot of Slytherins have shown up for eighth year," Hermione pointed out as she, Harry and Ron looked around what was left of the great hall, Most of the Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff tables were full of students eating talking with each other. Except for the Slytherin table. More than half were gone, and they were the quietest one of the bunch. </p>
<p>Although a few recognisable faces were there, Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott, and, ugh, Draco Malfoy. Harry did have to admit, not for the first time or thirty-seventh time, that Hermione was right. </p>
<p>"Yeah, but a lot of them are making up for what their parents did with the other Death Eaters," Ron said before he took a large gulp of pumpkin juice. </p>
<p>"Yeah fair enough Ron."</p>
<p>Ron looked behind Harry's shoulder, and over to the Slytherin table. And then back at his friends. Harry wondered if Ron had seen something weird, but then again at Hogwarts, everything is weird. </p>
<p>"Oi Harry, Malfoy's staring at you again." </p>
<p>Harry rolled his eyes, "When is he not staring at me Ron? Probably plotting on how he's going to get revenge for his father on me." Hermione didn't look too sure. She thought it was different somehow. She had noticed that it wasn't the usual malicious stare but more of a dreamy stare-at-a-crush stare. But she didn't dare mention that to Harry. </p>
<p>                                                                                 -*&lt;&gt;*-<br/>
When the bell rang to signal the end of lunch, Draco was relived as he was pretty sure Pansy had noticed him staring at Potter and he didn't want her to get any ideas. Fortunately Pansy had Transfiguration at that point so she couldn't question Draco at that point but he was sure she would later on. Draco had a free period so he went up to the room he was bunking in with another person but he didn't know who it was. He'd find out eventually.</p>
<p>He walked up the stairs to their room, it had quite a nice view looking over the lake and giant squid. Draco had already dumped his stuff on his side that he had claimed near the window. Flopping down on his bed, he saw that the other person had moved their stuff in already. The trunk was under the bed but, to his horror he could see the initials. Merlin, did the universe hate him? The H and P were unmistakable. He was bunking with Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Of course it had to be Potter. Harry bloody Potter.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Draco did not hate Harry. He had his weird crush/frenemies thing for him. But if Draco did go after him, was Harry into guys? He had a faint memory of Harry mentioning to his friends (he may have been eavesdropping) that he may be bi. But Draco wasn't sure if the statement still stood.</p>
<p>Harry did have that short thing with Ginny Weasley, they had broken when Ginny realised she was a lesbian and started dating Luna Lovegood. So he knew for a fact Harry was single. Hermione and Ron weren't much of a chance as they were dating. </p>
<p>So was Harry available? Yes. Was he wanting to date Draco? Have to get back to you on that one.</p>
<p>Draco felt the blood rushing to his face when he thought of him and Harry doing nice date-y stuff. Ugh Potter will be the death of him.</p>
<p>                        *&lt;&gt;*</p>
<p>After all of his classes Harry was exhausted. When McGonagall said eighth year would be hard she wasn't kidding. The only one who managed to do something was Hermione but even she didn't do much. God Harry just wanted to sleep for a week.</p>
<p>He painstakingly climbed up the stairs to his shared dorm with someone.</p>
<p>He absentmindedly wondered who it was, he hoped it was someone decent, like Dean or Seamus. But no. </p>
<p>He was sharing with one and only Draco Malfoy. Ugh this was going to be a long year.</p>
