<p>The Secret Garden</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Entering the garden, Harry called out, “Severus? Are you here?” </p>
<p>“Looking for someone special?” murmured someone behind him. “Or will anyone do?”</p>
<p>Harry smiled as he was embraced. “We’ll have to be quick. My boyfriend’s meeting me here soon.” </p>
<p>“He’s an idiot for making you wait.” </p>
<p>Laughing, Harry spun around. “Actually, he’s the smartest person I know.” </p>
<p>“Liar.” Severus smirked. “You’re friends with the smartest witch of the age, remember?” </p>
<p>“A white lie, maybe.” Looping his arms around Severus’ neck, Harry whispered, “You really want to discuss <i>this</i> when we could be doing something more fun?”</p>
<p>“Definitely not.” Capturing Harry’s mouth, Severus walked him backwards until the back of Harry’s legs hit…something. Smirking, Severus pushed him down onto…a bed?</p>
<p>Lying back, Harry looked around at the bed, shaded by a canopy of greenery. “Why’s there a bed here?”</p>
<p>Severus chuckled. “Why do you think?”</p>
<p>Laughing, Harry spread his legs, letting Severus settle between them. “Then what are we waiting for?”</p>
<p>Severus Banished their clothes. “Not a damn thing,” <br/>he growled, positioning Harry’s legs over his shoulders. “<i>Lubricus</i>.”</p>
<p>“Mmm, my favourite spell,” moaned Harry as Severus’ fingers slid inside him, stretching him open. </p>
<p>“It’s amongst…my favourites…too,” said Severus, his eyes trained on Harry’s face. “I love watching you.”</p>
<p>Arching his back, Harry tried to pull Severus’ fingers deeper. “Love…you…too.” </p>
<p>Kissing him, Severus pressed a third finger in, swallowing Harry’s moans and gasps. When he drew back, it was only long enough to position his cock and thrust. </p>
<p>“Yes!” Harry whimpered against Severus’ mouth.</p>
<p>Moving slowly at first, Severus moved out, then in, setting up a teasing rhythm that sent delicious shocks up Harry’s spine. </p>
<p>Feeling every inch of Severus, Harry locked his ankles around his shoulders, hanging on. Before he knew it, he was coming, cock spurting all over himself and Severus.</p>
<p>Speeding up, Severus’ rhythm went rough until, burying his face in the curve of Harry’s neck, he came, hips shuddering against Harry’s. </p>
<p>“Wow,” breathed Harry. “Brilliant.” </p>
<p>“Agreed.” </p>
<p>Harry hummed. “So, now we’ve used your special secret bed in your secret garden, can we go inside and use a regular bed?” </p>
<p>Severus laughed. “I believe that can be arranged.” </p>
