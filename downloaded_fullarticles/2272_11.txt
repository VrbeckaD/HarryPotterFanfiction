    <p>Frogs, mud and dragons hold more interest for Teddy than people do. <em>Not to worry,</em> say the adults fondly, <em>he’s only young. There’s plenty of time for that later.</em> But nothing changes when he gets older, which is the crux of the matter, really.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>Teddy doesn’t make a habit of it, swearing and flipping the bird like tiny Victoire. She has a foul mouth regardless of whether she’s speaking English or French. She only curses where adults can’t hear or see her, because she’s sensible, as she likes to primly tell Teddy when she squirms her way out of getting into trouble. She bats her eyelashes and smiles weetly enough that nobody could possibly suspect her of cursing like a sailor.<p>Teddy hasn’t decided whether he likes Victoire or not yet. She doesn’t like the same things that he likes, but she knows the alphabet backwards and can eat two bananas in under a minute. It’s impressive, even when she’s sick afterwards. </p><p>“Don't know what you were thinking,” Molly Weasley says, tutting as she sends plates pinwheeling across the garden table. “Honestly, the manners in this family. Anyone would think you’d all been raised by wolves!”</p><p>Teddy scowls, scuffing his shoe along the tips of the grass. He was <em>thinking</em> that he might as well try it. Swearing is for grown-ups, sure, but he’s seven, and that feels grown up enough to say whatever he wants. It had been exciting at first. There was a bit of a thrill in his chest, like the fizz of stolen champagne, and then the words popped out of his mouth and everything caught up with him.</p><p>He regrets it now, slouching in a scratchy jumper—not part of the punishment, but still uncomfortable enough to feel like one—while he watches some of his godparents’ friends’ sister’s nieces run around the Burrow garden. One of them’s got hair that looks like spiky dragon fire, blown upwards. Teddy doesn’t know her name, or why she’s there. There’s a party or something, but he’s not sure because he’s been purposely avoiding all the boring information about it.</p><p>The girl whirls around, the hem of her baggy jumper flying out like a fuzzy fan. Teddy stares, intrigued by the colour, wondering if he can replicate it. He’s getting better at changing his hair colour on command these days, and not just letting it ‘run riot with his emotions.’ </p><p>Someone hiccups beside him. Teddy turns, scrunching his nose up reflexively, feeling it shrink to the size of a button mushroom. Ginny’s Great Aunt Muriel lets her hiccups take on a flavour of distaste at this blatant display of magic. Teddy doesn’t like her, or the way she smells. She wears a dress that could also be a tent, in the right circumstance, and she wields a glass of burgundy alcohol like it’s a pointer stick. </p><p>“What’s all this about you being in trouble then, boy?”</p><p>Teddy frowns, shrugging slightly. He turns back to the girl with the baggy jumper, commiting the colour to memory. </p><p>Great Aunt Muriel tuts, following his gaze. “Oh, I see. It’s all downhill from here, Molly.” She chortles knowingly, bangles jangling on her wrist. “You’re about the age, aren’t you, ay, Teddy?”</p><p>Ron said, the other day, when he thought Teddy wasn’t listening, that he didn't know how Great Aunt Muriel was still alive, and that it must be spite keeping her alive. Teddy doesn’t think she can even remember yesterday, let alone remember enough to make ass-ump-shuns about what he should or should not be doing as a seven-year-old. </p><p>“The age for saying <em>fuck?”</em> Teddy asks sourly. </p><p>He spends the rest of the evening confined to Ron’s old room, wondering what Ginny’s Great Aunt Muriel could see that he just can’t.</p><p>He sits in the window for a bit, staring out at the party going on outside. It seems less boring now that he’s not allowed to join in with it. Music drifts up from the garden, led by one of George’s runaway drums, part of a matched set that beat you back with bigger sticks when you got the tempo wrong. </p><p>Sulking, Teddy jumps up and stands in front of Ron’s mirror, covered in a light sheen of dust, and squints until his eyes change colour. He gets them to turn blue by thinking of the sea, the way the light glints off it sometimes in the holiday brochures Gran keeps on her side-table. He pictures new leaves and long, wavy grass; his eyes fade to a deep, dark green. Not exactly the right shade, but close enough. He tries thinking of candyfloss for a bit, but nothing turns pink except for his cheeks, and that might just be a frustrated flush. </p><p>With a sigh, Teddy sits down on the carpet. Ron’s room is bare, just the old bed covered in faded orange sheets, and the bright walls, paler in some places where posters had blanketed them. There’s no toys or drawing things, nothing exciting to do. He’s already eaten his sandwich, and there’s half a glass of juice left beside it. </p><p>His only other companions come in the form of a few books that mostly likely belong to Molly, if he has to make a guess. </p><p>“I’m bored,” Teddy whines, listening to his voice ping off the window and the walls. He collapses against the ground like a starfish, flat on his back, and sighs deeply. </p><p>One of the books falls off the shelf, startling him. It lands with a thud on the ground and tips over, opening roughly halfway through the story. Teddy turns his head on the ground, resting his cheek on the musty carpet, and frowns when the pages start to move.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>By the time Teddy reaches the age of twelve, he’s well-versed in discarding boxes left and right. People seem to have an obsession with them. <em>Which one do you fit in?</em> they ask. <em>What do you call yourself? Why do you like wearing that? Who do you like? Why’ve you got that look in your eye that says you want to punch me for being a nosy git?</em><p>Teddy doesn’t want to be inside a box. There’s no appeal there. It’s constricting and tight and—anyway, there isn’t one that fits him perfectly. Too small or too big, not enough room to walk around and add a few homely touches, like Gran says you have to do with new, untouched spaces. </p><p>He’s happy enough with spells and ink and parchment. He’s happy enough with the woods outside, with smuggled Bowtruckles and pockets full of creature treats, with his yellow tie and <em>bluegreenpink</em> hair. He’s happy enough with books in the library, read between the stacks, books about dragons, potions and the history of the world.</p><p>It’s a secret, but sometimes. Sometimes, if he thinks very carefully about what he wants to happen, he can coax pictures from the books. If he knows the story well, he can make it come alive with just his hands and his voice. But it’s a secret. He doesn’t tell anybody about that, because it’s quite hard to find any reference to such spells in the texts in the library, and Teddy never actually knows how he’s doing it. He just feels it, the words and the story, and the fizz of the paper beneath his fingers, and there go the pictures. </p><p>There’s a girl that wants to hold his hand and probably kiss him, in second year, when he’s twelve and well-versed in lobbing boxes out the window whenever someone passes one his way. Her name’s Melody something-or-other, and she’s got a voice as sweet as her name, but she giggles too much and doesn’t like traipsing through the mud in the forest they’re not supposed to go in. Which is fair enough, because she flies really fast on a broom and not everybody likes mud, so it sort of balances it out. And the giggling is okay in small doses. </p><p>“Whatcha gonna do when you go out with her, Teddy?” Buggy says. He’s the giggly plump boy in Teddy’s dorm, with nice soft hair and shiny shoes. Teddy’s favourite thing about him is the way he can do a headstand on command, and how good he is at Gobstones. Sometimes he lets Teddy copy his Potions notes because Teddy’s hand-writing is atrocious, and he can’t always read what he’s written, especially not when he wrote it in the smoky haze of the dungeons, where it’s hard to see his own hand. </p><p>Teddy shrugs, flat on his back in his bed, and expels a world-weary sigh. “I dunno, I mean. We’re a bit young for dates, aren’t we? So we’ll probably just go for a walk or something. This would be easier if it was next year and I could take her to Hogsmeade.”</p><p>“Yeah, we all know you’re a big romantic. But what are you gonna <em>do?”</em></p><p>There’s special emphasis there that gives Teddy pause. He’s not stupid, and he knows what Buggy means, but the answer is: nothing. And even if he wasn’t twelve and nervous, the answer would still be the same. They’re not going to do anything, not the way Buggy means. Teddy doesn’t even feel a particular inclination to hold her hand, if he’s honest. But he can’t say that to a room full of his friends. </p><p>So he says, “Probably kiss her and stuff.”</p><p>There’s more giggling all around the room. Teddy scrunches up his nose. Giggling tends to be a reaction to something funny. Did he say the wrong thing? Or is it supposed to be funny and silly, what they’re feeling at this age? Maybe he’s just not feeling it right. Or maybe <em>he’s</em> not right. </p><p>“I wonder what it’s like,” Danny says. “Kissing, I mean.” </p><p>Danny always pretends like he’s too serious for this kind of talk, but ends up getting sucked in anyway. He taps his pen against the desk near the far window and blushes when Teddy turns his head thoughtfully, to look at him sideways. </p><p>“I bet it’s nice,” Sam decides, voice muffled by his pillow. He hasn’t moved in a while, and Teddy would be concerned, but Sam is basically the human version of a sloth. “Bet it’s really nice. That’s what people do, innit? They kiss each other all the time. You wouldn’t do that if you didn't like it, if it weren’t nice.”</p><p>Teddy feels his eyebrows go up. That’s too black-and-white for it to be the truth. People do things for all kinds of reasons. He turns it over in his mind, frowning faintly. It’s never really occurred to him that if it doesn't feel nice, he doesn't have to do it. Surely there’s more to it than that. It’s sort of just expected, isn’t it? Kissing? So what happens when you don't want to do it?</p><p>Did he have to say yes, when Melody asked him out? Maybe he could have said no. </p><p>“What do you think it’s like, Ted?” Buggy asks. Danny stops tapping his pen, his blush getting worse as he pretends not to wait for an answer. Sam kicks one leg that’s half under the covers and grunts impatiently. </p><p>Teddy doesn’t know why they always have to ask him. He’s not rude or impolite, but he’s not the most welcoming of people either. Not purposefully, anyway. And yet it doesn’t seem to stop people wanting to make him laugh or go for walks or play Quidditch. </p><p>Harry says it’s because Teddy’s got this something special about him, but he’s been saying that ever since he walked into Ron’s room and found Teddy alone on the floor, surrounded by paper chains in varying lengths and boats and hats and fluttering birds, where before there wasn’t even any paper. Molly’s book had been undamaged, full to the brim of its pages, but closer inspection of the paper chains revealed the same print from the book on each link. Teddy could never explain it, the way the pages peeled away and multiplied in his hands, and how he knew exactly what to do to make the boats float in the air. Nor could he explain some of the more complicated paper braids stuffed under his thighs. His hands just did what he wanted them to do, and he felt his way along the paper, folding it with care. </p><p>And Harry hadn’t said much beyond a firm request for him not to swear again. But he’d looked at Teddy differently, like he was waiting for something, like he was something special. </p><p>To be fair, Harry always said there was something special about Teddy, even before that day. </p><p>“Ted?” </p><p>“I expect it’s nice,” Teddy says carefully. “And wet, too.”</p><p>There’s more giggling. Teddy doesn’t know if they agree or not: they don't say so through the laughter. He decides to join in rather than let it worry him. </p><p>He doesn’t kiss Melody and stuff. He shows her Eggbert, the Glurvian snail that lives behind Greenhouse Two, and she turns a strange shade of green before scarpering. She’s a dainty thing, but she runs fast like a whippet when she wants to, as fast as she flies. Teddy watches her sprint away in admiration, and then turns to feed Eggbert a nice crunchy stem. </p><p>“I guess I’m just not cut out for this kissing stuff,” Teddy tells Eggbert, aware that talking to a snail is probably one of the reasons why he’s not cut out for this kissing stuff. He’s secretly relieved. “But it’s alright, I think. Harry said he didn't have a first kiss until he was fourteen, and it wasn’t a great one. Very wet, he said, and sad.”</p><p>Eggbert oozes, seemingly in agreement, but otherwise chooses to keep his opinions to himself. </p><p>“She was really nice, but it didn't work out,” Teddy says, shrugging, when Buggy asks about Melody later. “I guess it has to be right, doesn’t it?”</p><p>Buggy looks devastated at the concept, as though the world has fallen apart at his feet. Sam eyes him, sprawled all over his bed again, where Teddy’s pretty sure he lives. Danny’s not in, but Teddy’s kind of glad about one less set of eyes, since it seems like he’s being stared at from all angles. </p><p>“Yeah, Ted,” Sam says, flashing him a quick, almost pitying smile while Buggy bemoans the state of the world. “Reckon it does.”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>Victoire is beautiful. Even though she’s still growing, and has acne on her chin that she hides with magic, and split ends that enrage her on the daily, and all of those things seem to make her think otherwise, she’s still very beautiful. Teddy knows this because she tells him so every five minutes (despite thinking otherwise often) and because boys and girls fall at her feet wherever they walk, and because he has eyeballs in his head that work perfectly fine.<p>“Well you never look at anyone with them,” Victoire says, rolling her shoulders as she bends to pick up the Quaffle. They sneak out every Friday, close to when evening falls, to grab one from the Quidditch cupboard and throw it around near the treeline of the Forbidden Forest for a bit. Birds caw in the trees, squabbling specks amongst the crowds of leaves. </p><p>“I look at loads of people.” Teddy frowns, catching the ball easily when Victoire throws it at him. “We go to a school that’s also a huge castle.” He waggles his eyebrows. “People are everywhere. It’s hard not to look at them. Look, see, I’m looking at you right now.”</p><p>Victoire blows a raspberry at him. “No. You look at people like they’re projects sometimes, or like they’re the riddle to get you into Ravenclaw Tower. And you look at people normally, you know, how most people do. But you don't stare the way most boys do. You don't goggle.”</p><p>Teddy tosses the ball back, watching it soar towards her. “Goggle?”</p><p>Victoire catches it, nodding firmly. “Goggle.” She lets her mouth hang open, her eyes half-crossing as they glaze over. “Like that. Like the way Ron looks at a honey-roast ham.”</p><p>Teddy’s still chortling from the face she pulled, but the comment makes him crack up again. He misses the Quaffle when she chucks it his way, and she sighs, dropping down on the ground and waiting for him to join her. Apparently the game is over, Teddy thinks, watching her settle down fondly. She has the sun on her neck, and the breeze in her long blonde hair, and she rests her head on his shoulder when he crosses his legs under him beside her. </p><p>“It’s funny. I’m glad you’re not a pig, but of all the people in this place, you’re the only one I wouldn’t mind looking at me like that.”</p><p>Victoire’s always blatant and confident with her words. These ones are wistful. Teddy feels a sharp ache in his stomach and half-twists to try and look at her. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” he says. “I don't—I don't know why.”</p><p>It feels like the words get stuck on the way out of his mouth. They catch on his teeth and his sandpaper tongue, and they fall into the air, shredded and painful. Victoire gathers them up in her sensible way, sitting up to look at him. </p><p>“You don't know why you don't ogle people like they’re pieces of meat?” Victoire says, cocking one eyebrow. “You don't know why I’m glad you’re not a pig?”</p><p>Teddy shakes his head. He’s not actually sorry, but he feels as though he should be. He likes the yellow of the sun where it meets Victoire’s hair, so he turns his own hair a soft daffodil hue. She clicks her tongue, reaching up to card a hand through it.</p><p>“Don't change, Teddy. Not for other people.”</p><p>Teddy likes the way she says it. He puts his hand in his pocket and produces a small square of paper. He keeps three-point folds and valley creases about his person all the time, much smaller than they need to be. </p><p>It only takes a bit of thought, holding the paper in his hand, for it to grow to the size he needs and split in half. Victoire watches, captivated, her sharp eyes following the movements of his fingers as he folds each square and creases the paper delicately, until he has a stem and a flower, both pressed flat and no bigger than his hand when put together. The flower, he touches to his hair, just gently, until the white paper dyes itself yellow. The stem rests on the grass until it deepens to green. </p><p>“I won’t change if you don't tell,” Teddy says. </p><p>Then he breathes the two together and gifts Victoire with a paper daffodil that will never wilts; the petals open up in her hands.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>Teddy stops worrying so much as he works his way through Hogwarts. He folds shapes out of paper in class and throws them at his mates, grinning. Sam keeps a paper blue brachiosaurus by his bed at all times, gifted to him by Teddy when he first learned about the Muggle branch of paleontology. He gives girls paper flows all the time, although never a daffodil, and tries only once to bribe McGonagall with a paper tabby cat. The bribe doesn’t work, and Teddy still gets a detention for sneaking into the kitchen after hours, but McGonagall keeps the cat on her desk. Teddy spots it washing its crinkly paw with a flat, sandpaper tongue one morning and can’t stop grinning for the rest of the day.<p>He’s famous for being the nicest Hufflepuff to ever grace the halls. He’s weirdly popular, considering he never dates anyone. </p><p>The summer before his last year, Teddy spends it at the Potter’s house, soaking up the sun in the garden. He avoids paper in case anyone catches him folding it—it’s still a secret at home, sort of—and takes James fishing in the afternoons. </p><p>His favourite thing about James is that he never shuts up, never slows down his words, and yet they all seem equally as important as the last. He says things with such emotion packed into the words that it’s hard not to get swept along with the story, even when the story is just James enthusing about salt and vinegar crisps or babbling, star-struck, about how Krum came to visit Fleur last summer and ruffled James’s hair <em>with his snitch-catching hands.</em> </p><p>Fishing generally requires a quiet atmosphere, but it’s one of the only things that Teddy does that nobody else wants to join in with, so it’s really the only time he gets to spend alone with James. He’s sixteen to James’s ten. They’re not particularly close, but there’s something fascinating about James’s enthusiasm for life, and he’s cheeky and funny, bright and kind. Teddy never used to take much interest in people, but now he finds that they can be just as intriguing as dragons and frogs and mud. Just maybe not in the way everyone else explained they would be. </p><p>“What’s it really like?” James asks, upside down on the grassy bank, shoes kicked off and bare toes wiggling in the sun. “Hogwarts, I mean. Dad says it’s loads of fun, and the safest place in the world like that’s the most important part, even though I’m not in danger, y’know?” </p><p>Teddy tries to arrange his expression into something that might encompass his feelings for all his years at Hogwarts so far. It falls short, but James laughs anyway. </p><p>“It’s still a school,” Teddy says, adjusting his grip on the fishing rod slightly. “The classes are brilliant, but you still have to do homework. And Quidditch is fun too.” </p><p>“You’d think with all the reading you do that you’d be better at this,” James comments, rolling over onto his stomach, where he props his chin on his hands. “Come on, Teddy. Where’s the emotion? The description? The adventure, the magic! You have to make me believe it.”</p><p>“We’re not all giant show-offs.”</p><p>“Oi!”</p><p>James scrambles up indignantly, but he’s grinning far too proudly for it to be a believable protest. James knows exactly what he’s like and who he is, even at ten. It would be annoying, but it’s basically impossible to be annoyed at James. Instead, Teddy finds it endearing. </p><p>“It’s either be a nerd or a show-off, and I like my label better than yours, <em>nerd.”</em> James plucks a handful of grass out of the ground and throws it at Teddy. “C’mon, Teddy, I want to know about Hogwarts.”</p><p>“You’re going to be there next year!”</p><p>James scrunches his nose up, shredding a blade of grass. “Yeah, exactly. That’s ages away. Show me some magic or something!”</p><p>“I’m not of age yet,” Teddy says, shaking his head with a grin, but even as he says it, he’s thinking of all the things he could do. Because he has done magic before now, at home, and it wasn’t accidental. It was quite purposeful, in fact. </p><p>He fashioned a lightbulb out of paper when the lamp at Gran’s stopped working. It still glows even now, when the bulb is twisted half a centimeter to the left. There’s a paper plant in the windowsill of Harry’s study, a gift to the only person in his family barring Victoire that knows Teddy can do strange and wonderful things with paper. Harry told him it had grown three new pink paper buds in the past week alone.</p><p>James expels a dramatic sigh, flopping face-first into the grass. “Can’t even put your nerdiness to good use.”</p><p>Teddy straightens up, narrowing his eyes at James’s sprawled form. That does it. He’s not about to be showed up by a bratty ten-year old. </p><p>The river he’s fishing in is cool, a steady stream that runs through banks of dandelion-infested grass. Teddy shifts on the rock he claimed when they arrived, and props the fishing rod up between his knees. He hasn’t caught anything the whole time they’ve been here, too busy laughing at James to pay much attention to the water. </p><p>In his pockets, he finds a handful of mountain folds. He dips the pieces of folded paper in the water until they turns blue and soggy. Then he raises the mangled mess up into the air and feels it dry in his hands, smoothing out into a rectangular sheet of river blue. He doesn’t have to speak to suck the moisture out of the paper; it listens to the hope in his hand.</p><p>James isn’t paying attention anymore, rolled over onto his back to stare at the clouds, mumbling something to himself. </p><p>“Sardines or butterfly fish?” </p><p>James cranes his neck to look at Teddy oddly. When he spots the paper, he spins around and shuffles closer, crawling forward to sit near him. </p><p>“Butterfly fish.” </p><p>“Try again.” Teddy grins fleetingly. “I can’t do Butterfly fish yet.” </p><p>James snickers into his palm, then says, “Sardines taste better anyway.”</p><p>Teddy snorts softly, and begins to fold. James prods him insistently in the leg with his finger, poking him with questions too. A sardine takes shape in Teddy’s hands. It’s harder without a flat surface to fold against, but it works well enough against the rough surface of the rock. Nothing snags or rips, at least. </p><p>“What are you <em>doing?”</em> James complains, shifting restlessly, eyes glued to Teddy’s hands. </p><p>Teddy reels in his empty line and hooks the finished sardine onto the end of the fishing rod. It’s a narrow line of flat, blue paper, shaped perfectly like a fish. It even has glints of silver, like scales that flash in the light. </p><p>“You know, if you were that bad at fishing, you could have just said so Teddy.” James grins up at him. “We could have played Quidditch or something, even though you suck at that too.”</p><p>“I do not suck,” Teddy says, shoving him lightly with one hand.  “Just watch.”</p><p>The line disappears beneath the water, submerging the paper sardine.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>“How did you know you liked Ginny?”<p>They’re whisking eggs. Teddy’s spilled bits of jagged eggshell into the mixing bowl twice, and Harry’s made the same joke about going ‘cracked’ in his old age twice too. Teddy wonders when it starts: he’s only seventeen, but he can’t imagine Harry being any less cracked at Teddy’s age than he is now. </p><p>Harry runs a finger down the recipe, written in a book that he probably knows off by heart. He’s got flour everywhere, all over his jeans and his threadbare jumper. Harry always says he doesn’t mind having threadbare clothes now, since he knows it’s because he’s loved his clothes enough to wear them thin, and not because someone didn't love him enough to make sure he was warm when they had the means to. It makes anger pulse through Teddy, followed swiftly by a soft ache. </p><p>Harry pauses in the egg-whisking process to throw a smile his way. </p><p>“Oh, are we doing that, are we?” Harry pats the whisk on the side of the bowl so the excess mixture dribbles in. “I think maybe when we were hunting for Horcruxes. She didn't come with us, even though I know she would have given the chance. I used to watch the Marauder’s Map for ages, just following her name around Hogwarts. It was how I knew she was safe, which was all I wanted. And when I knew that, I knew I loved her, I think.”</p><p>Teddy puts down the carton of empty eggs before he can get more than a step towards the bin. He pokes at one of the eggs, disgruntled. Their shells look abandoned, like miserable little pockets for stolen goods. </p><p>“That’s not what I meant, but it’s nice.” Teddy pauses, then adds, “In a slightly sad way.”</p><p>“I’m going to pretend I didn't hear that bit. What did you mean?”</p><p>Teddy hums under his breath, not answering. He picks up the carton again to take the eggshells to the compost, but Harry reaches over and tugs gently on his wrist until he puts it down. Harry’s face crinkles up in concern, dark hair falling over his forehead </p><p>“You don't usually have trouble talking to me. Is everything alright?”</p><p>“It’s not a big deal,” Teddy says abruptly, tense with the need to get the words out, even if they don't make sense, even if they sound stupid. “But I meant how did you know you liked Ginny, not how did you know you loved her?”</p><p>Harry’s still as sharp as he ever was, which means Teddy only has to wait a few agonising seconds before Harry gets it. </p><p>“You mean, before we dated?”</p><p>Teddy shrugs, nodding. He feels small and skinny and young again. He feels blue-haired and like there are swear words on his tongue that he’s not allowed to say. </p><p>“Yeah. Before everything, before all of it.”</p><p>Harry watches him for a few long seconds, and then carefully resumes whisking the eggs. </p><p>“It’s not something you always know straight away, but I figured it out after a while. She made me laugh a lot. She always smelled like flowers. She was fierce and strong, and she didn't take anything lying down. I think when I realised I looked at her more than anyone else, and that I wanted to be around her all the time… I think that’s when I realised I liked her.”</p><p>“Not because she was pretty?”</p><p>Harry puts the whisk down again, flashing him a small grin. “That too. But lots of people look good, and I didn't date them.”</p><p>Teddy nods. The whisk gets put back to work while the eggshells are dumped in the compost. </p><p>“Don't throw away the carton,” Harry calls. “I promised Hugo I’d re-use them, so I bought cress seeds.”</p><p>“He’s really on an environment kick, isn’t he?”</p><p>“There are worse things to be obsessed with changing,” Harry says, and Teddy can tell he’s thinking of SPEW, and how badly it went. It’s a collection of stories that Ron likes to tell at dinner, or at a barbeque, getting progressively louder until Hermione hits him on the arm and says a few sharp things. </p><p>“True. I want to do the buttercream.”</p><p>“You want to <em>eat</em> the buttercream.”</p><p>Teddy flicks a tuft of flour at Harry along the sideboard. It explodes softly. Sadly, the minor eruption doesn’t distract from the fact that Harry is right. Teddy has a bit of a sweet tooth. </p><p>“Did someone catch your eye, then?”</p><p>Teddy looks up, but Harry is still whisking. As though Teddy isn’t there to hear the idle question, casually masking a deep curiosity. </p><p>“Since you’re asking about liking people,” Harry adds. “I thought maybe someone had caught your eye.”</p><p>“No,” Teddy replies slowly. That’s sort of the problem. </p><p>God, even in his own head, none of it makes much sense. Teddy makes a grab for the words but they elude him, dancing mockingly out of reach. The thing is, none of it feels bad to him. What he feels, or more accurately what he <em>doesn’t</em> feel, doesn’t feel wrong. </p><p>But he can tell by the way that other people react to what he says, and the way they respond carefully to his comments, or wait patiently for him to speak when he doesn’t realise he should be speaking—he can tell he’s doing something wrong. </p><p>He doesn’t ‘goggle’ as Victoire once put it. He doesn’t look at girls or guys, not unless they’re doing something particularly interesting or stupid. He likes the idea of romance, but the thought of sex just makes him frown. He doesn’t feel the same things that everyone in his year seems to be feeling. </p><p>Danny was upset but kind when Teddy turned him down last year, baffled at the request to go on a date, but still gentle. He’s had a few lackluster kisses during party games that felt more awkward than anything, and endured a thousand conversations with his mates that felt as though they should be private, if nothing else, where he contributed roughly nothing. </p><p>Buggy called him a prude. So did Jessie from Ravenclaw, when Teddy shrugged off her advances in Hogsmeade. </p><p>Teddy doesn’t feel like a prude. He just doesn’t feel… interested. </p><p>“No, nobody caught my eye,” Teddy says, louder than he needs to. He sweeps up the flour he just propelled forward and dumps that in the bin, desperate for something to do. </p><p>Harry’s voice, when he spins Teddy around with a firm hand on his shoulder and smiles at him knowingly, is soft. </p><p>“You just let me know if they ever do, okay?” </p><p>Teddy breathes in and out, as steady as he knows how. In his head, he concocts shapes out of paper, cutting into the corners here and there. There will be a flurry of paper snowflakes on his bed when he gets home. </p><p>“Good.” Harry hands him the icing sugar and points at the fridge. “Get the butter, and start on the buttercream. Just try to keep your face out of the bowl.”</p>

</center>Teddy fucks up being an adult within the very first month of turning twenty-three.<p>Technically, you’re supposed to count yourself as an adult at seventeen in the wizarding world, but he disagrees with that notion. Like he had a <em>clue</em> what to do with his life at seventeen, let alone the skills or knowledge to go ahead and do it. </p><p>James expressed something similar when he sent a letter to Teddy the other week, bemoaning the fact that he was supposed to suddenly know how to do things now, like cook or wash his own clothes. He’s light-years ahead of Teddy when he was that age, considering James already has a Reserve position lined up with the Appleby Arrows, and an interview for a job with a sports reporter. Teddy just had a backpack full of clothes and a Portkey to wherever Victoire wanted to go first. </p><p>“This was a stupid fucking idea,” Teddy says, heaving boxes in and out of the backroom, where he’s decided to store everything he doesn’t know what to do with yet. That turns out to be literally everything he owns. </p><p>Victoire huffs, waving her wand importantly and sending books and boxes flying. “You’ve never been known for having ideas that weren’t, on some level, a bit stupid. I don't know how you fooled people into thinking you’re a nice, normal, level-headed person.”</p><p>“Could you not do that?” Teddy has to duck to avoid the textbooks zooming like bullets towards him; he knows it’ll all end up in neat piles, precisely where it should be, but for now it’s just airborne chaos. </p><p>“Oh, I could.” Victoire grins at him impishly. The books and boxes keep flying. </p><p>Later, when the shopfront is empty, the wooden floors gleaming with fresh lacquer, and the windows scrubbed to a shine, Victoire loops her arm through Teddy’s and leans her cheek against his shoulder. </p><p>“Tell me why it’s stupid.”</p><p>It’s not stupid, but it is risky. It’s risky because it means something to Teddy. Paper, however stupid it sounds, has always been his escape. He folds to quiet his mind, bringing things to life because it feels natural. The Wizarding World already has some forms of magic relating to parchment, like the memos used in the Ministry of Magic, and the notes passed back and forth in Hogwarts classes. But he doesn’t think anybody else has a shop full of paper flowers ready to be sold and planted in real earth. He doesn’t think anybody else has an upstairs flat full of helpful paper birds and paper music boxes that sing his favourite songs, nor the ability to bring it all to life. </p><p>“S’posed to be an Auror, or something,” Teddy says, shrugging, because it feels easier than admitting what he’s truly afraid of; that he’ll open the doors, sell a few paper charms, and watch the thing he loves fade into non-existence, disparaged. He doesn’t want this to turn into another thing about him that people find weird.</p><p>“You don't actually believe that.” Victoire pokes him in the stomach. “Harry would set himself on fire if he thought you were saying things like that. And your Gran would set <em>you</em> on fire until you started speaking sensibly.”</p><p>Teddy snorts. He untangles himself from Victoire’s sideways embrace and paces the length of the shopfront slowly, taking in the shelves ready to be filled, the clouds painted on the ceiling and the paper candles already flickering in place. They give out light, but no heat, not yet.</p><p>He tried to be an Auror, for a while. After he and Victoire got back from travelling the world, dipping in and out of Africa and Thailand and France, he enrolled in Auror Training. He stuck at it for a full year, training under rough, hardened men and women with sharp eyes and even sharper instincts. It wasn’t that he was bad at it. It was that he didn't really want to do it. Finally, he was taken aside and told to make a choice. </p><p>“Your heart’s not in it, Lupin,” Roberts had said. “More importantly, neither is your head. If you’re distracted twenty-four-seven by not wanting to be an Auror, you’re not going to be a very good one, are you?”</p><p>Teddy had taken the day off, and then made several Floo calls to determine that he wouldn’t be coming back in, but <em>thanks very much anyway for all the yelling and morning drills and spell damage.</em> </p><p>“You’ve floated back and forth between what you want to do for years now,” Victoire says, braiding her hair absently while he stares at the empty walls. “Nobody minds how long it takes you. You’re not supposed to have everything together. I don't think there’s ever a limit on how long it takes you to find something you want to do. Christ, I don't know what I want to do, and you don't think less of me, do you?”</p><p>Teddy startles, turning on his heel. “No! Of course not.” He hesitates, and then shrugs. “But it’s not that people will think less of me.”</p><p>“Good, because they won’t. Everyone just wants you to stop being a big moping bugger and start being happy.” </p><p>Teddy flips her off. Victoire beams proudly—and, well, Teddy figures she’s got the right, considering she’s the one that taught him every curse word and rude gesture in the book. </p><p>“Thanks, Vic. You’ve got such a way with words. Makes me all warm and gooey inside.” </p><p>“Yes, well. It comes naturally. Look, do you even know what’s bothering you about doing this?”</p><p>She’s grinning knowingly. Teddy sort of hates that smile, but he doesn’t do anything more than glare her way. </p><p>“Emotions are confusing, Vic.”</p><p>“You’re a miniature version of Ronald,” Victoire says crisply. She knows that Ron doesn’t like his full name, and she uses it all the time just to irritate him, ever since he accidentally spat out the homemade goulash she brought to Christmas dinner one year. </p><p>“I’m taller than Ron.”</p><p>“You’re only taller than him because you cheat.”</p><p>“I can be taller than anyone.”</p><p>“You’re a secret short-arse.”</p><p>Teddy pointedly grows three more inches. Vic sends a forgotten box flying his way, but not even a knock to the nose can dampen his grin. </p><p>Teddy looks once more around the store, Victoire ranting beside him, and thinks, okay. Maybe it’s a risk. But maybe it’s not such a stupid idea after all.</p>
