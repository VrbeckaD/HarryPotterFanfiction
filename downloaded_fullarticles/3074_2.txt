  <em>I was running. I don’t remember where but I remember Draco Malfoy was with me. When we got into a bigger opening of the tunnel we instantly started throwing hexes and jinxes at the hooded people. All of them had a black hood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></em>
</p><p><em>One disarmed me and without a second thought Draco threw his wand to me and as I started to use it he used wandless magic to the best of his abilities. He had been practicing wandless magic for years as it was. He was still hit though and badly.</em> <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>That’s when I jolted up. I was breathing hard when my head snapped to the side and all I was met with was a hospital door. I laid back down and scrubbed at my face. I was okay. Holy shit I was okay. Bollocks what about Draco. He was hit. He was hit badly too. I needed to go see him!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>As I sat up again a nurse walked into my room. “Sleep good Mr. Potter?”, she asked. “Yes ma’am. If you don’t mind my asking where is Draco Malfoy?”, I asked her. She looked back down at her Muggle clipboard and frowned. “He will not be taking visitors for another few days Mr. Potter”, she replied.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>I scrunched up my nose in anger. “I am his bloody partner! I will be seeing Draco Malfoy!”, I shouted at her. Her eyes widened. “Oh I didn’t realize you and Mr. Malfoy are in a romantic-“, I had to cut her off at that. “He is my partner as Aurors. We go on missions together”, I explained.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Her eyes narrowed at that. “Oh. Well that’s disappointing”, she said. “Can I please go see him?”, I begged her. She puffed up one of her cheeks before blowing out the air slowly in consideration. “Come on I defeated Voldemort!”, I cried. She shook her head. “It is not a life threatening situation for you. His family may come see him if they wish”, she replied evenly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“He doesn’t have any family!”, I explained. His father had been put to death after the war and his mother had escaped to Paris and had no intentions of seeing Draco ever again because he looks like his father. He was let off for just trying to protect his family. She sighed. “Fine!”, she threw her hands into the air. Obviously she was annoyed with me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>I got out the hospital bed and followed her down a series of halls to Draco’s room. Goddammit. Just as I start liking the git he goes and tries to get himself killed. He’s too selfless, has no self-preservation, is extremely clever, ambitious, and can’t think of himself ever. And Hermione says I have a hero-complex.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Draco’s face was all sorts of bloody, his breathing was shallow, but he didn’t have a blood bag. “We couldn’t find blood pure enough to match his Mr. Potter. He’s been too thoroughly bred throughout the generations”, she explained. “He’s not going to make it without one is he?”, I asked. “He appears to be remaking blood as we speak but he lost a lot”, she explained.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>I nodded and walked over to his bedside. His hands were deathly cold when I touched one. His face was purely white, the palest I have ever seen a human being and the palest I will ever see a human being. A large vein in his arm was obviously depleted and sewn back together with magic. Merlin. I bowed my head and held Draco’s hands between the two of my own. I stayed there for hours.</p><p>When I left I promptly got a portkey to Paris and left the next morning. When I got there I instantly sought out Mrs. Malfoy. And by sought her out, I broke into her house and demanded that she donate blood for Draco because of how hurt he was. Which she point-blank refused.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>I sighed and pinched the bridge of my nose. “Mrs. Malfoy. Please listen to me. He’s going to die without it. The nurses say he only has a 40% of waking up by the end of the week without a blood transplant”, I explained. Mrs. Malfoy bit her lip and nodded. “Okay. I’ll go back but only to give my son blood. Understood? I will not be waiting around”, she said. “Fine by me”, I replied. I stayed with her over night and bonded with her over a glass of wine the night before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The next morning we took off to St. Mungo’s. She promptly donated blood but upon seeing her son, her face turned soft. “Merlin”, she whispered. I nodded. He was hooked up to blood and once on blood his heart picked up a little but not by much.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>I sighed in relief and went to go sit by his bed. “Aren’t you supposed to be leaving in an hour Mrs. Malfoy?”, I asked. She nodded but stayed where she was. “I want to spend a wee bit of time with him. If I could Mr. Potter”, she said. I nodded and left the room. She sat with him until she had to leave.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>When I walked into his hospital room he still looked as bad as before but I knew on the inside he was fighting. He was bloody stubborn I swear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>…</p><p> </p><p>A week later Draco woke up but not without having to stay in the hospital for another week. By the time he was half way through the week I was beside him when he started to complain. “This is bloody ridiculous Potter”, he spat. “I’m perfectly healthy”, he complained some more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>I smiled at him. “No you’re not”, I argued. “You need rest Draco”, I said softly. Draco instantly softened. “I don’t want to be here”, he said truthfully. “I know. No one wants to be here”, I comforted. He sighed and was promptly given a sedative by the nurse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>…</p><p> </p><p>By the end of the week he was happy to no longer be in the hospital bed or the hospital and quickly threw himself into his work as an Auror. While throwing himself into his work he was learning more wandless charms, which he only achieved one. “Merlin Malfoy, do you ever take it easy?”, I asked as I plopped on his couch in his flat as I picked up a wing since Draco had ordered pizza and wings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Yes, Draco Malfoy eats pizza and wings. He also likes to garden. He also has a tattoo over his Dark Mark of flowers that Teddy and I doodled on his arm but it had been mutilated from our last mission. His face was permanently scarred. So was his torso but it had apparently been scarred for years from where I hit him with Sectumsempra. I instantly felt horrible when I heard and had been taking care of Draco twice as much as usual.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He took a sip of red wine since that’s what he liked with pizza and spicy wings which I agreed with him on. It was really damn good. Draco raised an eyebrow at me. “Do I look like I can afford to take it easy?”, he asked. I rolled my eyes. “You have one of the nicest flats in London. What else could you want?”, I asked. Draco tilted his head back. “So I know you think this is crazy but I want a dog”, he replied.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>My eyes instantly widened. “Are you serious? Probably a purebred right?”, I asked. “No mate, I want a cute pound puppy mutt”, he answered. “Who are you?”, I asked. I shoved him playfully. “Says the one who thought I didn’t like pizza and wings”, Draco retorted. I had to give him that one. “Or muggle clubs, muggle TV, old muggle stuff like my car in the garage, and the fact that I hate gardening the magical way except for weeding and getting rid of trash or stuff that could potentially harm the garden”, he listed off. “I swear you should meet Neville”, I said. “He’d be scared of me the moment he saw me”, he retorted. “Draco”, I tried. “Don’t Draco me. Remember what happened with Hermione?”, he brought up. “You two are friends now!”, I said in the friendliest tone possible. “She punched me in the face. But, I mean, yeah she’s pretty great”, Draco complimented. I sighed. “You’re impossible”, I said to the ceiling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>I smiled. “Well your face is scarred now so why punch it!”, I joked. Draco laughed. “True”, he said. “Merlin I really am worse for wear huh?”, he asked. “Well you didn’t get your dick cut off did you?”, I asked. “I still have my dick Harry. It’s quite nice”, that when an evil smile broke over Draco’s face. “Don’t-“, Draco interrupted me. “My wand isn’t the only 10 inches I have if you catch my drift”, he wiggled his eyebrows before we both burst out laughing. We both sighed as we calmed down before bursting out laughing again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>We then actually started to watch the football, or as Americans call it, soccer game that was on. Draco’s team won. It ended super late though since my team put up a pretty good fight, so I stayed at Draco’s flat that night which neither of us minded since I did it all the time and I quite liked his place more than mine since my place easily got lonely. As I burrowed myself farther into the expensive sheets in the bedroom next to Draco’s, I could hear him go through some paperwork before falling into bed. I smiled and fell into an easily sleep.</p>
