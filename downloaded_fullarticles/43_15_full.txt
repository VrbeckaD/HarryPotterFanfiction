    <p>
  <strong> <em> <u>Sirius </u> </em> </strong>
</p><p>When he woke, he was breathing smoke. The red numbers on the clock next to his bed were flashing, which meant the electricity had gone out and come back on in the time that he’d been asleep. It meant that his heat had been out long enough that his every weighted exhale formed a silver mist in the air. It also meant he had no fucking idea what time it was.</p><p>It didn’t much matter – his life wasn’t exactly on a strict schedule anymore. At the moment, there were only two things that mattered. One – it was dark outside, so he’d at least gotten a few hours of uninterrupted sleep. Fan-<em>fucking</em>-tastic. Two – and this one was much more alarming than the first – the dreams were starting again. <em>Time to increase the dose.</em></p><p>The television was still on. Evidently, it had been on since he fell asleep, or he assumed, as the channel remained unchanged. His grey eyes glanced over to the screen. The program that he had on for the dull murmur of noise in the background had since ended, replaced by the local news. The date and time were stamped next to the station logo on the bottom left of the screen.</p><p>Sirius stared blankly at the television, mouth hanging slightly ajar as his eyes drifted indolently toward the bottom of the screen. Friday, October the 4<sup>th</sup>, eight in the evening. <em>Shit</em>.</p><p>“Shit,” he repeated aloud, his voice thick with sleep, as he pinched the bridge of his nose, screwing his eyes closed. His long, dark hair brushed against his collarbone as it cascaded over his face, and he had to stifle down the sick coming up in his throat from the unexpected contact against his skin. He hadn’t been asleep for a few hours. He’d been asleep for <em>a day and a half.</em></p><p>Still didn’t matter. No schedule, no life, no family, no friends. He likely could’ve overdosed on the ten Valium he’d popped at three in the morning and not a single person would’ve known he was dead. Hardly a single person even knew where he <em>lived</em>. Not anymore.</p><p>Pressing his fingertips deep into the sunken sockets of his eyes, he stumbled from the couch where he’d passed out, to his bedroom, where he intended to continue this drug-fueled pre-coma. If he was lucky, he thought, he wouldn’t wake up a second time.</p><p>At his bedside table, his eyes, previously half-closed and barely focusing, widened at the sight of the empty amber vial, lying on its side. The previously stifled acid boiled up from his stomach and he raced into the bathroom to empty it. And then stayed there, slipping onto the bathroom floor, waiting to empty it again. He started to pull his hair off his neck to prepare for it.</p><p>As his fingers slid along his skin, he ground his teeth at the familiar, sickening sensation it caused. It was to the point that his <em>own</em> touch repulsed him. Hands shaking, he reached for a band, tying his hair up as quickly as he could, grateful that there was no longer <em>anything</em> against his skin. Also, grateful that he’d made it in time to avoid spraying vomit into his hair.</p><p>The exhausted breath he let out echoed back at him from the porcelain bowl. He spit hard into the water, choking down another expulsion of his stomach contents. This was bad. Really fucking <em>bad</em>. Without those Valium, he’d … he would see <em>his</em> face again.</p><p>So much for avoiding the third round of puking. Though, he’d been unconscious for almost two days, there wasn’t that much to expel in the first place. By that third time, there was almost nothing left but bile, leaving a burning, bitter aftertaste on his tongue.</p><p>After wiping the cold sweat from his face and brushing the taste from his mouth, he plucked a shirt from his bedroom floor. As he pulled it over his ears, it ruffled the sloppy bun he’d tied his hair into, scattering shorter pieces down in front of his face. On his way to the front door, he swiped at them, violently shoving them behind his ears, if they’d reach. Most didn’t.</p><p>“Marlene?” he called as soon as his front door was open, but he knew it was fruitless. The door to Marlene’s flat, across the hall from his own, was only closed if she wasn’t home. And it was closed. He jiggled the handle, just to be sure. Locked, even.</p><p>His mobile was still in the back pocket of his jeans from two days earlier. He must’ve slept harder than he realized for it to still be there – of <em>course</em> he’d slept hard, he was fucking <em>unconscious</em> for most of two days. He pressed Marlene’s number. No answer.</p><p>For a moment, he stood in the hallway between the two flats, bringing his trembling hands up to cover his face. The tremors spread quickly from his hands, down to his stomach, down to his knees. Panicked tears formed in his eyes, and he pressed his hands harder against his face to try to keep them in. Crying wouldn’t help. It never had before.</p><p>“What the fuck do I do,” he mumbled through tight lips. It wasn’t a question, it couldn’t be. There wasn’t anyone around to answer it, anyway.</p><p>Marlene usually didn’t let him run out like this. She didn’t know anything about Sirius except that, without the Valium, he would wake up screaming in the middle of night and she would have to break into his flat to get him to stop. It had happened more than once.</p><p>Maybe she thought he was dead. If their relationship hadn’t been purely business, then Sirius would probably be hurt. Not like he was her best customer, anyway. All he ever wanted was Valium – occasionally some Ambien, if the nights were particularly bad.</p><p>With a deep breath, Sirius slapped both his cheeks overly hard, as a wake-up call and a pep-talk, all in one. If Marlene wasn’t home, he would just have to find her. It didn’t matter that he’d slept for 36 fucking hours. He wouldn’t be able to sleep for even one more without her.</p><p>“<strong><em>Marlene</em></strong>?” he shouted, pounding on the door, knowing she wasn’t inside. It didn’t matter – if <em>anyone</em> was inside, they could tell him where she’d gone. When Marlene’s menacing-as-fuck girlfriend came to the door, Sirius reconsidered.</p><p>“The fuck do you want?” she asked, words angry but tone indifferent.</p><p>“Hey, Dorcas,” Sirius said, trying to hide the quiver in his voice as he nonchalantly leaned against the doorway to the flat. “You seen Marlene?”</p><p>Dorcas’ lips formed a tight, thin line, as if she were debating with herself about giving Sirius the information. But she shrugged. “Went to peddle at some rich kid’s party, I think.”</p><p>“You, uh …” Sirius glanced down at his fingernails to appear disinterested. “Think you can give me the address of the kid?” Again, Dorcas shrugged. She disappeared from the doorway and came back with a slip of paper, holding it between her fingers like a cigarette. Sirius took it.</p><p>“Hope you find her. Looks like you really need to, mate,” she said, wincing as she looked Sirius up and down. Sucking in his lip, Sirius tried to straighten the black jeans, slung low on his hips, that had gotten cocked a little to the side from being in them for the last three days.</p><p>“Uh, yeah. Cheers,” Sirius waved as he tried not to race down the hallway. Running would only wear him out that much faster and rattle his already damaged brain that much harder.</p><p> </p><p>He smoked six cigarettes outside of the rich kid’s house. Actually, he was about a block down from the rich kid’s house, but that was really as close as he wanted to be. From where he stood, he could hear the music and the shouting and the laughter. He could see the masses of people flooding in and out of the front door. None of them Marlene.</p><p>Lighting up one last cigarette, he made his way into the house, weaving in between the people who seemed to move in a wave, in a rhythm not at all connected to the beat of the music blasting through the stereo. For the most part, he was quite successful at avoiding physical contact, but he knew, inevitably, someone would <em>touch</em> him. He retched at the thought.</p><p>Finally, after going through most of the anterior rooms, he spotted Marlene at the back of the house, talking to some random bloke on a white couch. Sirius had to hold back tears of relief. Cigarette still in his lips, he made his way over, pulling his hair from atop his head.</p><p>“Marlene, <em>help</em> me,” Sirius croaked, collapsing to his knees in front of the sofa, some of the precariously dangling ash on his cigarette scattering into the carpet.</p><p>“Fucking hell, Sirius,” Marlene hissed, starting to reach out to take him by the shoulders, but pulling back abruptly as he violently recoiled before she could even touch him. “How did y–”</p><p>“Doesn’t fucking matter. Please tell me you have something. <em>Anything</em>.” Sirius could feel hot tears threatening to spill over the inner corners of his eyes. He blinked furiously, sniffling.</p><p>“You shouldn’t be <em>out</em> yet,” Marlene said under her breath and Sirius nodded erratically.</p><p>“I know, I know that, I know.” Sirius could feel himself starting to go manic, the rate of his speech spiking in time with his heart rate, his hand shaking as he took the cigarette between his fingers. “I fucked up, I know, it won’t happen again. Just … <em>please</em>.” A few tears slipped down Sirius’ flushed cheeks and he wiped them away with the back of his trembling hand.</p><p>Marlene took a breath, reaching into her shirt pocket. “Take this.” She held her hand out delicately, dangling the pill from it, knowing not to let her skin contact Sirius’. She’d learned that aspect of Sirius quite quickly. Sirius held his palm flat, she dropped the pill onto it.</p><p>“What is it?” he asked, dry swallowing it before she even had time to answer.</p><p>“Xanax. A change might be better for you.” With a shudder, Sirius burrowed his face down into his hands, only vaguely aware of the still-lit cigarette between his fingers.</p><p>“Thank you,” he whispered, words mumbled against his skin. The contact of skin with his lips proved to be too much and he quickly pulled away, only to realize that the bloke sitting on the couch with Marlene was looking at him, quite concerned.</p><p>“Are you alright?” he asked, his voice as soft as the golden brown of his eyes, which were focused rather intently on Sirius. The stranger leaned forward, worried eyes darting across Sirius’ face. As he placed his elbows onto his knees, dipping down to look into Sirius’ eyes, the longer of his light-brown waves tumbled down over his forehead. The stranger reached up to brush the hair from his face, leading Sirius’ eyes to the skin underneath the short, bitten-down fingernails that moved across it. A splattering of sun-drawn freckles dusted over his nose, dotted the corners of his eyes, but many of them were smudged out by the raised, pink scars slashed across them. The more Sirius’ eyes traveled, the more he realized – the scars were <em>everywhere</em>. Dug out over the bridge of his nose, gouged through his left eyebrow, sliced from his ear down past his jaw. Even a crescent-shaped scar was hooked through his bottom lip, like it had been pierced. It took more than a moment for Sirius to realize that he’d been <em>staring</em> at this stranger’s face.</p><p>However, in the next moment, a drunken party-goer crashed into the back of Sirius, from where he knelt in front of Marlene. It was all he could do to stifle the panicked shout that bubbled up from his throat, but he did. He held it down. Until the drunk used Sirius to get himself back onto his feet, squeezing Sirius softly by the nape of his neck.</p><p>Sirius went absolutely solemn – the colour instantly drained from his face, the cigarette dropped from his tremoring hands and into the carpet. He didn’t even recognize that he would have burned the whole fucking house down if Marlene hadn’t stomped it out. All he could register was that seemingly tender squeeze at his shoulder. And the face that had once accompanied it. The face of his nightmares. The face that had him taking ten Valium to kill.</p><p>“Sirius?” he could hear Marlene calling him, but her voice sounded so far away. His vision had started to tunnel, focused in on the last thing that he’d seen – the soft, caring expression of the stranger on the white couch. His throat began to burn, his chest felt crushed, like his sternum had been snapped in two and the pieces were piercing into his lungs. He recognized all of this as a sign that he was breathing too hard, too fast, too <em>much</em>. But he couldn’t stop.</p><p>The next thing Sirius knew, he was standing in the back garden, looking up into starlight and moonlight, breathing in the chilled air. There was a pressure at his chest, he clawed at the collar of his shirt, adjusting the weight of his shoulders to try to lessen it. The pressure vanished.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he suddenly heard in front of him. His head snapped down in surprise. The stranger on the white couch – his golden eyes were wide, his hands, just as scarred as his face, held out defensively in front of him. “I had to get you out of there. I’m sorry.” Sirius took an immediate step back. The stranger pulled his hands toward himself, holding them against his chest, looking down at the dewing grass to avoid Sirius’ terrified gaze.</p><p>“Did you –” he started to ask but froze. It was obvious that this stranger had led him out here, which meant he had to have <em>touched</em> him, which meant he <em>wanted</em> something. Nobody had ever touched Sirius without <em>wanting</em> something in return. Sirius’ eyes shot chaotically around the yard, toward the windows of the house, searching for Marlene.</p><p>“She’s right here,” the stranger said, backing further away and pulling Marlene from somewhere behind him, placing her between himself and Sirius.</p><p>“Marlene,” he breathed out a sigh, placing both hands to his forehead.</p><p>“It’s alright, Sirius,” she said, nodding slowly, and he subconsciously mirrored it. “This is Remus, he just wanted to help. You had another panic attack.” Swallowing hard, his wild-eyed gaze drifted carefully back over to the stranger. To Remus.</p><p>“I, uh … you didn’t … uh, th-thank you.” Sirius sputtered out.</p><p>“Listen, it’s not my business, but …” Remus said, the tone of his voice softer than it had been inside, without the music to compete over. There was a breathy, rumbling quality to it that put Sirius at ease – so unlike the voice from his dreams that was high and sharp and biting.</p><p>“Can I go home?” Sirius interrupted. To himself, Sirius sounded like a child.</p><p>“Are you seeing someone about this?” Remus asked quickly, without making any sudden movements. At the very least, Sirius appreciated the effort this stranger was taking.</p><p>“No, I don’t – I don’t need to. I don’t …” Sirius took a breath. “I can’t talk about it.”</p><p>Remus smiled. It took Sirius by such surprise that he physically startled at the sight of it. It was soft, just like Remus’ voice, just like his eyes. It wasn’t the smile that Sirius saw on other people’s faces, wasn’t like the smiles he used to be able to fake. This smile had weight. There was misery behind it, Sirius could <em>see</em> it. He knew exactly what misery looked like.</p><p>“I gave Marlene my number, in case you change your mind. Support group is on Sunday afternoon.” With another one of those woeful smiles, Remus turned to leave.</p><p>“I can’t …” Sirius started feeling tight in the chest again. “I can’t talk to a <em>shrink</em>.” Remus turned, for just a moment, nodding. His smile remained, seemed stronger, somehow.</p><p>“Then maybe you can just talk to <em>me</em>. If you want.” His smile widened, and brightened, and, somehow, the anguish was suddenly gone. And then, so was he.</p>
<hr/><p>
  <strong> <em> <u>Remus</u> </em> </strong>
</p><p>“Why did I let you drag me to this?” Remus groaned, pushing his ever-lengthening hair from just underneath his eyebrow. His mother kept asking him when he was going to cut it, politely, always so politely. Of course, he appreciated it. After everything they’d all been through, he would <em>never</em> take his parents for granted. But it could become exhausting – his parents tiptoeing around him, treating him like his skin was made of eggshells and his bones of dynamite.</p><p>“Because you love me,” Peter shrugged. “Besides, it’s just James. You’ve met James loads of times.” Remus closed his eyes to keep from rolling them.</p><p>“I met James <em>once</em>. It was right after the football match that your team <em>lost</em>, and you were too pissed off to properly introduce us,” Remus huffed, his fingers anxiously twitching at the border of his coat pocket but ultimately deciding he didn’t want to bring the smell of cigarette smoke into someone else’s house. “James probably doesn’t even know who I am.”</p><p>Peter immediately smiled. “Right. We’ll see about that.” With a sideward glance, Peter knocked on the front door of James’ house. Good Lord, it was practically a mansion. The door swung wide – James Potter, with his disheveled hair and bespectacled face, appeared, smiling.</p><p>“First ones here,” he grinned, pulling Peter into a hug. Remus squirmed awkwardly for only a moment before James wrapped his arms around him, too. His eyes widened, chin perched on James’ shoulder and Peter nodded, a knowing expression. “Hiya, Moony.”</p><p>“M-Moony?” Remus stammered out. Sure, Remus was fucking terrible at social cues, but last he checked, he didn’t even <em>have</em> a nickname, much less one he’d given out to this bloke. As James pulled back, and Remus turned to Peter, he noticed a slight blush on Peter’s pale cheeks.</p><p>Peter opened his mouth to speak, but James beat him to it. “I never forget a face, but I have … I’m really bloody awful with putting a name to it. Helps if I can remember something about their appearance – their hair or something.” Remus stared.</p><p>“And how did you –” James started speaking again. This time, <em>he</em> blushed.</p><p>“Oh. The, uh …” He drew a half-circle at his throat, then pointed to Remus. Instinctively, Remus drew his hand up to cover the scar that ran over his jaw. Ever the industrial buffer, Peter nudged Remus’ elbow, the icy calm of his still, blue eyes looking pointedly at Remus. For as long as Remus had known him, Peter had a way of carrying on a whole conversation with one look.</p><p>“If it makes you feel any better, he still calls me Wormtail,” Peter said with a disgusted purse of his lips, and James let out a loud snort through his nostrils.</p><p>“Why?” Remus wondered aloud as they entered the house.</p><p>“You don’t want to know,” they both replied in unison. Walking through the house felt like walking through the university dorms Remus had lived in, extremely briefly, before he moved in with Peter – there were rooms practically stacked on top of each other. He was fairly certain they had gone through a door that had been disguised as a bookcase.</p><p>As they moved through the rooms, Remus tried to memorize the path back to the front door. Just in case. He always memorized the quickest way out of <em>any</em> place, just in case.</p><p>“You were in my classic literature class, weren’t you?” James asked as they reached a sitting room at the rear of the house, ceiling-high windows looking out into the garden.</p><p>“Was I?” Remus asked with a wince. Of all the classes that James could be in, he had to be in <em>that</em> one. But, of course, Remus wouldn’t know James was in that class. Remus tried hard to avoid everyone in that room, since the first day. Well, he tried that in every class, really, so he could share every single one of his classes with James and would still have no fucking idea.</p><p>“I think so. With Dr. Flitwick? You always sat in the back.”</p><p>“Ah. Yeah, that was probably me,” Remus nodded, pulling his lips into his teeth, knowing it was most definitely him. This was the part of new friendships that he was the worst at – the ‘<em>getting to know you.’ </em>The small talk. He just hoped it wouldn’t extend beyond the small talk.</p><p>“It was the only class Remus and I didn’t have together,” Peter said, casting a perfunctory check-up glance in Remus’ direction. This look was directed at Remus anytime Peter was sure that Remus was out of his element, in an unfamiliar and uncomfortable environment. However, this particular brand of <em>that</em> look was glazed with past concern. Remus nodded slowly.</p><p>“Were you there on the first day of class?” James asked, and Remus immediately stiffened. The subject was bound to come up, though he foolishly hoped it had been forgotten. </p><p>“Not very much of it,” Remus replied with a sigh. For a moment, James furrowed his hazel eyes underneath the sharp glare of his square glasses, sunlight bouncing off the lenses as the sun dipped below the high windows that overlooked the garden.</p><p>“Oh, <em>that</em> was –” He stopped suddenly, eyes meeting Remus’. </p><p>A sharp scoff ricocheted from the back of Remus’ throat. “<em>That</em> was why I don’t usually take classes without Pete.” It suddenly felt like there were empty pockets of dry air in Remus’ mouth, and he swallowed to try to get rid of them. It only worsened.</p><p>Back when Remus first started university, he’d been assigned to a dorm, shared by Peter Pettigrew. Attending university, in and of itself, was a big deal, but moving out of his parents’ home in Wales was the hardest part. He’d done all his previous schooling from home.</p><p>Peter became his security blanket, even when they moved out of the dorms and into their own flat. Pete was the one Remus clung to on those days when his anxiety ran so high that he felt like there was an iron brand burning a hole in the pit of his stomach. He and Peter shared every class, as long as they could. When they got to classic literature, Peter had taken it as part of a jump-start program in secondary school. He didn’t need it. Remus had to take it alone.</p><p>For all that Remus had gone through in his comparatively short life, there were a great many things that triggered extremely negative emotional memories. One of those things was darkness. Not even total darkness – it was often just a slight, unexpected darkening of a room.</p><p>It probably would’ve been fine if there had been more windows in the room. It likely would’ve been fine if there had been some allusion to shutting off every light in the room to better project the slides against the wall. Maybe it would’ve been fine if the girl behind him hadn’t screamed. The culmination of events resulted in Remus Lupin having one of the most aggressive fucking panic attacks he’d ever had – and Peter wasn’t there to remind him to breathe.</p><p>In other words, fifty people he had to spend the next four months with watched him scramble from his chair, shove himself into the furthest corner of the room with his face buried in his knees, with his whole body shaking to the point of exhaustion. James was one of them.</p><p>“I overslept that day. I wasn’t there, but I heard –” James said softly. Alright, James <em>wasn’t</em> one of them. But he’d heard about it. That was usually all it took, anyway. “Well, now you have me, too. Right, Moony?” James’ voice brightened as he reached out, gently squeezing Remus’ forearm, with a clear and promising smile. Remus stared, feeling a measure of shocked breath slipping silently from his lips. This was not the response he was expecting.</p><p>If anyone from that classroom that day even looked at him, there was blind terror in their expression, like they worried he would return <em>any day now</em> with a vest full of homemade explosives to murder them all. And James Potter looked at him like he had let <em>Remus</em> down by not being there to get him through it in the first place. Who the fuck <em>was</em> this kid?</p><p>“Right,” Peter replied for Remus, beaming. Oddly, Remus felt like beaming, too.</p><p> </p><p>The party was borderline torture. Remus was so far out of his comfort zone that he didn’t even remember where it had been in the first place. It was going to take several days of deliberate isolation to undo the anxiety that had nestled into the dark corner of his brain, screaming like a forgotten kettle on an over-hot stove. He would have to <em>live</em> on antacids to soothe the raw heat from the stomach acid churning up into his throat.</p><p>He remained devoutly attached to the white couch that James had left him on hours earlier. Peter mingled in and out, coming in to make sure Remus was, at the very least, not trying to escape over the privacy fence in the back garden. At least James had good taste in music.</p><p>While people-watching – which was, in all honesty, scanning to make sure no one was paying him any attention, just the way he wanted – he noticed a red-headed girl kept glancing in his direction. Her face was vaguely familiar, but Remus couldn’t place her. Must share some class with Remus – not that he would know outright. She was just another face that blended into the background. When she wasn’t side eyeing him, she was dancing with James. Eventually, as Remus knew she would, the red-haired girl came over, pulling James behind her.</p><p>“Remus, right?” she said and, with a sharp pull of breath through Remus’ teeth, he began to recall where he knew her face. It echoed through forgotten – or, rather, blocked – memory.</p><p>She’d been there – the first day of classic lit. She’d seen his giant fucking melt down. Not only that, she had been the one to talk him out of it. Remembering her face was like remembering a dream he hadn’t had in years. But it was suddenly there, plain as day. He could see her kneeling in front of him in the dark corner of the classroom that day, speaking softly, asking his name. Vaguely, he remembered giving it. And she had given hers.</p><p>“Lily,” he said, voice suddenly hoarse. She smiled softly.</p><p>“I wasn’t sure you would remember me,” she replied. Remus watched the muscles of her forearm flex as she squeezed James hand lightly within her own.</p><p>“I almost didn’t.” Remus cleared his throat, glancing at James.</p><p>“Lily, this is my Moony, the one I’ve been telling you about,” James stepped in, reaching out to hold Remus’ shoulder, the way he had done when he and Peter first arrived. Remus couldn’t help but smile at how comfortable he was beginning to feel around James – it may have had something to do with the way James spoke about him. <em>My</em> Moony. It felt like belonging.</p><p>“Moony,” Lily said, that same quiet smile on her lips. “It suits you.”</p><p>“I … I ran out without saying thank you,” Remus looking poignantly at her, trying to convey how much she aided him that day. Her smile remained, brightened substantially.</p><p>“No need,” Lily said, and Remus began to put together how, after that first day, Lily sat next to him for every class after that. His smile began to brighten, as well.</p><p>“Lils, there you are!” A bright falsetto voice rang over the crowd, over the music. A slender blonde pranced her way over, snapping Lily up into a hug before Lily even saw her.</p><p>“Marlene!” Lily laughed, her voice musical and full. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“I promise I’m not … working,” the blonde replied with a wink. With a surreptitious scratch to the back of his head, Remus looked away. He’d rather not know what this <em>Marlene</em> was promising not to do at this party where he was currently trapped. “Just wanted to see you.”</p><p>“Behave,” Lily warned, but smiled. “But have fun. Keep Remus company while I make James supervise the more … rowdy of the bunch.” She turned her grin to Remus as Marlene settled next to him on the couch. Remus tried very hard to smother a wince behind his lips.</p><p>“Moony, I’ll come back for you!” James shouted as Lily pulled him away. Though Remus smiled, he wondered if James would be as fond of him without the alcohol in his belly.</p><p>“So,” the blonde said, turning to him on the couch. “Is it Remus? Or Moony?” The look in her eyes had Remus a bit unsettled. It was a look that most men probably would’ve been aroused to see on a beautiful woman’s face. Remus was definitely not like most men.</p><p>“Only James calls me Moony,” Remus quipped, his voice a little sharp, a little biting. The girl seemed to take notice, a testy rise appearing in her eyebrow.</p><p>“<em>Only</em> James, huh?” she hummed, nudging Remus’ elbow. “Does Lily know?”</p><p>“I didn’t mean …” he started to explain, but before he could get out another word, there was someone knelt at the woman’s feet. Ink black hair billowed like smoke down over his face, only the lit end of a cigarette jutted through. The actual smoke trailed from the other end, from a mouth, hidden somewhere in the dark, matted waves of his hair.</p><p>“Marlene,” the voice behind the curtain breathed out. The voice sounded like it had once been smooth, melodious, but had been scraped raw with nicotine and strain. “Help me,” the stranger begged, voice shifting to thin and treacherous, while discarded ash from the butt of his cigarette drifted down in between the expensive carpet fibers.</p><p>“Fucking hell, Sirius,” Marlene said, her voice tight, tongue pressed to the back of her teeth. She made a move to hold this stranger Sirius’ shaking shoulders, but she barely even got her hands from her lap before Sirius sharply retracted. She pulled her hands back, wincing.</p><p>As he moved, Remus finally got a moderate look at his face – it was all sharp, aristocratic angles and pale, sunken skin. Without leaning over to look him full in the face, Remus saw the dark red rings around Sirius’ eyes, like he hadn’t slept in days. It sounded like Marlene started to ask how Sirius had found her there, but he interrupted, whole body trembling.</p><p>“Doesn’t fucking matter,” he growled. His voice rolled up his throat, gritty. “Please tell me you have something. Anything.” His eyes glistened, he blinked rapidly to clear it. He brought a shaking hand up to press underneath his nose, pulling in a deep breath through it.</p><p>“You shouldn’t be out yet,” the woman hissed, and Remus glanced nervously back and forth between them. So, <em>that</em> was what she was promising Lily not to do.</p><p>“I know, I know that, I know,” the man named Sirius rattled off manically. Remus bared his teeth. This was withdrawal, if he’d ever seen it. “I fucked up, I know, it won’t happen again. Just, please.” He reached up to pull the cigarette from his lips, fingers trembling, and a couple unguarded tears slid down his cheeks – cheeks tinted with the barest of pinks.</p><p>“Take this.” Marlene took a baggie out of her pocket, fishing a single tablet from within and holding it out for Sirius. Remus took note that Sirius let her drop it into his hand instead of letting her touch him. But he didn’t hesitate a single second before popping it into his mouth.</p><p>“What is it?” he asked afterward.</p><p>“Xanax,” she answered under her breath. “A change might be better for you.” Whatever she had been supplying him before, it evidently hadn’t been Xanax. With a deep breath, Sirius buried his face into his hands, letting out the air in his lungs through his fingers. The cigarette still tucked between his fingers glowed red with the renewed oxygen being blown against it.</p><p>“Thank you,” he mumbled against his skin, but he quickly wrenched his face from his hands, suddenly looking rather distressed by the contact it resulted in. As he did, his gaze finally fell onto Remus, who was surely looking at him with a panicked, wide-eyed expression.</p><p>Remus said the only thing he knew to say at a time like this. “Are you alright?” On instinct, he leaned forward, but made sure not to touch him. With this new closeness, Remus was finally able to look this stranger full in the face. What he saw was unexpected.</p><p>It wasn’t the face of a long-term drug-addict underneath that cascade of black hair. The drugs had dulled some of the brighter characteristics of this face, sure, but that wasn’t the base of his features. Hidden within the dark circles around his eyes was a swirling, silver pool of fright and mistrust, but they were also softened with loneliness and regret. The heavy tint to his sunken eyes and the dark shadow of being several days behind in shaving the sharp curves of his jaw were offset by the ashen pallor of his skin. Except, there was a pink undertone underneath his high cheekbones, Remus wasn’t sure if it was from the agitation of withdrawal or from the biting breeze of approaching winter outside. In his fingers, the cigarette still dangled, forgotten, the filtered end stamped down flat, like it had been caught between a rather unexpected clench of teeth. The veil of raven-black hair swayed over his gaunt collarbones, exposed through the over-stretched neck of his black t-shirt. In fact, Remus noticed, everything he had on was black.</p><p>The stranger known as Sirius seemed to lean in, lips parting, as if to speak, but in the very same moment, a party guest stumbled backward, tumbling right into Sirius’ back. An audible gasp slipped through Marlene’s lips and she instinctively reached out to steady Sirius but kept her distance. The look on Sirius’ face was stiff and rigid. As he closed his eyes for a moment, it was obvious that he was coaching himself into breathing steadily, though shakily.</p><p>Everything changed when that clumsy party guest put his hand back onto Sirius’ shoulder, squeezing a silent apology into his skin. Instantly, Sirius froze, silver eyes blanking out into cinder grey – what colour was left in his face was sucked dry. The tremor in his hands became a quake and the cigarette in his fingers dropped into the carpet.</p><p>“Shit,” Marlene exhaled, crushing it with the toe of her shoe to keep the embers from catching. Quickly, she looked back up, holding her hands in front of her. “Sirius?” she called.</p><p>Everything stilled for a moment as Remus looked into Sirius’ eyes, which were darting erratically around the room, unable to focus on anything in front of them. This, Remus imagined, was what Lily must’ve seen in <em>his</em> eyes, that day in classic literature. Sirius’ chest began to heave, sinking too deep with every breath out and rising too high with every breath in.</p><p>“Sirius, slow down,” Remus said calmly, having picked up on the <em>no-touching rule</em>, but thinking of no other way to regulate his breathing. Carefully, he took Sirius’ hand in his own and, when Sirius didn’t pull away, Remus placed Sirius’ hand against his own chest, taking full breaths in and letting them out slowly. “I’m sorry I have to touch you, Sirius, but <em>breathe</em> with me.”</p><p>At first, it almost seemed to be working – Remus could hear Sirius pull air into his lungs, pushing it out through half-closed lips, both in time with the movement of Remus’ chest. His skin stopped vibrating, his eyes stopped their chaotic motion. They began to focus on Remus, so Remus let Sirius’ hand slip from his grasp, let it fall away from his chest.</p><p>When it did, a sickening swallow snapped through the caverns of Sirius’ throat. He strained to suck in breath that wasn’t moving in – the lines of his throat sharpened as his muscles fruitlessly struggled to force air into his lungs.</p><p>Without thinking, Remus leapt from the couch, forgetting all the rules that he knew Sirius would otherwise have him follow to the letter. Remus wrapped one tight arm around Sirius’ waist and slung Sirius’ other arm over his neck. With a little struggle, he dragged Sirius outside, standing him underneath silver moonlight. He put his hands to Sirius’ face.</p><p>“Fuck, Sirius, please. <em>Breathe</em>.” Pressing his thumbs into the caverns underneath Sirius’ highborn cheekbones in an attempt to get a response, Remus watched as Sirius’ eyes flutter closed at his touch. For someone so averse to touch, it seemed he was rather starved of it. A quiet, aching breath slipped from Sirius’ lips, bringing a blush to the surface of Remus’ cheeks.</p><p>One hand slid down over Sirius’ jaw, along his throat, ending up pressed flat against Sirius’ chest in an almost autonomic response. So reflexive, in fact, that Remus wasn’t even sure why he’d done it. He tried not to notice how sharply the bones of Sirius’ ribs were palpable from underneath his shirt as Sirius’ fight to breathe began to subside.  </p><p>Sirius’ eyes began to open, his breathing finally back on a normal rhythm, and Remus realized as Sirius began tugging at the collar of his t-shirt, that his hands were still pressed to Sirius’ body. Quickly, he pulled away, holding his hands out in front of him.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Remus immediately apologized, and Sirius’ manic gaze shot down to meet Remus’. He looked like a wild animal. “I had to get you out of there. I’m sorry.” The first thing Sirius did was back away, spreading some distance between them. In response, Remus held his hands to his chest, as if to assure Sirius he wouldn’t touch him again.</p><p>“Did you …” he started to say. Remus knew what he wanted to ask. He wanted to ask if Remus had touched him. There was a pang of guilt in Remus’ chest.  Before he could come clean, Sirius’ breathing began to race again as he searched the yard for Marlene.</p><p>“She’s right here,” he said, reaching back to grab Marlene’s hand, who had followed them closely when Remus had practically carried Sirius outside.</p><p>“Marlene,” Sirius whimpered, voice small and fragile. He put both hands over his head.</p><p>“It’s alright, Sirius,” she assured him in a low voice. She nodded, and he nodded back, more for himself than for her. “This is Remus, he just wanted to help. You had another panic attack.” It was only then that Remus began to piece together this story. Remus already knew Sirius got anti-anxiety meds from Marlene. He wasn’t using them to get high, he was using them to <em>cope</em>. He was using them to stay <em>alive</em>. Remus let out a short breath. <em>This</em> he understood.</p><p>Sirius timidly met his gaze. He stumbled through some syllables, half-composed as words, ending with a relatively whole ‘<em>thank you</em>.’ Suddenly, Remus wished he could hold him.</p><p>“Listen,” Remus said, on a preparative, inward breath. “It’s not my business, but …”</p><p>“Can I go home?” Sirius asked suddenly, not looking up at Remus. And Remus had never heard a voice so broken and defeated and diminutive in all his life.</p><p>“Are you seeing someone about this?” Remus asked, before he could lose his nerve and before he could lose Sirius forever. He was getting himself much more involved in this than was probably wanted, or needed, but everything about this was too painfully familiar to let go.</p><p>“No, I don’t – I don’t need to. I don’t …” Sirius took a breath. “I can’t talk about it.” Remus lowered his head – it was just like he thought. Sirius hadn’t said there wasn’t anything wrong. He had actually admitted that there was something <em>very</em> wrong. Something he couldn’t say out loud.</p><p>Despite the horror and the sadness enveloping the boy in front of him, Remus smiled. It would be a hard road for Sirius, Remus knew that better than anyone. But for the first time, Remus started to wonder if this wasn’t something like fate. Normally, he would have never come to this party. He barely even knew James, certainly didn’t know Marlene. Yet, for some reason, he ended up meeting the one person in the world who needed him the most.</p><p>“I gave Marlene my number,” Remus said, glancing over at Marlene. She nodded. “In case you change your mind. Support group is on Sunday afternoon.” Before he could turn to leave, Sirius’ small voice rang out over the songs of crickets hiding in the roses.</p><p>“I can’t,” Sirius said, shortly. “I can’t talk to a shrink.” Again, Remus smiled. Whether Sirius would go to therapy or not, at this point, wasn’t the mission.</p><p>“Then maybe you can just talk to me,” Remus grinned. “If you want.”</p>
<hr/><p>
  <strong> <em> <u>Sirius </u> </em> </strong>
</p><p>“Give me ten minutes, I’ll take you home,” Marlene said, leaving Sirius to smoke another cigarette on the front lawn as she raced back into the house. Despite how he’d been ‘<em>casually’</em> glancing around for sign of Remus, he hadn’t seen him again.</p><p>Instead, a tall, gangly kid with thick glasses and tousled, dark hair came and stood next to him. Warily, Sirius’ eyes shot in his direction. The bloke, who looked about Sirius’ age, patted down his pockets in search of something he didn’t find. He turned to Sirius.</p><p>“Got a light, mate?” he asked. Sirius stifled the automatic snarl in his lip, shifting his weight to the foot opposite of this stranger to widen the space between them.</p><p>“Sure,” he responded on an inward breath, despite himself, holding the lighter out underneath a pinched thumb and forefinger. He thought it odd that this stranger seemed careful to take the lighter by the bottom, avoiding the touch of Sirius’ fingers completely.</p><p>“I’m James Potter.” He offered his name as he lit the cigarette between his teeth, but Sirius noticed that he didn’t really breathe it in. Not hungrily, the way Sirius was.</p><p>“Sirius.” He didn’t give his last name. He <em>never</em> gave his last name. Even the name on his lease was fake. With narrowed eyes, Sirius continued watching him. There was something off here. James stood there with the cigarette in his fingers, not taking a single puff.</p><p>“Are you friends with Mo-” He stopped, restarted. “With Remus?” he asked, his voice easy, but his eyes darting nervously over to Sirius. Sirius took in a deep breath of smoke.</p><p>“No,” he answered shortly, for a moment considering rephrasing that to ‘<em>not yet</em>.’ His heart had starting to pound as he wondered what was taking Marlene so bloody long. “I’m here with Marlene.” <em>Sort of</em>. The look that crossed over James’ face was impossible for Sirius to decipher. It was hard to tell what he <em>wanted</em> from Sirius. But everyone wanted <em>something</em>.</p><p>“Okay, listen, I’m bad with subtlety, so I’m just going to ask,” James blurted out, all in one breath, leaving Sirius to shift his weight even further away. “Are you alright?”</p><p>Sirius swallowed. Why did so many people keep asking him that today? Probably because he slipped into a drug-induced coma for three days and then showed up to a stranger’s house, begging his drug dealer to give him a fix. Yeah, that was probably why.</p><p>“I’m …” he paused, “… fine?” It was more of a question, directed at himself. Of course, he knew he wasn’t fine, he was very fucking far from fine. James took a breath, as if starting a sentence, but it stopped short as he held it for a moment. Sirius looked over cautiously.</p><p>“It’s just that people who are fine don’t usually show up to parties barefoot.” Quickly, Sirius jerked his head down. <em>Dammit</em>. He’d left his flat with no shoes. Of course.</p><p>“I … that’s just … I didn’t really come for the <em>party</em>,” Sirius tried to explain, his words trailing off as he busied his lips with the cigarette still between them.</p><p>“I know. You came to find Marlene,” James stated with certainty in his voice. “I also know you had a panic attack on my back lawn.” <em>Ah</em>. This was the <em>rich kid</em>. What was he so worried about? Was he going to try to blame Sirius for fucking up the vibe?</p><p>“I’m sorry, I –” Sirius started, but James interrupted.</p><p>“Do you need a place to stay, Sirius?”</p><p>“<em>What</em>? No,” Sirius replied instantly. Of course, if his Uncle Alphard hadn’t left him everything, Sirius <em>wouldn’t</em> have a place to stay, at all. But there was still some inheritance money left over. It was enough to last him until he could deal with everything. Get over what happened, move on with his life, disappear off the face of the earth. Whichever it would be.</p><p>Not to mention, Sirius couldn’t live with another person. How often would there be an accidental brush of skin? How many nights would Sirius keep them up with his unending nightmares? No, he <em>had</em> to live in isolation. It was the only way he could stay alive.</p><p>“Could I borrow your phone?” James suddenly asked. Jesus, he was all over the place.</p><p>“Uh, sure?” Sirius cocked an eyebrow as he pulled his mobile from his back pocket, cigarette still dangling from his lips. James had the phone for barely two minutes.</p><p>“I’ve sent myself your number. Is it okay if I check in with you every now and then?” For longer than he thought was considered normal, Sirius blinked dumbly at James. <em>Why</em>? Why was everyone at this party so concerned with his well-being? Couldn’t they all just leave him to rot in what he felt was his own self-created misery? His parents certainly had.</p><p>Finally, Sirius realized that the cigarette in James’ fingers remained completely unsmoked. James had asked him for a light for a cigarette that he didn’t intend to smoke. Which meant that this rich kid, James Fucking Potter, used it as an excuse, just to <em>talk</em> to Sirius. For some reason that Sirius couldn’t pin down, that was comforting. Endearing, even.</p><p>“Yeah, alright,” Sirius replied, looking carefully at this stranger. His glasses reflected the streetlights around them, making it look like a shimmering, hazel galaxy was tucked away inside his gaze. When he smiled, satisfied and pleased, his high, round cheekbones pressed up against his eyes, creasing together the freckles at the corners, shifting his glasses a little higher up the bridge of his nose. This unfettered smile, his eyes shining in the darkness, and the way his thick, dark hair stood on end, likely from someone running their fingers through it, made it look like he was some wild creature of the night. An untamed, but gentle animal. With horns. No<em>, antlers</em>.</p><p>Just then, Marlene came from the house, arm-in-arm with a redhead, whose green eyes were on James as soon as he was in view. The girls hugged their goodbye and Marlene gave Sirius a watchful look, assessing his condition without giving it away. Sirius gave a single nod.</p><p>“How do you feel about talking on the phone?” James called as they walked away. For just a moment, Sirius let himself smile. Who the fuck <em>was</em> this kid?</p><p>“I’d rather text,” Sirius mumbled back, turning to look at James. He wasn’t sure he’d ever seen a smile quite like the one he saw on that rich kid’s face.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus, Sirius, it’s fucking freezing in here,” Marlene said as she opened the door to Sirius’ flat for him. He hadn’t noticed. Of course, he hadn’t been conscious to notice. The cold in his flat was probably why he hadn’t noticed he had run out of his flat without shoes – his feet couldn’t tell the difference. The rest of him hardly could, either.</p><p>“I guess the heat is out,” he shrugged as Marlene peered at said thermostat on the wall. She made a strange sound of surprise at whatever number she saw there.</p><p>“You <em>guess</em>?” she bellowed, adding in an overly dramatic shiver. “I’m calling the super right now. It’s warmer outside than it is in here and it’s <em>October</em>.” She stared, like Sirius was going to have some revelation over what month it very obviously was. He just stood, staring.</p><p>“Is he going to have to come <em>in here</em>?” Sirius wondered, gritting his teeth behind his lips. He didn’t have to hide his feelings with Marlene, but sometimes he thought she would get irritated with how <em>far</em> his paranoia went. This time, her expression went soft.</p><p>“If he comes tonight, I’ll be here. Don’t worry.” While she was on the call, Sirius pulled out his own mobile, looking through the messages. There were only two conversations – one was Marlene. The other went to a number he didn’t recognize, which meant it went to James.</p><p>He opened the message. Inside, all the text said was ‘<em>Padfoot</em>.’ His eyebrows furrowed for only a second before he realized that James was referring to Sirius’ bare feet. Was this a nickname? What <em>for</em>? Sirius had <em>just</em> given James his name. Surely, he hadn’t forgotten it that quickly. If it was a nickname, Sirius wasn’t sure if it was even a positive one. It was kind of a jab.</p><p>Either way, Sirius tapped the number, saving it to his mobile. Two could play at this bizarre game – he saved James’ number under the name ‘<em>Prongs</em>.’ Whatever this was, it wasn’t unpleasant. Even these little digs at each other sparked something in Sirius that had long been dead. Something that reminded him of someone he would’ve once, <em>had</em> once, done anything to protect. Someone his parents had poisoned against him.</p><p>The thought of Regulus brought tears to Sirius’ eyes. At least he knew he had done what he could to make sure his little brother had a life that he wanted, no matter the cost. Before Sirius could dwell on that <em>cost</em>, Marlene spoke.</p><p>“They can’t send someone up until tomorrow. You can crash at my place.” She made the offer with very little inflection in her tone, knowing what Sirius’ answer would be.</p><p>“I’m fine here.” With a sigh, she nodded.</p><p>“Let me at least bring you a space heater.” There wasn’t a spare moment for him to argue – Marlene was across the hall and back before his mouth even opened.</p><p>“Thanks,” he said, lingering on the word as he tried to determine the best way to ask Marlene to give him more Valium. She’d already done so much. Before he could even get the words out, Marlene already knew, slipping two pills into his jacket pocket. But <em>only</em> two.</p><p>“See if you sleep on the Xanax I gave you,” Marlene sighed, eyeing Sirius’ nervous glances. “I’ll get more Valium, if it doesn’t work. But I’m putting you on a fucking schedule.” She pointed at him, baring her teeth. “No more ten at a bleeding time.”</p><p>“Okay,” he whispered, looking down at the floor.</p><p>“Oh, and here.” She fished around in her jacket pocket, pulling out her mobile and flash-typing on the screen for mere milliseconds before pocketing it again. “If you’re interested.”</p><p>“What –” Sirius started, but Marlene left him questioning, letting the door fall shut behind her. The sound of her door closing came soon after, followed by the buzzing of his own mobile, from his back pocket. With furrowed eyebrows, he glanced at the screen. It showed a text from Marlene. The message contained another foreign number. With a name. <em>Remus</em>.</p><p> </p><p>The Xanax didn’t work. For several hours, he laid still, waiting to fall asleep. Sleep never came. Of course, the nightmares hadn’t started back up, so at least he had that. That didn’t mean he didn’t see that face every time he closed his eyes. Only the ten Valium at a time had gotten rid of that, but Marlene wasn’t going to let him do that again.</p><p>At around two in the morning, the face of his mobile lit the room. He squinted his eyes to look at the screen – it was a text from James. <em>Prongs</em>. When he opened the message, blinking violently from the intrusion of light into his eyes, he tried hard to quell the smile trying to form over his face. The text was in all caps.</p><p>

</p><p>Sirius gritted his teeth at his own comment. It sounded too much like <em>himself</em> – like the old self that he left behind and locked in a basement, deep at the bottom of his psyche. He could never be that person again. For his own sake.</p><p>

  <strong>_________________________________________________________</strong>
</p><p>The thought of this <em>Remus</em> stirred something unusual in Sirius’ chest. Maybe it was the way Remus had helped him at the party – Marlene had told him how quickly Remus acted to try to ease Sirius’ panic. Even though Sirius knew Remus had touched him (Marlene had told him that too, a detailed recall of all the places that Remus’ hands had been), it somehow didn’t quite bother him as much as he expected it to. Remus had done what he had to, and he’d saved him.</p><p>More than once, Sirius opened a new message, with Remus’ newly saved mobile number as the recipient. Each time, he stared at the name underneath his thumbs, and it filled him with absolute dread. What would he say? Any social skill he had in his previous life was obliterated by the massive amounts of Valium he doped himself up on every night. Over and over, he discarded unwritten texts, convincing himself that this was all too soon. Remus, James, <em>all</em> of it.</p><p>However, he texted James again. Maybe just to spite himself. Just to spite his past.</p><p>

</p><p>Sirius didn’t quite understand why James Potter was suddenly so attached to him. He especially didn’t understand what was even remotely likeable about himself that this apparently popular uni kid would want to continue talking to him, especially after how cold he’d been at the party. None of it made sense. There had to be a motive. There was always a motive.</p><p>And yet – Sirius couldn’t stop himself from letting himself get attached right back.</p><p>
  <strong>_________________________________________________________</strong>
</p><p><em>                          Padfoot</em>: yeah. Maybe I should.</p><p>
  <strong>_________________________________________________________</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <em> <u>Remus </u> </em> </strong>
</p><p>There had been no word from Sirius, so far. Remus tried not to be disappointed. In truth, he wondered if Marlene had even remembered to give Sirius his number. So much had happened that evening, it wouldn’t have been hard to forget. Remus began to regret leaving it in Marlene’s hands, rather than getting Sirius’ number directly, for himself.</p><p>They had stayed at James’ so long after the party that he insisted they crash there for the night. Lily had stayed, too, but Remus thought that might have been fairly typical. The four of them stayed up into the night, trading stories and laughing and talking shit. Sirius came up in more than one conversation, and Remus tried to keep the worry from his expression each time.</p><p>“I think I forced him to be friends with me,” James said with a sardonic laugh, his cheeks momentarily filling with a flush. Remus knew that feeling. He’d done much the same to Sirius.</p><p>“Isn’t that what you did with me?” Remus smiled, the edge of a glass to his lips. For a moment, James’ face went a little pale, his mind obviously reeling as he considered what to say in return. Of course, Remus <em>knew</em> that James had been beating himself up about giving Remus the name <em>Moony</em>, on a very distinct physical flaw that Remus was a tad self-conscious about. Despite that, James had called him Moony all night, as if in some attempt to normalize it, so that Remus would forget entirely where the name had come from. Except, he wasn’t going to forget.</p><p>But the name <em>was</em> growing on him. It was in the way James <em>said</em> it – affectionate and warm and tender. Maybe it had started with James trying to force Remus to forget the origin of the name, but it had developed into something else. Into something that Remus could own, into something that Remus could <em>be</em>. Something that reminded him that, yeah, he’d never be rid of the scars, but they were part of who he was. While the scars hadn't shaped him as a person, they'd been there as he'd shaped himself. Intentional or not, James used those scars to remind Remus that the scars belonged to <em>him</em>, and not the other way around. James used those intensely negative reminders to gift Remus with something positive. A <em>name</em>. It was definitely growing on him.</p><p>Before Remus could assure James that he’d been kidding, the colour rapidly returned to James’ face, followed by the fullest, brightest smile that Remus had ever seen.</p><p>“Are you saying you’re my <em>friend</em>, Moony?” James asked, eyes wide with excitement as Lily rolled her eyes animatedly. Her whole head rolled back, in fact.</p><p>“Oh, fuck, I’m really going to regret admitting that,” Remus laughed, letting a groan fall out with each vowel. The smile on James’ face remained for only a moment before it was replaced by a starkly contrasted expression – teeth clenched, eyes widened even further.  </p><p>“Shit! I forget to text Padfoot!” he shouted, scrambling for his mobile.</p><p>“Who?” Pete slurred drowsily, lounging face-down on the sofa next to Remus.</p><p>“Sirius,” James said absently, typing rapidly onto the screen. At Sirius’ name, Remus felt an unexpected pitch to his previously steady heart rate. He knew instantly what that little flicker meant, he’d seen it coming. This was bad. <em>Really</em> fucking bad.</p><p>“You …” Remus tried to slow his voice. “You have his number?”</p><p>“I didn’t tell you?” James didn’t look up, but Remus was trying not to notice that Lily <em>did</em>, her attention suddenly directed to <em>Remus</em>. “I kinda conned him into giving it up.”</p><p>“Is he alright?” Remus asked, swallowing to keep his voice from rising. Lily narrowed her eyes – not speaking, but certainly not looking away.</p><p>“I’m sure he is. I just wanted to make sure he made it home.” This time, James did look up, and Lily’s expression tempered, almost on purpose. Before James could say more, the phone buzzed in his hand and he looked back down. Remus waited, hoping he would share.</p><p>Luckily, Lily asked the question for him. “I take it that means he made it.”</p><p>“Yeah,” James said. His face was soft again, just like the first time Remus had seen it this way. ‘<em>Well, now you have me, too, right, Moony?</em>’ he heard James’ voice say in his head, as clearly as he’d said it before. It was like James Potter deliberately went out of his way to collect people he <em>knew</em> were broken. Like he made it his own personal mission to repair them. And, from what Remus could tell, it might as well have been his goddamn <em>profession</em> because Remus hadn’t felt this safe, this included, this <em>himself</em> since he met Peter.</p><p>“Why am I the only one who didn’t meet Padfoot?” Peter mumbled through the couch cushions and Remus realized how enamored he’d become with these nicknames James had given to them. Not just his, but all of them, collectively. Through these ridiculous little names, they had become banded together. Remus never wanted to stop being <em>Moony</em>.</p><p>“To be fair, Pete, I met him before he was Padfoot, so I don’t think it counts,” Remus shrugged, and Peter puffed out a muffled cackle, buried in the fabric underneath him.</p><p>“Is he going to group with us on Sunday?” Peter asked, eyes still closed.</p><p>“I hope so,” Remus said, mostly to himself, under his breath. Again, Lily’s attention was drawn to him, glancing at him from her periphery. When he mistakenly met her gaze, a single, smart eyebrow rose in the form of a silent question that Remus didn’t know the answer to.</p><p>“Oh my God, you guys,” James said on a sudden outward breath. When he looked up, his eyes were shining behind his thick, square-framed glasses. “He gave me a nickname.”</p><p>“Oh, shit!” Peter shouted, suddenly wide awake. “He’s one of us now!” The laugh from Peter’s lips uncovered a grin from Remus’ lips that he tried to conceal but couldn’t. </p><p>“<em>What</em>?” Lily snapped, tearing her gaze from Remus. “<em>I</em> don’t have a nickname. Does that mean I’m not one of <em>you</em>?” James shot an amused look over to Remus, who tried to return it. </p><p>“Of course you do,” James huffed. “You’re my Lily-flower.”</p><p>Lily groaned. “That is the worst nickname I’ve ever heard.” James rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Well?” Remus asked. All eyes diverted to him. “What is it? Your nickname?” Immediately, James’ expression went sour – shoulders slumped, head dropped, voice lowered.</p><p>“Prongs.”</p><p>“Damn, Padfoot really <em>is</em> one of us,” Pete said, turning the corners of his mouth down as he nodded to show how impressed he was. “He’s already got the theme down and everything.”</p><p>“There’s a <em>theme</em>?” Lily scoffed, looking irritated, most likely because her impromptu nickname didn’t fit into said theme. The tight smile on James’ face grew.</p><p>“Mine doesn’t fit the theme either, Lil,” Remus assured her.</p><p>“What <em>is</em> the theme?” she shouted, exasperation in her tone. James snorted.</p><p>“Animal-based. Moony, I’m going to assign you as a wolf, so you fit the theme.”</p><p>“Thank you, Prongs.” Remus didn’t try to stifle the grin. “Speaking of Prongs – and Padfoot, for that matter – what’s the story?”</p><p>James stared blankly at Remus. “You really didn’t notice?” Again, Lily watched him closely, watched the blush creep up from the base of his throat.</p><p>“Apparently not?” Remus tried to laugh.</p><p>“Remus was a little preoccupied saving the boy’s life, give him a break,” Lily broke in, glancing at Remus, who nervously pushed the hair from his eyes.</p><p>“I mean, I’m oblivious as fuck and I still noticed the kid didn’t have on any shoes,” James replied, glowering playfully at Lily and not realizing that his comment was a tad tone-deaf.</p><p>“Oh, <em>Padfoot</em>.” Remus smacked himself in the forehead as he fell back against the back of the sofa. Peter grumbled a little at the motion of the couch, as he had already fallen back into a state of semi-consciousness, face planted against the cushions. “But Prongs?”</p><p>Again, James’ expression slackened. “It’s my hair,” he said listlessly. Immediately, Lily and Remus shot each other matching, knowing smiles.</p><p>“Antlers,” Remus mimed as Lily nodded, a wide grin covering her freckled cheeks.</p><p>“My hair does <em>not</em> look like antlers!” James whined.</p><p>“Oh, don’t be upset,” Lily crooned, pulling James into a kiss. “You have cute antlers.”</p><p>He pulled out of the kiss to pretend to cry, arms thrown out to his side, head thrown back onto the tall back of the armchair he and Lily were sharing. “I <em>don’t</em> have antlers.”</p><p>“But it fits,” Remus argued. James’ whole face brightened. That tenderness that he felt when James called him Moony spread through his chest again. It wasn’t the terrifying hitch in the rhythm of his heart, like he felt when he thought about Sirius, it was just <em>warm</em>.</p><p>“A matched set.” A fire of gold and green burned in his hazel eyes.</p><p> </p><p>The room across from James’ went to Remus. Peter took the one right next door, making sure to tell Remus to wake him if he needed him for anything. With Remus’ assurance, Peter waddled off into his room, leaving the door open, and collapsing onto the bed in the corner.</p><p>As Remus turned to go into his room, he stopped short, nearly running face first into Lily, who leaned into his doorway, in an obvious attempt at blocking him from it.</p><p>“Need something, Lil?” Remus asked, trying to keep his tone light, but knowing exactly why she was prowling. She was trying to get Remus to <em>talk</em>.</p><p>“Have you talked to Sirius yet?” Even as she spoke, she watched Remus closely, as if watching for minuscule facial expressions that could give him away.</p><p>“Nope,” Remus replied, with a nonchalant shrug. “I don’t have his number.”</p><p>“Oh.” Her expression was surprised, but also … disappointed? “Does he have yours?”</p><p>Another shrug. “I gave it to Marlene. I don’t know if he has it or not.” For only a moment, she was quiet, staring absently at Remus, as if formulating a plan to resolve this situation.</p><p>“Stay right here.” With a hop, she ran into James’ room and, after some loud grumbling from James, returned with his mobile in her hand. Once unlocked, she went straight to rummaging through James’ texts – Remus glanced down to see <strong><em>Padfoot</em></strong> across the top.</p><p>“I don’t know if I …” Remus started to argue. If Sirius had wanted him to have his number, he would’ve given it to him. Maybe Sirius didn’t <em>want</em> to talk to Remus. The delighted look on Lily’s face made him reconsider. What was it she was finding in this conversation?</p><p>“Before you say anything else, read this.” They traded phones and Remus looked down.</p><p>

</p><p>His throat tightened as he swallowed, staring at the words on the screen. <em>“Maybe I already know it. Maybe Remus likes me more than he likes you.”</em> While that wasn’t necessarily true – because, of course he liked James and yes, he liked Sirius, but <em>quite</em> differently – he may have let an ethereal smile cross over his lips before pursing them to stifle it.</p><p>Remus looked up as Lily spoke. “I already put his number in your mobile,” she said hurriedly as James shouted at her from his room to come to bed.</p><p>“Lily, what if …” She interrupted, swapping phones again.</p><p>“You won’t know if you don’t <em>talk</em> to him.” Her voice bordered insistent. Just before she disappeared into James’ room, Remus caught her by the arm.</p><p>“Tell James that I <em>like</em> being Moony.” A subdued smile flourished over her face, starting with a tiny curl in one corner of her lips and spreading to every feature of her face.</p><p>“I’ll tell him in the morning. He deserves to sweat over it a little first.” With a wink, she shut James’ door behind her, leaving Remus in a dark, empty hallway. And he let himself stand there, silently leaning against his doorway. He had Sirius’ number.</p><p>No, if for no other reason, he wouldn’t text Sirius purely as a measure of self-control, because this was becoming a bigger problem than Remus was willing to let it become. Sure, Sirius might need him, and if he did, Remus would be there to help. Nothing more. After all, Sirius was an absolute stranger – one that Remus <em>knew</em> used illegal prescription drugs. Why was that giant-arse red flag not enough for him to want to stay away?</p><p>It was because Remus knew the reason. Because he knew that those drugs were most likely the only reason that Sirius was still half-functioning, at the very least. Because he knew that there was some massive trauma in Sirius’ past that had immensely fucked him up. The kind of massive trauma that maybe Remus alone could understand. He couldn’t let go of the idea of <em>saving</em> Sirius, because maybe he was the only one who could. He and James and Peter.</p><p>Stripping his shirt and stepping out of his jeans, Remus buried himself beneath the pile of blankets on top of the guest bed. A soft, pleasant moan slipped from his lips at the contact of the cool silk sheets against his skin, against the long-since-healed areas of his skin that tended to run hotter than the rest. Or at least, felt like they did, most days.</p><p>His mobile was still in his hand. A tap on the screen illuminated the dark. Thumb hovering over Sirius’ contact information, he brought the other hand up to rub his face. More than once, he typed out several variations of the same message, only to ultimately discard them all.</p><p>He shut off the screen. If Sirius needed him, he would contact him. If there was some sort of order to the chaos of the universe, and he <em>was</em> the one that Sirius needed, then Sirius would find him again. Remus had to believe that. So, he burrowed deep into the mountain of sheets and blankets and pillows above him, curling his knees to his chest and holding them there.</p><p> </p><p>It must’ve been how worked up he’d gotten himself over Sirius – more so with making sure Sirius lived through the enormous panic attack he’d had, practically in Remus’ arms. It could have been brought on by how high Remus’ own anxiety ran throughout the course of the previous day. After all, he’d gone to a house party with dozens of strangers and had fallen asleep in a foreign bed he hadn’t planned on sleeping in, which he hadn’t done since … well.</p><p>Either way, <em>something</em> had brought on the nightmare he had the night before. At this point in his life, the nightmares were few and far between, mostly thanks to the disgusting amounts of therapy Remus had to endure. It had probably been a month since the last one.</p><p>This one hadn’t been the worst he’d ever had. Or, at least, he assumed, since nobody burst into the room to shake him from nightmare-induced screaming. Compared to some of his others, this one had been relatively mild. Of course, there was still that face that Remus had to stare at – the sharpened, yellowing teeth underneath sunken, hollow, <em>empty</em> eyes. His face was often the worst part. Remembering it brought a caustic taste to the back of Remus’ throat.</p><p>Several minutes of deep breathing reminded him that he was safe – there were no cables around his ankles, no plastic ties around his wrists, all of his scars had healed. He was at his friend’s house – warm, comfortable, <em>safe</em>. It was the first time in a long time that he had to run through this little checklist, reminding him of all the situations he was <em>not</em> in anymore.</p><p>When James Potter came bounding into his room, shouting incoherently at the top of his lungs (seriously, how did he <em>not</em> have a hangover?) Remus had to redefine his definition of safe. James had the ability to make Remus feel safe even when he was still very much on edge.</p><p>“Moony!”  James screamed, and Remus could feel him pulling at the blankets mounded on top of the bed, the pressure against him being released with each layer. “Moony? Moony! If you’re alive, give me a sign.” His clawing at the blankets ceased momentarily.</p><p>“I’m not sure I’m alive,” Remus muttered into the pillow. At the sound of his voice, James yanked back the rest of the blankets, uncovering Remus’s bare torso. And all of the unnumbered scars that lived there. James didn’t even look down, didn’t acknowledge them at all.</p><p>“You’re alive,” James grinned, but it faded a little. “Everything okay?” God, how perceptive could he be? Remus had tried so hard to keep his stressed expression hidden. In an attempt to not turn it into a huge deal, Remus stretched, pulling the sheet further up, back up over his chest. As uncomfortable as he was with having other people see just how damaged his body really was, he knew he shouldn’t have shed his clothes last night. But it was damn near impossible to sleep with how hot he ran, especially at night. Besides, James really wasn’t other <em>people</em>. He was just <em>James</em>. He glanced toward Remus’ motion but didn’t say anything.</p><p>“I’d be better if I wasn’t just woken up at dawn,” Remus grumbled, lying to avoid having to tell James that sleeping in his guest room had incited a panic-nightmare.</p><p>The grin returned to James’ face, but it had changed. “Lily told me what you said.” Before he could even try to suppress it, a satisfied grin splashed over Remus’ lips.</p><p>“I take it back,” he lied. James didn’t buy it in the least.</p><p>“You <em>like</em> being my Moony, you can admit it.”</p><p>“I admit nothing.”</p><p>“And I just realized this morning when I went to go change your name in my mobile to Moony that I don’t even have your number.” His knees hit the floor next to the bed as he propped his elbows up onto the mattress, jutting into Remus’ ribs. He held his mobile in both hands, looking up at Remus, expectant.  Remus let out a fake groan and recited his digits.</p><p>On the windowsill next to his bed, Remus’ mobile vibrated, scuttling across the cherry-stained wood. Without even looking at the face, he swiped his thumb over the screen.</p><p>“You’re really going to save me as Moony in your mobile?” he asked with a smile, but James’ eyebrows furrowed as he pulled the phone from his own ear.</p><p>“It went to your voicemail,” he said quietly, glancing at Remus’ phone, as if he were trying to hear what could possibly be on the other end. Within the gentle hum of an open line, Remus heard a sharp, anxious breath, followed by a length of silence.</p><p>“Remus?” he heard. His eyes widened, that hitch in his heart rate returned in full.</p><p>“<em>Sirius</em>?”</p>
