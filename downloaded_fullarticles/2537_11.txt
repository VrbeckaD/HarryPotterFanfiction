    <p>It was our 5th year at Hogwarts, and Umbridge was changing everything. I was a 5th year, and I was having a pretty great time, even if I was a Slytherin. </p><p>It was a rainy day when we were called to a school-wide meeting. I sat next to Daphne Greengrass and had Blaze on the other side of me. I had been friends with Blaze since the summer before school started.<br/>
“Sadie, what do you think this is about?” Blaze leans over and asks.<br/>
“Probably the 1st years messing things up in the potions room or Harry got in trouble for “inappropriate” behaviour.” It was no rumour that Potter had created a secret duelling club for those who wanted to learn how. I had been asked by a Hufflepuff girl, Lucy Hale. Lucy and I were friends; we had been friends since our first year at Hogwarts.<br/>
“I hate Potter and his blood traitor group of friends,” Malfoy says as he sets his head down on the table.<br/>
“For a person who can have almost everything he asks for. You seem to be …what's the word…jealous.” I say not thinking Draco can hear me.<br/>
“ what did you just say, Baldock?” Malfoy says looking at me with a lot of anger in his eyes, “you think I'm jealous of Potter? You must be out of your mind.”<br/>
“My names, not Baldock by the way. It's Sadie.” I say still looking at him.  “Maybe if you were a decent person, you would know that, but you're not.”<br/>
Malfoy turned and looked down at the table. The clock struck 4 in the evening when Umbridge to the front of the room. She wore her usual colour, pink. I heard Daphne mutter something about how she hated the colour pink. Most people could believe that this woman was in Slytherin, not by the way she dressed, but by her cruel punishment on kids in her detention.<br/>
“Students, it has come to my attention that some of you wish to learn how to fight. I will give you the honour of learning defensive spells, but not in the classroom. The minister of magic has permitted me to host the Wizarding games. These are not like the Triwizard tournament. You will compete amount your classmates. I will pick names from a bowl from each house. If you are called, you can't back out unless someone volunteers for you.<br/>
If chosen you will compete against each other, until the death.  Only 5th years and older will be competing in the games. The rest of us will watch, the ministry will also be attending. Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favour.”<br/>
Four bowls each bearing a house colour. In the green pot. My name was in it, and so was Blazes.  I looked at Blaze for a moment, and he had a horror look on his face. I leaned over and looked at Malfoy who also looked nervous.<br/>
“Now let's choose our lucky 24 kids,” Umbridge says walking over to the green bowl<br/>
“24?” Draco says, looking up. “Why so many?”<br/>
“ for Group 1<br/>
Marcus Flint<br/>
Daphne Greengrass<br/>
Group 2<br/>
Draco Malfoy<br/>
Sadie Baldock”<br/>
I was chosen. I saw Blaze's Face go white. I was going to be competing for my life against Malfoy and Daphne. I felt someone grab my hand it was Daphne, she looked as though she was fixing to cry.<br/>
“Draco, if you hurt Sadie in any way I'll, curse you and pray you don't come out alive. If I’m also in the games. I will hunt you down, and kill you.” Blaze says.<br/>
“Blaze, relax. I won't hurt her; I wasn’t even planning on hurting kids in my house.” Draco says looking at me.<br/>
