    <p>To be whole again.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>A whisper of the bullet passing his ear, the screams of a grieving mother and the soft thud of a child's body hitting the platform. these are the sounds that torment him at night. The reasons he needs to take a dreamless sleep draught before bed to even hope for some much needed sleep.<br/>
A man surrounded by smoke, gun raised at him, the bullet whizzing past colliding with his son. Another connects with his leg, shattering the bone. Pain explodes like fireworks across his vision. </p><p>He wakes panting a cold sweat dripping down his back. Eyes darting around the room he struggles to find his bearings. The empty pillow beside him reminds him the nightmare is all to real. His leg is aching again. He rubs his shin, vainly trying to vanquish the pain that lingers. Flinging the tangled blankets to the floor he trudges to the bathroom for a glass of water, gulping down the cool air as he does. Attempting to calm the panic his dreams erupt within.<br/>
Tears don't fall anymore. He has cried for too many years. He is lost, hollow. A shell of the man he one was and still expected to be. </p><p>"Just a dream. It will pass." He tells himself as he runs the shower. a vain hope lingers in his mind that the heat and steam will wash it all away. </p><p>It doesn't.</p><p>It never has.</p><p>He highly suspects it never will. Another gulp of air and he steps under the water, trying any way.</p><p>The kettle shrieks as he shuts of the water. He scrubs his unruly mop of hair with the fluffy yellow towel and wraps it around his waist as he heads towards the kitchen. His lips twitch. A ghost of a smile. The image of her laughing, wrapped in the cloud of yellow, her auburn hair glistening like a waterfall at sunset cascading down her back. It used to be her favorite towel, the wee splash of daisies in the corner forming a cursive G. </p><p>He shakes his head. trying to remove the memories of kissing the water droplets of her shoulders, the way she'd gasp his name her laughter filling his soul, reminiscent of birdsong on a spring morning.<br/>
He can't think of her today. Its too painful, to raw. He needs to stay composed. Its memorial day. </p><p>An exasperated sigh reaches his ears as he pours the boiling water over the coffee granules in his mug.</p><p>"Harry James Potter! Why must I always find you in this state of undress?!" </p><p>He jumps, the kettle drops and skitters across the kitchen floor to rest at his friends leather booted feet. </p><p>"Jesus! Hermione its only 7am! Why are you here already?" </p><p>He sighs and smiles as she places the kettle back on the bench top. She leans over and wraps her arms around him, giving him the hug he knows he needs.</p><p>"Its memorial day" she replies, ever the one to state the obvious. "Love, its actually 8.30am. Go get dressed, or you'll be late. Molly wont like that."</p><p> He snorts, the thought of Molly's reactions to lateness is enough to make anyone get a move on, so as to avoid her wrath. </p><p>"Ok, Okay. Gimme five minuets 'mione." </p><p>He smiles at her. Its a hollow smile, the one he only wears for her. He knows she can see right through the facade to the broken man he is inside, but for her he'll always try to be his best. She's his best friend. He doesn't want her to worry.</p><p>Gulping down his slightly to hot to drink coffee he trudges back down the hall to his bedroom. He doesn't dare to look at the frames on the wall. Not today. He can't do this today. Composure, he needs to maintain it.<br/>
As he walks through the bedroom door hes spares a quick glance, he cant help it, at the last frame. Ron took this picture the week before it happened. He, Ginny and the boys had been teaching little lily to fly for the first time. Its autumn, they're laughing. Lily wobbles and falls of the broom into a huge pile of leaves. the wind catches them, surrounding the happy family in a tidal wave of crimson, yellow and gold. He'd give anything to laugh like that again.</p><p>Feeling the lump form in his throat as it always does, he rushes through the door. There are no pictures in here. It doesn't hurt as much when he can't see them. </p><p>Casting a quick drying charm he carefully folds the towel, the daisy G facing up. His fingers trail the curve of the G as he places it on the chair.</p><p>Shucking on his suit jacket he glances in the mirror. His suit is perfectly tailored to cling in all the right places, enhancing the curves of his muscles underneath. The green silk shirt matches his eyes, over the years he  has changed his glasses, no longer the circular frames synonymous with the boy who lived. The sleek titanium rectangular frames rest on his nose, he pushes them up with his pinky, the way she used to do it for him, when he'd spend many a night up late filling in his Auror paperwork.</p><p>Taking a deep breath he turns away from the mirror, from the image of himself that feels so wrong. Oh how he would rather curl up in one of his over sized woolen jumpers by the fire. He steadies himself. Today is not about him, its memorial day. It is about them, the public. The reason he maintains composure and wears the perfectly tailored suits even though he feels dead inside. Glancing at the chair he spots the silver tie Hermione had ordered with his suit. </p><p>No. No way in hell. He thinks</p><p>" I am not wearing this." He plonks the tie on the coffee table in front of Hermione. She smirks</p><p>"Oh come on Harry you have to look your best."</p><p>"I'm already wearing this damn suit. Did it really have to fit quite so well? I'm not wearing the tie. Green I can handle, but silver?! No, its too...too Slytherin."</p><p> He flops unceremoniously into the arm chair opposite her. Desperately trying not to choke on her tea she swallows her laughter.</p><p>"Oh Harry. You have to stop this colour nonsense. we're not at Hogwarts anymore, besides you look amazing in Slytherin colours" </p><p>Harry glares at her, sending her into gales of laughter.</p><p>"I don't want to look amazing" he huffs.</p><p>"Tough luck. Come on, don't want to be late" </p><p>He doesn't let her know the real reason he wont wear the tie. He's not ready to admit that even to himself. He wasn't the only one whose heart broke that day in the smoke. his wasn't the only family torn apart and splintered, peppered by bullets.</p><p>Another deep breath, shakes him out of his reverie. </p><p>"Suppose we ought not to leave Ron alone too long" He pulls Hermione up from the sofa. They turn on the spot and apparate to The Burrow.</p>
