          <div class="userstuff"><p>Kana always had a heavy amount of pressure on him, since birth he was the heir to not only to a big sum of money, but a large ownership of land as well, along with prestige to live up to.</p><p> </p><p>His mother, who came from a very revered house in Japan, who owned more than half of the small island and had the ties of the imperial family for a long time running.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The pressure of his father's side however, was much much greater. He wasn't allowed to take either his mother or father's name socially without an official reasons. His full name being: Kana Ayzik Taiyo Minamoto Karađorđevićs on paper and is known to be behind lock and key while he is trained in the ways of politics in order to one day become an advisor to his cousins, or become the crown.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>In order to have his freedom, he is simply known as Kana Yusupov. The name still has weight, but not nearly as much as Karađorđevićs or Minamoto.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>It worked in his favor as the head of house, Felix, happened to be his godfather, and would vouch for him should there ever be a time of people question his fake name.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Yes, the burden he carried was heavy, but t was made a little lighter with small favors.</p><p> </p><p>————-</p><p>
  <em>I, Kana Ayzik Taiyo Minamoto Karađorđevićs, do solemnly swear that as eldest of the second in line's for the crown, do become the advisor, the sword, and the shield to my cousin, Macarthur Arthurovich Karađorđevićs, from the horrors of evil, and the eye of an assassin, I give up my life, so he may live, I drink the poison of ill intent so dawn may kiss the holy land of our forefathers, and eat the sword that craves the blood of our ancestors. I do this, all in his name, may he live forever.</em>
</p><p>————</p><p>The day I was given my letter was a sweet one, it was peaceful in the house gardens, Macarthur, while still young, was very wise on animal behavior, he calmed the mother swan and we were able to pet her chicks. It was then that an owl smacked me in the face with a letter, it was unusual and strange, and I immediately ordered my cousin of three years older inside, and to call his guards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I had looked around cautiously, as if waiting for someone who coveted the crown the come out and attack, when none came I immediately went inside to find Uncle Arthur, as Emperor, anything that happens in his land was to be seen by him first and foremost.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>After winding through hallways it was by my sixth sense alone that I found both him and Macarthur in the third study, instantly, I was irritated. "You absolute halfwit! If there really was an assassin, both you and your father would both be in the same place, which means you could both be killed, and what would that mean then hmm?!"</p><p> </p><p>Macarthur scoffed, "You are always like a mother wolf, quick to nip her cubs before licking them! I already sent guards to parole the area thankyou!"<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I huffed, less irritated as I gave the letter to his grace, "I was hit with it by an owl, I dared not to open it before you tore it with your own hands Uncle."</p><p> </p><p>Uncle raised an eyebrow at our exchange but none the less took the letter, as he opened it I stood at the ready to drag my cousin undergoing lest it be a death threat or a move or the emperor and his family themselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Now Uncle had both eyebrows raised high into his raven hairline. "My nephew, I think this is for you." He handed me the letter and now I copied my Uncle's expression of clear surprise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>With each word I was more and more perplexed, I looked at my Uncle wordlessly, begging for an answer as if he was the all knowing universe himself, and maybe at that moment, I had wished it to be true, if at nothing at all but to get to the bottom of this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Alas, Uncle also shook his head, we both had no idea what to do, with my parents on vacation in Japan, I was to say Incase of tragedy in order to preserve the crown, so I was at the mercy of cluelessness. We knew not what to do and hadn't the slightest clue if it was just an elaborate prank to a ruse to instill confusion for a murder plot.</p><p> </p><p>——————————</p><p> </p><p>It wasn't until three months later, with the letter tucked safely into my father's desk so upon his return he could read it, that it had been brought back to my attention.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I had been staying in my god father's mansion, him and I both about to stroll the town and splurge just for the sake of my father and uncle's irritation. That was when a small man had popped into my and my uncle's study just as we were devising a plan for the most efficient spending that would gain my mother's favor so we could hide behind her when uncle and father found out about the splurging<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>My godfather had jumped out of his seat, letting out a (definitely) manly scream while I startled, my liquor glass exploding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The man coughed and waved a stick, the glass repairing itself. "Sorry, oh very sorry to interrupt yes!" My godfather slowing sat back in his chair while I stood. The strange man looked at me and smiled, "Ah! Young Yusupov, I came here on the deputy headmistresses request, we were wondering why you haven't registered In the school for your first year yet! And so close to the date too!"<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I raised my brows in the Karađorđevićs way, he spoke English, and talked of a school? Deputy headmistress, was he talking of that Minerva? The letter maybe?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>"We though it vas elaborate prank, judging from your stik magjik, it vas clearly not." The small man nodded in a full body way, smiling and giving silent praise, "Oh you're so very smart! On the first try! Usually regular muggles go into a panic like your father there, you would do wonderful in ravenclaw, but enough of that. I must urge you to go."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>When I said nothing he sighed, "dear Kana, if you don't train your magic, you surprise will made that glass move on to humans you see, and then eventually....you."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Wincing at the both disgusting and disheartening imagine he gave, I nodded, "How do I gather ze supplies, and to get to skhool?"<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>The man waved the questions away, "I will take you, and will also lead you to the train on September 1st, expect me then, bright and early at 3 am so we don't miss the train."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Before I could ask anything else, he vanished with a loud pop, no evidence of him being there beforehand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>——————</p><p> </p><p>The goodbye was sad, however no tears had been shed beside my mother and godfather's brief ones behind closed doors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I was dressed in my civilian wear, an oriental shirt and black loose jeans (A/n: see drawing for ref)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I hugged Macarthur tightly, "Cousin, no, older brother of mine, if this is just a trap, know that I care for you deeply, and wish your utmost wisdom while I'm gone, ancestors only know you need it."</p><p> </p><p>His indignation rolled off his in waves, but he hugged back just as tightly, we had never been separated this long before. It would be lonely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>I shook the hand of my uncle, who gave me his silver ring of protection, and kissed my father on both cheeks, who gave me his ring of authority.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>My mother showered me with her affection, while brief, it was fierce and protective. She sighed and tied part of my hair up in a ponytail with a blue ribbon, which bore the Minamoto insignia, leaving my left eye covered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>"I wish you the best love."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>She whispered, hugging me the tightest. I stood tall as I walked out of my home for maybe the last time in a long while.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>However, the beginning of my school days were just beginning, as the man had introduced himself as Flitwick. He made us disappear and enter a place very strange indeed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>He gave me a 'translation spell' so I would be able to talk properly, and my scrabble for school supplies became a race. He had given me a train ticked and explicit instructions on how to get out of 'daigon alley' and into Kings cross station.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>So I was left alone, in an odd place, away from my home, where no one knew my name.</p><p> </p><p>What a wonderful way this was turning out already.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>An: I'm kinda just stalling now to get enough words. So uh, disclaimer: any names, places; or bloodlines are just be grabbing at anything to help string together a good story; this is a work of fiction, anything that does exist IRL is not in any way related to this.</p></div>
