    <p>
  <em>Harry,</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Yes, the fewer letters sent the better, not only for myself but for your owl. I’m sure they don’t like dealing with dementors.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>You’re a clever boy, but it still does not answer how you knew I was your godfather. But I have this feeling you’ll never spill your secrets so asking would be a waste of parchment. You know, I always thought you’d be like your father, flying on a broom in Quidditch but I guess you’ll turn into your mum with a brilliant mind for knowledge… Once you manage to figure out why you’re bad at charms that is. I’m sure your friends will be able to help you with schoolwork and also keep you out of trouble. Please do not engage against trolls anytime soon or I may just try to find a way to break out of here.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>You-Know-Who is back, even as a parasite he is not dead. Trust Dumbledore to keep you safe but also listen to your gut like you have done this year. Always trust it. Avoid trouble, keep your nose clean but remember to have fun, don’t waste your youth chasing a destiny not yet ready for you.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Get good at charms. Queen. Red. These are not bad questions but many of them are memories lost to me and I had to sit here for a few minutes to think about them.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>You may hear terrible things as you grow up but never let them get to you. Keep your friends close but be cautious as you never know when one will slither away into the dark, do not repeat the mistakes of us adults.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Sirius</em>
</p>
<p>Sitting lotus style on my bed I reread the letter, picking apart each word he said. Two things stuck to me and both are connected to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>Sirius doesn’t like that I’m in Slytherin.</p>
<p>He never mentions my house, instead focused on my lack of interest in Quidditch and my poor charms skills. But I also read no malice towards me directly, I felt more pride than anything that I was doing so well in school. </p>
<p>
  <em>Slither away into the dark…</em>
</p>
<p>That had to be a warning about Draco, how his family was and probably still is loyal to Voldemort to a fine stretch of the imagination. Sirius is warning me to not make myself vulnerable around other Slytherins because of who I am.</p>
<p>Appreciated, but not needed.</p>
<p>Going to my trunk I pull out my notebook and opened it for the first time since I finished writing all of my notes. The notes were skeletal summaries of each book, initials for people’s names and key words swapped out for pop culture references. I can afford to forget some details; minuscule ones that are little more than trivia that could get me full points on a Pottermore quiz. But I cannot afford to forget Voldemort’s Horcrux, their locations, and what can destroy them. </p>
<p>Besides, no one needs to remember when everyone’s birthday is, I can barely remember mine.</p>
<p>Pretty sure it’s next week.</p>
<p>Placing Sirius’ letter at the final page of the Philosopher’s Stone section along with Sirius’ first letter I close the notebook and put it away. With luck, I will only need to look over this book on rare occasions or to add notes. </p>
<p>“Well then…” I sigh, throwing my arm out to stretch. “Wanna go for another round of training, Sansa? Scabbers?”</p>
<p>Scabbers didn’t respond as usual but Sansa hopped off her perch and went to my falconry glove, nudging it in my direction. Slipping it on and putting the jess on my cooperative feather baby’s leg I took the two of them outside. Petunia was in the kitchen preparing lunch for Dudley and Vernon was at work. No one saw me go out the front door with a very large owl and a rat.</p>
<p>It was mid-July at this point. I usually kept the training to night time so Sansa could use her primal instincts, but something inside me just wanted to show off her beauty in broad daylight. </p>
<p>The summer wasn’t awful, wasn’t good either. I stuck to my bedroom and only came out when it was needed. There haven’t been any signs of Dobby stealing my letters, I still get several every few days and Sansa is getting plenty of exercise at night as a result. Petunia stopped complaining about me being in the garden when her marigolds began to bloom not long after I began taking full care of them. I think the praises from her neighbors soften the idea of me helping around. </p>
<p>When we had gotten home, Vernon attempted to lock my trunk away in the cupboard when my wand came out and Sansa went into a threat posture on my stuff. Who would have thought? A child with a stick was more threatening to a whale-like man than a criminal with a knife or gun. He gave up entirely when I tried to say a fake spell when one of my exploding snap cards fell out of one of my trunks pockets and well… exploded. </p>
<p>After that, I have yet to feel the need to use magic as a threat to anyone. Except this one time, but I needed to teach Dudley a lesson.</p>
<p>Mini-sea cow thought it was a good idea to try and steal my anklet the first week of me being back at their place. A long talk with a fluffed owl on my shoulder and a wand twirling in my hand about how he “shouldn’t take others’ belongings without permission, specifically when it was a special Christmas gift” later and Dudley never bothered trying to nab my jewelry. I still refuse to take it off though and have plans on asking Lucius if we can cast an anti-thievery charm on it. </p>
<p>Bless Sansa and her intelligent brain to know exactly when to act scary.</p>
<p>But in any case, back to the training!</p>
<p>“Remember Scabbers, if you manage to escape Sansa’s eyes, you win!” I clap my hands sadistically in encouragement to Scabbers. I never train in the same location, sometimes its the park with wide-open land, last week it was the nearby forest. It always ended the same.</p>
<p>Sansa either caught him, or I played dirty and hit him with a stunning spell.</p>
<p>He never seems to learn, always determined to get away the moment I open his cage door. He’s beginning to bite my fingers whenever I handle him now, determined to escape and get away from me. But it won’t work, not yet at least.</p>
<p>Sansa took off into the air and hovered over the property. She was alert when I opened Scabbers' cage and he took off. The owl getting my sense of humor and waited for the human-rat to get a fair distance before swooping in and catching her charge. </p>
<p>“Good girl, we’ll need to see if you can catch him when not present to his cage opening,” I praised Sansa. Scabbers got returned to his cage with fresh water and some veggies for him, but he seemed to prefer to bury himself in the nest he had made with scraps of cloth. </p>
<p>“Excuse me, boy!” A woman’s voice called out to me, not condescending or shrewd, but rather one that sounded curious. </p>
<p>I look over to see our neighbor, the one that is nosy at best and Petunia spies on often, waving at me politely. I pointed to myself to confirm that I was indeed the “boy” she called for.</p>
<p>“Yes, you! Come here please.” </p>
<p>With an awkward balance, I picked up Scabbers’ cage and walked over to the fence that separated the two yards. Sansa was relaxed on my arm, eyes virtually shut, head tucked into her body and the embodiment of harmless.</p>
<p>“How may I help you, ma’am? My apologies, but I believe we’ve never been introduced. Harry Potter, ma’am,” I say, putting the cage down so I can offer my hand. She takes it while eyeing Sansa suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Harper Poole, Mrs. Poole,” She introduced. “I’ve known you lived here since you were a baby, but you don’t get involved in much. Heard you were disturbed.” She looks at me up and down, from the respectable bird on my arm to the dark green t-shirt and black jeans all neatly resting on my body. “You don’t look disturbed.”</p>
<p>‘I swear Dursleys…’ I fake a laugh. “Oh! I was rather shy around strangers and my teachers were never fond of me as a result. They fed my aunt and uncle a lot of lies. I’ve gotten better at my school.”</p>
<p>“Poor thing… What school do you go to?”</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t hear about it, it’s a small private school in Scotland. I was supposed to go to Stonewall High but I had received a letter from the other school. My parents graduated from it and when they heard that I was turning eleven, they sent me a letter offering a scholarship.” I mean, as far as I can tell Hogwarts does not have any tuition whatsoever. “We’re taught math, writing, chemistry and some after school programs as well.”</p>
<p>I could tell she was going to ask about more specifics for the school, like its name so I look at my owl. “This is Sansa.”</p>
<p>The sudden change in subject caught Mrs. Poole off-guard but she looked at Sansa. “She’s lovely, where did you get her?”</p>
<p>“From my school. Besides normal classes, we can take special classes and I took fal… falconry. We are bonded with an owl and when I am older I can get a license to educate the public about other snowy owls like her since we don’t have them in the UK.”</p>
<p>Wow lying to snoopy ladies is really easy. </p>
<p>“That’s interesting… but do we have to worry about it attacking pets?”</p>
<p>I quickly shake my head which wakes Sansa up, “Oh no, she’s perfectly harmless to pets and I keep her well fed. I’m so grateful my family let me work with her over the summer, my goal is to have her work as a rescue for small animals because of how gentle she is. Would you like to pet her?” Mrs. Poole was hesitant but nodded. “Just stroke her breast like so, she’s friendly.”</p>
<p>I show the neighbor how to pet Sansa, who kept acting like the well-behaved girl that I know she is. I see Petunia walk out the door and storm over to us. Her smile was tight, fake, and she was trying to not explode into my ear about letting my owl out in public, but Mrs. Poole didn’t seem to notice.</p>
<p>“Oh, Petunia! You never told me you had such a charming nephew!”</p>
<p>A weird sound bubbled in my aunt's throat. “A-ah… pardon?”</p>
<p>“Letting your orphaned nephew go to a private school so far from home and allowing him to work with such a beautiful animal? Topped it off with a loving husband and a bright son,” I have a question: Where is this bright son? “You must feel so blessed. I wish my daughter was just as good.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t have asked for a better aunt! Thank you for letting me go to my parents’ old school, Aunt Petunia!” I chirped in my fake-happy voice that Petunia absolutely loathes. “I need to put Sansa away so she can sleep. It was nice meeting you, Mrs. Poole!” </p>
<p>I wave to the women and rush to my bedroom with Sansa and Scabbers. Sansa wasted no time in resting on her perch while Scabbers took this time to munch on broccoli. </p>
<p>It wasn’t until an hour later did Petunia barged into my room. She does this often so I never let my room be messy. My trunk remained neatly organized in the corner of my room, I always kept a shirt and trousers on despite the heat begging me to go shirtless and rarely did I take out my school stuff unless I knew no one would bother me. This time around, Petunia barged in to find me laying on my bed, one leg over the other, with my nose in Dudley’s abandoned <em>Old Yeller</em> novel. </p>
<p>I briefly lick my pointer finger to assist in the turning of my book’s page. “I did not mention my school, magic, and I did not say anything bad about you or the others. Please do not yell at me for something I am not guilty of,” I said, ignoring the sharp sound of Petunia’s teeth clenching.</p>
<p>“You should not have that bird out in public in the first place!”</p>
<p>“As far as your neighbors are concerned,” Another page turned. “I am going to a special school for my social anxiety and is working with a rare bird. You and Uncle Vernon are loving guardians caring for their nephew and Dudley is considered smart. Everyone wins.”</p>
<p>Petunia gasps.</p>
<p>“How dare you imply my Diddlekins is not smart?!”</p>
<p>I mean… I am the one reading a classic while he’s downstairs eating chocolate cake.</p>
<p>“Your words not mine, Aunt Petunia. What kind of books is he reading?” I finally look away from my book to watch her face change colors. “I would love suggestions, I’ve read all of the ones in here and I finished my homework a week ago.” And Vernon doesn’t like that I tried to spend all my days at the library.</p>
<p>“Y-You…” Petunia sputtered, lost for words.</p>
<p>“Aunt Petunia,” I start, sitting up so I can look at her properly. “I know you don’t like having me around, but you and Uncle Vernon are limiting my options. I keep running out of chores to do, you won't let me go to the library, or to London to visit Hermione. My homework is done unlike Dudley and I’ve read all of my books. I need to go get my next year’s supply soon but, as I said, neither of you will let me go to London.”</p>
<p>“Why should we take you anywhere for that freak school?” Petunia spats, her skinny neck so tense I could see the veins in her neck start to become visible.</p>
<p>Someday, I’m going to visit them when the Horcrux in me is destroyed just to see what changes about them. Are they naturally nasty people or is it because of me?</p>
<p>“Because then you can get rid of me sooner for another school year. Do you hate seeing me happy that much?” Petunia said nothing. She just gaped at me, wide eyed and silent, like she didn't know how to respond. I kicked off the bed and chucked the book over my shoulder, causing it to bounce off the wall and onto my pillow. “That’s it!”</p>
<p>“Wh-what are you doing?” She backed away while I stormed over to my desk.</p>
<p>Reaching for my trunk and whipping out some parchment and my quill which I filled with ink. I write a rather frantic, messy letter and shoved it in an envelope. I didn’t look at my aunt while I tied the letter to Sansa’s leg, who woke up from her rest and took off once she confirmed the letter wouldn’t fall.</p>
<p>“Seeing if we can both rid myself from this house for the rest of the summer. It's obvious you'd prefer it if I wasn't here anyway, so I might as well be out of your hair.”</p>
<p>Petunia frowned at that, for a brief moment I saw guilt flash across her eyes that shut themselves down. </p>
<p>I grab my hair, which was now halfway down my neck at this point and put it in a pathetically short ponytail to keep it from sticking to my skin. My bangs needed taming, but I just blew air from my mouth at it. </p>
<p>“I’m barely passing one of my classes,” The room became still. “I can’t participate in their sports because I’m afraid of it. I fall asleep in history class. My first night at the school I had juice go up to my nose because my body went into shock from how sweet it was. I went to the nurses several times for injuries, one of them was a concussion… and my favorite spot in my school is the library…”</p>
<p>I look to my aunt, “Doesn’t that sound like a normal school? I’m in a safe environment where I can make friends and learn and have a future. I want to become a teacher, Aunt Petunia, or a law enforcer,” I said and my lips pinched together. I went to my trunk and pulled out the photobook, hugging it. “What did I do to make you both hate me this much? I’ve asked this question every day for years.”</p>
<p>The door to my bedroom closed, and when I look, Petunia had left.</p>
<p>I stare out into the summer afternoon sky, my brain finally collecting my thoughts and replaying what I wrote in that later.</p>
<p>
  <em>Draco, what are the chances I could spend the summer with you and your family?</em>
</p>
<p>….. :3….. :3….. :3…..</p>
<p>To say things were tense between Petunia and I that next week was an understatement. Sansa wasn’t back, which made me nervous and when I’m nervous my vegetable choppings became loud and borderline hand-cutting. So while we were preparing for Vernon’s potential business partners I was given a wide berth while I viciously made a Mediterranean salad with the intensity of Edward Scissorhands making an ice sculpture.</p>
<p>Vernon rehearsed everything with his family while I contemplated sneaking out and trying to find ghost peppers to sneak into the salad. Would that be mean of me? I could buy a fresh gallon of milk in case the guests have a bad reaction to the peppers… now I’m hungry. Would I get away with sneaking some salad upstairs? I did make it after all-</p>
<p>“<em>BOY</em>!”</p>
<p>I let out a yelp, clutching my chest and look at my uncle with wide eyes. “I’m going to be in my bloody room with my bloody rat and quietly read a bloody book.”</p>
<p>“Don’t use that tone with me, but you are correct in what you shall be doing this evening. And cut your hair!”</p>
<p>I’ll cut my hair when your body stops looking like Jabba The Hutt's grandmother.</p>
<p>I wisely bit my tongue and headed up to my room where I saw someone I was both expecting and… not… really expecting?</p>
<p>“Dobby?”</p>
<p>The little house-elf was standing in the middle of my, now clean, bedroom. My trunk rested beside him, Scabbers’ cage on top of it and Sansa waiting on her perch, happily screeching upon my arrival.</p>
<p>“Harry Potter! It is an honor to see you again, sir!” Dobby squeaked out, bowing so low his ears flopped onto the ground ungracefully. I can hear the Dursleys buttering up to their house guests.</p>
<p>“Wha-?” I jerk my head in each and every direction to examine my room. Not only did Dobby seemed to have made himself busy, but everything was packed in my trunk. “Don’t take offense to my question, but why are you here and why is my trunk packed?”</p>
<p>Dobby let out a soft chuckle that was a mixture of amusement and nervousness. “Dobby does apologize, Dobby’s family gave the order to not disturb them when on vacation. When they returned this morning, Harry Potter’s owl was waiting for them. Dobby made sure she was fed and taken care of during the week. Dobby was tasked with packing Harry Potter’s possessions so he may spend the summer at the Malfoy Manor! Mrs. Malfoy will arrive soon to collect Harry Potter!”</p>
<p>That’s… oddly refreshing. No warning to not go to Hogwarts, that I’m in danger, it’s nice- wait a minute. I'd bet my vault that he's not telling me because I know he’s the Malfoy’s house-elf. </p>
<p>I hold back my urge to sharply inhale and motion to my bed with a polite smile, “Please have a seat.” Bad move. The waterworks instantly trickled down as Dobby wailed. “Shhhh, sh sh, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“D-Dobby heard that Harry Potter was good and kind, but never would Dobby expect to be told to sit down by a wizard l-like an <em>equal</em>!”</p>
<p>“Um…” I blinked. “Did you think I told you to take a break during Christmas only to mess with Draco? You do so much so you deserve to be nice to yourself- don’t hit yourself.” I quickly swiped my lamp from his grasp, scolding him like a child. “Come on, sit down, I don’t mind.”</p>
<p>“D-Dobby must return back home with Harry Potter’s things,” Dobby hiccuped, wiping a tear. “B-but Harry Potter’s offer was most generous.”</p>
<p>“I-” I pause when I hear the doorbell ring for a second time. “That must be them… Dobby, take a rest when you return home, okay? If they call for you that’s fine, but take a breather when you are not tasked with something. Consider that an order from me if you must view it as such.”</p>
<p>Dobby stared up at me with large, glassy eyes that oozed admiration. I found myself awkwardly shifting at such an expression, one of awe and… oh, sweet Glinda, I swear Dobby had a determined glow to his face now. </p>
<p>Hello, brick walls and bludgers…</p>
<p>Dobby didn’t say anything, snapping his fingers and all of my stuff -animals included- vanished with a crack. </p>
<p>
  <em>Thump… thump… thump</em>
</p>
<p>My blood went cold as I hear Vernon walk towards the front door. If he was the one to greet the door then no doubt he’ll explode at the sight of Narcissa! </p>
<p>“I’ll get the door!” I made a sharp 180 to run out only to hit my bedroom door face first. Rapidly patting my door until I found the knob and threw it open, rushing down the stairs and barely reaching the front door just as Vernon was going to reach for it. </p>
<p>Vernon gave me a look that could murder before breaking into a fake smile when his guests poked their heads into the hallway to see who the new voice was. “Oh, don’t mind my nephew, he’s a disturbed boy who gets nervous when the doorbell rings-”</p>
<p>Vernon’s voice died out when I opened the door. Standing there was Narcissa, stunning as always, dressed like she was to dine at one of England’s finest restaurants -oddly the dress was muggle with a long black overcoat- and a stern expression on her face while she stared daggers into my uncle. Behind her, in a finely tailored dress robe, is Draco with a sneer seemingly glued on his face.</p>
<p>“Harry,” Narcissa spoke, placing a perfectly manicured hand to my cheek, lifting my face up so she could kiss my forehead. My eyes remained open the entire time, so I watched as her loving eyes turned into hellfire when she saw my family. “I’m so sorry we were late to collect you. I have spoken with our… servant, that your letters override his orders not to disturb us.” </p>
<p>“Mrs. Dursley, who are those people?” Mrs. Manson asked, obviously not expecting people who look like the embodiment of nobility at the doorstep.</p>
<p>“Mum, can we take Harry home now? I feel sick looking at these mu-” Draco pauses when I frowned at him. “I don’t like them.”</p>
<p>“Of course, my love,” Narcissa responded, the hand on my cheek trailed down to my shoulder, and I was pulled into her arms and guided to stand behind her. “So sorry to interrupt your…” She tilted her head, nose up and looking down at my uncle’s suit. “Ah, dinner party. We received a letter from Harry requesting he stayed with us for the rest of the summer so they may return to their <em>illustrious private school</em> in September.” </p>
<p>“You- you…” Petunia gaped. I swear I could see her self-esteem drop as the mental comparison to her floral mess of a dress to Narcissa’s black tie formal attire. “We did not give you permission to take our… darling nephew.” Her voice became unnaturally sweet due to the important guests they had in the house. “If you take him we will call the authorities for kidnapping.”</p>
<p>I exchange glances with Draco, who’s about to damage his eyes with the level of rolling they’re doing. Narcissa’s polite smile never left her face.</p>
<p>“There is no need for them. Unless we wish to get my husband involved, he is a member of the government.” And then there was silence. Petunia knew what that meant, Vernon could take a guess, and I had a full toothy grin. “Harry, please do not smile like that, it is unsightly and you will get wrinkles.”</p>
<p><em>And</em> the grin is gone. </p>
<p>Petunia huffed but relented, retreating to the kitchen to make something and Vernon closed the door when the three of us were far enough away for it to be socially acceptable. </p>
<p>Narcissa kept her expression schooled while she escorted us both away from the house. “I already sent a letter to the ministry about our house elf being in your house. Now, we will be using a portkey so hang onto my arm and do not let go as you touched the object.”</p>
<p>I grimaced but obeyed, Draco already linked his arm with his mother. Narcissa pulled out a handkerchief that was in a small purse and we all touched the item at the same time. A sharp pull came from my naval and within seconds we were at the Malfoy Manor.</p>
<p>Narcissa kept a firm hold on the both of us, a motherly determination to keep us on our feet. Thank Merlin she held onto us as both of our knees buckled from the transport.</p>
<p>“That was… not fun…” I gasped out, only letting go of Narcissa when I finally had control of my jelly legs. Draco shortly followed suit, straightening himself up.</p>
<p>Narcissa gave us both a warm smile then head inside. In the distance, I saw their resident peacocks strutting around their yard and despite the gloomy sky, I finally breathed. I finally felt welcomed since summer started.</p>
<p>Draco draped his arm over my shoulder with his usual smug grin, no malice, just a default face he makes. “Welcome home, Harry.”</p>
