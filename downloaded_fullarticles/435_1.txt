    <p>Harry Potter had red hair down to his shoulders and wonderous killing curse green eyes. He normally lived with his aunt, uncle and cousin but when he was nine years old he'd discovered he was magic and that one of the teachers at his school was magic as well. He'd taken to following her after school so that he could see her do magic. One day he'd followed her on the underground to a place called Diagon Ally and to a bank called Gringrotts.</p>
<p>"May I help you?" A goblin teller asked looking down at Harry who stared right back up at him with curious eyes.</p>
<p>"I'd like to know if there is a way to find out if I have any money in this bank " Harry replied. "I don't know my parents but I'm magic so I was curious."</p>
<p>The Goblin stared hard at him for a long while before taking him back into a room. Harry sat in a chair that was too big for him. He was small for his age. His feet didn't even touch the ground. He felt like being childish so he kicked his feet idly while he hung on to the sides of the chair with his hands.</p>
<p>"We drop some of your blood on this parchment and it will tell us who you are and the family you belong to." the Goblin said. " It will also tell you if you have any money in the bank."</p>
<p>"Okay." Harry said, and got up. He let the Goblin prick his finger and watched as his blood fell on to the paper. A second later the Goblin healed Harry's finger. Harry took the opportunity to sit back down in the chairand kick his feet again. He waited patiently. "What is your name, Mr. Goblin? My name is Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"I'm called Griphook." The Goblin said.</p>
<p>He was shocked that this boy was claiming to be Harry Potter but now that he got a good look at the boy he did look a lot like Lady Lily Potter.</p>
<p>"Nice to meet you, Mr. Griphook." Harry said, holding out his hand. "What? You don't shake?"</p>
<p>Griphook was shocked and shook the child's hand.</p>
<p>"Is it ready?" Harry asked. "I'm really curious. I'm a very curious little boy all my teachers say so."</p>
<p>"Little Human Boys should be curious little creatures." Griphook said. "Yes, it is done, come over here and see. Can you read?"</p>
<p>"Of course I can." Harry said, happily. He got down out of the chair and rushed to the desk to see the parchment. "Can I move it closer. I'm rather short."</p>
<p>"Of course." Griphook said, having already looked at it. "Go ahead."</p>
<p>Harry looked at the parchment.</p>
<p>

  <b>Godmother: Alice Longbottom nee Rush</b>

</p>
<p>"Oh, wow." Harry said , "I'm a II. That's like rich family stuff isn't it? Titles and all that. I read that in a book."</p>
<p>"Yes." Griphook said, trying to hide a chuckle. "You are a very rich little boy, Heir Potter."</p>
<p>Griphook took him through the paperwork to get his money under control. That's when Harry found out about his properties and house-elves. Several questions popped into his head.</p>
<p>
  <b>You now have access to your Trust Vault.</b>
</p>
<p>Harry frowned at the blue screen in front of them then refoucsed on the task at hand.</p>
<p>"Mr. Griphook, can I legally live in Potter Manor by myself with my house-elves?" Harry wondered.</p>
<p>"Of course, Heir Potter." Griphook smirked. "Would you like to go down to your school vault?"</p>
<p>"Yes, please I'd like to get some money so that I can buy some books and learn about hiis world."</p>
<p>"Ah then maybe this would be better." Griphook showed Harry a card.</p>
<p>"That looks like my aunts debt card." Harry said. "I'd have one?"</p>
<p>
  <b>You've have obtained Magical Debt Card. This card is linked to your Trust Vault. This card can work in both worlds.</b>
</p>
<p>Harry was thrilled with the information that his screen was telling him.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Harry quickly found out that he was going to need a magical backpack the was bottomless and had a charm on it to make it as light as a feather. He found a nice black one and went on a shopping spree for books and other things he thought he might need or just wanted. When he was done he went to the Muggle world to get some clothes he didn't think he was going to like wearing robes at all but he supposed he would have to if he wanted to belong in the magic world.</p>
<p>When he was done shopping he activated the Port Key Griphook had given him to take him to Potter Manor. He appeared in the entrance way.</p>
<p>"Hello?" He called. "Um...Diddy, Dunky, Munky, Mose?"</p>
<p>"Master Harry Potter is home." the four elves appeared in front of Harry.</p>
<p>"Hello, who is whom please?" Harry wondered.</p>
<p>He shook their hands as they greeted him with their names. Mose was the youngest and just a tiny baby. Harry picked him up and rocked him happily.</p>
<p>"You are so cute, Mose." he said, happily. "Uhm, I'm sorry to be a bother but I'm rather hungry."</p>
<p>"I'm the cook!" Munky cheered. "I'll get Master Harry's dinner!"</p>
<p>"I'll get the Master bedroom ready for Master Harry!" Diddy beamed.</p>
<p>"I'll put Master's things away!" Dunky cheered and took the backpack Harry was holding.</p>
<p>"I play with Master Harry!" Mose cheered.</p>
<p>"Okay!" Harry smiled at the baby elf.</p>
<p>Harry found himself playing ball with Mose until he was summoned to dinner. Harry was happy to eat something anything and he wasn't lying when he praised Munky for the great food. After dinner he explored the Manor finding out just what there was to do and what there was of his family. He stared at portrait of a red haired woman for an hour as she smiled and cried while staring at him. The other portraits in the room watched and the black haired man in glasses next to the woman tried to comfort her. Harry got a chair and climbed on to it to stare hard at the people in the moving portrait.</p>
<p>"Are you my mum?" Harry asked her. "Are you? You're really pretty. I'm Harry James Potter II."</p>
<p>"Yes, Harry, I'm your mother." the woman said. "I'm Lily. Is Sirius here with you?"</p>
<p>"Never met him." Harry told her. "I've never met any of my Godparents just Auntie and she was mean."</p>
<p>"How did you end you with Petunia?" Lily asked softly. "You weren't supposed to go to Petunia."</p>
<p>"I don't know." Harry said. "Are you ghosts or just memories caught in magical paintings?"</p>
<p>"Turn around." James said, to his son.</p>
<p>Harry did and there stood two ghosts who seemed so life like Harry wondered if he could each out and touch them. He grinned.</p>
<p>"Great, if your ghosts too then you still teach me all I need to know about our family and the magical world." Harry said, happily.</p>
<p>"Of course, Harry." James laughed. "What is your first question?"</p>
<p>"Who am I named after?" Harry wondered. "I'm a second so I was named after someone wasn't I?"</p>
<p>James through his head back laughing.</p>
<p>"You were named after my grandfather Henry Potter." James said when his laughing fit was over. "It was always my hope that you would be as strong as he was and by that I mean I want you to be bold and hard headed. I never want you to be afraid of being who your are and I want you to always speak your mind. Let people know exactly what you're thinking. Never be afraid and hide or let other people control you. Be yourself."</p>
<p>"Daddy, ...I think I like you!" Harry blurted, then blushed "I always had to hide who I was at the Dursley's. I was never allowed to be me so to hear you say that being me is your wish for me makes me very happy."</p>
<p>James wasn't the only one who laughed at Harry's words most of the Portraits did too.</p>
<p>Harry spent the day touring the manor in full with his parents ghosts. He was awed, his father knew every nook and cranny of the manor and showed Harry everything. James wanted him to jump in the pool right then and there but Harry refused.</p>
<p>"I can't swim." Harry told them, "Dudley got swim lessons at the YMCA but I didn't." Harry shook his head. "Maybe I can learn but I'm actually afraid of water. Uncle tried to drown me. "</p>
<p>Lily and James were furious and were already thinking of going and haunting several people while still sticking aorund for their son of course.</p>
<p>Harry fell into be that night exhausted. He curled up on his side and was soon fast asleep he didn't know that his mother was crying just out side his room. Or that by taking control of his life and getting away from the Dursley's and by claiming his inheritance that he'd thrown a huge spanner into someone's plans. That he'd changed the course of history.</p>
<p>
  <b>You obtained the ghosts of your parents. You can call them to you whenever you want.</b>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Lily left the Manor for the first time since her death. She wanted to know why Severus had never taken her child in. He couldn't still be mad about what happened could he? She went off to find him.</p>
<p>James went off to find out what happened to Sirius.</p>
<p>Harry woke and was a little upset when he couldn't find his parents.</p>
<p>"Master Harry is not worrying." Mose said, happily as Harry ate his breakfast. "Lord James and Lady Lily will be back soon. They is just going to haunt some people for not loving you. Mose is hearing them talking and Mose is understanding. They is loveing Master Harry. If Master Harry is being good and eating all of his breakfast Mose will be showing Master Harry to the library. Mose is hearing Master Harry say that he is liking books."</p>
<p>Harry took that as the best incentive to eat everything on his plate. It was hard but he managed though he had to literally choke down the last few bites and then had to force himself to drink his milk. He noted that this made his House-elves very happy indeed. Then as promised Harry was taken to the library. Harry was in love in seconds. He quickly ran to the shelves and began reading over the titles. He pulled two off of the shelves and went to sit in the bay window. From that point on he was lost to the pages of the book. Around noon the House-Elves had to threaten to seal the library off if Harry didn't eat his lunch. Harry did so reluctantly.</p>
