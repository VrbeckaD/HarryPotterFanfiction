<p>Ty had been captured by the Ministry and was being sent to Azkaban after being in custody for 3 weeks. Aurors were taking him by boat through the River Thames after the Minister, Anwin Greener wanted anti-apparition charms around Azkaban.<br/>Ty was being dragged below decks by two Aurors. The whole boat was guarded with Aurors and other Aurors on brooms following them. <br/>Ty was chained to the wall while the two Aurors with him sat on chairs, guarding him as the boat started going along the heavy waves from the storm.</p>
<p>Harry was standing on Big Ben, watching over the boat. The lights of the buildings lit up the city in the dark and stormy night. <br/>Harry stepped off the tall clock tower and fell through the air, before he started flying through the rain and down to the Thames. </p>
<p>He followed the boat as it gained speed. <br/>Harry landed on the boat and immediately stunned an Auror.<br/>Three other Aurors ran towards him, shooting disarming and stunning spells at him.<br/>Harry blocked them with ease. <br/>He waved his wand and their wands shot out their hands. He caught a wave with his wand and wash the Aurors into the Thames.<br/>Harry ran below decks to Ty and the two Aurors. <br/>He quickly shot them back against the wall, knocking them out.<br/>"You took your time!" Ty shouted over the loud waves<br/>"Well, I couldn't break you out of the Ministry, could I?!" Harry shouted as he waved his wand and Ty's chained dissolved <br/>"I've got your wand." Harry said as he threw Ty his wand<br/>"Then lets get out of here."<br/>They ran back outside and 10 Aurors were standing there, with their wands raised at them<br/>Harry rolled his eyes before he raised his wand in the air and lightening shot into the wand.<br/>He quickly waved his wand in front of him and the ten Aurors screamed in pain as they were electrocuted.<br/>Five Aurors shot spells at them above them, on brooms.<br/>"I'm getting tired of his!" Harry shouted, taunting them<br/>Harry waved his wand once more and the brooms turned to ash before the Aurors fell into the Thames. One of them landed on the boat and Ty quickly stunned him into the water.<br/>"We need to get rid of the driver!" Harry shouted<br/>They walked up to the cabin to the driver.<br/>Harry raised his wand at him and two arrows shot out of the wand and into his hands, pinning him against the wall.<br/>Harry started steering the boat.<br/>"Where are we going?" Ty asked next to him<br/>"We need to get out of the Thames."<br/>"You'll never get away with this!" The driver shouted before Ty out a silencio charm on him<br/>"We're nearly there!" Harry shouted<br/>"There are, like, 50 Aurors following us!" Ty shouted<br/>Harry looked at the bridge in front of them, just before entering the ocean. He raised his wand in the air as they rode under it and the bridge collapsed after them and the Aurors on brooms crashed into the collapsed bridge. <br/>"Now what?" Ty asked<br/>"Follow me!" Harry said as he put a charm on the boat, making it steer on its own before they ran out into the open<br/>Ty saw 7 brooms flying towards them.<br/>Rose and Ora rode either side of the boat, with 5 Rebels, Harry's army, rode with them.<br/>"Hurry up!" Harry shouted to Ty<br/>Ty ran and jumped onto Ora's broom with her while Harry jumped onto Rose's and they four of then and the Rebels flew up into the dark sky.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>They landed in the gardens of Malfoy Manor.<br/>"You five, keep a look out." Harry said to the Rebels <br/>Harry, Ty, Rose and Ora walked inside and into the dining room.<br/>"See, Ora? Told you I would get him out." Harry said as he took off his black overcoat and his red vest, leaving him in his white shirt, dress trousers and boots.<br/>"What do you think of the Rebels new uniform?" Harry asked Ty<br/>"What?"<br/>"Come on, I love it. The red coat over the black leather outfit. And the hoods, come on!" Harry joked<br/>Harry sat at the end of the table.<br/>"You two, go." He said to the Rebels standing at the door and they left the room<br/>"So what do we do now?" Rose asked<br/>"I've been feeling like we should recruit people on the other side." <br/>"And how the hell do we do that?" Ora asked<br/>"Well... The Ministers new laws. Wizards and witches can't be friends or marry muggles. Bit stupid, this isn't 1920s America. But... Alice Longbottom just so happens to be in love with a muggle." Harry said with a smile<br/>"And you think we can recruit her?" Ty asked<br/>"With a few words of persuasion from me, then yeah."<br/>"So we're recruiting Alice Longbottom, is that it?"<br/>"No, of course not. Ty, Ora... Can I ask a big favour of you both?" Harry asked<br/>"What?" They both asked<br/>"Ora, would you mind tracking down a certain Hermione Granger? When you do, give her a quick bite. Turn her into a vampire." <br/>"Why?"<br/>"So that she'll lose her job, have to go on the run and will have nothing else to do but to come with me. And Ty... Would you mind doing the same with Ginny Weasley. Now, I know you can only turn her at a full moon, but would you?" <br/>"Of course." Ty said<br/>"Thank you both. Now can you both please do that before the rally on Halloween?" Harry asked as he stood up<br/>"Where's it being held?" Ty asked<br/>"Rome. The muggles have completely repaired the coliseum." Harry said before he turned to leave<br/>"Oh and Rose, could you arrange a spy in Hogwarts and the Order for me?" He asked<br/>"Yeah, sure." <br/>"Thank you!" He said before leaving the room.</p>
