    <p>1.</p><p>The door closes with a soft click as Graves steps into the hallway, his collar sticking to his neck from the balmy heat, the kind that sinks into the tarmac and lurks there for weeks. It’s been a wickedly hot summer.</p><p>Inside the firm, men with their dress shirts spotted with sweat walk down the hall with ties loosened and sleeves rolled up. Women in high heels fan themselves listlessly with paperwork in the breakroom, hair frizzing with sweat. The powers that be finally decide to let the lawyers and paralegals out early when the central air unit hiccoughs its last breath.</p><p>Even Credence, a lover of hot summer days, had seemed dazed by it that morning, barely able to take a step out of the house without gasping at the wall of heat rolling in from the south and slipping back indoors to take refuge in the cool, air-conditioned living room.</p><p>It makes Graves all the more glad that Tina had been whisked away by her grandparents to cruise the Mediterranean and travel the region for the summer. She should be in Croatia by now. At least one of them is spared this heat wave.</p><p>“It's great, dad,” Tina had told him in her last phone call home. “It's so beautiful here in Hvar. I wish you could've come with us.”</p><p>Graves had sighed, a huff of fond exasperation with just the slightest bit of regret. “You know I couldn't, Teens, I have so much work to do. And I don't think I would survive two months with your grandparents, you know that.”</p><p>She'd laughed, already ready to hang up and return to her fun. “Okay, dad,” she’d said. “I'll see you soon. Say hi to Credence for me if you see him.”</p><p>“Credence?” Graves calls out presently, surprised at the empty kitchen and entryway. Usually Credence greets him at the door for a welcome home kiss, but he did arrive early. Still, Credence should've heard the door even if he wasn't expecting Graves.</p><p>Graves slips upstairs, thinking maybe his boy’s in the bedroom, napping or reading, but once he's in the hallway, he hears a splash of water and sees the bathroom door open a crack, low soft music spilling into the corridor. Graves smiles. His princess is taking a bath. Even the thought of Credence lounging in the tub, pinked from the warm water, soft curls soaked and plastered to his shoulders, lashes spiky with moisture makes heat bloom in Graves’ stomach.</p><p>He quietly pushes the door open, planning on sneaking up on his darling when Credence least expects it, but seeing the long sweet line of Credence's leg lifted into the air as he carefully drags a little disposable razor along his baby soft skin makes Graves forget everything. The door bangs thoughtlessly against the wall.</p><p>Credence startles like a little doe. He sits up so quickly, water sloshes over the top of the tub and onto the tiles, his razor plopping into the tub unceremoniously.</p><p>“Baby,” breathes Graves, both delighted and awestruck. “What's this?”</p><p>Credence blushes a deep strawberry pink and says shyly, "It was supposed to be a surprise for you," in an earnest whisper. His arms come up around himself, bashful after all this time, but the boy from even just a few months ago wouldn't have pouted his plump bottom lip and softly complained, “Look at what you made me do!”</p><p>On the delicate skin of Credence’s knee, a small cut bleeds a little, running dark pink as a droplet of blood slides down Credence's leg and mingles with the warm water. Heartbreak surges through Graves, a sort of devastation that could cause earthquakes, topple buildings, and rattle the sky.</p><p>“Oh, princess,” Graves says mournfully as he slides to his knees beside the tub, uncaring of his trousers soaking with the water on the floor, “I'm so sorry.”</p><p>Credence gives the sweetest little laugh, twining wet, pruney fingers through Graves’ tie. “It's just a little nick, Percival,” he says, as Graves bends to kiss his neck sweetly. “I didn't really mean that. It's alright.”</p><p>Graves frowns, reaching into the tub to swipe up the razor. “These are too cheap to be using, baby,” he mutters, frowning. “And what are you using to shave?”</p><p>“I didn't want to waste your shaving cream,” says Credence bashfully. “It's too expensive. Soap works just as well.”</p><p>“That won't do, princess,” Graves purrs, something dark and prideful rumbling in his chest when Credence blushes softly. “We're going to have to do something about this.”</p><p>...</p><p>Graves books him an appointment at the best spa in Hollywood the very next day and drives a blushing Credence to the front doors with the promise to pick him up after the session.</p><p>Graves spends the next several hours making idle circles around the area, the heatwave making him sluggish and antsy. His dark shades and tinted windows are useless against the hot glare. The summer day and wilting palms make Graves crave ice and sugar he doesn't normally indulge in, and he caves, pulling up to a fancy little coffee shop Credence would be delighted with at the end of the street.</p><p>Credence's eyes light up at the sight of the plastic cups in Graves’ hands when he picks him up, eagerly reaching for his sugar-loaded strawberry concoction. Graves trades the cup for a kiss, pulling his boy close in the middle of the street as his hand settles at his hip and squeezes possessively.</p><p>“I can't wait til we get home,” Credence murmurs against his ear, eyes dark with promise when he pulls away, soft lips wrapping around the straw of his frappucino.</p><p>The hollowing of his cheeks has Graves bussing Credence quickly into the car, nearly stomping on the gas as he pulls out of his parking space. He spends the drive home with one hand on Credence's leg, rubbing circles into the smooth skin of his inner thigh until Credence's breath comes in little stuttering whimpers and Credence is squirming, drink finished and forgotten in the cup holder.</p><p>Graves doesn't know who reaches for who first when they're finally in the foyer of their home, but all he cares about is the feeling of Credence's narrow body slotted sweetly against his as he presses his boy up against the entry wall.</p><p>The air in the house is like a refreshing douse of cold water compared to the soupy heat outside. As Graves kisses down the slim arch of Credence's neck while he strips his baby of his shirt, he can see goosebumps erupting from the chill where formerly fine hairs would've bristled. He groans and slides his hand down the soft, smooth belly, bare of the thin soft hairs that used to gather in a trail down Credence’s navel.</p><p><em>"Fuck</em>,” Credence gasps, and Graves' darling doesn't normally swear, but he's immensely proud every time he's able to draw that reaction from Credence.</p><p>“Did you have them get rid of everything?” Graves breathes against Credence’s ear, and he feels his boy shudder in his arms.</p><p><em>"Everything</em>,” whispers Credence, eyelashes fluttering. Graves kisses them softly, feels Credence’s delicate eyelid under his lips. Graves moves down to kiss that red full mouth finally, unable to resist, tasting bursts of whipped cream and sugar and strawberry as their tongues tangle together.</p><p>“How in hell did I get so lucky?” Graves groans against Credence’s throat when they finally pull away. An overwhelming urge to sink his teeth into the delicate white skin rises in him, swelling like a tidal wave until he finds himself sucking a mark into the hollow of Credence’s throat where the shape of his mouth will bloom darkly purple.</p><p>It's intoxicating to be able to do this, even if it's just for the summer, when they don't have to hide for two precious months. They have a handful of weeks where they can pretend they're in their own world, just the two of them, and Graves thinks he can get addicted to this.</p><p>“I’m the lucky one,” Credence gasps as Graves picks him up and carries him up the stairs. He nearly has a heart attack when Credence murmurs softly, “I love it when you spoil me,” and Graves vows Credence will never want for anything from that moment on.</p><p>Credence changes into his favorite cream negligee after a languid shower together, where Graves is unable to help himself as he traces reverent fingers over his boy’s skin, smooth and pale, pinking softly in the hot water. He runs his hands over the planes of Credence’s narrow chest, down the line of his willowy waist and the hairless dip of his groin, luxuriating in the feeling of smooth skin beneath his fingers.</p><p>Soft lips drag against Graves’ stubbly jaw as they move to the bedroom. After what feels like an eternally long day, he finally gets to spread Credence out atop the soft sheets of their bed.</p><p>Graves tries to pull Credence back when he slips out of his arms, placated only slightly when his little darling moves to straddle his lap, small hand gently pushing him back to lean against the headboard. The next few minutes are the most excruciating moments of Graves' life when he has to watch Credence slowly shift up the hem of his negligee, a slow torturous tease. His lovely boy keeps stopping and frowning in warning every time he reaches out to touch, batting away his hands playfully.</p><p>“Patience, Percival,” murmurs Credence and Graves has to clench his fists into the sheets to stop himself from grabbing.</p><p>His heart is beating out of his chest by the time Credence lifts his negligee up to his chest, and the little tease only smirks, slowly shifting the silk up as he smoothes his own hands along the ladder of his ribs. Inch by inch, newly smoothed skin is bared to Graves' hungry eyes. His mouth goes desert dry and his breath lodges in his throat as his eyes widen, and he can't take it anymore. Not with those silky smooth thighs and that pretty white belly and Credence’s plump pink cock right there in front of him.</p><p>With a low growl, Graves’ hands reach out to press possessive fingers against Credence's narrow hips to bring him closer, closer, closer and Credence laughs<em> . </em>Graves silences him with a hungry kiss, licking into the seam of his plush, red mouth to chase the familiar flavor of strawberries and cream as he pulls Credence even closer, any distance between their bodies feeling like an offensive gulf. Credence’s smooth chest slips against Graves’ thickly furred one, and Graves groans at the friction, feels Credence squirming in response.</p><p>“Percival, Percival,” he gasps, clinging to Graves needily. “I'm—it's—” There's a glaze to his expression, a desperation that Graves feels an answering need to soothe, to make everything better. “I'm so sensitive, now,” says Credence, looking like he's been struck by lightning, bewildered and thrilled.</p><p>“Don't worry, princess. I'll take care of you,” Graves murmurs, fingers sliding greedily over his boy’s soft thighs, slipping in between to feel the velvet heat of Credence's cock. “I'll always take care of my sweet boy.”</p><p>Credence keens at that, hips rolling, but Graves only takes him by the waist and turns him onto his belly, admiring where the long curve of his boy’s back slopes into the pretty pale swell of his ass. His hand passes gently down the hatch of old scars as he leans down, lips finding that wonderful place where wiry thigh becomes soft and plush and thick, his tongue flicking out for a small taste as Credence squeaks softly in protest.</p><p>“You never ask for this,” Graves murmurs sadly, spreading Credence's legs slowly, lazy with patience as tender, quivering pink is revealed to him. Credence's embarrassment is evident as his boy reaches back and attempts to cover himself. “But I want this all the time.”</p><p>“You shouldn't!” Credence gasps, always shy despite the many times Graves has made worship here, lavishing him with his tongue and turning him into a mewling mess. “It's—it’s <em> lewd.” </em></p><p>Graves smiles fondly. “So I can kiss you here—” and he palms his boy’s soft groin, relishing in the little gasp that draws, “But not here?” His thumb gently slides over where Credence is softest, sweetest, babygirl pink, newly smoothed and hairless, and another sound, this one lower, more desperate, spills from Credence’s mouth. He can feel his boy trembling softly. “Baby, please.”</p><p>After a little bit more squirming, Credence nods. “O-okay,” he says, trying to sound begrudging, but his breathy voice gives away his desperation when Graves leans down to press kisses against the soft skin bared to him before flattening his tongue against the pink bud of his boy.</p><p>The first wet drag of his tongue has Credence shivering as he pushes back against Graves, keening softly as Graves slowly licks into him. Credence is already desperate for more as he rolls his hips with growing urgency, trying to find any sweet friction for his hard cock against the smooth sheets.  </p><p>“You're so good, letting me do this,” Graves murmurs into Credence’s softness. A bit of stubble on his jaw that Graves had missed shaving that morning scrapes against Credence’s tender skin and another sound, this one Graves has never heard before, spills from his boy’s throat.</p><p>“<em>More!” </em>Credence begs, back arching in pleasure, and Graves squeezes those soft thighs with his big hands affectionately, a heady pride coming over him at the thought that he could drive this precious thing into such a frenzy. More slow kisses, languid curls of his tongue, a thumb caressing the flared head of his boy’s cock, and Credence gasps happily, “Yes, yes!” It doesn’t take much for Credence to come with Graves’ tongue inside of him and his hand on his cock.</p><p>Unable to wait anymore and achingly hard, Graves reaches for the hem of the negligee and in his haste, he barely notices the sharp sound of fabric ripping until Credence sits up with a wide-eyed gasp. They both freeze, Graves uncomprehending as he stares at the scrap of silk fisted in his hand as he watches his darling blink back tears, the passion all but extinguished.</p><p>“You—you ripped it!” Credence says in shock. Graves sits up in a panic as Credence trembles, tears dripping down his cheeks in heartbreaking streams.</p><p>“Credence,” says Graves numbly as his baby sniffles and tugs the fabric out of his hands, clutching it to his chest like it's something precious. “Princess, I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Credence is not so much a hoarder as he is just irrationally sentimental. Despite the huge hidden section Credence has in Graves’ closet full of lingerie, he keeps the torn cream negligee and wibbles about mending it the whole night. He only settles down to sleep when Graves physically tugs him into bed and holds him close, whispering apology after apology until Credence finally calms and slips into an unsettled rest.</p><p>When Graves tries to buy him a new slip the next day, as close in design as he can find, Credence only wails louder, and refuses to throw away the old one.</p><p>“You don't understand, Percival,” Credence insists, his lashes dripping wet and eyes rimmed red. “It was the first one you bought me. You can’t replace it!”</p><p><em> Oh</em>. There's the stab of heartbreak again, one that comes every time he sees Credence unhappy. It's the sort of pain that will have Graves moving entire worlds to erase the frown on that beautiful face. Graves knows he can't replace whatever sentiment Credence is clinging onto, but the least he can do is make sure he has whatever his heart desires now.</p><p>...</p><p>The first time Graves takes Credence shopping, Credence barely wants to get out of the car. His eyes turn saucer-wide at the logo atop the storefront and sinks lower into his seat, shaking his head vigorously.</p><p>“They’ll know!” he insists ludicrously, even as Graves pecks his neck and cheeks and lips with swift little kisses that make him tremble. Credence’s cheeks are cherry red by the time Graves pulls away. “Percival, I <em> can’t!” </em>He wriggles in his seat, thighs shifting uncomfortably, thoughtlessly tempting. “That’s—it’s private.”</p><p>“It still will be, princess,” Graves reassures him, charmed by Credence’s little pout. “I’ll bring you all of the panties and garters you want, baby, all you have to do is stay in the dressing room.”</p><p>Credence chews on his lip, looking down shyly at his nails, glossy with a fresh manicure from his spa visit. “You promise?” he whispers, looking up at Graves with big dewy eyes.</p><p>Graves smiles and kisses his baby’s soft mouth. “Promise.”</p><p>The “good afternoon, Mr. Graves,” they're greeted with nearly has Credence balking and running back out the door again, if not for the firm press of Graves' hand at his lower back.</p><p>“They <em> know </em> you?” Credence whispers in an urgent panicked hiss, even as his awe-filled eyes rove the black and gold art deco walls lined with racks upon racks of lace and silk.</p><p>“Where do you think I've been getting all your pretties, darling?” Graves purrs against Credence's ear, feeling him shudder softly.</p><p>“I don't know,” Credence admits as he's led into a dressing area, with a long black curtain at the far end. It is a wide room with ornate mirrors stretching from floor to ceiling and a long lush couch pushed against one wall. “Certainly not from a place like this.” He looks around, awestruck at the decadence of the dressing room. “This is so beautiful.”</p><p>“Only the best for my darling.” When Graves kisses Credence, so do four other Graveses, his reflections moving with him.</p><p>“That’s a bit weird,” says Credence when Graves pulls away, eyes fixed to the mirrors around them. Graves laughs and kisses Credence again, before slipping out into the main store where his favorite sales associate already has piles of suggestions in her arms, everything from garters and bralettes to velvet robes.</p><p>“Is that him?” she asks, eyes sparkling. “The one you buy all these for?”</p><p>Graves smirks and raises a finger to his lips as he eyes the bundle of lace and satin. She manages not to squeal too loudly as she scurries off to help another customer.</p><p>Graves hums as he skims through the small pile of lingerie, but he trusts her judgement, and he brings the whole set to Credence, who is still fully dressed as he stares wonderingly at the opulence surrounding him. He’s holding a small glass of golden champagne in one hand, still full to the brim.</p><p>“Percival,” Credence whispers urgently as Graves steps into the dressing room. “They gave me champagne! What kind of lingerie store is this?”</p><p>“The finest,” Graves says happily, taking the champagne flute from Credence and handing him the pile of lingerie. “I only want you to have the best.” He steals a sip, watching his princess handle soft dove-grey panties with delicate lace filigree across the waistband.</p><p>Credence gasps when he turns the price tags over with his fingers, turns wide-shocked eyes up to stare at Graves. “Percival,” he says, voice edged with nerves and his pink tongue flicks out to wet his lips, “I <em> can’t</em>. These are so expensive.”</p><p>Graves smiles, endlessly fond. “Credence, don’t worry so much. The price doesn't matter if you like it.”</p><p>Credence huffs a little, still shaken by the numbers. “But. But, still. Don’t—I’d be just as happy with anything from Victoria’s Secret, you know that. Don’t you?”</p><p>“Of course I do,” says Graves, taking Credence’s hand in his as he sits next to his princess on the couch. He kisses the soft knuckles slowly, watching a dull flush rise to Credence’s cheeks. “But I would rather give my baby the best.”</p><p>“You don't have to,” Credence repeats in a low whisper, even as his grip on the lingerie becomes covetous, possessive.</p><p>“I want to,” Graves counters boldly. He lounges back against the couch, smiling slowly. “It's just as much a present for me as it is for you, so please, princess, indulge me.” He nudges Credence softly until he nods, shy and flushed.</p><p>“Can you help me?” Credence asks, suddenly coy as he stands and steps between Graves’ casually open legs, fluid in the way that only happens when Credence is feeling particularly playful.</p><p>“Of course, darling,” Graves says hoarsely, settling his half drained champagne on the side table and standing to help Credence lift his shirt and step out of his jeans. It’s always half-torment, half-pleasure to strip Credence, to see all of that pearly skin revealed to him, so close and so tempting. That is especially true now, knowing that he won’t be able to touch the way he wants.</p><p>Credence is dewy-eyed, cheeks ruddy with passion and shyness both, his belly and chest heaving as he breathes when Graves’ hands find the sweet dip of his waist, fingers sliding appreciatively against smooth skin. Graves has to look away for a moment so he doesn’t drag his boy into his lap and ravish him mindlessly.</p><p>A softly spoken “Percy,” draws his eyes back to his boy and his breath doesn’t just catch in his chest, it strangles, and wheezes out of him in an idiotic cough.</p><p><em> Right</em>, Graves has to let go, but trying to ever stop touching any part of his boy is always a challenge, much less when he's standing before him in the nude. Credence gives him a knowing look when Graves finally steps back and with a small smirk, disappears behind the curtain with his piles of lace and silk, hips rolling with a purpose that wasn’t there before.</p><p>“Minx,” Graves mutters to himself, and he hears a soft laugh as Credence calls to him, “I heard that!” through the curtain. And there’s the overwhelming fondness, the love that seems to strangle at the best of times.</p><p>The seconds seems to stretch into hours, impatience making Graves restless as he drinks Credence’s forgotten champagne and taps his fingers on the glass side table, bubbles gathering in his stomach in brilliant pops.</p><p>“Close your eyes,” comes from behind the curtain, a shy little demand that Graves has a very large problem obeying.</p><p>“You’re torturing me, princess, you know that?” he growls, but his eyes flicker shut, because this, like everything, is for Credence. Agonizing seconds later, he's told he can open them, and the vision that stands before him is nothing short of heartstopping.</p><p>Credence is standing before him dressed in the dove-grey lacy set, translucent fabric doing little to cover much of anything. Graves can see the outline of his soft pink nipples through the sheer panels of the bralette and the outline of his cock through the tiny panties, clingy and soft. And when Credence gives a tiny little spin, oh. The fabric rolls high over the soft swell of Credence’s ass, little more than a scrap of lace between his cheeks, making him look even more tempting than expected.</p><p>“Darling,” Graves manages to croak. “You…”</p><p>“Is it too much?” Credence whispers tremulously. His bottom lip plumps up as he pouts. “I don’t know—it’s very <em> revealing.” </em></p><p>Graves stands, crosses the little space between them, gathers Credence up in his arms until he's pressed warm and soft against him, and kisses him so long and languid that the air in the dressing room grows hot and thick like fog. “No,” Graves replies when they separate, “we're definitely taking this one.”</p><p>Credence looks down, eyelashes pressed against his cheekbones. There’s a shy, almost prideful pleasure making him smile, a smile Graves would do anything to keep on Credence’s plush mouth. Fingers grip Graves’ shirt lightly but firmly, a possessive little gesture that makes Graves want to <em> devour. </em></p><p>“Good,” says Credence quietly. “Hand me the next one?”</p><p>The next piece is another transparent slip embroidered in tiny pink satin flowers that Graves decides Credence must have as well. And the black dressing robe after that, with the matching garters and stockings, so short it barely skims the top of Credence’s thighs, flashing more lace when he walks. And a gorgeous pastel pink garter and panty set that softens Credence’s edges, making him into something delicate and floral and so very, very sweet.</p><p>Graves’ desire to just push Credence against the nearest wall and have his way only increases with every little spin and hint of lace and flare of satin.</p><p>“I love all of them,” says Credence adoringly, gathering the latest burgundy negligee in his hand. “God, Percival. They’re so <em> pretty.” </em>He stands onto his tiptoes in his delight, sighing happily, not knowing Graves is vividly picturing him in high heels and imploding over the mental image.</p><p>Graves is only stopped from reaching over and grabbing at Credence's hips when the sales associate peeks her head through the door and asks cheerfully, “How's everything?”</p><p>“We'll take all of it,” Graves says hurriedly, voice a hoarse low scrape<em>. </em></p><p>Credence gives a low squeak and dives for the curtain, face stained like a cherry in his embarrassment.</p><p>“Don’t worry,” the associate says, still obnoxiously happy. “I’ve seen it all, nothing to be shy about!”</p><p>But the damage has been done and it takes Graves ages to coax Credence to get dressed and come with him to the counter. Even still, Credence has his eyes firmly fixed to the floor and the permanent color in his cheeks darken when the same associate smiles at them widely on their way out and chirrups, “Have a good day!”</p><p>…</p><p>Graves somehow manages to last through dinner at their favorite restaurant but it's a near thing. Credence's coy little looks and fluttering lashes do nothing to help the heat welling up in his belly, but he somehow sits through their meal without any touching.</p><p>The temptation to go straight home is strong, knowing that Credence is wearing the tiny little dove grey number underneath his soft cotton shirt that shifts open with every movement to flash tempting slivers of pale lace. Graves somehow even manages to keep his hands to himself on the drive home. Credence is almost pouting and looks slightly disappointed by the time Graves finally breaks and all but drags him up to their room.</p><p>“Percival!” gasps Credence, delighted, wrapping arms and legs around Graves tightly. “You were so good,” his boy murmurs, squirming happily. “You didn’t even slip your hand under my shirt to feel my bra! I’m so proud of you.”</p><p>Graves manhandles his princess onto the bed, dragging his hips forward despite Credence’s soft little squeaks of protest. “The entire time we were eating,” Graves rumbles, yanking off Credence’s shirt too hard, buttons popping everywhere, “All I could think about was following you into that nice bathroom and backing you into a stall. I wanted to open you up with my fingers, and make my baby whine so loud everyone in that goddamn restaurant would know what was happening to you, what I was doing to you, as I fucked you against the sink, so you can see how beautiful you look in the mirror.”</p><p>Credence gasps as his bralette is gently peeled away from his chest and Graves kisses at his soft pink nipples reverently, sucking a little purple love note above his heart.</p><p>“Wait!” Credence says suddenly, urgently pushing Graves away, and Graves feels as though he’s been doused in cold water. “Since you were so good all day, you deserve a treat,” Credence says, mouth curved in a wide feline smile.</p><p>And before Graves can snap out of his surprised stupor, Credence squirms out of his arms and hops off the bed, grabbing one of the shopping bags from their trip as he disappears into their bathroom.</p><p>“<em>Fuck,</em>” Graves gasps, flopping back onto the bed. “Don't <em> do this </em> to me, princess!” he growls and the only reply he gets is the faint sound of Credence's amused laughter.</p><p>It feels like Credence takes an interminably long time, shuffling around in the bathroom, and Graves nearly loses his tenacious grip on patience. He contemplates the best way to take the door down as he stares up at the ceiling. After an eternity and a half, finally, <em> finally</em>, the door of the bathroom opens and Graves sits up so fast his head spins.</p><p>He thinks he must’ve died and gone to heaven waiting for Credence when he finally sees his princess. He’s dressed in his soft pastel panties and bralette with slinky stockings clipped to his new garter belt, the soft curves of his hips and waist accentuated by the lines of lace and chiffon. Graves only realizes vaguely as Credence walks over to him with a languid sway to his hips that his boy has also put on <em> heels </em>and yes, Graves is definitely dead now.</p><p>Credence takes his hand as he steps between Graves’ splayed legs and does a little turn, just like he had done in the store’s dressing room. Graves chokes on nothing at the sight of Credence's back, the soft curve of his ass bared by the cut of his panties and framed by a little bow at the dip of his waist.</p><p>Graves feels as though he's in a trance, hypnotized by his boy, barely able to react as Credence smiles and straddles his lap. And then Credence is unbuckling his belt as Graves is tugged in for a kiss that's all tongue and soft gasps while nimble fingers make quick work of his pants as he struggles impatiently out of his own shirt. The curl of Credence's hand around his hard cock is the best and worst kind of torture as it works slowly down his length.  </p><p>“Princess, <em> princess</em>,” Graves gasps, completely at the mercy of his boy as Credence shushes him gently. He can feel the live wire skips of pleasure dancing across his skin as Credence's thumb presses against the slit of his cock, spreading his precome around the head.</p><p>Before Graves realizes what's happening, Credence is rising up on his knees and pulling aside his panties and sinking down on his cock with a shuddering moan, pink-tinted pleasure flashing behind Graves’ eyes in his shock. The sensation of his cock being engulfed in tight, slick heat is almost too much, coupled with the realization of exactly why Credence had taken so long in the bathroom.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>,” Graves growls, his fingers bruisingly tight around Credence's rolling hips. “Were you preparing yourself for me in there, baby?”</p><p>Credence nods, lips still curved in that tempting smile as he rolls his hips down again and leans in close. “Wanted to have you in me as soon as possible,” he gasps against Graves’ ear, “so I opened myself up on my fingers. I wanted to just be able to sit on your cock as soon as I came out. I waited all day for you,” he adds with a soft whine, reaching down to tug Graves’ hands up to press against his chest.</p><p>“Jesus <em> fucking </em> Christ,” Graves says, the breath knocked out of his chest. He smoothes his hands over the tiny translucent bralette that does nothing to hide the hard peaks of Credence's nipples, pinching at the little buds through the fabric as his boy tilts his head back with a gasp, pale throat bared in offering. His baby clenches up around him, a sweet hot pressure gripping his cock.</p><p>“Percival,” Credence sighs, bouncing in Graves’ lap with his head thrown back and his fingers clutching at Graves’ shoulders desperately. “You—you feel so good!”</p><p>Graves nuzzles at Credence's neck, and he can't help himself from grabbing his boy’s hips and stilling him so Graves can thrust his hips up once, twice, three times, feeling Credence tremble sweetly around him.</p><p>“Percy no!” Credence gasps, but before Graves can release him in panic to ask what's wrong, Credence protests, “I’m supposed to be doing the work!” He's pink with pleasure, his cock peachy pink against his belly where it peeks up over the panties, and Graves feels that urge to just <em> ruin, </em>to leave Credence a squirming mewling mess on the bed.</p><p>Graves fucks up into his baby once more, feeling his cock slide against the swollen little bud that makes Credence keen and his thighs shake. “You're so good for me,” Graves croons as he lies back and watches Credence through half-closed eyes. “Go ahead, sweetheart.”</p><p>Credence smiles, the soft light haloing his edges into something gentle, something innocent. Graves nearly chokes when Credence begins to move again. It’s almost too much, the sight of his princess and the tight heat of him filling all of Graves’ senses, and the soft little <em> sounds </em> Credence is making are driving him crazy. He wants nothing more than to grab him by the hips and flip them over so he can just fuck into him with harsh wanting thrusts, but he’d promised to let Credence take charge.</p><p>The slow rolls of Credence’s hips and his languid movements has Graves squeezing hard at the curve of his ass, unable to help himself as he brings his boy down harder on his cock, smirking up at the half-hearted glare Credence directs at him. He doesn’t know how much longer he can last with Credence looking like that, with the soft slick heat of him surrounding his dick, and the sound of his boy’s panting gasps against his ear. But soon the ripple of Credence’s hips and stomach grows slower, more sluggish, and Graves smirks to himself through the pleasure as the sound of his princess’s keens grow louder, more desperate.</p><p>“Percy!” Credence whines, kissing at Graves’ throat, movements lazy and slow in the best of ways.</p><p>“I know, baby,” Graves murmurs, wrapping his hands around those soft thighs. He picks Credence up and gently lays him down on the bed, relishing in the surprised little moan and the short gasps tumbling from Credence’s lips with every stuttered thrust of Graves’ hips. “I’ll give you what you need, princess.”</p><p>This time, Credence doesn’t protest as Graves does the work, mewling piteously as a kitten as he clenches softly around him, and Graves must be in heaven.</p><p>This boy isn’t real, hasn’t come into his life in a whirl of lace and happy laughter, is out there somewhere on someone else’s arm, laid out on someone else’s bed. He pushes that thought away before he can think too much about it because Credence is <em> his </em>, and he’ll be damned if Credence ever ends up with anyone else.</p><p>And Credence, his beautiful, beautiful boy is arching up against his chest, his low cries of “More, more!” draw Graves back into himself. The little sounds make him thrust harder, faster, deeper until Credence is spilling thickly against his own silk-smooth tummy as Graves pins him down and follows him, dark bliss nearly blinding him.</p><p>In the aftermath, Graves rolls onto his back, panting hard. Credence is cuddled up happy and sated against his chest, eyes half-lidded and weighed with sleep as he reaches up and drags Graves into a languid little kiss.</p><p>“Good?” Graves murmurs, and that triggers a little flood of laughter, Credence pressing his smile against the crook of Graves’ neck.</p><p>“Excellent,” Credence corrects on a soft sigh, sleepiness making him relaxed and soft.</p><p>Graves runs his fingers through Credence’s sweat damp curls as he kisses his temple and murmurs, “I know I can’t replace the memory of your first slip but we can make new, happy memories, can’t we?”</p><p>Credence nods sleepily, burrowing deeper against Graves’ chest and murmurs, “yes, we can. But Percival,” he adds softly, biting at his bottom lip, “you don't have to always buy me new things. I'm happy with what I have. I'm happy even if I don't have any of this. I would be happy with just you.”</p><p>Graves wonders what he's ever done in this life or the last to get so lucky, to have someone as precious as Credence to call his. He tightens his arms around his boy and presses another kiss to his temple.</p><p>“I know, baby,” he says. “But I want you to have everything you want, especially anything that helps you feel more like yourself. I just want you to be happy.”</p><p>Credence leans up a little, his eyes bright as he blinks them fully open, lips curved in a gentle smile. “I'm always happy when I'm with you, Percival.”</p>
