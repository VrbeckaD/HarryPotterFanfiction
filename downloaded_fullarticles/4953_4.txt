    <p>Maia sighed leaning on the sink as she stared at her tired reflection in the mirror. The last days, or rather weeks, were exhausting her because the work had increased after the continuous attacks of the followers of Grindelwald. Everyone in the magic community wondered when it would stop, all knew that Albus Dumbledore was the key but refused to face that war, although most didn’t understand why.</p>
<p>The woman cleaned her hands after a hard day, suddenly she saw a familiar face through the mirror.</p>
<p>-Poppy, what happens?</p>
<p>-Mr. Scamander has a visit- answered the younger healer, as tired as Maia, who turned to be face to face.</p>
<p>-But his parents and mates know that it’s not visiting hours.</p>
<p>-This visit didn’t know, he said he has just arrived.</p>
<p>Maia sighed again and both left the bathroom of the healers room of that floor.</p>
<p>-Has he identified himself?- Maia asked.</p>
<p>-Yes, it’s Mr. Newt Scamander. I guess he’s Theseus’ brother.</p>
<p>Maia stopped in the middle of the corridor and looked at her colleague.</p>
<p>-Newt Scamander?</p>
<p>-Yes, that’s right…- Poppy frowned confused and looked to the end of the corridor, pointing with her head -there you have him.</p>
<p>Maia looked at that direction and saw Newt with his blue coat and suitcase in his hand. The man raised her eyes and looked at her from under his copper fringe that was longer.</p>
<p>-Poppy, I got him- she mumbled still looking at him -go home, you have to rest.</p>
<p>-Okay… See you tomorrow Maia.</p>
<p>The woman only nodded in her direction and walked slowly towards Newt, not being discreet as she looked him up and down to see what had changed since the last time they had met, that sunny morning at King Kross Station almost two years ago. When he was only two meters away from her, she lifted her wand and aimed at him, surprising the man, but not frightening him.</p>
<p>-Revelio- she said clearly.</p>
<p>A transparent stream came from the tip of Maia's wand to wrap around Newt's body, which was calm despite the enchantment. When nothing happened, the healer put away her wand and sighed approaching.</p>
<p>-I’m sorry, any precaution is short. That a man who identifies as Newt Scamander, someone who has been disappeared for three months, arrives at this hour of the night can be suspicious.<br/>
Newt realized her tone was a bit sharp.</p>
<p>-Maia, I wanted to write you but…</p>
<p>-I know- she interrupted him putting her hair into a braid that had been removed moments before -when I didn’t receive any letter from you after all I sent, I went to the ministry. He told me that you were the key in the arrest of Grindelwald and that you were collaborating with MACUSA.</p>
<p>They looked at each other’s eyes a few second, the woman being surprised when he didn’t look away.</p>
<p>-I’m sorry.</p>
<p>Maia shook her head pressing her lips into a thin line.</p>
<p>-You are alright, that’s the most important thing…- she pulled away a lock of hair -come with me please.</p>
<p>They walked through a long corridor, Maia waving her wand without saying a word to take off the protection spells.</p>
<p>-You look exhausted…- Newt mumbled a bit uncomfortable in that situation between them.</p>
<p>-I hardly go home from weeks. I just go to feed Scamy, calm him down and take a shower. I sleep in a sofa in the healers’ room in this floor though I think I haven’t slept for two nights, I’m not sure…</p>
<p>The man looked at her with concern, the dark circles under her eyes, her skin pale and she was visibly thinner since the last time he had seen her. Maia stopped in front of a door, murmuring between her teeth as she removed the security spells that protected the room.</p>
<p>-Before going inside- she turned to look at him, realizing he was tanner, she guessed it was because all the time he was exposed to the sun in Asia and Africa, his freckles stood out even more -I have to warn you that Theseus came in a really bad shape. Luckily he’s recovering quickly but he doesn’t coordinate his limbs too well yet, he need help to walk and sometimes to pick things because his fingers don’t answer correctly. He suffered a lot of curses in a row, I don’t know how he could appearated here without suffering an irreversible damage.</p>
<p>-My brother is a really strong person- he said with a small smile.</p>
<p>-Yes, yes he is. It must be a quality that runs in the family- she said smiling back.</p>
<p>She was going to open the door but Newt took her arm gently stopping her, making her to look at him.</p>
<p>-I didn’t rite you because the followers of Grindelwald had me under their watch and I didn’t want you to be in danger if they linked us- Maia didn’t expect that explanation, she wasn’t angry with him, just sad because she missed him -I’m sorry for having worried you, but I didn’t want you to turn into a target.</p>
<p>The healer sighed and stood on her toes to wrap her arms around his shoulders because he leaned into her, wrapping his own arms around her waist.</p>
<p>-I’ve missed you so much- she confessed.</p>
<p>-Me too.</p>
<p>They moved away and Maia smiled slightly before opening the door, letting him step in before her. Theseus was sleeping in his bed, only visible a few bruises that were almost healed in his face.</p>
<p>-He had a lot of cuts but I healed them and made them disappear. The bruises will go away in a couple of day, only the coordination thing remains, but we hope that it will pass in a week with the potions that we are administering him.</p>
<p>-I’ve been in England a whole day, locked in the ministry. They didn’t let me come because they thought I’m in danger, you know Grindelwald escaped and it’s believed he has come here, but I needed to see my brother…</p>
<p>-He will recover fully, I promise- she approached Theseus and made an spell to make possible nightmares disappear </p>
<p>-I can do an exception today so you can stay tonight.</p>
<p>-What are you going to do?</p>
<p>-I’ll go to sleep for a few hours in the room, my shift starts in four hours. You can accommodate in this armchair- said pointing to a red one that was in the side of the bedroom -I ask for it, for your mother, she’s here all afternoons.</p>
<p>-Oh, that’s nice of you, thank you.</p>
<p>-You won’t be cold, there’s a temperature spell.</p>
<p>Newt nodded and they looked at each other for a few seconds, analyzing how the other had changed in two years, until they heard movement coming from the bed. Theseus' legs moved at a great speed, causing him to wake up. Maia approached quickly and called with the spell accio some vials that were in a cabinet. She sat on his legs, shaking her lightly, and made Theseus drink the potions.</p>
<p>-There you have…- said gently, standing up from his legs that had stopped -I’ll increase the dose.</p>
<p>-Thank you…- Theseus said with raspy voice -what time is it?</p>
<p>-Depends how you look at it, it’s too late or too soon- she said laughing before turning to Newt who approached until he was into the visual field of his brother.</p>
<p>Theseus opened his eyes wide because of the surprise.</p>
<p>-Newt!</p>
<p>-Hi Theseus, how are you?</p>
<p>-It could be worse, when have you arrived?</p>
<p>-Just a few minutes ago, I was lucky Maia was here and let me come in.</p>
<p>Theseus looked at Maia who smiled sweetly.</p>
<p>-I’ve told him he can stay. You two should sleep but I’m sure you will stay awake talking so…- Maia went to a big wardrobe and took a couple of pillows, putting them behind Theseus -at least get comfortable. See you in a few hours.</p>
<p>She smiled at Newt before leaving the room, giving him an affectionate squeeze in his shoulder. The younger brother took the armchair next to the bed.</p>
<p>-I hope you go to talk to mother and father, they are really worried- Theseus said.</p>
<p>-I know… I told them from the ministry, I will go tomorrow. But first I wanted to see you, I was really scare when I was told what happened.</p>
<p>-I’m sure it wounded worse than what it was Newt.</p>
<p>-Maia told me about your limbs and the curses in a row. You’ve never been in a bed more than two weeks, not even in the muggle war.</p>
<p>-It’s my job Newt, like yours is face those magic creatures that are dangerous. We are expose to this- Newt sighed looking at his hands. Theseus ruffled his hair, like when they were kids -we’ll be alright.</p>
<p>They talked about what would happen after Theseus left the hospital and what would be their positions in the war. Theseus wasn't too interested in the creatures that Newts studied but he adored his little brother and listened to him with attention.</p>
<p>-So you’ve known Maia for a while…- Theseus said when Newt ended the story about Frank and what happened in America.</p>
<p>-She took me in and helped me when I studied the disappearing of creatures here in London- he explained blushing.</p>
<p>-I know, she told me.</p>
<p>-Oh, really?</p>
<p>- I heard about the arrest of Barry and Carl by the minister who was in charge of telling me what you had done. And that you had been helped by a woman. When I arrived here it was she who took care of me, who managed to heal me and has been watching me, more than she should, so I asked why. She was offended a little, but she confessed that she was a friend of yours. You lived at her home for over a month.</p>
<p>-Yes, well, I know it’s not appropriate but we are only friends.</p>
<p>-Relax Newt. I don’t doubt your integrity and respect for Miss Carpenter. It was a few days ago when she told me about your adventure. She has a lot of appreciation, or even something more, for you although I don’t know what exactly it is.</p>
<p>-Loyalty, Hufflepuff loyalty.</p>
<p>Theseus frowned confused but didn’t give it more importance. His brother had had no friends at Hogwarts, except Leta Lestrange but he preferred to forget that because she broke Newt's heart, and then it was not that Newt was too popular in the ministry so he was glad that his brother had at least one person with whom he would share a friendship.</p>
<p>An hour later the brothers fell asleep, both tired for their own reasons.</p>
<p>Maia woke up from her few hours of sleep, washing her face and making another spell of energy. She no longer remembered the number of times she had done that spell on herself. She went to the kitchens where she thanked the elves for the food and took two trays, making them float in front of her as she crossed the still empty corridors. After removing the protection spells, she entered the room where she found the sleeping Scamanders. She set Newt's tray on the table as she approached Theseus and gently woke him. The older brother's blue eyes met hers.</p>
<p>-Breakfast time- she announced with a small smile.</p>
<p>He got comfortable and she put the tray on his lap before going for the potions.</p>
<p>-I’ll give you 20% more, just to be sure that you won’t suffer another attack. Have you slept well?</p>
<p>-Quite well, thank you.</p>
<p>He drank the potion in a swing before he began to eat breakfast. Maia looked at Newt and took a blanket from the closet to cover him. Theseus watched her with his head titled to the side, it was already a habit of his profession to analyze what those around him were doing. He observed the symptoms of fatigue shown by the healer and opted to comment:</p>
<p>-If I’m not wrong, this is the fourth day you are here at the first hour.</p>
<p>-Well, you know there has been low staffing in our healers. Now keep eating, I have to start doing my patrol.</p>
<p>She smiled once more at him and gave one last look to the sleeping Newt before leaving the room.</p>
<p>Hours later Maia leaned against the wall, wiping sweat from her forehead with a wipe that made it disappear later. That night she was sure she had to go home to sleep, at least 6 hours in a row. She heard someone coughing beside her, finding Newt with a small smile.</p>
<p>-Ey- she greeted him trying to smile him back but the second energy spell wasn’t working anymore.</p>
<p>-I’m going to see my parents, but I’ll be back later. I think I’ll spend a bit of time here until Theseus is fully recovered.</p>
<p>-And that’s perfect.</p>
<p>Newt looked into her eyes and saw the weariness in them, he was going to say something when someone shouted the name of Maia, causing them both to look at an older woman gesturing her to approach.</p>
<p>-I have to go, see you tonight. Greet your parents for me.</p>
<p>The woman turned and ran to her companion, both running out of that hallway. The magizoologist sighed and went towards the exit.</p>
<p>It was almost dinner time when Newt returned to San Mungo, however, there was no receptionist, no one in the lobby, something quite unusual. Confused, he headed for the stairs when he heard explosions and screams. Suitcase in hand, he ran to the fourth floor, where his brother was. In the central corridor he could see several disputes between aurors and what should be Grindelwald's followers. Frightened, he disappeared to land in his brother's room, where he not only found Theseus, also Maia and a burly man dressed in black who lashed out at them, curse after curse. However, Maia kept a field of protection over she and Theseus as she could, with both hands holding the wand but her arms were trembling. Theseus was sitting on the bed, his wand also raised, supporting, but he was still weak to resist. Without thinking, Newt aimed his wand at the man shouting:</p>
<p>-¡STUPEFY!</p>
<p>The man was thrown into the air and hit the wall, but, fearing that he would rise again, Newt cast a spell on him again:</p>
<p>-Petrificus totalus.</p>
<p>Newt looked down at Maia, who dropped the field, sitting on the bed and breathing heavily. Theseus caught her by the waist, feeling that she would collapse at any moment. Newt stepped forward and set the suitcase down before taking her by the shoulders.</p>
<p>-Maia, Maia…</p>
<p>The woman looked at him for a moment before her head dropped forward.</p>
<p>-She’s exhausted- Theseus mumbled frowning.</p>
<p>Newt took her in his arms carefully and placed her in the big chair, brushing her hair away from her face. At that moment three aurors stepped into the room, opening the eyes wide when they saw the scene that was in that room.</p>
<p>-Guys- Theseus started to talk -his under a petrificus totalus, take him now. Hudson, make a bed appear for the miss.</p>
<p>Two Aurors caught the man from the floor, disappearing instantly while Hudson made an extensive spell to make the room larger and made a bed appear. It was clear that his strong point was the spells. Newt took Maia in his arms again and laid her gently on the bed, taking off her shoes and covering her with the sheet.</p>
<p>-She’s really pale…</p>
<p>-She has been incredibly brave- Theseus said looking at them -I’ve heard explosions and almost immediately she appeareated here. Those bastards are too skilled but they needed three of them to take off the protection spells. She quickly put herself in front of me and created the field.</p>
<p>Newt said nothing, just sighed as he looked at his unconscious friend. A healer entered, the magizoologist recognized her as the woman who had received him the day before, Poppy.</p>
<p>-Oh My- the healer mumbled approaching Maia quickly, but she sighed relieved when she recognized Maia was unconscious because of the effort and not a spell –I told her to rest… Mr. Scamander- she turned to Theseus -would you mind is she stays here until she has recovered a bit? We can take her to another room once there’s one free.</p>
<p>-Of course, she can stay as long as she needs.</p>
<p>-Thank you.</p>
<p>She began to make a couple of spells on Maia to guarantee rest and then check Theseus to make sure he was fine. Newt noticed watched from the armchair, which, after Poppy left, placed between the two beds.</p>
<p>-They’ll have to intensify the protection in San Mungo if they don’t want more attacks- Theseus commented grumpily.</p>
<p>-But, they didn’t heal the rebels here too?</p>
<p>-Yes, they do, but the rebels care more about hurting ours than putting in danger some of theirs. This has to end,<br/>
Dumbledore has to fight no because I don’t if we’ll be strong enough to defeat Grindelwald or contain our secret to the muggles. The aurors are falling, healers go away like other wizards because of fear. In this moment the balance is not in our favor and if things keep going like this, I doubt we’ll win this war.</p>
<p>Newt had always admired the bravery of this brother and hearing him so disheartened and pessimist about the prospects of the future it only saddened and terrified him. The situation with Grindelwald and his followers was worse than he could imagine, and sitting there between his friend and his brother, he did not find a hope to hold on to.</p>
