    <p>Draco quickly dragged the back of his hand over his face. Now the skin there was all wet, which was a side effect he hadn’t taken into account. Usually he wouldn’t have done it if he’d been <em>Imperiused </em>to do so, but this whole situation was anything <em>but</em> <em>usual</em>, and it called for desperate measures. He pulled down his sleeve over his hand and dried his face with the fabric. The tip of his nose was ice cold. When he went to rearrange his shirt, he saw a string of snot shining white against the cotton grey. An involuntary sniff escaped him and he shook his head.</p>
<p>This whole situation was so fucked up.</p>
<p>“I—,” his voice came out weak. He cleared his throat. “I haven’t told anyone,” he said to the flames climbing up the chimney. The glazed bricks of the fireplace doubled the green light with its reflection. Draco had always wondered if the fires in the Ravenclaw tower were blue, and if the Hufflepuff fires just looked like regular fires. He didn’t plan on asking.</p>
<p>“It’s not like I’ll ever <em>do anything</em> about it,” he tried for a sarcastic laugh, “Could you even imagine!” Pansy didn’t join in. She hadn’t made a sound since he’d started. A log cracked in the fire, emitting green sparks. Nothing about this was funny. It had never been funny. And it would ever only be pathetic.</p>
<p>Back a couple of months ago, he’d just ignored the funny feeling he got at the sight of his sweaty classmates changing after quidditch practice. If he didn’t look, he wouldn’t have to think about it, and then he could pretend it wasn’t happening.</p>
<p>Of course that whole concept was inherently flawed. He could live in denial all he wanted, it didn’t make the fact that he was gay any less true. Still he had tried to cling to his construct, like a naïve little child. After all, he hadn’t been rightfully sorted into Slytherin if he shouldn’t be able to bend the truth a little to his convenience every now and then.</p>
<p>However, bending the truth, especially a little, only took you so far. It only ever worked trying to hide things from <em>other</em> people. And that required acknowledging what the fuck it was that you were trying to hide.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, the castle had been flooded with foreign students. And suddenly, there were achingly fit Durmstrang contestants turning his head, and Beauxbaton’s most elite young wizards filled the halls of Hogwarts with the beautiful sounds of Draco’s second language. It took him back to all the summers spent with his parents at their estate in the vineyards of France.</p>
<p>He could have ended up at that school, but his parents had preferred to send him to Hogwarts for the sole reason that it would spare him one year. Still, French wizarding society had always struck him as more distinguished, more noble, more elegant, and so the people in it.</p>
<p>One particularly sunny morning he’d slipped up and replied a greeting in French on his way to breakfast. It took him actual physical force to restrain from getting pulled into a conversation with the incredibly blue-eyed Beauxbaton boy. Looking at his beaming smile when he realized Draco was fluent made his stomach twist. Draco had stumbled away, and was sure to this moment that the boy must have <em>some </em>amount of Veela-blood running through his veins. Either way, it had been a turning point.</p>
<p>After some careful evaluation, he’d gotten fed up with feeling like a blatant idiot and decided to accept this piece of information about himself. Then he’d carefully stored it away with the other few things he’d take to his grave. Blackmail material. It was important to know yourself, to prioritize, in order to ensure your enemies never found out your weaknesses.</p>
<p>It was only rational. He owned this knowledge now. He’d make sure no one else ever got their hands on it.</p>
<p>Except—well.</p>
<p>He suppressed the urge to rub his hands together. Instead, he drew circles with his chilling fingers on the armrests, the slightly worn-out satin upholstery, aiming for casual. It felt rough under his touch. He was shaking, though maybe not from the cold.</p>
<p>What the fuck had gotten him into spilling.</p>
<p>Pansy had grown close to him, closer than Vince and Greg. They were a bit like puppies, loyal and a tad servile. They lacked the wit or commitment to scheme on their own, but were always looking to make themselves useful.</p>
<p>Last Halloween, when he’d been lying in bed with a cold, they’d managed to sneak out a whole three-course-meal for him from the Great Hall down to the dungeons, complete with plates and cutlery and an entire fucking gravy boat with custard to pour over a slice of dessert-pie. It was the most disgustingly <em>Hufflepuff</em> thing anyone had ever done for him. He was quite fond of them. And he would never trust them with anything.</p>
<p>But Pansy had gotten under his skin, and he’d been too involved in his own affairs to notice it happening. Reckless. She was vicious, it was one of the reasons why he liked her so much. The cleverest witch he knew.</p>
<p>So it was only wise to be terrified out of his mind right now, though undoubtedly would have been <em>wiser</em> not to slip up to her in the fucking first place.</p>
<p>It must have been the storm. Storms always unsettled him. Down here you couldn’t hear the shrieking wind and the rustling trees from the forest, but the light was different. Usually you were able to see a couple of yards through the dim-green, mostly clear water through the thick glass out into the lake. If you stood close enough to the huge window and looked up, you could even see the surface on especially nice days. Today however, the water had been grey and dark, not a single thing moving there all afternoon. It felt ominous. Unsettling.</p>
<p>“Do you want to go to the yule ball with me.”</p>
<p>Draco looked at her in shock. “What. What the hell, Pansy? Did you not just hear what—” Stupid. Of course she’d heard him.</p>
<p>“Of course I fucking heard you,” she grimaced and now it was her, keeping her eyes firmly on the fire.</p>
<p>“Right.” He hesitated. “So… why.”</p>
<p>She didn’t reply right away, giving him an awful couple of moments to race through his mind searching for her possible agenda. He’d expected her to laugh at him, more likely to yell. Or even get up and leave. It would have been awful, but he’d anticipated it.</p>
<p>“You didn’t answer my question,” she said.</p>
<p>“Neither did you.”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes and shuffled forward in her chair, propping her elbows on her knees and clasping her hands before she pinned him down with a stern gaze. “Look. I don’t mean to presume.”</p>
<p>Draco blinked and waited for her to continue. She didn’t. “Right,” he said intelligently, and then silence fell again in which they both just blatantly stared at the other. Surely he was missing a point here. Or maybe she was just playing a joke on him because—what could she possibly be getting at. He swallowed.</p>
<p>“You want to go to the Yule ball with me,” he summarized.</p>
<p>“No.” She frowned, like that should have been obvious.</p>
<p>“Right,” he said, again. This was ridiculous. “Then why did you ask.”</p>
<p>This time, Pansy did laugh, a dry unbelieving laugh.</p>
<p>“Draco Malfoy, considering that you’re one of the most cunning people I know, you can be awfully slow on the uptake.”</p>
<p>“Well, considering <em>you</em> are one of the most eloquent people <em>I </em>know you’re evidently doing a terrible job at making yourself be understood,” he shot back, but the fact they were both grinning at each other now filled him with immense relief.</p>
<p>Pansy pushed some escaped stings of her raven hair back behind her ears. “Look,” she said, “we don’t have to do the whole thing where… you pour out your heart and then I tell you it’s all going to be fine because,” she crossed her legs and leant back in the armchair, “Well, I think we’d both regret <em>that </em>later and also,” she looked at him with furrowed brows now, “I can’t really tell you that it will be fine, now, can I?”</p>
<p>Draco blinked at her.</p>
<p>“I mean it depends on how you’re planning on—“ She frowned. “Well, what you’re planning on doing with this.”</p>
<p>“I don’t plan on doing <em>anything</em> with this,” Draco clarified. “What the fuck would I be <em>doing</em> with this?”</p>
<p>Pansy gave him a <em>look</em>. “Well I can think of <em>one or two things</em> and actually a bunch of <em>people </em>that you could—“</p>
<p>“Pansy!” Draco gasped. She snickered. “Pansy,” he said again, and this time she stopped immediately at his voice. He chewed on his lip while he tried to find the right words without giving too much away. He came up blank.</p>
<p>“Why did you tell me,” she said quietly.</p>
<p>That was the big question, wasn’t it. He certainly hadn’t planned on it. He’d <em>planned</em> on taking it to the fucking grave. He’d <em>planned </em>to ignore it and just concentrate on other things, which had worked out well so far until those bloody French teenage wizards started flouncing about all over the fucking castle, making his blood boil under his skin. He’d <em>planned </em>to maybe just let his parents set him up with a pureblood witch one day to continue his family legacy with, as was common practice among families like his—although he tried not to think about how he was going to spend his adult life too much. It made him sad, and scared of growing up, which was no use and not getting him anywhere.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he whispered. He propped his elbow on the armrest and buried his face in his hand, eyes closed shut. “I didn’t mean to.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you wanted someone to know,” she whispered back.</p>
<p>He snorted. “Why on earth would I possibly want anyone to know the single most awful thing about me.”</p>
<p>There was a rustling of fabric but he couldn’t bring himself to look up to see what Pansy was doing. He startled when he felt a hand on his shoulder and lifted his head to find Pansy squatting before him.</p>
<p>“Draco, no.”</p>
<p>He blinked at her intense gaze. “What?”</p>
<p>“You really mean that, don’t you.”</p>
<p>“What,” he repeated and instinctively sat up a bit in his chair.</p>
<p>“You think this is an awful thing.”</p>
<p>Draco looked at her in disbelief. “You’re not seriously proposing the opposite is the case.”</p>
<p>She sighed and squeezed his arm. “You’re not going to feel like this forever.”</p>
<p>He took a second to process that. “If you are honestly about to tell me that this is a fucking <em>phase</em> then I regret everything I’ve ever thought about you being intelligent,” he said dryly, “Because I <em>wish</em>, but I’m afraid I’m out of luck there.”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes. “You’re doing it again! You’re making this worse than it really is.”</p>
<p>Draco pushed her arm away and crossed his own before his chest. “Are you serious? <em>Worse than it is</em>? You did understand what I said earlier, yes? I’m fucking <em>bent</em>.” He couldn’t keep from flinching even at his own words and took a quick scan of the room, even though it had been just the two of them in here for hours now. “My father is going to kill me if he ever finds out. Which is why no one can find out. Ever. I don’t even know why I told <em>you. </em>I’d take it back if I could.”</p>
<p>She frowned at him. “See? Look. You already told me, even if you didn’t want to. Salazar knows why. It doesn’t matter. It’s going to happen again. You won’t keep this hidden your <em>entire life</em>, that’s,” she laughed once, sharply, “that’s just insane. You’re not going to take this to the grave. It’s just not going to happen.”</p>
<p>He squint his eyes. “I don’t see any reason why anyone else should find out. Unless,” and he leaned forward into her space, trying for his best practiced threatening demeanour, “<em>You</em> plan on somehow slipping it to people. Which I would<em> strongly</em> advise you against.”<br/> He had absolutely nothing to hold against her. This was no more than a pathetic empty threat, and she knew it. He was definitely at her mercy here.</p>
<p>“Draco, I’m all for scheming and holding secrets. We’re on the same page there. But this isn’t your cuddle blanket that you <em>still</em> sleep with now, since you were 2 years old.”</p>
<p>His mouth dropped open and he felt heat rising in his cheeks. “How—how do you know about that?”</p>
<p>“Please.” She waved her hand dismissively. “Anyway, it’s not the same fucking thing. <em>That </em>is something you <em>could</em> take to the grave. Well, I mean, <em>I </em>know— but hypothetically you could live and die without anyone ever knowing. <em>That </em>is a secret you can keep. But this—this is—“ She looked around the room, avoiding his eyes, clearly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“You know,” Draco interrupted her stuttering. He couldn’t take it. “We don’t have to talk about it,” he said bitterly. “Ever. I already feel bad enough without having you being unable to look me in the face. And <em>you’re</em> taking it really fucking well. I imagine other people would not,” he shuddered. “I don’t really plan on finding out.”</p>
<p>Pansy looked like she was on the verge of a mental breakdown. It would have been funny, especially considering that it should be him in that state, but he felt too repelled to even lift the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>“No, listen to me. Fuck.” She shook her head slightly as if to straighten her thoughts. “I’m just not used to— nevermind. Fuck. I’m doing this.” She dropped to her knees on the thick carpet and placed both of her hands atop her thighs. She swallowed once before pinning him down with serious eyes. “This is a part of you. You shouldn’t have to hide a part of yourself.”</p>
<p>Draco snorted. “Are you sure you were sorted into Slytherin? Because that sounds like the opposite of everything I’ve ever heard you say before tonight.”</p>
<p>She pressed her lips together. “Well. Alright, I take that back. We do like to keep some things hidden. And fuck it, I am taking on anyone who tries to fight me on that it’s our bloody right to do so. But those are weaknesses, Draco. Things like cuddle blankets that we’d be ashamed if other people knew.”</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you for reminding me. Tell me again how you know about that?”</p>
<p>“I won’t,” she smirked. “Now shut up and listen. This is a part of you. It’s who you are. You simply won’t be able to hide it forever. Some way or another, some people will find out. Maybe one day everyone who knows you will know.” Draco stared at her while that terrifying idea sunk in.</p>
<p>“Oh Merlin,” he whispered. “No. I won’t let that happen.”</p>
<p>Pansy lifted her hand to his head and started stroking his hair. “Never forget what you are, Draco, for surely the world will not. But don’t you dare be ashamed, don’t you dare let it be a weakness. It’s going to destroy you from the inside if you do.” She smiled slowly at him. “You need to <em>own</em> it. If it isn’t a secret, it can’t be turned into a weapon against you.”</p>
<p>She actually had a fucking point. “I can’t do that. I think—I’m not ready to do that,” he said quietly. His throat was dry and he swallowed hard.</p>
<p>“I figured,” she said, just as quiet. “But I think you will be one day. Take your time. But that needs to be the goal, not to blackmail yourself into feeling ashamed of who you are for the rest of your life. Don’t aim to take it to the grave. There’s no good outcome to that.”</p>
<p>She was still lazily stroking across his head, sending a comfortable tingling down his spine. It reminded him of his mother and made him feel sleepy. Oh Merlin, his mother. What would she <em>think.</em> He felt panic rise in his chest at the feeling that she would never stroke his hair again, show affection, maybe even <em>talk</em> to him again if she found out.</p>
<p>“No, I <em>really</em> can’t do that. Fuck,” he focussed on controlling his breathing and Pansy brought up her other hand to take his. Draco felt sappy and corny at their random display of affection, but right now he couldn’t bring himself to care.</p>
<p>“Then don’t. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not in a week, or even a year. No one said you had to blurt it out. Fuck, <em>I </em>can’t tell you what to do with this. But you <em>did </em>tell me. I just want you to—,” she cut herself off shaking her head, then firmly withdrew her hands and clasped them in her lap. “Not that I care. This is your mess, not mine. Do whatever you want,” she was probably trying for indifferent, but it came out half-hearted. Draco managed a laugh and she rolled her eyes. “Shut up.”</p>
<p>“Wait,” he suddenly remembered. “Is <em>that</em> why you brought up the Yule ball? To cover me?”</p>
<p>“Please,” she scoffed and straightened her shoulders. “Don’t flatter yourself. I could not care less about how you’re spending an evening of well-mannered lovey-dovey among an entire castle full of three schools worth of teenage couples.” She flicked her hair over her shoulder and looked at him expectantly.</p>
<p>“So,” he tilted his head and looked down at her with a smirk. “Do you want to go to the Yule ball with me?”</p>
<p>She threw her head back in laughter. “No, I really fucking don’t.”</p>
<p>He grinned. “I’m an excellent dancer,” he baited.</p>
<p>“I bet you your silver-tipped peacock quill with the enhanced emeralds that I’m better,” she said, her eyes sparking with challenge.</p>
<p>“Well you’d have to actually go to the ball and dance with me to find out,” he paused, “Also, you can’t bet on something that doesn’t belong to you,” he protested, “What if I win?”</p>
<p>“You won’t,” she decided.</p>
<p>He ignored her. “How about if I win, you have to buy me a drink.”</p>
<p>“Don’t insult me, that’s hardly an equal bet for an actual piece of Malfoy heirloom,” she sounded genuinely offended.</p>
<p>“Of course not, but it doesn’t matter because I <em>am </em>the more proficient dancer, and you’re going to get me a drink at the ball.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you have <em>any</em> shame? That is ridiculous, and they won’t even <em>sell any drinks</em> <em>there</em> because it’s an <em>open bar</em>.”</p>
<p>“How convenient, so you really have nothing to lose,” he concluded with a mischievous grin, “Other than your honour, of course.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” she rolled her eyes. “Not even in your wildest dreams, Draco Malfoy.”</p>
<p>“So that’s a yes, then? Or?”</p>
<p>She took his hand and squeezed it quickly before standing up and rearranging her skirt. “I was thinking Charcoal or Anthracite and Papaya Whip,” she pursed her lips. “Silver,” she added. “Ankles exposed.”</p>
<p>Draco raised a brow. “How daring.”</p>
<p>“Oh shut your mouth. I’m sick of stepping on my robes and I will <em>not </em>freeze my kneecaps off in <em>this weather</em>,” she shuddered. “It’s going to be <em>snowing</em>.”</p>
<p>Draco splayed a hand across his chest in mocked shock. “But it’s for <em>fashion</em>!”</p>
<p>She sniffed. “Yes, well. They did it in Paris in the summer. It hasn’t caught up here in the Scottish countryside of course. Yet. I’m <em>bringing</em> it to them. They should really <em>thank </em>me,” she paused and frowned. “Although I suppose all the Beauxbatons will probably be going for that design, too.”</p>
<p>Draco watched as Pansy thoughtfully chewed on her lip for a while, eyes on the dark water of the lake behind the glass.</p>
<p>“You could go for a different headpiece,” he yawned. It had been late when they’d sat down as it were, the common room already empty of people. How much time had passed since then? “Or customized colours,” he added.</p>
<p>She hummed without tearing her eyes away from the window. “I’ll send you my colour palette in time,” she waved her hand dismissively. “You should consider a gore skirt. I’ll send you some sketches. It’ll suit you.” Then she turned and started towards the dorms.</p>
<p>“I know,” Draco mumbled, eyes glazing over as he stared at the dying flames of the fireplace. It really was time he went to sleep. “I’ll make it work. I actually <em>know</em> how to make myself adequately presentable, mind you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m very well aware,” she had reached the exit of the common room and he saw her turn around one last time in his periphery as she added more quietly “After all, I expect you’re not spending all that time in the closet for nothing.”</p>
