<p>“Quiet, Potter. Are you trying to alert everyone we're in here?”</p>
<p>Harry moaned against his fist. "It wasn't my idea to be tossed into the broom cupboard for a shag, was it?"</p>
<p>Draco slid his hand under Harry's shirt, tugging at the nipple ring there, the one Harry hadn’t shown to anyone else. Harry shivered, his arse clenching tight around Draco's cock. One more thrust and Harry was coming so hard his legs nearly buckled. Draco wasn’t far behind.</p>
<p>A quick Cleaning Charm later, they pulled their clothes together and stepped out of the cupboard, into the hall.</p>
<p>Draco gave Harry a quick kiss. "Let's go to dinner before we're missed."</p>
<p>As he spoke, the Headmistress stepped from behind a tapestry. "A bit late for that, gentlemen. I'm fairly certain even the centaurs in the Forbidden Forest heard you."</p>
<p>Harry blushed; Draco looked at his feet.</p>
<p>McGonagall’s eyebrow went up. "Perhaps next year, Professors, you could have your annual <em>welcome back shag</em> in your own quarters?"</p></div>
