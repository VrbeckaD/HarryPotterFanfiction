</center><p> </p><p>Rrrrrrrrroooarrrr!!!!!</p><p>"The crowd goes wild! Ladys and Gentlmen, we've never…"</p><p>Quite honestly, Fon was never a fan of stadium seating. It was a filthy place; jam-packed with the grime of humanity. None of them had visited Skull's stunt shows. Unfortunately, Fon could not afford to be ousted here or bait a country the size of Germany again. This could have failed had Skull been in the wrong area. Now, the Arcobaleno could talk shop and <em>watch</em> Skull. The scatter-brained cloud had already spooked twice.</p><p>"We're lucky as it is, Lal. He doesn't remember me."</p><p>"Try harder!"</p><p>"No luck, Reborn, I can't find a seal." </p><p>It hurt. Every time to be seen and not remembered. The need to play this charade with one of their own. To High Heaven, the broken bond was agony. The trust was gone. Not reacting to the things Skull revealed. How much was real. Hidden from them. Fake. Nothing was right, yet nothing turned up. After tricking Skull into a calm Zen inducing sleep, Fon had <em>searched</em>. He'd kept the twitchy cloud under for hours. He slept like Reborn dozing on a trigger high.</p><p>They saw the distorted, rippled reflection in the water; not the hidden depth beneath. </p><p>"I'm beginning to wonder if you're the great and powerful information broker you claim, Viper. Checkerface went to great pains to insure we were powerful loners."</p><p>"Your point?"</p><p>"Viper, where's your file that says Skull's name is Harry, in his 20s, British, married, has three kids and vanished from us twice." Fon couldn't sound more deadpan unless death itself smacked him.</p><p>
  <em>disbelief</em>
</p><p>A rare ringing in a symphony of sound.<br/>
An island of stillness in crowded seats.<br/>
Married. Kids. <strong>Family.</strong> Betrayal.</p><p>CCCRRUU... SSSHHHH…EEEEEEE….WHHOOMP….</p><p>
  <em>Silence</em>
</p><p> </p><p>A barricade shattered, hollowed.</p><p>A twisted metal parody of a cage.</p><p>A tomb.</p>
