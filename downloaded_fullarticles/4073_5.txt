    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Loki almost forgets her... Almost. After all, what is one mortal life to thousands of silver tailed years? Almost nothing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then, suddenly, he sees her again within a dream- her entire life up until now. She is alive and even more marvellous than before. She is perfect... And she is looking for- well not exactly his enemies now- help, from those he would not consider friends. It displeases him to say the least.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> He isn't sure why his vision of his Moon is only appearing now, perhaps because of Thanos's prior control over him, or his cell blocking external interference. Whatever the reason, he is glad it at least came.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The way her childhood has been developing bitterly reminds him of his own. The forced training of combat and the arts, the hidden magic, the fact that she too was snatched from her parents and forced to forget. Only she escaped, for which he is ever grateful for. The only good that has come out of this life is she is unbreakable, and at only the tender age of ten. Loki has to envy her a little, the skills she's learned are utterly priceless.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Father." Thor's voice bellows throughout the throne room, destroying the blissful silence as he often does, like a foghorn. He bows so lowly and Loki feels his lips curve- appeased. "I wish to enquire about the magic-ones of Midgard."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hmm." Loki-Odin hums dismissively in the way Loki knows all too well. "Might I know the nature of this enquiry?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Of course, father. A mortal child has shown up and Lady Maximoff, the woman who's powers were granted from the Mind Gem, claims that the child was born with these powers. And I remember broth- Loki, "Thor corrects, "mentioning Midgardians with communities of natural magic wielders."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I see..." Loki-Odin strokes his beard in a thoughtful manner, trying not to flinch<em>... So they are not even brothers anymore?! </em>"You are to be king, Thor. That means every book, every library, every bank of knowledge is to be yours, my son."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Boy, he is really laying it on thick.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Perhaps Heimdahl would be of use to you."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Yes Father. Thank you, father." Thor bows, sweeping elegantly out the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Loki knows, however, that his mind is more vast than Thor's. So, he searches through the archive which is his mind till he finds something perfect. He'll have to start preparing the spell tonight if it is to be ready by the time she goes. This branch of magic isn't really his specialty after all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As if by magic, which Dumbledore knows it definitely isn't, the glass doors opens. It is safe to say that muggles were taking a different path in terms of culture and artistry. The awesome architecture of the high rise buildings could be enough to take a wizard's breath away, if not just for the modern designs. The ingenuity of these muggles, really, despite their obvious limitations are truly astounding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hello sir welcome to Stark Technologies, how may I help you?" Says a dull looking young lady sitting at what seemed to be the main desk. She does not look up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I'm here to see... Miss Potts." He says, after searching her head. "She is your boss?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The lady gives him an odd look. "Yes. May I ask what this is about?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I have an appointment."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"No, you don't." She says shortly and raises a brow as if to say, 'try again'.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So he does, "I'm here to enquire about a child."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Visibly, she stills. Hands shaking, she reaches for something under her desk. "Miss Potts is away on a business venture that you are not privy to. I need to ask you to leave."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hmm." Dumbledore hums. It would not do to cause a scene after all. "I see."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Would you like to leave a message for Miss Potts?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"No thank you." He replies, strolling out of the building.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It seems that Miss Lovegood will be getting her letter early.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Susan breathes a sigh of relief. The strange man is gone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Carefully, she pops the ICER back to the compartment under her desk, recalling what Miss Potts had told her when she had left.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>"Susan, the likelihood that someone will ask about Luna is quite high. In that case, just ask him to leave. He could be dangerous, don't hesitate to use that ICER I got you for Christmas." </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is the second enquiry about Luna today. The first was a man who said his name was Sunil Bakshi, flanked by two other men. They left after some pushing- she really didn't want to use that ICER. Strange how both men were British.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She gives herself a moment before calling Miss Potts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After about two days, it is decided that FRIDAY, Mr. Stark's A.I, will school her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So at four thirty, Luna wakes and joins Steve and Sam for a run. Six o clock is breakfast with them and Wanda; and seven is when FRIDAY starts her lessons with a hologram and a notepad. First for her today is history.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Ms. Margaret Carter. Founder of SHIELD, former SSR agent, born April 9th, 1921."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Luna copies it all down dutifully.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At half past one, Friday dismisses her and she goes to lunch. Most of the time Rhodey or Natasha or Clint is there but sometimes it's just her. Which is nice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She's not allowed out of the facility. Ever. There are no missions to do now after all. At least not ones she's allowed to be in. She reminds them every day how capable she is though… just in case.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Afterwards, Wanda and sometimes Vision come to help her control her "magic". When she first meets Vision she is pleasantly surprised. He makes for such good conversation- at least in Luna's opinion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Miss Luna." The android says carefully, holding out a hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Mr. Vision." Luna replies, grinning a little out of mirth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Meeting new people is overwhelming, is it not?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Why yes, it is. I'm glad we are on the same page."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hmmm... That is a metaphor, yes?" He raises a confused brow and she nods lightly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During "training" most of the time it's just the three of them in a room and some sugar glass bottles. Wanda will briefly try and sense Luna's mind and try to activate her magic. It takes several attempts. After a while, Luna tries to turn it on and off herself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It kind of works, it isn't like <em>it</em> turns off, because the quiet hum of it is always there, always changing, it's only that she can direct it. And yes, whilst she could use it in tiny bursts before, now she can control it. Now it isn't like putting Wanda guards to sleep or falling from a building safely. Now she can shatter those glass bottles and put them back together safely without using her hands.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As it turns out, the discipline taught in the Academy proves useful for magic as well as ops. After an about an hour usually, Luna gets tired and leaves Wanda and Vision practicing more combative uses of their powers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Four o clock is when Natasha, Clint and Sam and Steve usually get back from whatever they were doing. They never tell Luna what it is they're doing matter how much she asks. After they've grabbed a bite to eat Luna usually follows them to one of the many training areas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first time Sam and Steve see her fight is almost comical. She's a year older now and she has a year's more experience so she finds herself able to hold up to the Black Widow for longer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Their little duet begins as usual- neither party holding back, no weapons except their fists and kicks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Luna poises, one foot behind the other, crouched down low, hands in front. She's smaller than Natasha so she's gonna have to use that. Ahead of her, Natasha towers over her, reversing her position. Slowly they circle each other, waiting for an opening. It doesn't come so Luna closes her eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> A fist comes for her lower ribcage and she can hear the speed it moves at. She dodges- just. She knows the Widow's moves though and predictably, she ducks before Luna can make a jab at her open front so  Luna goes for her neck and slips down quickly to aim a kick at her ankles. Apparently, she's just as predictable because in seconds the Black Widow swiftly moves to gain advantage over her. She's about to finish the fight when things really get scrappy. Luna opens her eyes and grabs one of Natasha's leg's and kicks the other, pushing herself up and her opponent down. But Natasha's arms are free so makes a punch for Luna's face which lands and Luna stumbles a little, quickly, Natasha overpowers her and once again Luna's on the bottom. She kicks up but Natasha sees and grabs her foot. Using Natasha's hand as a foothold, she takes the opportunity to hoist herself up and wrap her legs around the redhead's neck and uses her hands to strangle her, pressing her feet into her Natasha's stomach in an attempt to topple her . Quickly, Natasha falls back landing on her hand and Luna on her back. Natasha rolls and uses her knees to keep Luna's feet down and an arm over Luna's arms and chest, clamping her to the floor. She raises her free hand about to strike Luna's jaw when Luna whispers, "Dead."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Quickly they both stand up and make their way off the mat. Sam whistles and raises his brows. Even Clint looks a little startled. Steve is staring open mouthed and there's a sadness underlining his eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The silence is palpable and she can feel herself start to smirk a little; out of the corner of her eye, Natasha's smirking too.</p>
<p>"Well damn, girl!" Sam winks holding his hand up. "You really gave Natasha a run for her money. "</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Thank you, Sam." Luna giggles before staring at his raised hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He notices her staring and once again, gives her a look of disbelief. "You've never had a high five before?" She shakes her head questioningly. "Huh. Well, you just slap my hand with your hand. It's a sign of respect and like, I dunno, saying that was a good job." Luna nods along and slaps his hand. "Ow! Fu- wow, that was a good one." He winces rubbing his palm a little, "Maybe a bit lighter next time."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Okay!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She sees Steve staring at her and approaches him. "Are you okay?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Y-yeah. Why?" He runs a nervous hand through his hair and twitches a little.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Because you looked sad earlier and you look nervous now. Is something bothering you? You look like you've been followed by a swarm of Wrackspurts! Really! Is there a Nargle infestation in your room or something?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He gives her an odd look before sighing. "No. At least I don't think so." He pauses and she can tell he's thinking. "How did you learn to fight like that. You were very good."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She smiles, "Thank You. I've been doing this since I was about three… or maybe four? Madame Yelena says I'm one of the best and that I can be a Black Widow one day? Do you think she realises that Natasha's superhero name is Black Widow as well?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He doesn't say anything for a moment before replying he replies. "Yes. I think they do know. But have you ever... You know..." Frowning , he stops himself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"What do I know?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Well... Have you ever killed anyone?" He blurts before covering his mouth. "I-I'm sorry. That was totally inappropriate of me Luna."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh. She forgets that even amongst these people she's dangerous. "Ah... Yes. Yes, I have. On my assigned missions." She pauses briefly to think, "I do regret some of them, though... but I think some of them really were bad people and the world was better off without them anyways." She finishes darkly, but she shrugs all the same.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Oh. Wow. I mean, uh, I think it's my turn to spar with Natasha now." He flashes her a brief smile before he excuses himself. Flees, she thinks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They discover soon that Luna almost easily overpowers Sam on the mat -much to the delight of a certain archer- and is on even playing fields if not at more of an advantage when it comes to Clint-much to the amusement of Natasha.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When she sees Clint and Natasha start to head up to the weapons range she quickly trails behind them. She thinks her shooting's going okay until she hears Clint sigh and ask her if she wants to learn how to shoot "properly".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Anyone with a decent gun and a good pair of sights can shoot a gun. But I never miss." He says, almost cockily except Luna knows it to be a fact.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then she finds it a lot better now, she knows, not just where the bullet will go but the path through the air it will take, the millisecond it will hit the target and so on until she sees Natasha training with knives and daggers and spears and shurikens and all types of objects. She leaves Clint and goes over to that station. She's very good with this so it's nice, except she struggles a bit with the heavier objects like axes and maces. All is well until Natasha starts to talk. A look from her, that Luna most definitely notices, prompts Clint to leave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"So," Natasha starts conversationally, twirling a knife in her hand, "How far with training did you go?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A brief moment of confusion flickers over. Weren't they just training...?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I mean in your lessons. How much did they tell you what was going on? What did they tell you to believe? How often did you go on those missions? What did they... Did they... Inje- do anything to you?" Taking a breath, Natasha eyes her warily. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Luna shifts in her stance a little. All of a sudden the room feels more empty. That lost looking swarm of wrackspurts that were just in the corner over there seems to have disappeared.  She shakes her head. How irrational she's being!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She releases the arrow and it hits the bullseye a little to the right of the inner red with a "thwack".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Well at the beginning they mostly just said that they were good-" Luna nods<em>(and will change the world)" </em>and told us who was bad... For instance SHIELD, or the Avengers and so forth. What do you mean by 'those missions'? I had seventy-one kill missions and eighty-six kills if that's what you're meaning. Three long-term undercover missions as well. I don't think HYDRA did anything to me. Were you going to say inject? You were, weren't you? No. As Wanda said, I was born with my powers. Why are you asking me this? It's because of Mr. Stark, isn't it. He doesn't like me. I've noticed... He's scared. All the wrackspurts around him go blue and frantic whenever he notices me."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Luna takes a breath. Natasha is staring at her, waiting. Absentmindedly Luna wonders if she's even heard her, but she isn't about to repeat herself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Did I say too much?" She asks instead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"No. And you're right. But don't worry about it."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A smile reaches her face. "I'm not worried!" She says reassuringly. Cause she'd not. After all, it's foolish to worry about what others will think.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This time, the arrow hits right in the centre.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>….</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At seven-thirty, most days- actually only some days- the Avengers minus Thor all sit down to have dinner together. Usually, it's a whole buffet ordeal since it's not easy to feed a hulk and a Super soldier, especially a Super soldier which missed almost a century of "Exotic new flavours." It sure is a change compared to the Academy... And there's always pudding!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hey guys," says Sam randomly, pointing with his fork, "Guess who Luna gave her first high five to today?" He winked , "Me! Suck on that Barton!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Clint pouts, "Can I have one too Luna?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Alright." Giggling, Luna reaches her hand up to high five Clint, only for Clint 's waiting had to be snatched away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Too slow. That's what you get for giving this jerk a high five instead of me."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Sorry. " she pouts, still grinning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After that whole affair, at eleven she goes to bed. Once, Clint had offered to read her a bedtime story. How silly, though.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Oh no Clint, I've plenty stories to keep me company tonight. "</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Carefully, just as she hears his footsteps pad away, she takes out the sugar and flour she stole from the kitchen and feeds it to those blibbering humdingers currently residing in the far corner of her room. They seem grateful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With a smile, she tucks herself back in and loops a length of rope around her wrist to the bedpost. A handcuff of sorts. It brings her a little, odd comfort.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally, peace can reclaim her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>....</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the short span of the three weeks Luna has been at the Avengers Facility, she can safely say that she's quite accustom now, to the antics of the Avengers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course, just as things start feeling normal, things tend to become un-normal. It's the way of the world. Although to be frank, when a bird literally flies into Luna's face, she isn't totally shocked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Oh dear." She murmurs after a moment, "You don't seem very coordinated."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It returns the sentiment with an intelligent stare and a slightly sheepish shrug, before promptly holding a leg out. There's an envelope attached to its leg... Strange. She's seen stranger things if course but still, this is pretty odd. On the back it says, "Miss Luna Lovegood…"</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Lovegood</em>? Who's that?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Room nine, third floor, Avengers Facility.</p>
<p>New York,</p>
<p>The United States of America</p>
<p>North America."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At this very moment, two things dawn on Luna. One, she has no known surname so the possibility of it being Lovegood aren't none; and two, she does not want to show anyone her letter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She doesn't open the letter, though - she's had more than enough training to know not to. The fancy wax seal does seem inviting, though.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A quick search on the web reveals that the only Lovegood found was a madman back in the 1700s. It's disappointing, to say the least.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Luna! Where heading out. Mission in Ukraine. You know the drill." Natasha calls, before letting herself in. Luckily, eight seconds is more than enough time to hide the letter. Throwing it like a knife, it wedges itself between two books on her bookshelf.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Yup. I know, don't worry." She smiles carefully, but  right now she's realising how do they know where she lives, right up to the room?! And the owl?! It makes her falter a bit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Narrowing her eyes, Natasha inspects her room. "What is it?" She asks, voice monotonous. Eyes turn back to Luna with a calculating stare, "Don't hide things from us when you know we'll find out anyways.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>You won't.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But Luna just shrugs gracefully at that and says, "Oh no. It really was nothing. Just some Nargles - pesky creatures aren't they? You should really tell Colonel Rhodes to stop wearing that mistletoe and holly scented cologne before they steal his suit. Mistletoe attracts Nargles, you know?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At this, Natasha rolls her eyes. "Mmmhm." But she hugs her and says, "Yeah, okay. Don't burn the place down okay?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Right." Luna nods in mock seriousness. "And you don't burn the country down and we have a deal."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"We make no promises." Natasha winks before taking herself out the door.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It shuts silently.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Returning to her laptop, she opens a new tab and types in "Mail via owls" into the search engine. Surprisingly there are several pages including recent sightings, one person writes about her neighbours being driven away by a flock of owls and finding their living room filled to the brim with letters; and theories dating back to the early 1200s of legends and local suspicions of witches and wizards. It can't be a coincidence. Luna shakes her head. Nothing is ever a coincidence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once again she feels the thrum of her magic. "FRIDAY. " she calls, <em>"can you keep a secret from the Avengers?"</em></p>
