    <p>The empty corridors of Hogwarts echoed with the heeled footsteps of a lone individual. It was the Summer holidays and Charms apprentice Hermione Granger was restless. She knew she should have gone on that trip with Ginny and Luna to New York. But she had declined, hoping that this Summer one of her greatest desires would come to fruition.</p><p>It had been quite a shock when it was found out that Professor Snape had survived Nagini’s bite. He’d taken a year to recover fully having refused to resume his post as Headmaster, he handed the title over to Minerva. She, in turn, granted him the title of Deputy. And Severus had grudgingly accepted.</p><p>Slughorn had stayed that extra year while Severus recovered and then slipped back into retirement when he’d returned. Hermione too had taken that year he was gone to study for her NEWTS and accepted the apprenticeship offered by Professor Flitwick.</p><p>Hermione’s and Ron’s relationship had died without a whimper. It seemed once the adrenaline of battle had waned, so had their desire. They were still friends, but gatherings at the Burrow were tense, as Molly seemed to think that Hermione had lead Ron on with promises of wild passion and eventual marriage. They both tried to explain that it was a mutual decision, to no avail. Molly would believe what she wanted to believe.</p><p>Hermione had spent the last school year learning everything there was to know about charms and how they could branch out to different magical disciplines. The most fascinating was how Charms could affect the potions making process. For all Severus said about foolish wand waving, a lot was used with certain potions.</p><p>She remembered when he’d given her permission to call him by his given name. They’d been arguing, uhhmm <em> ‘passionately debating’ </em> the merits of using the featherweight charm on heavy elements, when he finally got fed up with her saying Professor Snape every five seconds in her arguments and snapped, “Just call me Severus, for Merlin’s sake!” and she had.  </p><p>It was while working with Severus after this argument, that Hermione’s obsession had come to be. No, it wasn’t with the simmering fumes, or the intricate wand movement, the utter control that Severus exhibited. It was his buttons. Some’d think that such a mundane and innocuous thing such as buttons would and could be easily ignored. And yes, in most case that’d be correct. But not in Hermione’s case.</p><p>It all started out so innocently. She’d been observing him for hours working on a better version of the Wolfsbane Potion. One that not only would allow the drinker to retain their human intelligence, but the transformation was much less trying on the body. Some of the test subjects had even been able to control the change altogether. It was a brilliant breakthrough. And Hermione was ecstatic to have been witness to it. It was during that very session that her obsession with Severus’ buttons was born.     </p><p>The lab had boiling been hot, and that's saying something; as it was in the middle of winter in the highlands of Scotland. Hermione had quickly shucked her heavy apprentice robes and was contemplating undoing several buttons on her blouse, as even with cooling charms she felt sticky with sweat. Severus, on the other hand, seem completely unfazed with the heat. He’d shed his teaching robes, but only because they would get in the way of his brewing. He stood in his heavy wool frock coat and trousers, just the tiniest bit of white could be seen at his throat and wrists.</p><p>Hermione couldn’t understand how Severus could be so unflappable. He was always cool, calm and collected… Well, unless something or someone had annoyed him. She’d had the sudden intense desire to see him without his armor, it was as if his buttons acted like a shield against the world.</p><p>Hermione began to imagine what could be behind those buttons. Would he be scrawny and skeletal? Would he be lean with ropey, wiry muscles? She knew him to be strong, solely based on his ability to move the heaviest cauldron without the aid of magic. So, he had to be lean with lieth flanks and she desperately wanted to see for herself.</p><p>
  <em> She pictured herself sauntering over to him, running her hands up his chest and playing with the topmost button of his frock coat. “Hmmm, Professor. You must be sweltering in that coat, allow me to assist you in removing it. All those buttons must be annoying to undo one at a time.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> She pictured him looking at her with cool eyes, “If you must, Miss Granger. I won’t stop you.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Oh, yes. Please?” she’d moan as she slowly pushed that first button through its hole. </em>
</p><p>Hermione was so deep in her fantasy that she didn’t hear Severus calling her name.</p><p>“Miss Granger…?” No response, “MISS GRANGER!?” he yelled and she snapped back to attention. “You wanted to learn how charms affect this potion, so pay… Attention!”</p><p>“Y-yes, Professor,” Hermione said meekly, her eyes down cast. It wouldn’t do for Severus to catch a glimpse of what she was thinking, using Legilimency. She had continued to observe him, but in the back of her mind she was still imagining all those buttons and what they hid.</p><p>__________________________________________________________________</p><p>It was this obsession that had Hermione so restless. The remainder of the year had been hell, she just couldn’t stop herself, she imagined just walking right up to him, taking both lapels of his frock and wrenching it open. But then she would imagine undoing each button individually, it was maddening!</p><p>So, in order to combat the desire to tackle and have her wicked way with Severus, Hermione would go to the Room of Requirement and dance. The magic of the Room still astounded her sometimes, especially when she would enter thinking of what music she’d like to dance to and it would be played. It didn’t matter if it was Muggle or Magical.</p><p>On this particular evening, she was thinking of one song that fit in so nicely with her obsession. Buttons, by the Pussycat Dolls, was a chart-topping hit in the Muggle world. She’d heard it once while in the car with her mother. She’d been shocked when her mother had started singing along and wriggling in her seat. She quickly stopped that train of thought, as it was a bit too disturbing.</p><p>Hermione paced three times in front of the tapestry featuring the dancing trolls, thinking, ‘I need somewhere to dance,’ and the door materialized. She slipped in a closed the door quickly, even though there were only a few select staff and apprentices in residence at that time, she didn’t want to raise any suspicions.</p><p>The Room, was as she had pictured it. A wooden floor, with several dancing poles spaced throughout. A wall of mirrors, so that she could watch herself. There were even several chairs she could be able to utilize in her routine. She went over to the chairs and positioned them in the room. She then pictured one addition to the Room and a waist-high horizontal bar appeared, it wasn’t attached to the mirrors so it would allow for a wide range of movement.</p><p>“Room? Please play, Buttons by the Pussycat Dolls,” Hermione asked, knowing that    </p><p>it would. She then removed the cloak she’d been wearing to conceal her outfit. It was a more feminine version of Severus’ frock coat. It had a built-in corseted waist and only fell to mid-thigh. She wasn’t wearing trousers either, just sheer black thigh high stockings and a suspender belt with knee high heeled boots. She also wore silver silk and black lace bra and knickers. She felt sexy and wished with all her heart that Severus could watch her dance for him. She completely forgot that the Room was still in tune with her thoughts and granted her wish.  </p><p>Hermione stood in the center of the room and when the sound of a symbol sounded she struck a pose. Her feet shoulder-width apart, right hip cocked, her head thrown back and hair cascading down her back. Once the first beat started, she swiveled her hips to the left and ran her hands down her chest, going down her hips and to her thighs and she swung her hips to the right. She then spun to where her back was against one of the vertical poles. She entwined her arms above her head, around the pole and shimmied down, spreading her legs apart.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>The light tapping of a cane was the only sound that echoed in the halls of the dungeon. Severus looked over his shoulder as he raised his hand brushing it against an inconspicuous wall next to his classroom, “Do you really need to tap that bloody thing?” he asked his companion irritatedly.</p><p>Lucius raised an elegant brow letting out a small sniff, “What’s got you so agitated? My walking stick has never bothered you before.”</p><p>Severus let out a low grunt stepping through the shimmering portal that led to his private chambers. Yes, he was agitated, extremely so. He’d been having a lovely fantasy about Miss Granger, no Hermione, when Lucius had floo’d into the Headmaster’s Office. Knowing Severus was there alone while Minerva was away on holiday.</p><p>He’d been about to go to his own chambers to have a wank to the image of a delectable Hermione spread out for him on his bed when Lucius appeared effectively pouring freezing water on his fantasy and arousal.</p><p>Whenever he was working with her, Severus went out of his way to touch her as much as possible. Testing boundaries while she was near him, just to see if she would notice and how much she could take.</p><p>He enjoyed watching her blush whenever he towered behind her, grazing his hand down her arm to show her how to cast a charm or to correct the position of her stirring rod. Touching her hand as they sat next to each other in the Great Hall at meals under the guise of reaching for the same item she was.</p><p>He loved playing with her, giving himself that little boost he needed to fuel his fantasies. It wouldn’t do to let her know the downright licenious thoughts he was having of her. He was sure she would be disgusted. He was too old for her, too set in his own ways to have her in his life, although the thought of her warming his bed each night did have its appeal. Oh, how he wished he could see what she looked like under those robes. His cock twitched at the mere thought.</p><p>He and Lucius of course, had shared willing witches in the past as well as since the war had ended. Narcissa had left Lucius shortly after the Dark Lords fall, taking Draco with her. The only companionship they had now was each other, and that of an occasional whore. The prostitutes were just a means to an end, to get a release from all the delicious thoughts of Hermione, at least on his part. A way to work off his frustration caused by the fantasies he’d built up in his head. No one else had piqued his interest in a long time, not physically, nor intellectually as much as she did.</p><p>However much he wished it, she’d never see him as anything other than her <em> professor. </em>Severus paused in his step while entering his sitting room. He tilted his head to the side, listening. Lucius stepped next to him looking around the room, “Do I detect music playing?” Lucius asked as he stepped further into the room.</p><p>Closing the door with a quiet thud, Severus checked his wireless for the low thudding beat, but it was switched off, “I didn’t leave any playing...” he said absentmindedly going towards the back of his main sitting room where there was a small private sitting area with a reading nook, it was his sanctuary. He was going to try and read and rid him of his thoughts about Hermione. At least until such a time that he would have enough privacy to indulge in them.</p><p>“Well, what do we have here?” Lucius purred suddenly. Severus turned around and found him standing in front of the tall mirror the sat flush against the wall between his bedroom and lab, “My, what a naughty little vixen you are.”</p><p>Severus furrowed his brow walking to where Lucius stood so enraptured, staring into the mirror. Severus mentally shook his head thinking his friend had finally lost the plot. Lucius knew he looked good, and Severus often caught him preening himself in any reflective surface they’d pass. But there was something on Lucius’s face that caused him to pause. The way he was clutching his cane as if it were physically keeping him from collapsing to the ground.</p><p>Severus’ breath then caught in his throat when he caught sight of what had so consumed Lucius’ attention. It was Granger…Hermione <em> dancing </em> seductively. That wasn’t all that made his breath freeze in his lungs, or all of his blood to go rushing to his cock. No, it was what she was wearing.</p><p>He watched as Hermione swayed her hips to the beat of the music, her delicate fingers sliding down a coat, a coat that looked so like his own. Playing with each button slowly, her fingers brushing over the rough wool. Her plump lower lip sucked into her mouth and the fire in her eyes, made his cock harden even more. Eyes that seemed to be trained on him.</p><p>Her eyes never left the mirror in front of her, for she was picturing Severus sitting in a chair and watching her, his black eyes sparking with desire. She then slid back up the pole while arching her back, her breasts thrust out. Once standing again, she spun away from the pole and strutted toward the back of the room, her hips swinging widely, legs crossed over each other with every step.</p><p>At the back of the room, she grabbed one of the chairs, spun it around and placed one foot on the seat. She gyrated her hips and then stood up on the seat of the chair. She spun in place and then dropped down on the seat, straddling it, her arms crossed over the back and shimmied her shoulder while mouthing the words, “Loosen up my buttons, babe.”</p><p>She stood back up and spun the chair around so that it was facing front and she sat back down on it and splayed her legs open, a flash of her silver and black knickers captured by the mirror. She threw her head forward, her hair flying. She then snapped her head back again and ran her hands up her legs to her knees. She spread her legs wider and arched her back and ran her hands up to her throat.</p><p>Snapping forward once again, she brought her legs together and crossed them while shimmying her shoulders and lip-syncing the lyrics. She stood up from the chair and kicked backward, causing it to slide across the floor and come to a stop against the far wall.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Lucius gripped his cane harder watching the way Granger’s body moved. He was surprised, delightfully so at the way she had grown. She had curves, and that mane of hair finally tamed making her look like delicious specimen of a woman. He could very easily picture her wild hair spread across his silk pillows.</p><p>Not so long ago, the mere thought of sullying his reputation with someone of her status made his stomach roll, but the war had changed his views. He wasn’t saddened when Narcissa had filed for divorce, which is a rare thing in the Wizarding community, especially to one of his high standing. All he felt at that moment was pure relief. They hadn’t loved each other, and her fanatical way of thinking had brought nothing but trouble, so much in fact, he now had to rebuild his reputation that had been smeared because of her beliefs, and the actions he took at her behest for the madman that took up residence in his estate.</p><p>The thought gave him pause. His eyes took in the Granger girl once again, his cock almost twitching in time with the sway of her delectable body. His lips curled into a smirk. She could be most helpful in his endeavor not only in rebuilding his reputation, but she would be a lovely witch to warm his bed, and life. She was full of life, and was intelligent. Something he had been looking for in a companion for some time.</p><p>He looked over at Severus noting the way his eyes burned into the mirror, his pupils dilated and full of lust. It would appear he was not the only one that desired this little witch. Lucius turned his head back to the mirror, a plan forming in his head. They’d shared witches before, why not this one? If they were lucky enough she would become a permanent part of their lonely lives. He, well, they were still young and had much to offer a witch. Sadly, he knew this because when witches would paw at them wanting to bed them only in the off chance of what they could offer them in the financial realm. Granger had her own fortune, she was not a whore who sought to increase her station in life, she had that in spades.</p><p>Adjusting his cock he cleared his throat. “I think it’s time to pay Miss Granger a visit, don’t you Severus?”</p><p>Severus grunted in response leaning against the wall his eyes never leaving the mirror.</p><p>Rolling his eyes, Lucius tugged at Severus’ arm. “Come now, it appears that Miss Granger is in need of a <em> dance partner </em>… or two, yes? Who better to help her with that than us?”</p><p>Severus yanked his arm from Lucius grip straightening out his robes as he brushed past him, “Very well,” he growled, “I think I may know where she is, follow me.”</p><hr/><p>Hermione then strutted forward to the horizontal bar. She stopped, her legs together and she bent over and spread her arms along the top of the bar. She brought her hands back together and did a full-body shimmy to the floor, her hands remaining on the bar. Suddenly she kicked out and fell into the splits.</p><p>She bounced back up and placed her left foot on top of the bar and leaned to the side and raised her left leg until it was vertical to her body. she snapped her leg back down and began to play with the buttons on the coat she was wearing. She undid the first three and then grasped the lapels and pulled slowly. The rest of the buttons came undone and the coat gaped open revealing the full sight of her bra, knickers, suspender belt and lace-top stockings.</p><p>She shrugged her shoulders and the coat fell down her arms to rest at her wrists. She took it off and began to spin it rapidly over her head when she flung it to the side and it landed in the heap on the floor.</p><p>She then spun back around, her back facing the mirror and the horizontal bar. Her hi-cut boy short knickers riding up the crack of her arse and exposing the bottom of her cheeks. She arched backward over the bar, until she could see herself in the mirror once again. Her eyes widened, for she saw that she was no longer alone.</p><p> </p><p> <img src="https://www.ebay.com/i/232969956704?chn=ps&amp;ul_ref=https%253A%252F%252Frover.ebay.com%252Frover%252F1%252F711-117182-37290-0%252F2%253Fmpre%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.ebay.com%25252Fi%25252F232969956704%25253Fchn%25253Dps%2526itemid%253D232969956704%2526targetid%253D593772068093%2526device%253Dt%2526adtype%253Dpla%2526googleloc%253D9011789%2526poi%253D%2526campaignid%253D1689945016%2526adgroupid%253D69559042447%2526rlsatarget%253Dpla-593772068093%2526abcId%253D1140466%2526merchantid%253D114154187%2526gclid%253DCj0KCQjw5J_mBRDVARIsAGqGLZCbtx8DO5pGGrtN8gBPQlmBlep0sapS3869r5NBC_zGUVjSg3g0ya8aAmVLEALw_wcB%2526srcrot%253D711-117182-37290-0%2526rvr_id%253D1953819439139%2526rvr_ts%253D7088274316a0ac3c4ea54352ffdeb777" alt="" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1458075677" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1458075677" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/></p><p> </p>
