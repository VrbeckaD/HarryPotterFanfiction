    <p>He stood in the garden, a shadow against the twilight snow. Unsettled by an earlier conversation, annoyed by the children finding dark corners for their fumbling intimacies, but now alone, in the dark, as he liked it. The falling snowflakes showed no respect for gravity; they twirled and launched themselves into the air, filling his eyelashes, his boots, his cloak with tiny diamonds. He was silent, he was the abyss. A great sigh scattered the snowflakes in front of his face.</p><p>Across the garden, near the entrance gate, a matching sigh and the hiss of an almost-silent spell broke his reverie. He didn’t move. Another amorous couple, another discreet conversation? Wearisome. He slowly shifted his stance to blend into the outline of a shrub.</p><p>The noise had come from a small, blue glow at the garden gate. A slender will-o’-wisp in a girlish ball gown, expertly curled hair now falling over her shoulders, all made an ethereal blue by small, flickering flames held in her hands. She also seemed tired, but that was not surprising, as dawn was creeping toward the horizon. For now, it was still inky dark, lit only by a haze of snow and a small unworldly sylph, come to mourn her disastrous evening.</p><p>Snape stood still, waiting to see which of the idiots would join her—Weasley the fathead, or the Durmstrang dolt. Hermione stood alone, caressing her blue flames for warmth. A shiver ran through her and Snape then knew she was alone. He was bemused by their shared presence, in the garden, in the snow. </p><p>And then she turned toward him, snow still billowing around her. She cocked her head to one side and then cast a shield, air vibrating with magic. Snape rolled his eyes and stepped out of the shadows, wand down, but ready. </p><p>Hermione hesitated, then dropped the shield. Snape let one side of his mouth drag upward into the closest thing he had to a smile. He stepped forward, into the blue light, intending to send her on her way. As he drew closer, he hesitated. The flickering, cerulean glow infused her eyes, her sculpted collarbone and fine, slender arms. Unwillingly, he found his hand raised to one of the lazy curls on her shoulder.</p><p>He gathered it into his hand, stroked the lock of hair between his thumb and forefinger. She was silent, still, something else in her eyes. </p><p>“Beautiful.” It was as if someone else had said it. Someone behind him, someone that hadn’t been touched by the immense sorrow of his life. Hermione, eyes dark and liquid, made him new again. And yet…yes. There was the task that needed to be done. And now it was obvious how to do it. She stood in the snow as if made out of ivory, almost as if she didn’t need to breathe. He gently let the curl fall back onto her shoulder, moving his hand to clasp her cheek. </p><p>“Beautiful, and yet we must wait.” Her eyes ignited. His thumb moved to her lower lip and he pressed lightly, as if leaving an stamped impression, a seal of possession. Her lips pursed to meet his thumb, light, tenuous—a promise.</p><p>Then she turned on her heel and fled back into the safety of the school, back where she was Hermione the swot and everything made sense.</p><p>Snape tipped his head back and smiled his half-smile into the oncoming snow, a moment of glory. Then the consequences rippled across his face and he hunched forward into his cloak, a ragged shadow once again.</p>
