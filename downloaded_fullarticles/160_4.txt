It turned out he’d done a poor job of it, though, because Ron looked up. “What? Do you have a date to the Yule Ball yet?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry shook his head. “Unfortunately.” </p><p> </p><p>Ron twisted his hands in his lap. He licked his lip, eyes flickering from Harry to his hands and Harry again.</p><p> </p><p>“Say, Harry,” Ron said, then bit down on his lip, breaking the skin. A splotch of crimson blood bloomed on the soft pink flesh. He swallowed. “Harry,” he said again. Harry looked up.</p><p> </p><p>“Will you come to the Yule Ball with me?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry inhaled suddenly. “A-as friends?” he stammered.</p><p> </p><p>“Um,” said Ron. “Um. I guess, yeah… yeah, mate. As friends.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry frowned slightly. “Ron? We can, um, we can go as more than friends.”</p><p> </p><p>Comprehension dawned in Ron’s eyes. “You - really?”</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded. Ron beamed, flushing vivid pink against a wide white smile. “More than friends,” he said, and Harry smiled back.</p><p> </p><p>“More than friends.”</p></div>
