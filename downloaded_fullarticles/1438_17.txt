    <p>"They're going to interview you and decide who you'll be able to help based off of that." Hermione walked with Harry down to the omega safety office. Rather anxious about the whole affair. "Now all of the omegas were trained and drugged pretty badly, so you'll need to take that into consideration, alright? These people have been through a lot."</p><p>Harry smiled and hurried along with her. "I know, Hermione, you don't need to remind me over and over again. I know you worked hard to help them. Everything is gonna turn out alright. Promise."</p><p>Hermione nodded. "It's just... It's taken so long to get them out of there. I want to help get them back into society, you know? It's heartbreaking seeing some of them. I'm so glad you're volunteering for this." She smiled, squeezing her friend's hand. "Anyway, this is the office. Clari is taking your interview, so just ask for her. I need to get back to my desk." She pulled Harry in for a hug. "Tell me how it goes, alright? I'll see you at dinner."</p><p>Harry hugged her back, watching her hurry back to her office upstairs. He was doing this. He was seriously about to save an omega and bring them back to Hogwarts with him. He took a deep breath and walked through the door, feeling slightly self-conscious in his simple sweater and jeans. Muggle clothes, most wizards would say, but he was far more comfortable in these so that's what he wore.</p><p>"Mr. Potter?" A receptionist asked, looking him over from being her desk. "Ms. Clari is in the second office. She's ready to see you for the interview now if you're ready."</p><p>Harry nodded, his mouth suddenly feeling dry. It didn't seem to matter though, so he followed the receptionist's directions to the small office of a petite redhead that had to be Clari.</p><p>"Hello? I'm Harry Potter. I've come for an interview. For the -uh- the omega program? That Hermione worked on?" Harry fiddled with his hands nervously. He wasn't really sure what to do for this part, so he stood in the doorway, waiting for instructions.</p><p>Clari nodded and gestured to a chair for him to sit. "Thank you for meeting me today Mister Potter. May I call you Harry?" Harry nodded so she continued. "As you know this is a very serious project so we have to ensure the safety and well-being of the omegas under our care. I've taken the liberty of running a background check on you and with Mrs. Granger as a reference and to verify you can adequately house whoever is sent to you, you're all set in that area. So there's just the psychological exam and a few interview questions to go over today and then tomorrow we'll send you an owl confirming your address. Assuming all goes well I'll be escorting a very lucky omega to your residence soon enough. Are you ready to begin? or do you have questions?"</p><p>"I'm ready." Harry smiled, crossing his legs as he leaned back to get more comfortable in the chair.</p><p>Clari nodded and took out a notepad. "Could you draw a clock for me? At ten-thirty."</p><p>X X X X X X X X X X X X</p><p>The owl came only a day later with the news that they'd selected an omega for him and that Clari would be down the next day with him  to meet Harry before letting the omega decide if they wanted to stay.</p><p>"What does it say?" Ron asked, looking over Harry's shoulder. "Malfoy? They're kidding, right? If you get stuck with one of those pureblood snobs I'm gonna-"</p><p>"Ron!" Hermione chided. "You have no right to judge whomever they picked for Harry. All of these omegas went through a lot of trauma. You have to be sensitive."</p><p>Harry frowned, reading over the brief description of his soon-to-be omega. "What do you mean Ron? Do you know him?"</p><p>"Malfoy's are an old wizarding family. They hate anyone who's not pureblood and thing muggleborn's aren't real wizards. They hate the living hell out of omegas too. I bet if their kid presented as one then his parents are the ones who sold him. They consider it 'dishonorable' to be anything other than an alpha or beta. It's bloody stupid if you ask me."</p><p>Hermonie nodded. "It is stupid. Omegas are just as capable of things as an alpha or beta. That's why Harry is doing this; to help an omega get back on their feet. And you are not going to comment on his family, got it, Ron? If it's true they sold him into this then I doubt he ever wants to see them again. They should be in prison for doing something like that." She frowned. "When I'm the minister of magic that'll be one of the first things I change. Omegas need proper rights. Not just temporary rights until they get mated and all that bullshit."</p><p>"Language." Ron nudged her. "But I agree. I can imagine someone doing something like that to Ginny. I'd probably go mental if she got caught up in one of those rings."</p><p>"Language." Hermione grinned, nudging him back. "I can't wait to meet Draco though. I'll be at work then, but I promise I'll come by during my lunch break to say hi and all that. He may know me actually. I was pretty hands-on with this project, so a lot of the omegas were in my care at the office while we got them settled in."</p><p>"Thank you. I bet he'd love to see a familiar face." Harry grinned, before shooing them out. "I've got papers to grade guys, you know that. I can't talk forever."</p><p>He stared at the paper for a while after his best friends left. Imagining the omega in his head. Draco Malfoy. He couldn't wait.</p><p>X X X X X X X X X X X</p><p>"Now Draco," Clari adjusted Draco's shirt, "You must be nice to Mr. Potter. He's going to take care of you for a while. Hopefully, until you can get back on your feet, but we'll see." She sighed when Draco didn't even look up. Snapping her fingers in front of his face. "Draco? I know you can hear me. It's not polite to zone out like that. I need Potter to take you out of hands already so I need you to be polite and present, alright?"</p><p>Draco nodded, still staring down at his hands.</p><p>"I'd slap you into speaking right now if it weren't for that fact we're nearly there. If one more alpha sends you back to me then I'm going to let you get 'lost' in the system, alright? SO straighten up and do whatever Mr. Potter wants you to to get you out of my damn facility. I had enough problems with omegas wanting divorces or trying to file domestic abuse cases without taking care of some stupid omegas just because they decided to be whores enough to get caught in a sex ring." She growled, grabbing Draco's arm and dragging him to his feet. "Now," She straightened herself out and glanced over Draco's messy form, "Let's get this show underway, shall we?"</p><p>The train doors opened to reveal a redheaded boy in the seat of one of the carriages (whether or not they were self-drawn was now under debate, but Draco could see the dark horse like creatures well).</p><p>"Name's Charlie. Care of Magical Creatures Professor and Groundskeeper-in-training. A pleasure to meet you." he shook Cali's hand firmly, and barely seemed to notice that Draco didn't accept the handshake he offered. "Harry asked me to escort you back to the grounds so you didn't have to walk. I'll also help you find his office because he's the sort that probably forgot to tell you where to look." Charlie winked and helped both of them into the carriage before climbing in himself. "It' a pleasure to meet both of you. Terribly sorry, I know I didn't ask your names, but Harry already told me. You're Clari and you're Draco."</p><p>Draco smiled softly at the overly talkative boy seated across from him. He made the carriage ride seem like mere seconds. Mostly chatting with Clari, leaving Draco to follow them at a polite and measured distance behind them as they were ushered into a large office covered in photographs. It was pleasant and had a delightful sense of home Draco hadn't felt in a while.</p><p>"Clari! It's good to see you again. Charlie, how you doing? And you must be Draco, it's a pleasure to meet you at last." Harry smiled warmly, holding out his hand.</p><p>Draco stared down at it, wondering if this was all a trap. Clari hated him, so no way in hell would she send him to an actual nice person. He opted to bow slightly and expose his neck to the alpha. A show of pure submission that had been trained into him since he presented as an omega. Thankfully the conversation drifted away from him and the three alphas left him to slump in a chair and pretend he didn't exist for a while.</p><p>Which was a lot easier when he didn't particularly want to.</p>
