    <p>“What the HELL are those, Moony??” Sirius said, a little too loudly. It was their first morning back at school, sixth year, and Remus had just walked out of the dorm bathroom with wet hair, a towel clinging to his hips, and matching pieces of metal through his nipples.</p>
<p>“Hmm?” said James, voice raspy with sleep as he drew back the curtains around his bed. Then he too caught sight of Remus’ chest and blinked hard. Remus, for his part, reddened slightly at the attention, but would not have walked out of the bathroom shirtless if he minded the teasing he knew would follow. Well, that and the piercings were still new enough that he wanted to give them as much of a chance to breathe as possible before donning his robes for the day.</p>
<p>Peter poked his head out from his bed then, eyes landing on Remus. “Shit, Moony, you pierced your nipples?”</p>
<p>“No,” Remus deadpanned, rolling his eyes at them all. “I paid someone else to do it for me.”</p>
<p>“Is this a Muggle thing?” Sirius demanded. He’d decided over the summer he was going to familiarize himself with all things Muggle, but had not yet had much of a chance. “What’s it for?”</p>
<p>Peter snorted. “They’re not <i>for</i> anything, mate. It’s just another form of jewelry, like how Evans has her ears pierced.”</p>
<p>“Wait,” said James, sitting up suddenly, eyes widening. “Does Evans have - y’know - those, too?”</p>
<p>“How am I supposed to know?”</p>
<p>“Okay, getting back to the point,” Sirius cut in. “Moony. What the hell are those.”</p>
<p>Remus raised an eyebrow at him, gesturing down at his chest in a sweeping motion. “You mean these? Pete’s just explained it. I thought your hearing was supposed to better  now with your Animagus form.”</p>
<p>The other boys snickered, James wandered off to take the next shower, and the day went on.</p>

</p>
<p>	By their third class of the day, Sirius had developed something of a fixation on the small bars of metal. He’d almost gotten to the point of making a list of all the questions he had about them by lunch - were there other pieces of jewelry you could put through them? Were there other places you could get a piercing? How much did it hurt? When that question occurred to him, he crossed his arms over his chest and discreetly pinched one nipple through his shirt, digging the edges of his nails into the sides as much as he could to try to replicate the stabbing. Not as discreetly as he thought, however, as Peter gave him a funny look, eyes flickering down to his hand. Sirius released his nipple immediately and uncrossed his arms, hastily returning to taking notes.<br/>
</p>
<p>After the day’s lessons were over and the boys had all returned to the common room, Sirius really did make a list of his questions, while Remus got a start on the homework for Defense and James and Peter played a game of chess. He watched Remus out of the corner of his eye in between scrawling, looking too long, until finally Remus fixed him with a look and asked, “What, Pads?”<br/>
</p>
<p>“Nothing,” Sirius said, cheeks warming. “I just- I was wondering - I have some questions, about-” His eyes darted to Remus’ chest and back.<br/>
</p>
<p>Remus sighed, set down his quill, and made for the stairs up to their dorm. He turned back when Sirius didn’t follow, jerking his head, and Sirius got the idea. Once they were in the privacy of the dorm, Remus turned to him.<br/>
</p>
<p>“I don’t want everyone knowing about them, or they might want to see, and that means seeing other things too. You three already know though, so…” he shrugged, and slipped his shirt over his head. The piercings glinted in the light. Sirius’ mouth went very dry, until Remus huffed.<br/>
</p>
<p>“You said you had questions,” he said, and Sirius startled.<br/>
</p>
<p>“Right! Yes. Um,” he stammered, and had to glance at the piece of parchment he’d brought up with him. “Did it hurt?”<br/>
</p>
<p>“Obviously, Pads,” Remus rolled his eyes at him, but with a gentle smile. “They stab a needle through and then put the jewelry in. Even with the transformations every month it still hurt. Have you ever given any thought to what the inside of your nipple feels like?”<br/>
</p>
<p>Sirius nearly flinched. “No, but - well, I did try pinching myself earlier to see what it was like,” he admitted, feeling a little silly.<br/>
</p>
<p>To his credit, Remus didn’t laugh, but he couldn’t fight off a grin. “Okay, so imagine that, but maybe ten times worse. Our pain tolerances are probably a little different, but I’m not saying anyone really enjoys the process, per se. What else?”<br/>
</p>
<p>“Can you get piercings in other places? Pete said it was like Evans having her ears pierced, but are there others beyond that?”<br/>
</p>
<p>“Pretty much anywhere you wanna stick a piece of metal, they can do it,” Remus said. “They had a notebook you could flip through showing other piercings they’d done, quite the variety. I don’t know if I want any more, though.”<br/>
</p>
<p>“Why those?” It hadn’t been on his list of questions, but Sirius couldn’t deny wondering a little.<br/>
</p>
<p>Remus lifted a shoulder. “Dunno,” he said. “Wasn’t really too picky about where, except that I knew I didn’t want anything sharp near my dick, and the facial ones might have drawn too much attention. Could’ve gone with an ear piercing, it probably would’ve been hidden enough by my hair, but I kind of wanted to be able to see it too.”<br/>
</p>
<p>Sirius tried to ignore the flare of heat he felt at Remus saying the words “my dick” so nonchalantly, but he was insanely curious now about what those sort of piercings might look like - or feel like. That would most definitely require further investigation on his own part, somehow.<br/>
</p>
<p>“Why did you want a piercing at all? Not necessarily that one, but any,” he said instead.<br/>
</p>
<p>Remus’ cheeks went pink this time. “Well. You may have noticed I’ve got an awful lot of marks on my body that I didn’t have much say in.”<br/>
</p>
<p>Sirius nodded, cataloguing the worst ones in his mind.<br/>
</p>
<p>“I wanted there to be something I did have a say in. Something I chose. A tattoo might have been okay too, but they’re more expensive, and if I hadn’t liked these I could’ve just taken them out and they would’ve closed over. Plus, I’m pretty sure that since they’re not actually a part of my body, it won’t be possible for the wolf to destroy them in the same way as a tattoo,” he said, “but that’s just a theory. Not a lot of research on werewolves and body modification, y’know.”<br/>
</p>
<p>“Not a lot of research on werewolves and a lot of things,” Sirius agreed, thinking, not for the first time, how unfair it all was and how much he wished he could change things for Moony. He was startled out of this line of thinking, however, by Remus asking if he wanted to touch them.<br/>
</p>
<p>“What?” was all he could say, surprised, even as he felt a really quite overwhelming urge to do so, a strong wave of needing to know what how they felt under his fingers.<br/>
</p>
<p>Remus blushed, much more than he had only moments ago. “I just- I thought maybe you’d want to see what they’re like. As much as you can without actually having them yourself,” he said. “It doesn’t have to be weird or anything, they’re just nipples, we’ve all got them,” he rambled on.<br/>
</p>
<p>“No,” said Sirius, “no, I know. It’s- yeah, I kinda do, if that’s okay.”<br/>
</p>
<p>“Yes,” Remus breathed.<br/>
</p>
<p>At that moment, the door flew open and they both jumped back a little. James rushed in, barely looking at them, making a beeline for his broom. As he went back out, he wolf whistled at Remus, who had moved to put his shirt back on.<br/>
</p>
<p>“Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do, and not on my bed!” he called out, pulling the door closed. Sirius and Remus both turned alarming shades of red, avoiding eye contact. When they awkwardly went back down to the common room a moment later, they still couldn’t look at each other.</p>
