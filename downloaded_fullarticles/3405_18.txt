    <p>Draco was running out of time to shop for groceries, but refused his mother’s advice to have the house elves fetch the ingredients. After all, he was the one making the dish, he didn’t want the house elves dirty hands all over the food, much less attempting to assemble it himself.</p><p>The upcoming party was supposed to represent unity within the wizarding world, and everyone in attendance was expected to make something. He knew some people were making décor, or dresses, while others-like himself-were making food.</p><p>It would do no good, after such a hectic war, to turn immediately to his house elves to do his duty. They Would be doing the cleaning afterward, anyway.</p><p>Besides, he had already been telling everyone that he was going to be cooking something for the party. Everyone was excited—except for those who were mortified.</p><p>Hermione was also planning a bit of her own dish for the event, since it was such an important event in the wizarding world. Hand-made goods and food were so important in mending the only recently stitched schism in the world.</p><p>She, however, already knew how to cook. Draco didn’t have such an advantage. What made things worse still was that they didn’t expect to run into each other, fighting over the final bunch of bananas.</p><p>“Malfoy? What brings you here—?” She was cut off.</p><p>“Let go of my bananas, Granger.” He muttered.</p><p>His face was already red by the time she replied. “Well, no, Malfoy, I need these for the dinner tomorrow. Why don’t you just go buy some another time?”</p><p>He scoffed, his tone resembling the tension that they felt back in school, only a year and a half ago. “Well, Granger, it seems that you don’t really get it… I’m making something for the dinner as well, so… would you kindly--”</p><p>It was her turn to interrupt, “I don’t think so! I’m making a bananas custard pie, so…” She tugged at the bunch of bananas. Other witches and wizards in the market were beginning to notice their slight tussle.</p><p>“Granger, that’s fine and all, but I need ALL of these bananas for something called Banana pudding…” He nodded to the boxes of vanilla wafers in his cart. “Apparently a few folks coming from the Americas simply adore it…”</p><p>There was a stare-down, and before long, they had gathered a small, silent crowd.</p><p>They noticed this quickly, and both flushed, letting go of the bananas briskly.</p><p>“No, Granger—go ahead, you can have them.” He muttered, gripping the handles of his cart while thinking of where else he could possibly find bananas.</p><p>“No-no, Malfoy, you have at them. I’ll just think of a different fruit to use…” Her brow was furrowed with what she could possibly conjure up.</p><p>Both seemed keen on using this very muggle way to create something. The thought didn’t cross either of their minds to actually use magic to solve this problem. The pride there—it was far too strong.</p><p>“Granger… take the bananas.” He spoke through slightly gritted teeth.</p><p>It wasn’t long before their eyes actually met, and her own seared into his. It seemed that, no matter how the war ended—nor how the current state of affairs had turned them into allies—these two were intent on being at each other’s throats.</p><p>Some time passed before she began to reach for the bananas, finally caving under the pressure of the moment. In a quick movement, she snapped the bunch in half, taking only some of the bananas and setting them in her cart.</p><p>“There… problem solved.” She nodded smugly.</p><p>His hand hit his face, dragging down his matured, scarred, and devilish features. “That may be all good and well for you, Granger, but I need the entire bunch.”</p><p>Her face screwed up into a quizzical one. As her hand came up to her chin to consider their options, weigh the variables, and solve the problem, there was a loud bang from the front of the store.</p><p>People were running already, ducking and hiding from whatever caused the sound, and leaving groceries scattered about the place. In a flash, there was <em>fiendfyre </em>licking at the ceiling of the grocer, sending people fleeing out of fire exits toward the back.</p><p>Although the banana situation hadn’t been solved, the pair turned quickly to the front of the store, seeing the offending wizard. They looked like a young wizard, who was making a run for the ladders leading up to the roof access.</p><p>It didn’t take more than a second for Hermione to brandish her wand, catch sight of the wizard, and rush after him; but not before dousing the fires in the store with a gush of water.</p><p>Draco quickly reached out, trying to stop her from rushing into an obviously dangerous situation. Soon remembering who he was dealing with, he merely shook his head and rushed after her in hopes of talking her down from the ladder which she was already scaling.</p><p>On the roof, there was no sight of Hermione or the would-be pyromaniac.</p><p>He looked left, right, and around the corner before finding the two figures. They stood on the edge of the building, having a stare down.</p><p>The moment was tense. Hermione’s hair was standing a bit to attention, from the look of it, it was a visible manifestation of her magic. The set of her features was soft, and it dawned upon Draco that this situation was beyond a mere attack: she was talking this young wizard down.</p><p>She saw Draco from the corner of her eye, approaching the situation slowly, no wand in sight.</p><p>“What’s your name?” She asked the figure, clad in a large black cloak, similar to those found in a Halloween shop, but far too large for their form.</p><p>“Stop it, Hermione Granger…”</p><p>She frowned a bit, hoping that this kid wouldn’t have discovered who she was so quickly.</p><p>The teen went on: “Yea, I know who you are. You and Draco Malfoy think you’re so great… you don’t know what it’s like to be a teen in the wizarding world these days…”</p><p>The teen began to pace along the edge of the building’s ledge.</p><p>“So, there’s nothing we can say, right?” Draco offered, stepping to stand next to Hermione, but at such an angle that he could flee if an attack proved possible.</p><p>“…let me finish!” The teen shouted, hands balling into fists.</p><p>“You two… you’re not much older than me… but look at you… Acting like the world is normal and that you’re just allowed to grow up…” The teen paced some more, wand in hand.</p><p>Hermione and Draco exchanged glances, attempting to read each other’s reactions. Draco managed to glean from her with a bit of legilimancy: she wanted to save this teen. Of course, typical Gryffindor. He sneered at her slightly, turning away from her.</p><p>“What do you mean?” She asked, tucking her wand away slowly.</p><p>“Have you even SEEN what it’s like at Hogwarts now? It’s… so stupid! They don’t even use the Sorting Hat anymore since they want people to be able to make their own choices… As a show of like—some stupid thing!” The teen was failing with words, and paced more, embarrassedly.</p><p>“I heard about that…” Draco offered, hands tucking into his pockets as he stepped forward toward the ledge. “I think it’s important. Making choices like where you belong… It can change your life.” He offered, glancing briefly at Hermione, who was inching closer still.</p><p>“Yea? I’m sure you’d say so… everyone calls YOU a blood-traitor, you know!” The teen spat.</p><p>Draco shrugged.</p><p>“And you… Hermione Granger… You know what they call you?” The teen seethed, seemingly crying through the words.</p><p>Hermione and Draco both tensed at what was to come.</p><p>“They call you a ‘hero’… really? You’re the reason why I was dragged to Hogwarts! Nobody asked if I wanted to be a wizard! I was just… normal. And now I’m this!” The teen was exasperated.</p><p>“What do you mean I’m the reason…” Hermione trailed off, before realizing what was happening. “You mean, you were forced to begin schooling under the law I helped draft…”</p><p>The teen nodded, scoffing under the hood.</p><p>She looked at Draco, who squinted some, confused. She explained, “It was supposed to prevent muggle parents from holding their children back.”</p><p>“So, you’re… muggle-born?” She asked gently, tilting her head.</p><p>“And you don’t want to be a wizard?” Draco added.</p><p>The teen slumped, merely shaking his head.</p><p>“I never thought… Why don’t you want to be a wizard?” Hermione asked.</p><p>“I mean, it was fine at first… then this war started, and… I just hate it. I lost so many friends! I wish I had never come!”</p><p>The teen made a move, turning away from them as if to jump at any moment.</p><p>Hermione shuffled her feet closer, Draco slowly following suit, hesitant.</p><p>Why was he being a hero now… dragged into a stupid situation by Granger, of all people.</p><p>The wind was blowing against their backs, daring the teen toward demise.</p><p>“I guess it’s just… all so stupid…” The teen muttered.</p><p>“You’re right…” Draco suddenly spoke. The young wizard came to turn around some, slowly stepping off of the edge toward them. The tension settled slightly.</p><p>“I mean, plenty of unfortunate events took place, and I’ll admit, I was a big part of that.” Draco loosened his posture.</p><p>“And this bloody war, it should never have started in the first place. But really, the things you detest about Hogwarts now are all put in place to prevent that from happening again.” Draco went on.</p><p>Hermione found herself staring at Draco. He sounded so very… understanding. His features were even, soft, talking to the shorter wizard like a father to a child. She appreciated this, taking note that she should let him have the bunch of bananas after all of this was over.</p><p>“Yea… I know… I just worry that, what if I’m in the wrong house? What if I am making the wrong choices?” The panic in the boy’s voice was more child-like now, and he took some steps toward Draco and Hermione, when an awful creak was heard.</p><p>Something to do with the integrity of the structure of the building, having been compromised by the fire—the roof gave out beneath the teen’s feet.</p><p>As he began to fall, Hermione was the first to leap forward, grabbing the hands of boy, belly-flopping on the in-tact edge of the roof to hold on. She surely should have been falling with the boy, if it hadn’t been for the strong grip of Draco’s hands on her hips, holding them still.</p><p>The hood of the cloak fell back, revealing the face of a semi-familiar 5<sup>th</sup>-year student, thankful for the saving.</p>
