    <p>
  <span>Draco Malfoy, born into an all Slytherin family, with distant relations to the founder of said house, Salazar Slytherin. The colors green and silver adorn every holiday, while the sounds of softly moving water still echo through the Malfoy manor, as a reminder of the common room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His family is of all Pureblood, and while his path didn't deviate from his mother's or father's before him, as he too was sorted into Slytherin; it was the fact that his counterpart, as he join the ranks of the other students, clad in green and silver, was none other than Harry Potter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The lanky, awkward male, who knew no one else among the tables, sat, cheeks flush, due to their earlier encounter, beside Draco. Neither spoke for countless minutes as the rest of the first years were sorted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now, this was Draco’s third encounter with the Harry Potter. At first, when neither knew the other, they got on fine, Draco rambling on about the Magical world while Harry asked questions. But, the second wasn't as tame. Their second Draco was undermined, by as his father states, “blood traitors”, but now they sit in an uncomfortable silence. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At least until it seemed to bother Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm sorry about before. I shouldn't have been so rude.” Draco paused, although it wasn't as he was doing anything beforehand anyways. He shook his head with confusion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You weren't rude. At least not by my standards, besides, you're Harry Potter, I had expected you to know about the magical world.” And Draco was poorly mistaken. Perhaps he had forgotten Harry was orphaned, yet, it wasn't that. He'd assumed that the Harry Potter was placed into a magical home; fantasies of Harry being raised by Dumbledore himself played back in Draco's mind, before he cringed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I-uh. Thanks?” Harry answered, seemingly unsure. It was all very amusing, and curious to Draco. He didn't think Harry be this, anti-social.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>No.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Shy.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“You're welcome.” Draco responded, out of habit, before glancing down at the tableware in front of them. Gold, probably only lined, goblets and platters covered the large tables. The pale male didn't register as the Headmaster spoke, his parents reciting too often what the opening speech was, for Draco to even have a need to listen. “When will we eat? It's been hours.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It hadn't, yet Harry seemed too eager to agree, his head nodding in earnest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco admired the male with a hard lingering intrigue. Something seemed off about The Boy Who Lived. He was too humble for Draco's liking. If he was in Harry's shoes he'd never stop boasting. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>He would.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>But, even if Harry didn't know why he was, he's still famous, probably rich too. Which is something to brag of, right?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Draco lost himself in thought, the plates began to fill, after Dumbledore clapped, concluding his speech. The sounds of conversation broke him of his questions, and he glanced at Harry once more. The male seemed awestruck by the sight of food. Draco furrowed his brows, collectively adding to his plate, only grabbing what he knew he'd eat, while watching as the raven beside him dig into his food. He looked like a starved animal. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And while Draco knew it was very rude to ask, his mother's scolding already memorized, he couldn't help but question. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do the muggles not feed you? Or does your stomach have no end?” The last bit was meant to hopely downplay the seriousness of the first question. But Harry only shrugged in response. Answering verbally, mouth still full, making Draco smirk, amused. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm just not used to so much food.” It was then Harry realized his actions, and calmed his movement, reaching for his water filled goblet to wash down the scarfing of food. “Sorry.” He said once more. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And it was beginning to irk Draco, the apologies. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don't need to apologize for everything you do.” Harry's eyes widened. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh.” He seemed to want to say more, probably apologize for apologizing, but stopped himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco didn't press the matter, although he wanted to. Instead, he ate, keeping a calm silence between two. And every so often, he'd glance at Harry, who'd returned to eating too, still hurriedly, as though someone would steal it from him if he didn't eat it quickly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was only when they were called by the Prefects to follow them to the common room did they talk again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We're one of the luckier houses with the common room.” Draco stated, as they group of Slytherins was guided from the Great Hall. Harry tilted his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why's that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Unlike the Ravenclaws or Gryffindors, who both have to tower up seven flights of stairs, our commons is in the dungeons. Only one set of stairs to deal with.” Draco smirked, but it was quickly wiped from his face as Harry shivered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The dungeons?” He asked, footsteps slowing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It's not as bad as it sounds.” Draco reassured, falling back into step with his counterpart. It wasn't bad, if his parent's recollections were anything to go off of. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>They were right</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>While Harry was skeptical, once they entered Draco whispered an ‘'I told you so”, before looking around himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The room, while it was carved from stone, had green colored marble bricks lining the walls. The center dipped into the floor, surrounded by chairs and pillows. A large decorative fireplace, carved with a large snake as it's centerpiece, opened with a green flame.  Two large windows sat side to the fireplace, reinforced with black metal decor, looked out into the underwater of the black lake; black masses could be seen as they sawm past. On the other side were two hallways, pictures lined their walls, alongside doors. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Girls on the left hall, and boys on the right. All your luggage has been brought to your respective rooms.” The Perfect spoke, tearing both Draco and Harry from the rooms entrance, created by the crackling fire and soft water waves. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their eyes met momentarily, before they started off down the right hall. Upon entering their room, they were hit with candle light. Still bewitched to color green, it was a soft contrast to the silver bedding. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right.” Harry said, sitting on the bed his trunk was on. Draco found his own alongside a divot in the wall, which had more pillows and candles laid inside it, a reading nook. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Cozy.” Draco chuckled, laying down on the soft silk sheets of his bed, the coolness a welcome feeling, which made him realize that the dungeon had a warming spell cast over it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They weren't they only ones in the room, as another bed took up the rest of the space. To whom it was for, they didn't know yet. Another door was attached to their room, their shared bathroom. Draco, always curious about the state of the restroom he had, stood and instantly entered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unlike the rest of the Slytherin common room, the bathroom was pure white marble, cracks molded back in with silver and black. There was three showers, each blocked with a wall, the top half being glass. On each wall was two shelves. And an individual sink. On the other side was a wall completely made of mirrors. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Satisfied, Draco left the bathroom, only to see a sleeping Harry. He was sprawled out his bed, trunk carelessly kicked to the floor. With a sigh, rolling his eyes, Draco closed the soft grey feathered curtains dividing their beds, before laying back down in his own. Closing the divider, he let out a long breath, before closing his eyes.</span>
