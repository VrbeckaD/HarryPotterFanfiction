    <p dir="ltr">Snow scattered across Scotland in thick layers, it was the deepest Albus had ever seen before, almost two feet of snow! But with the help of magic and Hagrid, Hogsmeade and Hogwarts were soon ridden of any real risk the snow could pose.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">It was the start of the new year, Albus needed a breath of fresh air before the children began flooding his halls again. A drink, perhaps. He certainly earned one. He pushed aside the worry of how Tom would react if he found Albus drinking without him and carried on the slush-mud mix of a pathway to the three broomsticks.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">The fire of whiskey burnt his throat when he downed the second shot. The company of Minerva kept him from going too crazy, and he thanked her for that mentally.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">"I best be heading off, Minerva," Albus purred to his second in command, lips pulled in a smile, "Wouldn't want Tom worrying about me now. I'll see you later, I suppose. Goodnight." Albus picked himself up, silently casting a spell to hide any boozy smell on his breath and headed towards the old pub's door but he stopped in his tracks as Minerva said her goodbyes.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">"May not be my place to say this as a colleague, Albus, but as a friend, I'll tell you right now that boy doesn't treat you bloody right!" The fiery woman warned eyes narrowed at her headmaster, not in a threatening manner but more in the way a lioness would protect her young. It made Albus smile.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">"I appreciate the concern but its not needed, thank you," Albus called back to her and disappeared through the doors, slipping past a few drunken Aurors.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">The sky was black, the stars shone bright and the moon was full. The bitter cold bit harshly at the tip of Albus' nose, turning it the same shade of red as the locks that fell from his head and stubble that covered his lower face. The pathway back to the castle became dangerous as the slush turned to ice, but a simple charm on the bottom of his winter boots saved him the fear of falling.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">A few shortcuts down the back of alleyways and back streets left Albus a few feet away from the train station when the sound of a child's cry pierced through the silence of the winters night. Albus stopped dead in his tracks and listened. Again, the baby cried, causing the young headmaster to flinch at the noise. He followed the sound as cries turned into desperate screams. A swift, quiet spell revealed the sound was coming from a nearby cardboard box.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">"Lumos," Albus whispered, shining the soft blue light to reveal what was causing such a distressing noise.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">A tiny child was laid in the box. Pale, white, almost blue-ish skin. A few tiny, coal black curls sprouted from the tiny child's head, matching black eyes gazed widely at Albus. For a moment, the child was silent, watching Albus with a wild stare.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Albus' heart launched in his chest when he saw the little boy. He didn't hesitate to scoop the child up and wrap him in his charmed robes.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">The screaming paused as he bathed in the warm of Albus' body. His small, tinted blue cheeks were stained with tears. Tiny, shivering hands grabbed instinctively on Albus's clothing, gripping for life, terrified that he'd be put down again and left to die.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">The wizard and child fled to the castle, no time to waste, Albus refused to let the tiny newborn die under his watch; not tonight, not any night.</p>
