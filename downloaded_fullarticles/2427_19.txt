  <strong>Grehan Hall, Waterhall Park, Bedfordshire - just off the A4146</strong>
</h3><h3>
  <strong>14th October 2000</strong>
</h3><p align="left">Climbing the stone steps towards the historical building, Hermione muttered feverishly as she tried to hold her bag, calm her hair, and save herself from being strangled by her own scarf.</p><p align="left">“Of course I’ll help, Pansy. No bloody problem, Pansy. Why the f—”</p><p align="left">“Darling! You’re here!” Pansy gushed as she tottered towards the opening door in high heels — or miniature stilts. A house-elf, wearing a lime green three-piece suit, was already bowing low to The-Girl-Who-Can’t-Knit — Hermione’s hats and scarves were legendary amongst the Hogwarts house-elves who used to line the baby mandrakes’ crates with the tatty lumps of wool.</p><p align="left">But don’t tell her, okay?</p><p align="left">“Just about,” Hermione replied, bracing herself for her friend’s infamous double-cheeked — and lipstick-staining — <em> mwah </em>. Not only was the former Slytherin a famous fashion designer these days, she was also the epitome of pure-blood society… on the outside. To the public at large, Pansy Parkinson looked as sharp as her fringe; she practically oozed upper-class breeding, whether in sleek designer dresses — usually daring creations by her Muggle colleague, Victoria B. — or her favourite extra skinny jeans and killer heels. She demanded attention with every blister-inducing step, and never failed to get it.</p><p align="left">Behind closed doors, however, <em> Pans </em> could slum it with the best of them — and usually did.</p><p align="left">For the past year or so, Friday evenings were spent at Hermione’s London flat in pyjamas, surrounded by trashy magazines, DVDs, takeaway cartons, and wine bottles. The tradition had started with Ginny and Luna but, as time went by and tentative friendships blossomed — some into lasting romances — the trio welcomed Daphne and Pansy.</p><p align="left">On the other side of the country, in a manor the size of Ikea, Draco hosted the male version of Hermione’s pyjama party, only <em> he </em> insisted on full wizarding attire. Quidditch, billiards, Texas Hold’em, and a full seven-course meal prepared by Michelin star house-elves — it’s a long story — were a far cry from the girls’ more relaxed evenings, but enjoyed just as much by the Malfoy heir, Harry, Neville, Theo, and Blaise.</p><p align="left">As a favour to Pansy, who wanted ‘the gang’ to help promote her new collection for Draco’s Quidditch team — the Leighton Buzzards — they all gathered at Grehan Hall to pose dramatically and smile for the camera. Hermione was the last to arrive, receiving the usual jeers from her friends who were well used to her notorious tardiness.</p><p align="left">“Haven’t you ever heard of being <em> on time </em>, Granger?” Draco complained, crossing his arms. “Being first here—”</p><p align="left">“‘Punctuality is the virtue of the bored’, Malfoy,” she retorted, dropping her bag with a thud. No one asked; the last time someone enquired about what Hermione was carrying in her tiny beaded coffer, she’d hauled out an entire three-piece suite, her extensive collection of Arklow pottery, a cross trainer, and her E-Reader — which she vehemently refused to let anyone hold, for fear they’d go through her reading list.</p><p align="left">(Of course, <em> we </em> understand E doesn’t necessarily mean ‘electronic’. But Hermione’s friends didn’t need to know that, right?)</p><p align="left">Hugs, kisses, and a brief nod — no guesses from whom — were exchanged with the rest of the former school friends/enemies (delete as appropriate). Theo, Blaise, and Neville were all drinking what looked like black coffee but you just wouldn’t know with Pansy — her love of Marmite was legendary.</p><p align="left">“Enough, children!” Pansy clapped her hands, marching towards them all with an entourage of assistants behind her, a line of suit carriers, garment bags, shoe boxes, and totes floating behind the last clone. “Now, Araminta, Octavia, Iolanthe… will you organise the outfits and accessories per model? Great! Henrietta, Persephone, and… eh… Joan, you can begin make-up, okay? Fab! Thank you, darlings! I’d be lost without my favourite witches, wouldn’t !?”</p><p align="left">Eyebrows were raised around the room as Araminta, Octavia, Iolanthe, Henrietta, Persephone, and Joan tottered off on equally high heels, gathering up the items for each model. It was difficult to tell the witches apart; each had ramrod straight hair in varying shades of dyed blonde — buttery, beige, summer, honey, strawberry, and... dirty. Their pale make-up was also similar, like vampire chic — anaemic, spectral, mozzarella, Malfoy, Michael Jackson (the latter years), and I-Can’t-Believe-I’m-Not-Dead (oh, wait…).</p><p align="left">They’d obviously shared the one jet-black eyeliner and Communist-red lipstick as well.</p><p align="left">Their outfits consisted of pencil-thin dresses with high collars and bracelet sleeves in charcoal grey — the style so tight against their waif-like bodies, the witches could only move their wandlike legs from the knees down. Small patch pockets, sewn over their non-existent left breasts, also bore the logo of Pansy’s fashion house, <em> Pantastico. </em></p><p align="left">The house-elves looked better… and healthier! Julian, Dick, Anne, Georgina, and Timmy were decked out in ebony tea towels with elaborate frills along the bottom. Their pockets also displayed Pansy’s logo — over slightly bigger moobs and boobs.</p><p align="left">They were on set to arrange props and backdrops for the photographer, a wizard of robust proportions with a wheat-coloured comb-over — that began just above his left ear — and a penchant for gold chains. Pansy <em> mwah </em>-ed him enthusiastically upon his arrival, lovingly calling him, ‘Barry, darling’.</p><p align="left">“Swee-tee,” Barry-darling cooed, pawing Pansy’s arse playfully as he hungrily eyed her from the breasts down, “how about those cocktails afterwards? You’re always putting me off, babes. A guy will only wait so long, you know.”</p><p align="left">“He looks old enough to be her grandfather,” Ginny whispered to Daphne while wands were waved around them with gusto, “and when did velour come into fashion?”</p><p align="left">“I don’t think it ever did,” Daphne replied through the thick layer of Jammy Dodger Red that landed on her lips, “especially not in that shade of magenta.”</p><p align="left">They watched Pansy sidestep Barry with practised ease and wave more instructions at her assistants. By now the two of them, along with Luna, were styled in surprisingly suitable tones that highlighted their features, with uncomplicated hairstyles to match the outfits they’d be modelling.</p><p align="left">Ginny and Daphne were handed the women’s home and away kits respectively in the Buzzards’ colours of black and khaki. Luna was already wearing the supporters’ jersey for the coming season in the same colours, with <em> Malfoy </em> emblazoned across the back in a dull mushroom colour and khaki cargo shorts to match. She also had a baseball cap, tote bag, and travel mug to carry for different shots. She insisted on remaining barefoot; something about Nargles.</p><p align="left">Nobody listened.</p><p align="left">While all of this was going on, Hermione was being plucked, powdered, and painted with rapid precision behind a screen. Her lateness resulted in the last outfit for the women being left for her — a short khaki safari dress with the Buzzards’ logo embroidered onto the collar, a wide black leather belt, and cream push-up bra. Pansy insisted the buttons on the dress remain wide open at the top — “to make you look like you actually have tits, darling!” — and high up the leg as well — “well, at least you’ve got decent pins.”</p><p align="left">That quote landed Hermione with a pair of black wedges that really did accentuate her long, tanned legs — with the aid of quite a few cushioning and balancing charms.</p><p align="left">Meanwhile, over in the boys’ corner…</p><p align="left">“Uh huh, fascinating, Octavia. And what shade <em> do </em> you think would match my natural skin tone?” Theo was finding the make-up session a little <em> too </em> interesting.</p><p align="left">“<em> Virgin </em> hair? How did you know… <em> oh </em>…” TMI there, Neville. Bless him.</p><p align="left">“<em> Bella </em> , why don’t you let me show you what <em> I’m </em> concealing?” You can understand why Blaise is single, right?</p><p align="left">“Don’t you fucking dare attack me with… with… that mini broomstick! What do you mean blusher? Do I look like I’m fucking blushing, you blind twat!” No, there’s no prizes for guessing this one.</p><p align="left">Overhearing that last comment, Pansy sighed loudly. It was going to be a long day.</p><p align="left">Another hour of prepping and dressing passed before everyone was ready for Barry to start clicking away. Pansy had Theo and Neville dress in the team colours to match Ginny and Daphne, the four of them taking to charmed broomsticks, posing in front of a modified Ventus Jinx in order to simulate flying conditions.</p><p align="left">Luna sat on a large plush couch sipping Marmachino and flicking through a coffee table book of Barry-darling’s best pics, waiting for her turn to pose. Blaise lounged beside her in black silk boxers — the team’s logo strategically positioned. He was going to model the new Leighton Buzzards’ homewares collection, so Pansy planned to sprawl him across a duvet and throw shapes behind a shower curtain. Needless to say, he was in sexuality heaven.</p><p align="left">It was all relaxed and casual, until…</p><p align="left">“WHAT. THE. FUCK. AM I FUCKING WEARING?”</p><p align="left">Henrietta came running out from behind a screen, as fast as her legs could carry her — from the knees down. It <em> might </em> be possible to say she was as white as a sheet, but how could you tell really?</p><p align="left">“Pansy,” she breathed, “I-I…”</p><p align="left">Her boss placed a well manicured hand on Henrietta’s shaking bone of an arm. “Don’t worry, darling,” Pansy shushed her. “I’ll deal with him. Go get yourself a Marmiatto and take five.”</p><p align="left">Ever so calmly, Pansy walked over to the screen and pulled it back, revealing a livid Draco Malfoy.</p><p align="left"><em> "You,” </em>she started before he could utter a word, “will not ruin this for me! I turned down the chance to work with Donatella to do this fucking photo shoot today, nevermind the hours spent designing fucking amazing outfits for your fucking… toy! So, Draco I’m-So-Spoiled-Daddy-Bought-Me-A-Quidditch-Team Malfoy, you will walk out there, stand in front of that fucking camera, and FUCKING SMILE!”</p><p align="left">Witches and wizards, Miss Pansy Parkinson. Slytherin.</p><p align="left">Scary as fuck.</p><p align="left">And fabulous.</p><p align="left">All heads — wizard, witch, and elf — turned to watch Draco shuffle forward in a pair of shoes twice the length of his feet.</p><p align="left">“Poulaines, Pans? We’re not in the thirteenth fucking century!” He spat furiously</p><p align="left">“They’re called <em> winklepickers </em> , Draco,” Pansy corrected him with a wave of her hand. “Famous since the fifties in Muggle Britain. <em> I’m </em> bringing them into wizarding fashion. Even your father will be wearing them in the coming months. So stand there, shut up, and smile for the fucking camera.”</p><p align="left">She turned on her super high heel and recited a list of instructions to Barry-darling about what she wanted — Draco looking left, Draco looking right, Draco looking pensive, Draco pointing this way, Draco scratching his arse, Draco with each of the friends in turn, and finally, Draco with Hermione.</p><p align="left"><em> Draco </em> fumed silently as Barry-darling changed lenses and tweaked camera angles. He looked quite fashionable from the neck down to the shins, to be honest. His black silk shirt highlighted his trademark pale skin, along with a bomber jacket and slim trousers in the team colours. Beneath the three-quarter length trousers, however, were cream socks covered in golden snitches and tweed-patterned shoes that reached out in front of him like tree branches. He closed his eyes and silently wished for death.</p><p align="left">He remained that way until a hand gently brushed along his shoulder.</p><p align="left">“You could do with some fresh air.” That soothing voice brought him back to reality. “Come on.”</p><p align="left">Draco didn’t reply, but he followed Hermione as best he could, shuffling across the floor.</p><p align="left">“Can you give us ten minutes, Pans?” Hermione asked She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed, <em> Accio- </em>ing her coat and scarf as she passed her friend.</p><p align="left">“Sure,” the other witch sighed, “Try to get him to smile, will you?”</p><p align="left">“I’ll do my best but I’m not promising anything,” Hermione quipped, ignoring Draco’s glare.</p><p align="left">The laughing just got louder as he moved past everyone else, gliding over the tiled floor like a cross-country skier. Even Henrietta joined in, eventually, from a distance.</p><p align="left">The pair made their way out onto a large balcony overlooking Grehan Hall’s lush gardens. Without speaking, Draco waved himself up into the air and sat heavily onto the stone balustrade.</p><p align="left">“Why didn’t you laugh with the rest of them?” He muttered, watching Hermione’s hair billow out behind her in the strong breeze. It was a beautiful shade of mixed Autumn colours, he noted.</p><p align="left">“Why would I?” She asked, leaning on the balustrade and casually waving her wand. An aria of bright yellow canaries fluttered around their heads, tweeting a familiar melody as she continued. “It’s just a bit of fun, Draco. You shouldn’t take life so seriously.”</p><p align="left">“Pansy’s made me look ridiculous,” he moaned, “and I’m not spoiled… that much.”</p><p align="left">“Draco,” Hermione stood up, turning to him. “Your father bought you a Quidditch team; you’ve never worked a day in your life. You live the life of a rake — all fashion and women. What do you expect?”</p><p align="left">“There are no women!” He almost fell over, reaching out and grabbing her hand to steady himself. “What the fuck makes you think there are women?”</p><p align="left">“<em> Witch Weekly, the Daily Prophet, Spella Weekly, Which Wizard… Knitter’s Own… </em>” she trailed off.</p><p align="left">“You… you believe them? Seriously, Granger! What the fuck—”</p><p align="left">“Pictures speak for themselves,” she replied, watching the canaries fly in formation above Draco’s head, trying not to stare down at the hand that still held hers. The tiny birds had spelled out L, then O, and were currently flying into a V.</p><p align="left">Draco sighed, reaching out to wave his free hand in front of Hermione’s face to get her attention. The birds were just finishing the E.</p><p align="left">“Any woman I’m pictured with is either an employee of Malfoy Industries or one of the Buzzards’ administration team,” he explained. “I don’t want… there’s just one woman <em> I </em>want to date, I just haven’t plucked up the courage to ask her out yet. And any time I try to say something, she has some smart retort that puts me straight back in my very spoiled place.”</p><p align="left">“She sounds like she’s well able for you,” Hermione smiled, her heart slowly flaking into pieces. It wasn’t until she actually heard him admit he liked someone that she began to realise just how interested she was in Draco Malfoy.</p><p align="left">“Yeah, she even quoted Evelyn Waugh to me earlier today when I complained about her being late. <em> And </em> I was only early because I wanted to make sure our friends knew I planned to ask her out, and hope to fuck she’d agree to date me.”</p><p align="left">The canaries were now flying in the shape of a love heart, tweeting to the tune of Marvin Gaye’s ‘Let’s Get It On’.</p><p align="left">Draco looked down at their joined hands. “Well, Hermione Granger, what do you say? Will you have dinner with me?”</p><p align="center">
