    <p>Harry was smitten. Incredibly smitten. It was a bit pathetic really.</p><p>He closed his eyes and heard Hermione’s voice in his head. <i>No, don’t think negatively about yourself! <u>You</u> should be your biggest champion!</i> He snorted. Oh, Hermione.</p><p>The problem was that he was doing something that made him feel a bit (a lot) foolish. He’d bought Draco Christmas gifts. Multiple. More than a few.</p><p>Okay, he’d bought Draco twenty five Christmas gifts. It’d seemed like a good idea in the shop, but now, with all of them wrapped up in front of him, it made him feel like a twat. It made him look . . . <i>desperate.</i></p><p>He flinched. He <i>was</i> desperate. Very, very, mind-numbingly desperate. He wanted Draco so much that he couldn’t fucking <i>breathe</i>.</p><p>It hadn’t always been like this. Only a few years ago Harry’d thought he was straight. But about five . . . no seven, no <i>eight</i> years ago he realized that he was attracted to men. Back then, he still thought he would be an Auror and married to Gin. He would’ve never expected to end up teaching at Hogwarts and pining after Draco fucking Malfoy.</p><p>He sighed and spelled the twenty five gifts into the advent calendar that was shaped like a house. He was not crafty, so the house was a bit lopsided, the roof slowly ungluing at the top. He’d spelled the wood red and green, and had little painted Christmas trees dance on the sides. The house contained holes for the gifts and, with all of them in place, it looked a bit . . . much.</p><p>Oh, well. No going back now.</p><p>“You won’t <i>believe</i> what Macaroni did in class!” Draco said from the doorway.</p><p>Harry startled. “Christ—knock or something!”</p><p>Draco smirked, and looked entirely too pleased. Of course he immediately noticed the calendar. “What the hell is that?”</p><p>“Oh, um—”</p><p>“Another one of Mrs Weasley’s barmy ideas, I suppose?”</p><p>Harry flushed. “Actually, it’s for you.”</p><p>“She got me presents?” He was beaming. He plucked out the first gift and stared at it. “I never thought she . . . cared.” His voice was very soft.</p><p>Oh, hell.</p><p>“No, it’s not from her,” Harry said, his heart hammering. “It’s from me.”</p><p>Draco gaped at him. “What?”</p><p>“I bought you twenty five gifts . . . one to open up each day until Christmas. Then of course the last one is your main Christmas gift.”</p><p>“<i>What?</i>”</p><p>Harry sat down in a chair, waiting for Draco to process it all. Draco wandered to the opposite chair, still holding the first gift. He looked stunned.</p><p>“I could make tea,” Harry said, not really knowing how to help.</p><p>“No . . . don’t bother.” Draco rotated the gift in his hands. His cheeks were a little pink. “I had no idea . . .”</p><p>Harry winced. He looked away. He just wanted to throw himself on Draco, kiss him deeply, <i>devour him</i>, but he was scared. So, so scared. He didn’t know what he’d do if Draco rejected him.</p><p>“Take that one with you and open it tomorrow on December first,” Harry said softly.</p><p>Draco looked at him, and his eyes were unreadable. “I will.”</p><p>“So, what did Milani do again?”</p><p>“<i>Macaroni</i> blew up his cauldron again! AGAIN!”</p><p>Harry tried to hide his smile. “That’s it. Off with his head. Hang him from his toenails.”</p><p>“<i>Yes.</i> I’m glad you understand.” Draco smirked. He got to his feet. “My next class starts in ten minutes. Must dash.” He hesitated near the door almost shyly. “Thanks for . . . thinking of me.”</p><p>“Of course. All the time.” Harry coughed. “I mean anytime. You can come to me anytime for help.”</p><p>Draco laughed.</p>
