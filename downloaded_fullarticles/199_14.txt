    <p>          2 May 1998</p><p>          To Hermione Granger the Second Wizarding War was over.</p><p>          As she looked around The Great Hall, all she could see was the fallen under the white sheets Madam Pomfrey had conjured. Hermione wondered who had collected Snape from the shrieking shack, moments from death. Months before she had been lucky enough to collect a drop of Nagini’s venom to create the serum to protect against the viper. Voldemort thought he was being clever when the snake attacked them over the Christmas holiday, but she wasn’t called the smartest witch of their age for no reason. She had used it as an opportunity. While Harry and Ron ran away with the memories, Hermione had stayed behind to keep the potions master breathing.</p><p>          There was something that needed to be done and she knew it. The Weasley’s were mourning over the loss of the twins in the far corner of the hall. She couldn’t let herself feel the loss of them. Not yet. Months on the run with Harry and Ron had her listening to their voices every night on the Wizarding Wireless. When the time came to it she would mourn for the two pranksters more than anyone else. They were the only people who could get her out of her shell when she needed it, whether she knew it or not.</p><p>          A witch with a pig nose, whose belly was near to term laid next to the werewolf on the other side of the hall. Everyone was giving them a wide berth, but Hermione needed to say goodbye to her favorite professor and his wife. She walked to where their bodies were, it seems that no one thought to close their eyes. All she could see were emotionless orbs. There was no more kindness here. There would be no new family with them in the next month as expected. There would be no more hot chocolate at midnight in Grimmauld Place.</p><p>          Another body caught her attention, and while Hermione thought to herself, ‘Oh, how I loathed the Brown girl, but I didn’t wish death on anyone. Not this type of death anyways.’ Lavender hadn’t been lucky enough to see the green light for her death. No, some death eater had pulled her away and used a muggle knife to butcher her. There was no way that she would let them get away with this. Not even death could stop her from getting her revenge.</p><p>         There was too much sadness in this place. She could feel it in my chest. It was pressing in on her, making it hard to breathe. She couldn’t handle it. I need to get away from all this blackness, Hermione’s heart began racing. How was she going to make it out of this alive? There was no one left.</p><p>          Harry, it seems, had proposed the moment the Dark Lord had fallen. Ginny was cradling her left hand waiting to show her mother the good news. It would have been good news if the twins were here to see them. This didn’t feel like the right time anymore. Why start that journey now? Why begin their next step here, at this moment?</p><p>          McGonagall was calling attention to herself at the head table as Hermione snuck into a passageway to give those mourning more time with their fallen loved ones. ‘I must do something. There are so many people are supposed to be alive today that didn’t make it. What am I to do? Lord Voldemort had fallen, but at what cost? All I need is more time,’ Hermione thought.</p><p>          Hermione let her feet take her where she needed to go, eventually coming to a stop. She was looking out a window. Below her, she could see the forest trying to right itself. There was death on its soil. Nothing outside was moving. Almost as if even the smallest bug were to breathe the wrong way it would break beneath the weight.</p><p>          The way here didn’t feel familiar, but the view did. Hermione was in the West tower. Flitwick’s office to be precise, on the seventh floor. If she tucked her head outside, she’d be the thirteenth window from the right. All she needed was <em>more</em> time. More time. If all went well, she could save more than one innocent life today.</p><p>          “I have to find my beaded bag,” she muttered to herself. Years ago, she had no idea why she had given back an exact copy of the time turner instead of the actual device, but now that was coming in handy. I must leave a note for the others, so they know not to come looking for me. Who knows if they’ll even remember me? Hermione pulls out a roll of parchment and a quill.</p><p>
  <em>                    Dear Harry and Ron,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>          I thank you for letting me help you save the world. But it is all too much for me. I am leaving today, and I don’t know if I will ever be back. I wish you both the best in life. Harry congratulations on your life with Ginny. And Ron you can handle whatever the future throws at you. Please don’t come looking for me. This is what I want. I want to just disappear. I don’t need all the fame and glory. Just let me fade away please.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>                    I love you both, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>                    Hermione.</em>
</p><p>She needed more parchment</p><p>
  <em>          Horcruxes </em>
</p><p>
  <em>               1. Tom Riddles Diary. Given to Ginny. Malfoy possession? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>               2. Marvolo Gaunt’s Ring. Dumbledore destroys </em>
</p><p>
  <em>               3. Salazar Slytherin’s Locket. Hidden in the cave. Must find before R.A.B. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>               4. Helga Hufflepuff’s cup. Stole from Gringotts in the Black Vault</em>
</p><p>
  <em>               5. Rowena Ravenclaw’s Diadem. In the Room of Requirment </em>
</p><p>
  <em>               6. Harry </em>
</p><p>
  <em>               7. Nagini Prevent Harry from becoming a Horcruxe, Keep the Basilisk Fang with you. It can destroy them. </em>
</p><p>          One last thing from her beaded bag, a de-aging potion. She needed to look like a first-year again. If this plan was going to work, she needed to be eleven. Popping the stopper, Hermione measured out the correct dosage and swallowed the pale-yellow potion. A bright light surrounded her and when it faded, she was several centimeters shorter.</p><p>          Hermione Granger was going back to 1971. She laid the necklace of the time turner around her shoulders. Huffing to herself, she started to turn the dials back. Flipping the sand around and around. ‘I’m ready. I can do this. I am going to make this better.’ Deep breath in, and she lets the sands fly.</p><p dir="ltr">          It takes longer than normal to land where she was originally standing. Which makes sense. She didn’t go back mere hours. She went back decades. She was still standing in the Charm Professor’s office, yet Flitwick wasn’t there at all. There in front of her stood a young James Potter.</p>
