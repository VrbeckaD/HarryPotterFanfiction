<p>Angels and Demons</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Draco inspects his reflection. The expression in his red eyes is…haunted. Baring his pointed teeth, he grins. “Perfect,” he murmurs, turning away. </p>
<p>Exiting the bathroom, he poses. “What do you think?” </p>
<p>Harry, already dressed, looks up. “Bloody hell! You make a scarily convincing demon.” </p>
<p>Smirking, Draco stalks towards him. </p>
<p>Laughing, Harry backs up until he hits the wall. “Begone, demon,” he says. “Lest I smite you.”</p>
<p>“Too late,” Draco growls, pressing against him. “You’re in my clutches now, <i>angel</i>.” </p>
<p>Harry’s grin widens. “Or you’re in mine.” His wings enfold Draco. “Shall I take you to heaven?”</p>
<p>“You can try.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Fuck!” Draco cries as Harry sucks his cock, tonguing his slit. When Harry’s slick finger presses inside him, it’s too much. Draco shudders and comes, Harry swallowing every drop. </p>
<p>Shifting, Harry spreads Draco’s legs, pressing inside him. Draco shouts, arching up.</p>
<p>Harry fucks him steadily, wings fully outstretched as he moves in and out, and soon, Draco’s hard again, trembling, coming. Harry comes moments later.</p>
<p>They kiss, Draco moaning around Harry’s tongue. His forked tail glides between Harry’s legs, caressing his balls. “Keep the tail,” Harry gasps.</p>
<p>“If you’ll keep the wings.” </p>
<p>“Deal.” Harry sighs. “Right. Haunted house time?”</p>
<p>“Apparently.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Angel and demon?” Pansy sniffs when they arrive. “You’re supposed to wear <i>costumes</i>, not regular role-play outfits.” </p>
<p>“You’re hilarious.” Draco sneers. </p>
<p>Harry coughs. “Why celebrate Halloween in an actual haunted house?” </p>
<p>“It’s Blaise’s idea.” Pansy sips her martini. “So annoying. The ghosts keeps tipping over the buffet table.” </p>
<p>“The food’s been on the floor?” Harry makes a face. “I wasn’t hungry anyway.” He winks. “Plus, I’ve had my fill of sausage today already.” </p>
<p>Pansy huffs. “You’re two are disgusting. Love, <i>ugh</i>.” </p>
<p>“Are we?” asks Harry once she stalks off. </p>
<p>“Absolutely.” Draco smirks. “And I wouldn’t have it any other way.” </p>
