    <p>The Hogwarts Express had pulled up to Platform 9 ¾ , and Harry hadn’t yet taken the time to look around at the swarm of faces around him, used to it as he was to ignore the stares from crowds. He instead focused on Ron and Hermione at his sides, making idle conversation about what to expect from the upcoming school year (a conversation they had often had over the last four months following the Battle of Hogwarts), which was somehow turning into an argument over the fact that although they both had been prefects, neither Ron nor Hermione were selected as Head Boy or Head Girl in their eighth year. Ron seemed to be rather insulted by this snub, even though it had clearly not occurred to him that he could even have <em>been </em>Head Boy before this final go at the conversation, while Hermione was arguing that Headmistress McGonagall had likely (rightly) thought that they’d had enough responsibility on their shoulders over the course of the war and the years leading up to it, and that they might actually <em>like</em> the chance to be regular students for once.</p><p>“-and honestly, Ron, if you really think about it, the Head Boy and Girl are usually positions given to seventh years, and we not only missed our seventh year <em> entirely, </em>we’re technically eighth years now. It would have been awfully unfair for the seventh years if McGonagall just took that away from them, after all of this.”</p><p>“Yeah, I guess that's a good point. I always <em>did</em> reckon you were clever enough to skip a year anyway,” said Ron, having done a complete one-eighty from his previous indignation to that soppy puppy-love romantic expression Harry had gotten all too used to seeing on both of his friends’ faces. Hermione’s cheeks turned a light pink, and her bossy expression softened to one of deep affection. Harry finally turned away.</p><p>“Well Hermione might be, but I’ve got a feeling I’ll be rubbish at everything except DADA this year. Feels like I haven’t had the chance to do much more than defence in ages.” Harry hid the truth of his nervous statement with a crooked grin. He really hadn’t been so nervous about going to Hogwarts since he’d been a tiny first year, barely believing that he was a wizard at all.</p><p>“Oh come off it Harry, I’m sure you’ll do fine. We’ve got Hermione to help us study after all,” said Ron, a careless arm draped around Hermione’s shoulders. Her face was still rather pink and fond, but that didn’t stop her from rolling her eyes at them.<br/>
</p><p>“More like there to copy homework off of. Don’t worry though Harry, I’m sure that after everything we’ve gone through, a final year at Hogwarts will be nothing to worry about. Although we <em> will </em>be taking our NEWTs this year…  I just wish I’d gotten a chance to finish reading the course materials over the summer.”</p><p>Now it was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes.</p><p>“Hermione, only <em> you </em>would consider reading all of the textbooks from cover to cover before the year has begun appropriate summer reading. Beside, I heard enough from my room at Grimmauld Place to know that whatever it was that kept you two too busy to be reading all summer, it wasn’t any hardship at all.”</p><p>Hermione flushed a dark red at that, with Ron just as red if not more so beside her. Both still managed to look rather pleased with themselves despite their obvious embarrassment.</p><p>“Well we- we should get on the train before it leaves without us and the whole thing is moot. Come along, boys!” and with that she was scurrying off onto the train, her trunk floating along weightlessly behind her. Ron turned to look at Harry, still rather red in the face as he shrugged and grinned, and went after her. Harry smiled at them both and went to climb onto the Hogwarts Express himself. With one foot on the platform and one foot on the bright red step of the train, he turned around to look at the station.</p><p>It might be the last time he ever took off from Platform 9 ¾ . He took in the sight of all the families milling about: parents nervously wringing their hands as their first years got onto the train, returning students reuniting with classmates they hadn’t seen for the summer, the odd parent chit-chatting with the parent of their child’s friend. The usual hubbub of September 1st at King's Cross, which warmed Harry to his core. He had feared the war would have taken every last shred of normalcy from his life, but it seems that Hogwarts (even just the Hogwarts Express) proved yet again immune to the lasting evils of war. And that’s when Harry spotted him.</p><p>Unaccompanied, and making his way towards the train in the most roundabout way possible so as to not disturb or displace anyone, was Draco Malfoy.</p><p>He looked slightly better than he had last time Harry saw him at the Death Eater Trials in May, a few weeks after the Battle of Hogwarts, but that wasn’t saying much. He’d been positively gray in the face then, haunted, and withdrawn in a way that Harry could hardly recognize when he was called up to the stand, having mostly seen Malfoy as a joyous, smug, pompous yet happy prig his entire life.</p><p>But then Harry had remembered what Malfoy had been forced to do in his sixth year, remembered that Voldemort had been living in his house, remembered how he had seen him cry in frustration at his life, remembered how he held him tightly around the ribs as they flew over the Fiendfyre just a few weeks before, remembered the recognition in his eyes as he had been asked to identify Harry and how he had <em> lied, </em>and suddenly his ashen complexion seemed thoroughly justified.</p><p>It had been easy then, to ask the Wizengamot and the spectators for the trials to have mercy on him. It had been easy to ask that they forgive him entirely, as he had just been a kid in a difficult situation, without any choices, just as he had been. It had been slightly less easy to say that they should forgive him because no one had suffered more at the hands of Draco Malfoy than himself, and that Harry had already forgiven him everything. It had been difficult to say, but even as he said it, he knew it was the truth.</p><p>It definitely wasn’t easy to meet Malfoy’s eyes after saying such honest and vulnerable things, but his eyes searched for Malfoy's anyways. They only held each other's gazes for an instance before Malfoy averted his eyes, going back to sitting ramrod straight in his chair, eyes to the top of the table in front of him. Harry was sure nevertheless that he hadn't imagined the deep emotion barely contained behind those grey eyes of his.</p><p>In the end, the Wizengamot listened to him, and pardoned Malfoy for his crimes during the war, as well as for the brand on his arm, but they strongly suggested that, as he had been instrumental in the initial destruction of Hogwarts, that he do his part in its reparations. They suggested that he pay a sum of 1,000 Galleons to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, or commit to 1,000 hours of service to the school and to Hogsmeade, put in as service in the restoration and rebuilding of the two.</p><p>Malfoy spoke for the first time in the trial when he rose from his seat, thanked the Wizengamot for their judgement, and volunteered to do both. He didn’t look back at Harry once.</p><p>Harry had stared at him for the rest of the trial and watched him leave a free man as it ended, the next Death Eater being brought in for trial in his stead.</p><p>He turned to face the Death Eater and carried on with the revolving door of trials he had been made to testify in over the course of the last few days.</p><p>He told himself he didn’t want to think about Malfoy any longer, and so he hadn’t until that day on Platform 9 ¾.</p><p>He was looking gaunt, his pale hair and delicate features being washed out by the deep black of his robes. Their high collar didn’t do much to shorten his long, elegant neck, bowed though it was, facing the floor. He wasn’t carrying a trunk, rather a small leather satchel was slung across his body, and Harry found himself wondering whether the satchel was magical like Hermione’s beaded purse was.</p><p>Harry stared as he made his way slowly but surely to the train, unsure whether he could go up to him and ask, even though they weren’t friends, hadn’t ever been anything <em> close </em> to friendly, and how do you even go about asking former enemy about their <em> purse anyw- </em></p><p>“Um, excuse me- um, sir? You’re um, blocking the door. Sir.”</p><p>Startled out of his reverie, Harry looked down (<em> blimey, really far down, had he ever been that small?) </em> at the first year that was currently shifting awkwardly from foot to foot, one hand on his very large and very heavy-looking trunk.</p><p>“What? Oh bugger, right, sorry! Here let me give you a hand with that-” Harry took out his wand and cast a <em> Wingardium Leviosa </em>to the trunk. The first-year stared at the trunk as though he was seeing a levitating trunk for the very first time.</p><p>“<em>Wicked. </em>”</p><p>Harry grinned at the muggleborn kid, who was looking at him as though he hung the moon, and sent the trunk off with a flick of the wrist. It neatly stacked itself on top of two trunks and an empty owl cage already perched on the nearest overhead compartment. He then waved at the first-year and sauntered off to find Hermione and Ron, happy to have someone look at him in wonder not because of what had happened at the Battle of Hogwarts, or his role in the war, but because <em> magic was cool </em>. He remembered that feeling all too well.</p><p>When he reached the compartment that Ron and Hermione had saved for them (their favourite, all the way at the back of the train), he had the courtesy to knock before entering, giving them a chance to get themselves in order before barging in, having previously learned the lesson that his best mates were rather randy after the war, and needed little more than a closed door and a half a second to get their hands on each other.</p><p>True to form, when he opened the door it was to Ron wiping his mouth, and Hermione buttoning the last buttons at the top of her blouse. He made the standard show of covering his eyes, and claiming eternal scarring, but he knew his voice betrayed laughter, and through his fingers he could see them both rolling their eyes as they finished setting themselves to rights.</p><p>“Did either of you notice how small the first years are this year, before you became too distracted with each other?”</p><p>“Mate, I’m always distracted by Hermion-” Hermione smacked Ron in the chest before he could finish his sentence. “Ow, blimey!”</p><p>Hermione chose to ignore him entirely. “Harry, you were smaller than <em>all</em> of them first time I saw you. Hardly looked big enough to be the same age as us at all!”</p><p>“Yeah mate, you were a right runt! When in Merlin’s name did you get as tall as you are now anyway?”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes and sat down across from them; he was certainly taller than he’d been as a first year, but he wasn’t anywhere near as tall as Ron was. Or Malfoy for that matter.</p><p>“Did you see Malfoy on the Platform?”</p><p>“No, not that I was keeping an eye out for the little ferret; were you? What was he up to now?” Ron seemed to be asking the questions out of rote, not necessarily caring for an answer as he was busy tracing mindless patterns on Hermione’s arm. Hermione tucked herself more closely into Ron’s side, but her gaze was definitely sharper as she waited for Harry’s answer.</p><p>“I wasn’t looking out for him exactly, I just- saw him. He wasn’t doing anything really, just trying to get on the train. He didn’t have a trunk though, just a bag. Thought it might be one like yours, Hermione.”</p><p>“Might be,” she answered thoughtfully, “although he might just already have his stuff at Hogwarts.”</p><p>Ron and Harry shot her confused glances and she returned their looks with an exasperated huff.</p><p>“He’s been volunteering a thousand hours towards the reconstruction, hasn’t he? That works out to about four months non-stop. He’s likely been at Hogwarts helping with the rebuilding since just after the trial.”</p><p>“Oh. Right, I hadn’t thought about that.”</p><p>Harry hadn’t thought about it either. He had known of course, that Malfoy would be rebuilding Hogwarts with some of the professors, and other volunteers, he was there when Malfoy agreed to it, but he hadn’t actually <em> thought </em> about it. Hadn’t thought to volunteer either and suddenly, he was racked with guilt. Hogwarts was his home, his first <em>real</em> home, and he hadn’t even thought about helping in the reconstruction, busy as he was enjoying the post-war world, and fulfilling his duties in the trials, and discussing with the members of the Order and the new Ministry what exactly should be done in order to ensure that another war would never happen again. He has so wrapped up in his thoughts that he very nearly missed Hermione speaking to him again.</p><p>“-esides, the charms around the purse are very complex. I’m not sure Malfoy knows them all.”</p><p>“Yeah, not everyone is as clever as our Hermione! Certainly not ferret-face,” he planted a smacking kiss to Hermione’s cheek, who rolled her eyes, but took the compliment his a smile.</p><p>Harry though was remembering the night when he caught Malfoy crying in the bathroom, pushed to the end of his rope with nobody but Moaning Myrtle of all people (<em> people? </em>) to comfort him. All because of that troublesome broken Vanishing Cabinet, which he had not yet managed to fix, but that he <em>did</em> fix just weeks later.</p><p>“Maybe,” said Harry, not wanting to take away from Ron’s compliment, because really, Hermione was cleverer than all of them put together. But he was still thinking about that night, and the bright, bright blood on Malfoy’s porcelain skin, and on the porcelain tiles. Maybe that had been the only thing Malfoy had been missing, that final push over the edge that caused him to stumble on whatever genius it required to get that impossible task completed.</p><p>Hermione was looking at him as though she knew exactly where his thoughts had turned, a very similar look to the one she shot him all through that school year. He resolved to change the topic.</p><p>“So who <em> are </em> the Head Boy and Girl this year?”</p><p>The rest of the train ride passed by in an amicable discussion, during which Malfoy’s name didn’t come up once.</p>
