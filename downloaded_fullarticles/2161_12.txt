    <p class="p1">His grip is bruising around her forearm as he half directs, half pulls her up the stairs and into the master bedroom. It’s a half bedroom and half office. </p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">She feels numb. Now that Sirius knows, everyone will know and her plan to escape into the wizarding world will never work. Her past will follow her no matter where she goes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He releases her and she stumbles to the floor. She knows he follows her and he’s talking but she can’t hear him. She doesn’t know if she’s in shock or if the drugs they’d used to make her obedient and pliable are taking its toll on her body at last. Sirius must have lied the way everyone always lied to her.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">Remus comes through the fireplace and runs up the stairs. Sirius’ Patronus had not been very detailed, stating simply he needed help.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">He enters the master suite to find Sirius kneeling in front of Hermione. The girl is rocking back and forth as if in distress, dressed in a black negligee that covers only the essential.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">Remus goes to Sirius. “I need your healing skills.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Wouldn’t it be safer to just take the girl to Pomfrey?”</p>
<p class="p1">“NO!” the other man commends. “I’ll explain everything but, help her first”</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">Remus’ forehead creaks in confusion, but he does as requested waving his wand over the distressed girl. As he reads the diagnostics his face closes in a scowl.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">“What?” Sirius asked</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">“In due time” Remus bites out “let’s calm her down first.” He translates the diagnostics into parchment and with a wave of his wand Hermione falls into a restful sleep.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">Remus lifts the girl and tucks her into bed, caressing a stray curl fondly before setting his scowl on Sirius.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">“Explain. Now!”</p>
