    <p>“Ground rules,” Lily said sternly, conjuring a quill, some ink and a scrap of parchment. She dropped the tip of her quill to parchment and ticked off a sharp <em>1</em>. “Your dorm must be cleared of <em>all</em> leftover food.”</p><p>James scowled and glanced around his room. There were, indeed, plates and cups of leftover food, things the House Elves had been told were not their responsibility and so had long been forgotten by the room’s occupants. “That’s so much work. Just close the bed curtains, you won’t have to see any of it.”</p><p>“James, if your dorm is the only place in this castle we can snog with some semblance of privacy, I’m <em>not</em> doing it when your room <em>smells</em> like a bunch teenage boys.”</p><p>“Lily. You <em>do</em> realize that we <em>are</em> a bunch of teenage boys, yeah?”</p><p>“Yes,” Lily said, and eyed the yellowed sock lying discarded next to a half eaten apple beside Peter’s bed. “But have some <em>standards</em>. You’re seventeen, for Merlin’s sake.”</p><p>“What, like <em>your</em> room smells like a flower field, all sunshine and butterflies?”</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>!” And then, even more incredulous, “you’re a wizard! Just vanish it all!” </p><p>“Well. Fine.” James crossed his arms, a bit petulant but mostly pouty, and Lily fought back a smile. “But we’re not getting rid of our dungbomb collection. Non-negotiable, Evans.” They were, after all, a classic in the Marauder’s repertoire of pranks.</p><p>“<em>Christ</em>, Potter, you’re actually five years old.” Lily rubbed her forehead, but did laugh now. It made her face soft and bright, and James soaked it in. “Fine, but rule number two— you have to get rid of the rock cake.”</p><p>That struck down his dopey, happy stare. “<em>Lily</em>, Peter would be devastated, he’s been holding onto that since second year.”</p><p>Lily rolled her eyes, cutting right through James’ impassioned plea. “Yes! Exactly— and it hasn’t rotted!” And then she shivered with as much passion as James felt and he finally conceded that yes, she did have a point; he’d been deeply suspicious of the rock cake since fifth year…</p><p>“Yeah, fine, I’ll talk to the lads,” James agreed, a bit grumpy at the prospect, and at being told to stop being a slob in general.</p><p>“Oh, don’t look like that,” Lily finally took pity on him, and pressed a kiss to his cheek. </p><p>James brightened instantly, and tugged her against him, wrapping an arm around her shoulders; she <em>did</em> smell like a sunny flower field. Lily adjusted her body so that her feet went up onto the bed; she was just laying her head onto his lap when he shot up and swung her around by her legs.</p><p>“Okay, rule three,” he said to Lily’s startled outrage. “No feet on my pillow, c’mon Evans, have some standards.”</p><p>He climbed back onto the bed with her, nuzzling into that soft spot where her neck met her shoulder, feeling the vibrations of her laughter.</p>
