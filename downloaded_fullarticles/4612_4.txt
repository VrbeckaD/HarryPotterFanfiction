    <p>“I’m a female writer, and what’s interesting about the wizarding world is when you take physical strength out of the equation, a woman can fight just as well as a man can fight, a woman can do magic just as powerfully as a man can do magic, and I consider that I’ve written a lot of well-rounded female characters in these books.  As an author, none of the women ever gave me trouble, actually.  It was always the men that gave me trouble, never the women.  But Harry came to me as Harry, and I never wanted to change that.  Because switching gender isn’t simply putting a dress and a pretty name on a boy, is it?  A lot of preoccupations and expectations are different on men and women, and so the books would have been incredibly different I think.”</p><p>- JK Rowling, The Women of Harry Potter</p><p>Chapter One: Six Moments That Defined Dahlia Potter</p><p>1.</p><p>Dudley Dursley and Dahlia Potter entered their year two classroom in primary school.  It was their very first day.</p><p>The classroom seemed big to them.  It had a deep blue play rug dotted with the alphabet, colorful posters of animals and travel photos on the walls, and a series of desks with a big blackboard and a teacher’s desk at the front.  Their teacher wore a long maxi skirt and a bun of hair.  Children ran around the classroom, giggling, laughing, and playing.</p><p>“Be good, Duddy,” said Aunt Petunia, hugging and kissing Dudley goodbye, her eyes misty.  “Oh, my big boy.  I’m so proud of you.”</p><p>“Do I really have to do this?” Dudley complained.</p><p>“Now, now,” said Uncle Vernon.  “Be brave, son.  It’s what strapping young boys do.”</p><p>Dudley sighed.  “Kay,” he said reluctantly.</p><p>Then both Dursley adults turned coldly to Dahlia.  “Don’t cause any trouble,” said Aunt Petunia stiffly, and she and Uncle Vernon left the classroom.</p><p>Dudley made to charge off into the crowds of students.</p><p>“Dudley!  Where are you going?” said Dahlia uncertainly.</p><p>Dudley sighed.  “Come on.  It’s not that hard, pipsqueak.  Just go talk to somebody and make some friends.”  He set off decidedly and rather aggressively toward a group of boys in the far left corner.</p><p>Dahlia looked around, hesitating.  Finally, she saw a nice looking group of girls over by a big fake wooden house and decided to approach them.  “H… hi,” she said, smiling, her fingers twisting around each other.  “Can… can I play with you?”</p><p>“Sure -” one of the girls began, smiling, but another girl looked at Dahlia and her nose wrinkled.</p><p>“What are you <i>wearing?”</i></p><p>It was a ragged, grey, faded second-hand dress, really quite ugly but all her aunt and uncle would buy her.  Her black hair was a long mess of wild, tangled curls - only somewhat less psychically painful than the hair shorning haircuts she used to get - and a lightning bolt scar from the car crash her parents had died in when she was a baby shown clear on her forehead.</p><p>“Well…”  Dahlia’s face reddened painfully.</p><p>Dudley looked over from across the classroom, as if having a sixth sense for this sort of thing.  He let go of the kid he’d been punching, stomped right over, and punched the offending girl across the face.  Dahlia gasped, stiffening, hands lifted, and the other girls screamed.</p><p>Dahlia tugged Dudley by the arm.  “You didn’t have to do that,” she whispered heatedly.</p><p>“I know,” said Dudley smugly.  “You can thank me later.”  He stood on a desk and called, “Can I have everyone’s attention, please?”</p><p>The classroom fell into a shocked silence.</p><p>“Dahlia Potter, my cousin, lives with me.”  He waved to Dahlia, who winced as everyone now turned to stare at her.  “That means she’s like my sister.  And if anyone ever picks on my sister, they will get the stuffing beaten out of them.  I look big, I am big, I have big fists, and I will hit you.  So someone had better be nice to her, and she’d better make some friends.</p><p>“Got it?”  He glared around the classroom.</p><p>“Mr Dursley!  Get down this instant!  We do not hit people!” said the teacher, indignant.</p><p>But Dudley was smug as he got down off the desk.  His point had been made.</p><p>2.</p><p>Dahlia did end up making friends in primary school.  A girl named Samantha, a girl named Rachel, and a boy named Tommy were closest.  She spent time at their houses, spent lunches eating with them and recesses playing with them.  They always picked her first for their team in phys ed - and they didn’t even resent it, as she was short and skinny and not strong but was also extremely graceful and fast.</p><p>One thing they told her was that she needed hobbies.  “There’s nothing defining about you.  You know?” said Tommy thoughtfully, when they were all sitting in a circle in the grassy field during one recess.</p><p>“I guess I’ve mostly just been focused on trying to keep from being miserable as much as possible around my aunt and uncle,” Dahlia admitted.  “I’ve been making friends easier lately, but it’s harder to shake off… survival mode, I guess.”</p><p>“Yeah, you always seem pretty quiet and tense,” Rachel nodded, concerned.</p><p>“Well, we can help you find hobbies,” said Samantha bossily, as usual taking the lead.</p><p>“Okay, but there are three limitations,” Dahlia warned them.</p><p>“Okay.  Go.”</p><p>“My Aunt Petunia hates animals because they’re messy, so I’m not allowed to get involved with animals,” Dahlia began.</p><p>“She doesn’t like animals?” said Samantha, indignant, as Tommy frowned and Rachel stared in disbelief.</p><p>“Look, they’re snooty suburban people,” said Dahlia in exasperation.  “Proper English accent, big square house, big square garden with a wall and hedges, perfectly neat interior full of lots of white and vases on end tables and gleaming picture frames.  My uncle is a firm director; he throws dinner parties.  They can’t have animals.”</p><p>“Okay, we get it, they’re snobs,” said Samantha, exasperated.  “What are the other two limitations?”</p><p>“I’m not allowed sports because I’m a girl.  And I’m not allowed to be creative because they don’t trust imagination,” Dahlia finished.</p><p>There was a stumped silence.  “I know what we’ll do,” said Tommy suddenly.</p><p>The next day, he came to school with a big list of all the hobbies it was possible to think of in this world.  “At this world culture organization my mother works at, they set up people from different cultures as friends with each other,” he explained.  “They have people fill out this questionnaire saying what hobbies they enjoy, and try to match people with those hobbies in the area.  There’s got to be <i>something</i> on here that fits you.”</p><p>“Make sure you like it,” Samantha clarified.</p><p>Rachel sat down and calmly talked Dahlia through it, as the choices were a bit overwhelming.  Eventually, Dahlia chose seven possibilities.  Books were a quiet, intelligent, and introverted hobby that she couldn’t see her aunt and uncle having a problem with.  Calligraphy was the kind of creative art that wasn’t really seen as creative - in other words, the kind they could trust.  Dancing, figure skating, and swimming were sports, but more feminine sports they might not have a problem with - and again, they weren’t conventionally creative.  Then she chose tea ceremony and science as her final two interesting possibilities.</p><p>It was hard work, deciding what she liked, but she thought all those sounded interesting.</p><p>Next came research.  She looked into it and arranged a potential schedule so that she focused on groups surrounding one activity per week, seven days a week.  After that, there was just one problem.</p><p>Dahlia seemed downcast on the walk home from school one day.  “What’s wrong, pipsqueak?” Dudley asked bluntly.  His friends were walking with them.  They’d become the tough guys around school, often getting into fights with other kids.  More recently they’d become obsessed with sci fi and video games.</p><p>Dahlia explained what had been going on.  “I don’t see your Mum and Dad having a problem exactly with any of it - books, calligraphy, dancing, figure skating, swimming, tea ceremony, or science.  I might even make more friends at these groups.  And with where my physical talents lie, things like dancing and skating might be good for me.  But I don’t see your Mum and Dad allowing me to be happy, signing permission slips, or paying for anything either.”</p><p>Dudley frowned thoughtfully.  “I’ll handle it,” he said suddenly, taking charge and walking ahead.  “If you want to be a nerdy fairy, that’s what you’re getting.”</p><p>“Your aunt and uncle are weird,” said Piers Polkiss to Dahlia fervently.</p><p>She sighed.  “You’re telling me,” she said dryly, by now able to give back as good as she got when it came to the crippling bluntness of Dudley’s guy friends.</p><p>They made it home and Dudley stormed in the front door.  He threw himself down on his butt, kicked his arms and legs about, and started screaming.</p><p>“Duddy!” Aunt Petunia cried, running in the doorway.  “What’s wrong?  What did that girl do?”  She glared up at Dahlia.</p><p>“Nothing, Mum - I want her to have hobbies - I want her to be happy - but she’s not happy and I’m miserable -!” Dudley screeched, pretend sobbing.</p><p>“Oh, you poor, sensitive, loving boy!” Aunt Petunia cried, flinging her arms around him.</p><p>Dahlia nearly snorted, fondly exasperated.  Sensitive was the last thing Dudley Dursley was.</p><p>“Alright, Duddy, she can - she can have her hobbies,” said Aunt Petunia, looking torn and worried.  “I’ll let Vernon know as soon as he gets home from work.”  Dudley calmed down.  “As long as they’re <i>appropriate,”</i> Aunt Petunia added coldly, standing and walking up to Dahlia.</p><p>Dahlia named her potential interests.</p><p>Aunt Petunia sniffed.  “Well… they’ll keep you busy… and none of them sound terrible…  Alright,” she decided.  “I suppose we can allow it.”  </p><p>Dahlia beamed in victory and Dudley looked satisfied from behind his mother.</p><p>“But we don’t trust all this friend and hobby business,” said Aunt Petunia.  “So we’re still reading all your mail before you do.  Just so we know what’s going on.”  She stormed away.</p><p>So Dahlia got to print her full name on signed permission slip forms: <i>Dahlia Euphemia Potter.</i></p><p>Mrs Figg, her little old cat lady babysitter, now more allowed to be kind to her, even started being friendlier and warmer, smiling dottily and baking her food amidst her many purring cats during visits to her house with its medicinal smell and knitted afghans.  Dahlia, of course, was old enough that she knew better than to say too much about it back at home.  The Dursleys’ tight rein over Dahlia’s constant misery seemed to relax just a little, but it was still there.</p><p>3.</p><p>When Dahlia walked up to Aunt Petunia hesitantly after school one afternoon, she was nervous.  Aunt Petunia was baking in the kitchen.  “Yes?” she snapped.  Dahlia jumped and then realized she was just standing there.</p><p>She cleared her throat.  “I - need - glasses.”  She winced.  “I can’t see the board at school.”</p><p>Aunt Petunia, to her surprise, didn’t seem shocked or even upset.  “Fine,” she said, not looking up from her kneading of the dough on the gleaming white counter surface.  “We’ll get your prescription filled and go pick out some frames.”</p><p>“Oh… alright.”  Dahlia walked away, thinking that this had been surprisingly painless.  She wasn’t looking forward to glasses, though.  They’d probably just make her uglier.</p><p>But when Aunt Petunia helped her pick out her new frames right before the prescriptions were stuck into them, she was actually rather nice.  They’d gone to the mall, a huge and brightly lit place with squeaky linoleum, metal bars, and several floors full of gleaming, fashionable store fronts with neon signs.  The glasses place was wall to wall glasses frames set on little pedestal holders.  There was a room in the back for the prescriptions to be filled and set into the frames.</p><p>“Now,” said Aunt Petunia thoughtfully, bending and looking over their choices, “your face is a heart shape, and a rather thin one at that.  So you need glasses that widen your face and draw attention back to your eyes.”</p><p>“Back to my eyes?” Dahlia asked.</p><p>“They’re your best feature, now be quiet,” said Aunt Petunia rather snappishly, and Dahlia fell obediently silent.  She thought of her almond shaped bright green eyes.  Her best feature, she wondered to herself quietly…?  And a heart-shaped face didn’t make it sound so bad either…</p><p>“So let’s choose cat-eye frames,” Aunt Petunia decided, straightening, “in a tortoiseshell pattern, to add extra emphasis to that area.”  She picked out the frames, and when Dahlia tried on her finished glasses she gasped in awe.  Not only could she see the world clearly… but she looked better in the mirror provided, too.</p><p>“Wow,” she whispered.</p><p>“Now,” said Aunt Petunia, “I’m going to give you one extra tip.  Since your hair being short isn’t an option apparently,” she added, exasperated, and Dahlia winced at that particular memory, “I’d recommend putting your hair in an updo.  It’ll make your hair look less…”</p><p>“Like an afro?” Dahlia suggested.</p><p>Aunt Petunia almost smiled.  “Well, quite,” she said.  It seemed she had always wanted a young girl she could teach these things to.  “So with your face shape, I’d recommend…”  She tilted Dahlia off to the side so she could see in the mirror, then pulled her wild black curls back, showing her how it was done.  “A swept back chignon.  Starts at the nape of the neck, goes up to the high crown.  Volume on top.  Then allow pieces to fall out of the shape, softly framing your face.  That’s the casual look, anyway.  In more formal situations, it would all go back.”  She let pieces of Dahlia’s jet black curls fall around her face with its new glasses.</p><p>“And finally,” she added grimly, “to cover up that horrid scar… you have this long, blunt 60’s retro fringe for a reason.  Use it.”  She pulled Dahlia’s straight dark bangs down, entirely covering her forehead.</p><p>“See?  Isn’t that better?”  She let Dahlia look in the mirror.</p><p>Dahlia paused in surprise.  Her aunt was right; she was quite transformed.  Her hair looked good, her face looked good, her glasses looked good, and her scar was gone.  She realized she actually did like her green eyes with these new glasses.  And instead of being short and skinny, now thanks to her sports and hobbies and increased food she was small and slim instead.  Even her knees looked dimpled instead of bony, bulging, and knobbly.  Her nose was small and pert, clearer now in her face.  She looked in body and face both much better and healthier.</p><p>And she had friends.</p><p>The only thing wrong was the clothes.  But now she just looked like a pretty, pixie-like girl slightly washed out in ragged grey dresses.  She didn’t look ugly anymore.</p><p>“Thank you,” she breathed.</p><p>“Yes.  Well.”  Aunt Petunia sniffed, but Dahlia could tell she was pleased with her finished feminine work and its praise despite herself.</p><p>4.</p><p>Aunt Petunia walked up to her in the house one day, hands on her hips.  “On weekends, I’m going to be teaching you cooking, baking, and flower gardening,” she said.  “The real stuff, not the side chores you’ve been doing.  My reasoning is entirely selfish.  I want you to be able to do chores like this better around the house.”</p><p>“... Okay,” said Dahlia, surprised.  It made sense, in a way; Dudley never had any chores while she had many of them, to “earn her place in the house.”</p><p>But, especially as their lessons progressed, Dahlia could tell Aunt Petunia’s heart wasn’t really in the selfish chores ideology.  Aunt Petunia had no one else to teach things like this to, with only a son and a husband.  Perhaps her success with the glasses and the hair had been the catalyst, or perhaps Dahlia was simply getting older and more successful - her grades even beating Dudley’s, though to be fair that wouldn’t take much - but Aunt Petunia seemed to want someone to teach these feminine techniques to.  </p><p>And so they began.  Aunt Petunia taught Dahlia how to kneel in the dirt of the front garden before the flower beds and dig up weeds, water, feed fresh soil.  She taught her how to plant, sow, and help flowers grow, when plants looked like they were dying, how they thrived throughout the different seasons.  Aunt Petunia’s gardens were her pride and joy, and Dahlia just then realized how carefully she took care of them.  She also found there was a sort of almost meditative calm to the act of gardening.  She could see why Aunt Petunia liked it.</p><p>Aunt Petunia also taught Dahlia how to use a sewing machine, and how to make an amazing variety of foods.  Dahlia loved that she got to eat everything she made, so she quickly took to this.  Aunt Petunia taught her how to make everything from noodles and fruit salad to meat, potatoes, and vegetables.  She taught her how to properly brew and make tea, and how to bake treats like biscuits, puddings, tarts, and cakes.  They had a whole section on breakfasts.  More than that, she taught her aesthetics - how to make a meal look just right.  In this, Aunt Petunia - a natural cleanliness-obsessed perfectionist who prided herself on her magnificent displays - was an expert.</p><p>Dahlia mentioned one day while they were baking together, feeling somewhat freer around her aunt these days, who had become more difficult and short and less frigid and angry, “You know, I could help make food for dinner parties now.”</p><p>She said it casually, but Aunt Petunia entirely stilled.</p><p>“Sorry,” said Dahlia quickly, not sure what she’d done wrong.</p><p>“No, it’s just…”  Aunt Petunia stared straight ahead of herself, a floury hand to her lips.  “You could be perfect to round out our dinner party act.”  Dahlia rose a skeptical eyebrow.  “Think about it!” said Aunt Petunia, suddenly excited.  “We have a mother, a father, a little boy - why not a little girl?” she said to herself.  “It would look perfect!  But you’d need new clothes.  Let me talk to Vernon.”</p><p>She was now absently busy in her own mind, worrying away at the problem.</p><p>Dahlia kept silent.  She decided suffering through a few dinner parties was worth an upgrade in fashion.  It was rare she was bought anything as it was.</p><p>5.</p><p>Uncle Vernon had seemed reluctant, but agreed it was a good idea.  So Aunt Petunia took Dahlia back to that same mall, this time to go clothes shopping in those lovely, fancy, multi-floor shops with the gleaming neon signs.</p><p>Dahlia was allowed her own style - to a certain extent.  She wanted to go for a boyish yet fun and colorful look, and at first Aunt Petunia was skeptical.  “Think masculine but feminine,” said Dahlia, finding it hard to contain her excitement as they stood in the entryway of her first store, surrounded by racks of clothes.</p><p>“Alright.  That might work,” said Aunt Petunia slowly.  Dahlia could already tell she was the kind of person who loved feminine clothes shopping anyway.</p><p>So Dahlia went for a look and then it was vetted through an Aunt Petunia filter for feminine accents, classy muted colors, and sophistication.</p><p>Just as some examples, Dahlia bought a one-piece pants dress, a sleeveless top that reminded her of mermaids, and oxford shoes, all in pastel colors.  For another outfit, she picked out a sweater and button up shirt in white and pastel colors with a bluish scarf, black capris pants, and shiny flats.  Another outfit was a little girl’s cute white-out suit with a red skirt and a boyish cap.  Yet another outfit was a white sweater-shirt, khaki pants it could tuck into, and a belt.</p><p>She felt transformed once more in the mirror, and decided smiling that she liked fashion and shopping.  </p><p>Back at home, she began cleaning up her cupboard-bedroom, vacuuming out all the spiders busily and matter of factly, picking up everything and putting it neatly in drawers, tidying up.  She had so many nice new things, including new clothes - she wanted it all to look good.  Just because her cupboard was a bedroom, that didn’t mean everything she had couldn’t look as good as possible.</p><p>For her bedroom <i>was</i> a cupboard, the closet underneath the staircase.  She had a small camp bed, a set of dresser drawers that doubled as a bedside table, a lightbulb, and some shelving space.  That was about it.  Spiders got in sometimes, so the cupboard had to be regularly cleaned, which Dahlia didn’t mind.  She was rather sensible about the whole thing.</p><p>Her cupboard shelves were filled with books and scientific texts, in pride of place being a single book of recipes from her Aunt Petunia, while her calligraphic pieces hung on the walls in the spaces between the shelves.  Her swimsuit and dancing uniform hung from the light bulb switch above her bed.  Her skates and dance shoes were set in a far corner.  Some of her favorite finished science art projects and experiments decorated various other corners of her cupboard.  Beautiful scientific posters of various phenomena hung alongside the calligraphic designs.  She had a neat little shelf in a corner full of tea ceremony materials and a book of tea.</p><p>All of it, like her clothes, was carefully preserved because she wasn’t allowed much.</p><p>A single photograph of her with her three childhood best friends was framed on her bedside table, along with her glasses at night and various hair scrunchies.  Tacked in a collage above her headboard were photographs of her with her various childhood groups and clubs, everyone gathered together beaming for the camera.  And in her dressers, folded neatly, came her new clothes, her shoes set in neat rows in front of the bottom drawers.</p><p>It was nice - she looked good now, she had friends, she had hobbies, and there was the genuine feeling that someone lived here in her newly clean cupboard.</p><p>But Aunt Petunia wasn’t finished with her.  She gave Dahlia etiquette lessons in preparation for her first dinner party.  Dahlia walked while balancing books on her head so that she moved with dignity and grace.  She learned calm smiles, hands neatly folded, legs crossed.  She learned how to cut her steak, how to eat and drink daintily, what a salad fork was, and how to speak as politely and respectfully as possible at all times.  Aunt Petunia even taught her how to edge tactful compliments into a conversation, and speak softly but loudly enough to be heard.  Dahlia took these lessons and integrated them through her own filter, becoming quiet and reserved instead of soft-spoken and openly girly.  She learned when to hold her tongue and when to speak her mind, the useful lesson of tact, which tallied well with her already sharp eyes.</p><p>Aunt Petunia was a strict disciplinarian, scolding and difficult and easily irritable as always, but Dahlia was a quick learner.</p><p>6.</p><p>The Dursleys always had a set plan of attack for the evening before a dinner party.  </p><p>Uncle Vernon in his formal dark suit went over it all sternly one last time: “Dudley opens the door.  Dahlia takes their coats, smiling but keeping quiet.  Petunia will be in the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.</p><p>“I will lead them into the lounge, introduce Petunia, and pour them drinks.  We all sit down and chat - politely.”  Here he glared at Dahlia, whom he thought was quite wild and whom he had never trusted, spoken much to, or dared teach anything to.  “Petunia announces dinner exactly fifteen minutes later.  Dahlia leads them into the dining room and opens the door for them while Dudley asks for the Mrs arm and leads her through into the dining room with her husband.</p><p>“We should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner, alongside the polite chatter.”  Here Uncle Vernon glared at Dahlia again.  “When dinner is over, Dahlia and Dudley go along with Petunia as she leads the Mrs out to the lounge again for a late coffee.  The children are not to drink coffee, as it could give them too much energy, and they are not to be rowdy or roughhouse.  Sit quietly.  Meanwhile, in the dining room, I’ll bring the subject of a big corporate shipment of drills around to the Mr.  With any luck, we’ll have a deal signed.</p><p>“But it is very important that we all behave impressively in absolutely all areas.”</p><p>One final glare at Dahlia, who sighed quietly.  “I understand,” she said, trying hard not to show her irritation.</p><p>And understand she did.  She played her part to perfection.  Stern, dark Uncle Vernon watched her like a hawk the entire time, his eyes beady, but she smiled sharply and charmed, remained reserved, paid even better and more tasteful, subtle compliments than Dudley, chatted and even impressed with her grades and her hobbies.  She never roughhoused, her clothes were unconventional but flattering, she was obviously intelligent and sharp-eyed despite her purposefully quiet voice, and her etiquette was perfect.</p><p>She was a lesson in deadly precision.</p><p>“Petunia, you must be so proud of this poor orphan girl,” said the Mrs at one point.</p><p>Aunt Petunia’s teeth clenched, but she simpered a smile.  “Yes,” she lied.  “She’s very important to us.”</p><p>Dahlia smiled with razor sharpness and watched her aunt with intent eyes, and no one ever suspected that she slept in a cupboard or that she was in many ways still and usually treated terribly, punished for things that weren’t her fault, forbidden from going fun places in the world.</p><p>A single, formal family dinner party photograph was taken that night, and Dahlia smiled sharply in it amidst her proud and formal, fancy family, in their suits and peach silk organdy dress.  They looked cold, unaffectionate.  No one who visited seemed to notice, but it was the least affectionate photograph hung in the lounge and also the only one Dahlia was ever in.</p>
