    <p> </p><p>Magic Circles and Seals Studies sounded lame but was turning out to be a pretty interesting class overall; for once Okumura Rin wasn't asleep and drooling on his desk.  </p><p> </p><p>Rin watched in rapt fascination as Neuhaus Sensei, useing a comically oversized compass, began to outline a perfect circle around the already intricate chalk drawing he made on the floor. Rin was impressed that anyone could draw something that elaborate so quickly and for a dude with only one eye, Neuhaus Sensei didn't seem to have any issues with his depth perception.</p><p> </p><p>As Rin stared, the glyphs and sigils around the edges of the design began squirming  slightly. Rin blinked in surprise and glanced subtly at the other paiges to see if they had noticed the suddenly lively art.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone else seemed calmly fixated on Neuhaus Sensei so Rin tried to ignore the way the white lines twisted and shook even as he wondered why no one else noticed the strange phenomena.</p><p> </p><p>Neuhaus Sensei smoothly overlapped the ends of the chalk circle, pausing briefly to take in it's perfect symmetry before he began to lecture. </p><p> </p><p>"All right. We will now summon a demon." </p><p> </p><p>Rin gasped and took a half step forward; as soon as the circle had closed the subtle movement of the chalk lines transformed into a full on vibration that he could feel in his bones. Like an inaudible bass line with a vaguely dubstep rhythm, that is if dubstep were intrinsically enticing, seductive and demanded immediate obedience.</p><p> </p><p>"Watch your step!" Neuhaus Sensei glared at Rin who quickly came to his senses and stepped back blushing.</p><p> </p><p>"If the magic circle is broken it will lose it's effect. Now, to summon a demon you will need a drop of your blood and a suitable invocation."</p><p> </p><p>Rin felt a little ill at the thought of watching someone hurt themselves deliberately as Neuhaus Sensei moved to draw the point of his compass across the skin of his arm.</p><p> </p><p>Just then an obnoxious cellphone jingle split the tense atmosphere with a shrill but cheerful melody.</p><p> </p><p>Neuhaus Sensei grunted and stepped back from the circle. "Hold class. Unfortunately I have to take this call."</p><p> </p><p>He flipped his phone out efficiently and turned away from the paiges. Even though Neuhaus Sensei was making an effort to speak quietly it was obvious to Rin that the person on the other end didn't care one whit for discretion. </p><p> </p><p>Rin couldn't exactly make out what was being said but from the volume and tone of voice it was obvious that Neuhaus Sensei was being thoroughly scolded.</p><p> </p><p>Rin didn't realize he had been leaning forward towards the circle again until Neuhaus Sensei turned back to the class and gave him a dark look.</p><p> </p><p>"Class, my presence is required elsewhere for a moment." </p><p> </p><p>Neuhaus Sensei scuffed his foot through the circle on the floor, disrupting the magic. He slung his compass over his shoulder and pulled out his key ring.</p><p> </p><p>"Behave, I will be right back." He twisted the key in the lock on the classroom door, and opening it, stepped through into a darkened room. </p><p> </p><p>The door shut behind him with a resounding clang leaving the paiges standing akwardly, clutching their summoning papers in front of the defunct summoning circle chalked on the ground.</p><p> </p><p>Sugaro Ryuji finally had enough.</p><p> </p><p>"This is absolute bullshit! First Tsubaki Sensei wanders off in the middle of class for a booty call and now Neuhaus Sensei is doing the same thing!?"</p><p> </p><p>Shima Renzo smiled gently. "Now Bon, we don't know what that call was about, it was probably something important."</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah Bon." Miwa Konekomaru chimed in.  "The ringtone was an anime theme, I don't think that Neuhaus Sensei would have that as his regular ringtone. "</p><p> </p><p>"It may have been the headmaster calling, he is a bit of an otaku after all, it kinda makes sense if you think about it." Renzo ruffled his pink hair nervously.</p><p> </p><p>Ryuji's anger deflated. "Yeah, you guys are probably right. It's not like this was going to be a big deal or anything, being a tamer is supposed to be a really rare thing, I doubt any of us have the talent."</p><p> </p><p>Kamiki Izumo puffed up in rightous indignation. </p><p> </p><p>"Speak for yourself loser!" She sneered as she bled on two summoning papers.</p><p> </p><p>"I humbly appeal to thee o goddess Inari, grant my request, leave not my prayers to be unfulfilled!"</p><p> </p><p>With a gust of wind and a flash of blinding light two ethereal white foxes sprang into being. They circled Izumo and assumed ready positions at her feet.</p><p> </p><p>"Woah! That's so unbelievably cool!" Rin enthused while Ryuji seethed.</p><p> </p><p>"Kamiki-san?! What the hell are you trying to prove!?" </p><p> </p><p>"Only the strongest among us can be tamers. It takes great will power and stamina to summon a familiar." Izumo casually ripped her summoning papers in half dismissing her foxes and fanned the remaining stack of summoning papers in Ryuji's face</p><p> </p><p>"Let's see how you manage oh great challenger of Satan!"</p><p> </p><p>"Peice of cake!" Ryuji growled as he took the papers from her with one hand. He grasped a straight pin in the same hand as the papers and pierced his skin.</p><p> </p><p>Carefully letting only one drop of blood touch the top most paper he waited for words of summoning to come to mind. As the seconds stretched into minutes Ryuji began to fidget uncomfortably.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey Bon, I think you are supposed to say something when you are trying to summon." Rin called out helpfully.</p><p> </p><p>Ryuji turned several shades of red before he stomped over to Rin and shoved the unused wad of summoning papers into his hands.</p><p> </p><p>"DON'T CALL ME THAT YA MORON!"</p><p> </p><p>"Sorry, I was just trying to help......" Rin trailed off uncertainly at the anger on Ryuji's face. </p><p> </p><p>"You, helping me? Ha! That's a fucking joke! You couldn't help me find my way out of a wet paper bag!"</p><p> </p><p>Rin stepped back warily clutching the papers to his chest. </p><p> </p><p>"Dude, why are you so fucking mean to me?! I didn't do a god damned thing to you!"</p><p> </p><p>"That's because you don't do a god damned thing in the first place! Why don't you try it Okumura-kun, what's the harm? After all you will just fail at this the same way you fail at everything else!"</p><p> </p><p>Rin was shocked into silence for a half a second before his pride reasserted itself.</p><p> </p><p>"You know what!? Just for that I'm going to summon something that will knock your shoes off!"</p><p> </p><p>Before Rin could run the straight pin through his flesh the classroom door swung open, slamming into the wall violently revealing a wide eyed and thoroughly incensed Okumura Yukio.</p><p> </p><p>"RIN NO! EVERYONE STOP! How dare you play with this stuff!" He shouted at the room at large as he threw his briefcase in the general direction of the lectern. Yukio stepped quickly towards Rin with a thunderous look on his face.</p><p> </p><p>"You don't know how badly this could have gone wrong without the supervision of a trained exorcist!"</p><p> </p><p>Yukio snatched the wad of summoning papers out of Rin's hand and turned to face the rest of the class. </p><p> </p><p>"I hope you're pleased with yourselves! We could have all  been killed - or worse, expelled!"</p><p> </p><p>The second the words came out of his mouth the floor shook and the lights overhead flickered and died. The small windows in the top of the wall kept the room from being completely dark but the long shadows cast by their dim light were hardly reassuring.</p><p> </p><p>Looking down at his hand Yukio realized with a thrill of foreboding that he must have cut himself on Rin's nails. The summoning papers in his fist were saturated with blood and a steady rivulet of crimson was dripping on the floor.</p><p> </p><p>He felt strangely detached from the situation, almost as if it was happening to someone else. There was only one thought on his mind and it escaped from his mouth before he had the sense to keep it shut.</p><p> </p><p>"Fucking hell, that is not good." </p><p> </p><p>The paiges didn't know what to be more suprised by, the suddenly dim and oddly frigid room, the blood dripping from their Sensei's hand, or the fact that he actually said a swear word.</p><p> </p><p>Yukio discovered, as he was trying to think of an appropriate action to take, that his body was frozen in abject primal terror. As a shadowy figure rose from the floor he could do little more than gasp and pant in place.</p><p> </p><p>Seeing that Yukio had completely seized up, Rin grabbed the papers from Yukio's hand and began frantically tearing them apart.</p><p> </p><p>"SHIT! I don't know which one it is, they are all covered in your blood!"</p><p> </p><p>"You can't banish me! I won't go back!" The demon ground out in a voice that sounded raspy from disuse as it stalked towards Yukio's rigid form.</p><p> </p><p>The demon suddenly barked out a sillibant word while making a complex slashing motion with a slender stick.</p><p> </p><p>Yukio gave a strangled cry of pain and collapsed heavily into the first row of desks. </p><p> </p><p>For a second Rin lost track of his surroundings as he dropped the summoning papers and frantically tore through the desks to get to Yukio.</p><p> </p><p>The summoned demon continued to chant nonsense latin-ish words in roughly sing song manner.</p><p> </p><p>"Yukio!" Rin turned his twin brother onto his back and was relieved to find that he was awake and breathing normally.</p><p> </p><p>Rin's frantic examination of Yukio's chest revealed that his exorcists coat had been cut with surgical precision and his once white dress shirt was wet with blood.</p><p> </p><p>Rin shakily peeled back Yukio's shirt but there were no visible wounds. Scrubbing lightly at his crimson stained skin Rin could just barely make out a light silvery scar resembling a circle inside a bisected triangle.</p><p> </p><p>While Rin checked him over Yukio dazedly watched the demon retreat to the side of the room. As the gloom began to dissipate and the lights came back on Yukio was able to make out it's features more clearly.</p><p> </p><p>It had a humanoid shape, slightly on the smaller side, but it's head was completely hidden by the shimmering cowel of a long flowing cloak. It's arms, visible from within the folds of the cloak, were covered in dense greenish black scales, like that of a giant snake. The scales on the legs were different, more armored, and were a darker color all together, as if the skin was from an entirely different demon. </p><p> </p><p>Yukio wondered, a little hysterically, if some demons did that; wore the skin of another demon, like a human wearing a human skin suit. </p><p> </p><p>Yukio shuddered hard at the thought and tried to take in the rest of the figure before him. The strangely colored, plate scaled legs transitioned into thick soled, sensible if slightly opalescent calf length boots.</p><p> </p><p>He had summoned a humanoid demon wearing...shiny boots? With a gasp Yukio reached out to grab the crumpled  summoning papers that Rin had dropped.</p><p> </p><p>"Begone!" he yelled as he ripped the whole stack in half all at once.</p><p> </p><p>The torn pieces of paper fluttered to the ground but the summons remained.</p><p> </p><p>"I told you I won't go back." The demon folded it's arms across it's chest and leaned defiantly against the wall.</p><p> </p><p>Yukio gaped at his summons, completely overwhelmed and was totally unprepared for Neuhaus Sensei to come barging back into the room.</p><p> </p><p>Seeing Rin crouched over Yukio with blood everywhere and all the students looking shocked Neuhaus Sensei jumped directly to the wrong conclusion. </p><p> </p><p>Grinning maniacally he lashed out with his compass, brandishing the sharp point like a sword. </p><p> </p><p>"You fiend! Just as I suspected!"</p><p> </p><p>Yukio reflexively pulled Rin down to safety but there just wasn't enough time for him to move as well. He turned his head and braced himself for Neuhaus Sensei's blow.</p><p> </p><p>There was a blur of movement in front of Yukio and he looked up to see Neuhaus Sensei's compass being skillfully deflected by a flashing silver sword.</p><p> </p><p>The red gems in the pommel caught the overhead lights, glowing like hot coals, as the compass was twisted out of Neuhaus Sensei's hand and kicked away. Yukio's demonic summoning raised it's sword and stepped forward as Neuhaus Sensei posed ready to draw blood across one of the many sigils on his arms.</p><p> </p><p>"Woah, woah! Everyone just stop!" Yukio clamored to his feet to intercept his summons, "Don't attack!"</p><p> </p><p>"Exorcist Okumura you are obviously injured and we need to neutralize the demon that attacked you!" Neuhaus totally disregarded Yukio's summons in favor of sending Rin a one eyed glare.</p><p> </p><p>Rin sat up from where he had been thrown to the ground and opened his mouth to explain but Yukio cut him off before he could he could even suck in a breath.</p><p> </p><p>"Sensei <i>I</i> summoned the demon by accident and I can't seem to send it back. I'm not hurt anymore it looks a lot worse than it is." Yukio grimaced at the tense, angry atmosphere. </p><p> </p><p>"Let's all calm down and put our weapons away."</p><p> </p><p>The cloaked figure turned slightly, seemingly to ascertain Yukio's sincerity, and then with a nod of it's covered head the sword it was holding winked out of existence.</p><p> </p><p>"Cool!" Renzo exclaimed quietly while the others still stood around in slack jawed amazement.</p><p> </p><p>Neuhaus Sensei narrowed his eye and puffed out a heavy breath in Rin's direction. </p><p> </p><p>"What's this about a summons?"</p><p> </p><p>Yukio started slightly at his change of tone.</p><p> </p><p>"Ah, yes. You may remember that I didn't have any luck with summoning a familiar in the past."</p><p> </p><p>"Thinking that I didn't have the ability I was careless while I was collecting the summoning papers from the students. Not realizing I had a cut on my hand I was astonished to find that the first words I said got a reaction."</p><p> </p><p>Neuhaus Sensei gave Yukio a look of surprise.</p><p> </p><p>"So this is what you summoned?"</p><p> </p><p>Yukio nodded affirmatively while he carefully helped Rin to stand.</p><p> </p><p>Neuhaus Sensei looked over the mysterious cloaked figure with an analytical eye.</p><p> </p><p>"It's not a class of demon that I recognize."</p><p> </p><p>"Me neither, but it's initial presence and abilities seem to point at either the Time or Spirit kingdom."</p><p> </p><p>"Fascinating. Can you communicate with it?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, it seems intelligent and speaks clearly."</p><p> </p><p>Neuhaus Sensei coughed wetly to clear his throat and in a slightly exaggerated voice asked, "Hello can you understand me?"</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>"Yes, I understand you just fine."</b> the figure drawled in a flat tone.</p><p>"I didn't understand that, what did it say?"</p><p> </p><p>"It said that it understands you."</p><p> </p><p>"That's very strange, I can hear it but it isn't speaking in Japanese. I hear something that could be English perhaps. Does anyone here know conversational English well enough to understand it?"</p><p> </p><p>All the students shook their heads no including Yukio. </p><p> </p><p>Neuhaus Sensei gave Yukio a rare grin.</p><p> </p><p>"Congratulations Okamura-kun! You now have a familiar and because of your bond you can understand it despite the apparent language barrier."</p><p> </p><p>"Familiar? I don't have time for a familiar!"</p><p> </p><p>Neuhaus gave Yukio an unimpressed look.</p><p> </p><p>Flustered Yukio corrected himself. "Of course this will require some adjustment in my schedule as my familiar cannot be banished. I will give the matter my utmost attention over the weekend."</p><p> </p><p>"Excellent Okumura-kun, I look forward to following up with you and your most intriguing new familiar."</p><p> </p><p>Nodding approvingly Neuhaus Sensei carried on " Not that you were supposed to with me out of the room but has anyone else been able to summon anything?"</p><p> </p><p>Izumo stepped forward with a haughty expression and quickly ran through the chant to summon her Byakko.</p><p> </p><p>"Excellent summoning Kamiki-san! Two familiars at once, quite impressive"</p><p> </p><p>Izumo flipped her hair and assumed a proud stance. "Thank you Sensei but it was really no trouble. I am decended from a long line of shrine maidens after all."</p><p> </p><p>Neuhaus Sensei nodded and moved on. "Any one else that isn't an Okumura?"</p><p> </p><p>Konekomaru and Renzou looked at each other and at Paku Noriko. Ryuji shook his head in exasperation. "No one else apart from Kamiki-san and Okumura Sensei managed anything."</p><p> </p><p>"Ummmm Sensei." Sheimi quietly called out. "I didn't get a chance to try."</p><p> </p><p>"Go ahead then, just say what comes naturally once you bloody the summoning paper."</p><p> </p><p>"Ok." With a determined face Sheimi pricked her finger and neatly dabbed a drop on blood on the paper.</p><p> </p><p>"Come on boy, come on boy......or something."</p><p> </p><p>With a sudden green <b>POOF</b> and a high pitched "Nii!" a tiny bipedal shrubbery popped into being.</p><p> </p><p>"If I'm not mistaken that's a baby Greenman. Excellent Moriyama-san, excellent."</p><p> </p><p>"He's perfect!" With a blinding smile Sheimi cuddled her new familiar as it cooed and cuddled back.</p><p> </p><p>Neuhaus Sensei stepped back to the front of the room and began gathering his paperwork.</p><p> </p><p>"It seems that we have our tamer candidates for this class. Remember, having a demon familiar can be a double edged sword."</p><p> </p><p>"On one hand having a demon familiar can be very empowering for an exorcist. On the other hand if your will is weak and you cannot control your demon it can turn on you."</p><p> </p><p>Neuhaus Sensei gave Yukio a piercing look.</p><p> </p><p>"Be careful"</p><p> </p><p>He cleared his throat and passed out a worksheet.</p><p> </p><p>"Your homework is to spend time with your new familiars, get to know their strengths and weaknesses, their likes and dislikes. Eventually we will discuss strategies for your familiars in field operations. For now you need to build trust and the foundation for a working relationship."</p><p> </p><p>Renzo said a little too loudly "All right! No homework for the rest of us!"</p><p> </p><p>Neuhaus Sensei ignored Renzo's outburst. "Homework for those of you who did not summon a familiar is to research demon contracts. Even though you don't have the innate ability to summon a demon directly from Gehenna that doesn't preclude the possibility of demonic assistance for exorcism. Gehennen politics are dynamic and factious, the old adage 'the enemy of my enemy is a potential ally' holds very true."</p><p> </p><p>"That's all for today. Please straighten up the classroom before you leave and have a good weekend, class is dismissed."</p><p> </p><p>Neuhaus left as the bell rang, swinging his briefcase in his hand, the massive compass held threateningly just over his shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Yukio turned as the door shut and sighed quietly at the mess in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>Quite a few desks were damaged by the earlier scuffle, no doubt because of Rin.</p><p> </p><p>There was a slowly drying pool of his blood staining the floor and small scraps of summoning paper littered the floor like confetti.</p><p> </p><p>"Class dismissed." Yukio said flatly.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you sure Okumura Sensei?" Ryuji  asked "We can stay and help."</p><p> </p><p>"No, go on. I would like to take care of this myself."</p><p> </p><p>With that Yukio began righting desks as his students filed out. Rin lingered uncertainly finally coming over and helping Yukio move the desks back into place.</p><p> </p><p>"Man, some of these are really banged up."</p><p> </p><p>Rin chuckled nervously running a hand through the hair on the back of his head.</p><p> </p><p>"That thing pointed a stick at you then all of a sudden you were on the floor and with your blood everywhere....I lost it a little. But on the plus side, I didn't flame up!"</p><p> </p><p>Yukio chuckled weakly and pushed his glasses back to a more comfortable position.</p><p> </p><p>"I have to give you credit there Nii-san, you didn't lose control completely."</p><p> </p><p>Rin expression was contrite. "I'm sorry Yukio, I....." </p><p> </p><p>Looking down at the red stains on his brother's shirt and the dark pool of blood on the floor Rin frowned. </p><p> </p><p>Yukio sighed. "I don't blame you. It was my fault to begin with. I saw you holding the summoning papers and I freaked out. I didn't even notice I had cut myself...."</p><p> </p><p>Rin looked down at his hand. "They aren't exactly claws but they are sharper and stronger than normal human nails."</p><p> </p><p>"I know and I should have been careful but I was scared you were going to summon a demon and get yourself hurt."</p><p> </p><p>Rin grinned a little "So basically you jumped in and acted stupid for me, I feel the love Ototou!"</p><p> </p><p>Yukio ignored Rin's jibe in favor of removing his uniform coat to inspect the damage. "Look at this! And my shirt is a mess too! I have no idea how I am going to make it back to our dorm without scaring anyone."</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah and there really isn't much we can do about the broken desks but we should probably look for a mop before all the blood dries."</p><p> </p><p>Yukio sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose under his glasses "I wish we could just put it all back the way it was before."</p><p> </p><p>"Repairo!"</p><p> </p><p>Yukio jumped when his shirt suddenly rippled, the rent shreds wriggling back together before his eyes like watching a film in reverse.</p><p> </p><p>Startled cobalt blue eyes met his own teal. The desks, hell, everything in the room suddenly looked like it was brand new and there was a stack of pristine summoning papers on the floor.</p><p> </p><p>"Scourgify!"</p><p> </p><p>The floor shined softly, the not a speck of blood to be seen. Yukio looked down in wonder at snowy whiteness of his suddenly pristine dress shirt.</p><p> </p><p>Yukio's familiar stood with it's stick angled away so as to appear nonthreatening but still ready to take action.</p><p> </p><p>Rin was the first one to break the astonished silence.</p><p> </p><p>"No fucking way! That isn't a stick, that's a magic wand! Your familiar can do magic, bro I'm so jealous of you!"</p><p> </p><p>Rin slung an arm over Yukio's shoulder to pull him into a congratulatory hug not noticing the slight shaking of Yukio's body.</p><p> </p><p>Yukio pushed Rin off and grabbed the demon roughly by the cloak. </p><p> </p><p>"Why now!?" He snarled. </p><p> </p><p>"Why the fuck are you here now? Why not ten weeks ago, why not two years ago, hell, why not when I was just a little kid and I needed you?!" </p><p> </p><p>Yukio aggressively shook the slight figure like a rag doll, but it made no sound or moved to defend itself, and the deep  shadows of it's cowl gave nothing away.</p><p> </p><p>"Woah Yukio calm down." </p><p> </p><p>Rin tried to intercede but only succeeded in making Yukio spin around and grab him by the lapels.</p><p> </p><p>"God dammit Rin! You saw what it did!"</p><p> </p><p>"It cut me to ribbons in one second and then healed me in the next! If it would have come when I needed it Tou-san would still be alive and you wouldn't be here!"</p><p> </p><p>Rin scowled darkly. "You still don't want me here, is that it?"</p><p> </p><p>Yukio spluttered in rage. </p><p> </p><p>"Of course I don't want you here! You being here puts you in danger and fuck! If you never had to unseal that cursed demon sword you would still be a human being!"</p><p> </p><p>"I could be going to school without having to worry about whether or not you are going to snap and go on a killing spree, or hell, more likely, get your dumb ass killed because you don't fucking think!"</p><p> </p><p>"What would have happened Rin!? You see what I summoned and I'm the human one of the two of us, what the hell do you think your demon blood would have pulled through?!"</p><p> </p><p>"An eldritch horror from the void?! The fucking Gehenna gate?!"</p><p> </p><p>"Satan himself could have come through, possessed you and we would all be dead now!"</p><p> </p><p>Yukio growled in anger and frustration as he opened the classroom door.</p><p> </p><p>"I am not a child anymore Rin! I haven't been for a long time. It's high time that you grew up as well, and if you can't get over this suicidal tendency to throw yourself on the nearest grenade I swear to God I will lock you up and throw away the fucking key!"</p><p> </p><p>Swinging his coat over his shoulder he yelled "Be home before dark!"</p><p> </p><p>An echoing crack followed the door slamming shut behind Yukio.</p><p> </p><p>Rin hesitated for a moment and then rushed to follow his brother but by the time he reached the door the hallway was clear.</p><p> </p><p>"He must have used one of his keys, fuck."</p><p> </p><p>Rin sighed and slid down the door to sit on the floor. His tail, which had come unbound from around his waist, twitched back and forth erratically.</p><p> </p><p>"Are you ok?"</p><p> </p><p>Rin looked up, Yukio's familiar was crouched down angled towards him apparently trying to show concern.</p><p> </p><p>Feeling caught out by the fact that a total stranger, a demon no less, was showing more concern over his well being than his own blood relation, Rin let out a startled laugh that quickly turned into choking sobs. Leaning forward he buried his face in cool fabric as strong arms came up to embrace him.</p><p> </p><p>Rin was surprised to find that Yukio's familiar was nice to hug. </p><p> </p><p>The hard looking scales of it's arms were individually solid but together as a whole were supple and flexible like fine chain mail. The demon's cloak enveloped him and for the first time since he was a young child Rin felt completely safe. Eventually his keening noises quieted and his tears lessened; leaning back slightly he began drying his face with the hem of his shirt.</p><p> </p><p>Yukio's familiar stood silently and held out it's hand. Blushing at his loss of composure Rin took the offered hand and stood up.</p><p> </p><p>"Thanks, it's been a really bad couple of months."</p><p> </p><p>Yukio's familiar nodded in agreement and then crossed it's arms "Now what?"</p><p> </p><p>"I guess we should head home before it gets late. Spotty face four eyes was so mad he left his briefcase." </p><p> </p><p>Rin gestured towards the teachers lectern.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you mind grabbing that?"</p><p> </p><p>"No problem." The demon picked up the briefcase checking that the latches were closed completely. </p><p> </p><p>"Follow me, you should be staying with us in our dorm. Yukio is my younger twin brother and my name is Rin."</p><p> </p><p>"We have our own dorm building because, as you may have heard when Yukio screamed it in my face, I have demon blood that awakened about ten weeks ago.  It isn't safe for me to be housed with the rest of the students. I guess you wouldn't really care about that...." </p><p> </p><p>Rin looked back at the familiar who gave a shrug.</p><p> </p><p>"No, not really, even as a demon you seem like a better person than the humans I have known."</p><p> </p><p>Rin blushed deeply "Um, thanks, that's really nice. Most people seem to hate my guts on principle."</p><p> </p><p>The demon chortled. "That is also something I am familiar with."</p><p> </p><p>Rin smiled and opened a door at the end of the hallway. </p><p> </p><p>They stepped out into weak sunlight, the sky was already taking on a amber glow and the shadows were long and deep.</p><p> </p><p>"Wow, it's a lot later than I thought it was. Um, you would probably like to know where you were summoned to."</p><p> </p><p>"This is True Cross Academy, the exorcist cram school you appeared in is a secret and only a tiny part of the school here. The school itself is massive, exclusive and highly ranked. We are in Japan, outside of Tokyo, you don't speak Japanese do you?"</p><p> </p><p>"No, I speak English but I can understand you, Yukio and whatever Yukio hears that he is paying attention to."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh, so that's how you understood Neuhaus Sensei. We understand each other because I am a demon too."</p><p> </p><p>Yukio's familiar shrugged. </p><p> </p><p>"I don't mind, I suppose I will have to learn your language eventually but right now I am just happy to be somewhere. I'm not sure how long I was in limbo."</p><p> </p><p>"Well if it helps it's the year 2010 and we are still in the beginning of the school year."</p><p> </p><p>The demon stumbled slightly as they crossed a bridge.</p><p> </p><p>"Fifteen years! I have been less than nothing in nowhere for fifteen years!"</p><p> </p><p>"Um wow, I'm fifteen, that's a long time...." realizing too late how tactless his statement was Rin trailed off uncomfortably. </p><p> </p><p>As they made their way up a wide stone staircase the gloomy shadow of the old men's dorm engulfed them.</p><p> </p><p>"Despite looking like the set of a horror film it's the safest building on campus. Anyone trying to break in without the key will get bounced into the courtyard with extreme prejudice by the wards."</p><p> </p><p>Rin pulled out an utterly mundane key and unlocked the front door.</p><p> </p><p>"Some of the keys we have are magic and turn doorways into portals to specific locations. The key to the dorm is just a regular key, I will see about getting you a copy."</p><p> </p><p>Rin gallantly held the door open for the demon before he turned to lock it behind them.</p><p> </p><p>"We have to keep the front door secure so random students don't stumble in while trying to find a place to party."</p><p> </p><p>Rin laughed "It's just the two of us here so there isn't much to show you. Let's check in on Yukio and see what he wants for dinner."</p><p> </p><p>They turned down a poorly lit hallway and ascended a flight of scuffed but still sturdy stairs.</p><p> </p><p>After five landings Rin led the demon out of the stairwell and down the hall.</p><p> </p><p>He stopped at the door numbered 602 and held up his hand.</p><p> </p><p>"Shhhhh, let's sneak in real quick and see what Yukio is up to."</p><p> </p><p>Rin opened the door quietly; the room was cast in shadow with the exception of a small desk lamp.</p><p> </p><p>The lamp was mounted to the left side of a divider that evenly split the area in front a large window. In the left alcove below the lamp was a desk that was almost totally devoid of books but somehow still messily covered in crap. Conversely, the desk to the right of the divider was crammed with books but was neat as a pin.</p><p> </p><p>"Ah man. It looks like Yukio is in bed for the night." Rin whispered quietly. </p><p> </p><p>He gestured to the shadowy sleeping platform on the other side of the room. The chair, which would normally be pushed into the right hand desk was placed near the head of the bed with Yukio's heavy black exorcists coat draped over it.</p><p> </p><p>"He only does that when he doesn't want to be woken up for anything less than a structure fire." </p><p> </p><p>Rin noticed the half empty glass of water on the floor and sighed.</p><p> </p><p>"Damn. He probably took a sleeping aid too which means he skipped dinner."</p><p> </p><p>"I was hoping we could talk things out over food but it doesn't look like that's going to happen tonight. How about you, hungry at all?"</p><p> </p><p>"I should be, I'm not really sure though. I have gone a long time without eating before and sometimes you forget because you just get used to feeling empty."</p><p> </p><p>The repressed pain in the demon's quiet voice made Rin's stomach ache sympathetically. </p><p> </p><p>"That sounds awful, I love food, in fact I love to cook too so how about you and I go down to the kitchen and see what I can whip up." </p><p> </p><p>Rin half turned and stopped short.</p><p> </p><p>"I don't want to assume but would you like to change out of all this." Rin waved his hand vaguely gesturing to the cloak and boots.</p><p> </p><p>"That would be nice but I'm not sure what I have with me that's appropriate to wear."</p><p> </p><p>"Oh no problem, if you don't mind I can give you some sweatpants and a t-shirt to wear."</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, that sounds nice."</p><p> </p><p>Rin bent down to rummage through his drawers while the demon carefully pulled out the chair from the left hand desk. </p><p> </p><p>The cloak swirled away into nothing before the demon put a boot down on the chair and began methodically unbuckleing. Repeating the same sequence with the other boot, eventually both shoes were removed and placed carefully under the desk.</p><p> </p><p>With a flourish of cloth the demon sat down on the chair and bent over.</p><p> </p><p>Rin saw the motion in the corner of his eye and turned involuntarily to look.</p><p> </p><p>A long sleeve double breasted surcoat made of some kind of green scaled material was draped casually over the back of the chair, and black pants made out of some sort of animal skin, like something off a giant lizard, pooled around the demon's feet. It was bent over at the waist, a shock of unruly dark red hair obscured it's face while it fiddled around trying to pull off socks and pants all in one go.</p><p> </p><p>The demon sat up and upon catching Rin's dumbfounded expression began apologizing. </p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry for putting my manky boots up on the chair but they are a real pain in the ass to get off."</p><p> </p><p>Rin gaped in astonishment at the demon's lean tanned legs, letting his eyes trail up to small black athletic shorts, flared hips, trim waist and a generous amount of cleavage peaking out of the top of a utilitarian black sports bra.</p><p> </p><p>"Holy crap you are a girl!" </p><p> </p><p>Rin was a little loud in his shock and demon lept forward to clap a hand over his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>"Shhhhh, be quiet." </p><p> </p><p>They both froze in place for entirely different reasons.</p><p> </p><p>Rin, who was scant inches away from burying his face in her chest, choked down a whine.</p><p> </p><p>The demon posed silently with her hand over Rin's mouth watching Yukio's side of the room intently. Satisfied that Yukio was still asleep she whispered into Rin's ear.</p><p> </p><p>"Did you find something for me to wear?"</p><p> </p><p>Overwrought Rin mutely held out a handful of garments and when it became apparent that she was going to strip the rest of the way in front of him he slammed his eyelids closed.</p><p> </p><p>He could hear the soft shuffling of her bare feet on the wood floor as she exchanged her shorts for his sweat pants and the muted thud of her bra hitting the side of his bed barely registered over the blood pounding in his ears.</p><p> </p><p>"All done." She said softly as she slipped on a spare set of house shoes.</p><p> </p><p>"All right then." Rin squeaked.</p><p> </p><p>He shuffled dazedly out of the room leading the way.</p><p> </p><p>As they decended to the first floor Rin worked on calming down by counting the stairs as they went.</p><p> </p><p>Somewhere around stair number 30 he felt like he could breathe normally. The intial shock of seeing how powerful Yukio was based on the demon he summoned was passing and now he was worried. Not only was the demon a wand wielding honest to god magical badass with a sword, she was also totally human looking which sent a shiver down Rin's spine.</p><p> </p><p>As they reached the first floor Rin put that thought aside and as he crossed through the cafeteria to the kitchen Rin finally felt  in control of himself again. </p><p> </p><p>"Hey Ukobach! What's in the fridge?" He called out cheerfully.</p><p> </p><p>Ukobach meeped a short answer but they could both clearly hear him say "A little bit of everything, who's your friend?"</p><p> </p><p>"This is Yukio's new familiar.....ummm you know what, I'm sorry I never asked your name!" </p><p> </p><p>Rin looked thoroughly embarrassed by his oversight and Yukio's familiar laughed lightly at his discomfort. </p><p> </p><p>"It's ok, Harry is fine."</p><p> </p><p>Ukobach scrambled up the cabinet and onto the counter next to Harry, reaching out with his hands he asked "May I?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry nodded and the diminutive stove sprit traced one finger gently across her upper lip looking for fangs that were not there while his other hand was feeling the rounded shell of her ear.</p><p> </p><p>"How strange!" He squeaked "Are your demonic powers sealed?"</p><p> </p><p>She frowned "Not that I'm aware of."</p><p> </p><p>"No way!" Seconded Rin "When Harry was summoned it was terrifying, she's way powerful!"</p><p> </p><p>"Interesting!" Ukobach chirped and shrugged "Just when you think you've seen it all....anyway what do you kids want to eat?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled shyly "I haven't had Japanese food before so I don't know what I like but I will try whatever you want to make."</p><p> </p><p>"What is your favorite food?"</p><p> </p><p>"I love treacle tart, it's a kind of dessert and pretty much anything with bacon in it is always a winner."</p><p> </p><p>Ukobach looked over at Rin. </p><p> </p><p>"How does okonomiyaki for dinner and syrup filled melonpan for dessert sound?"</p><p> </p><p>"That sounds good let me start the cabbage and the bacon if you want to handle the batter for okonomiyaki and the melonpan dough."</p><p> </p><p>Ukobach nodded and started pulling out mixing bowls while Rin rummaged through the fridge.</p><p> </p><p>Harry hopped up on an unused section of the countertop. Swinging her feet idly she  watched the two chefs at work.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm a pretty decent cook but I grew up cooking British food. Probably the most exotic thing I can make is pub style curry chips."</p><p> </p><p>Rin laughed "I don't know, that sounds pretty exotic to me."</p><p> </p><p>"Deep fried potato slices topped with sautéed vegetables in a mild yellow curry" Ukobatch said without taking his eyes off the batter he was mixing.</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled "Basically what he said is it. You can add some diced chicken in to make it a more substantial meal but it's pretty basic to prepare."</p><p> </p><p>"There is nothing wrong with that, the basics are the foundation of cooking. As long as it tastes good and makes you feel good it doesn't matter if it is stew or a soufflé."</p><p> </p><p>"Well in that case Rin just keep in mind if you want it boiled, roasted or fried then I'm your girl!"</p><p> </p><p>"Good to know! And for everything else there is Ukobach." </p><p> </p><p>Ukobach took a moment to give a funny little bow and the kitchen was bright with laughter.</p><p> </p><p>Dinner was satisfying and after dessert the three demons drank a soothing cup of tea while they chatted about living accommodations.</p><p> </p><p>"Ukobach likes to sleep in the kitchen near the stove but I am guessing you would probably like a bed to sleep on."</p><p> </p><p>"I have a bed!" Ukobach grumbled indignantly.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, and it's a lovely sack of buckwheat hulls. Harry, it would be no problem to clear out a room for you. You can pick one near ours or on a different floor if you like, we have the building to ourselves so we can do pretty much what we want."</p><p> </p><p>Harry sat finger combing her hair with one hand while she stifled a yarn with another.</p><p> </p><p>"Maybe we can do that tomorrow. I'm exhausted and I would really like to see where Yukio wants me before I get settled in anywhere. Can I sleep with you tonite?"</p><p> </p><p>Rin spluttered into his tea cup for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>"Yeah if that's what you want, you don't have to worry about me trying any funny stuff. Personally I don't to be murdered in my sleep even if it's death by cute girl." </p><p> </p><p>"But I warn you I snore sometimes and my tail has a mind of it's own."</p><p> </p><p>Harry chuckled weakly.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm not worried about it. This has been a very difficult day but you have been kind and honestly anything is better than where I was, so thank you."</p><p> </p><p>Rin blushed at the compliment and turned to Ukobach.</p><p> </p><p>"Not to change the subject but do you want help cleaning up in here?"</p><p> </p><p>"No, I can handle it. You kids get some rest."</p><p> </p><p>Rin and Harry sleepily said good night and shuffled up the stairs.</p><p> </p>
