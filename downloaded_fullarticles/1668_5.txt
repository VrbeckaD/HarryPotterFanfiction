    <p>
  <span>Who am I?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I'm really not sure. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>My name---this name---is Alice</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice Samantha Morrigan</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I'm cursed</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I don't know how long I've been alive</span>
</p><p>
  <span>How many times my heart has beat</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But I remember the beginning</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Some laugh when I say her name</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tatania</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fairy queen</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A Shakespearean legend</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A comedy, of all things</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They don't know how painful it was</span>
</p><p>
  <span> Being drugged over and over,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The juice from that accursed flower</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Seeping under her eyelids</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The one she trusted</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her husband </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He took her child</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The child of her best friend</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The only thing left she had of her</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And used the flower over and over</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Humiliating her</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Taunting her</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Using her</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Until she broke </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I remember the spell</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The chant she used</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My soul will move on</span>
</p><p>
  <span>until one may find</span>
</p><p>
  <span>a happiness in love</span>
</p><p>
  <span>bright enough for the world to see.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then she fell</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I remember another</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alice</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice Liddell</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice in Wonderland</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice who's dreams and imagination inspired a world</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alice who lost her love</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her prince. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And threw her spirit into another</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A different,</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A love without a love</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without a passion.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span> Hiding away the magic behind her eyes</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hiding away her power</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Angie</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Angie Martinelli</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A character</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Someone who worked so hard for a break that was never as big as they'd dreamed</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Someone who fell in love</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With the wrong kind of love. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Someone who spent hours talking, laughing, and stealing kisses in hidden corridors. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With her,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Peggy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With someone who's smile filled the room and who's laugh was more precious than diamond. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Someone who they worked with, day and night. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Creating a legacy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>S.H.I.E.L.D. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But never showing the full story,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Never able to bring their love into the light. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No matter how strong,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>How pure,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>How powerful,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It could never be shown. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So they hid,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hiding their light.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Saving it for dark corners,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Closed doors,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For their hearts only. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And now me. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Alice Samantha Morrigan. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A dreamer,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Someone filled with ambition, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And wondering. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Someone who is nervous,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Scared, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And passionate for the smallest of things. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Finding the magic. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Falling into rabbit holes,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Fairy circles,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And worlds of wondrous proportions. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Uncovering her power left behind by her queen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Finding the remnants </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of Tatania, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of Alice,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of Angie,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of the queens and goddesses before her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Taking these woman, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her past,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And making them her future. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A brighter future. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I hope. </span>
