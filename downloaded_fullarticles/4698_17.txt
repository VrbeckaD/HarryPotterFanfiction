It smelled funky, like bad potions and sadness. The chairs were hard and not comfy. The grownups around him, mostly Ginny’s family, didn’t seem to be helping any because they all smelled scared. Victoire had offered to share her coloring stuff, but she had the markers that smelled wrong, which just added to the bad smells. He restlessly paced around the waiting room. Harry had said he was going to be allowed to help with the new baby, that James was <em>his</em> baby brother, so Teddy should be allowed to help, not forced to wait here.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe I should take the kids home,” Aunt Fleur said. Teddy growled loudly. He wasn’t leaving Harry! Most of the grownups looked like they were going to start scolding but Aunt Fleur just looked amused by the reminder of the wolf he had inside him. “Or perhaps not, if the <em>loup pygmée</em> feels so strongly.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not <em>little</em>,” Teddy protested, making everyone chuckle. He growled again when she pulled him into her lap as he passed her. The grumpy feeling faded as she rubbed her nose against his cheek and over his jaw. He nuzzled into her neck, letting her scent chase away the bad smells surrounding him. He heard Aunt Fleur talking to the other Weasleys and Nonna, but since she made no move to leave, Teddy let himself relax against her. She wasn’t as comforting as Harry, but she didn’t mind when he rubbed his cheek against her like a lot of the family did.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry?” Nonna asked, sounding more worried than Teddy had ever heard her. He jerked out of Fleur’s lap and raced towards his godfather. Harry crouched down to catch him and didn’t seem upset about what Nonna would call his ‘uncouth behavior’. Harry’s arms only tightened when Teddy pressed his nose into his neck like he had just been doing to Aunt Fleur. Harry smelled both sad and happy, which was weird, but everything was weird and no one was explaining anything, so maybe it was still safe. “Harry, what’s wrong?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ginny didn’t—” Harry swallowed hard as if the words got caught. Teddy pressed closer as the sadness in Harry’s scent spiked. “Ginny didn’t make it, but James did. He’s healthy, but I can’t explain right now.” Harry stood, keeping Teddy in his arms like he was a baby despite him being five. “I need to take Teddy to meet James before they move Ginny. It’s important. Fleur or Bill can explain.”</p><p> </p><p>With those words, Harry carried him down the hall to a room that smelled even worse than the waiting room. Teddy didn’t see any blood though. The room was clean, even the bed that held Ginny looking like she could just be asleep. In a bassinet near her head was a baby wrapped in the yellow and black blanket Teddy had been sleeping with so that James would have his scent and wouldn’t be lonely. Harry put Teddy on the bed near the bassinet. After a cautious glance at Ginny to confirm what Harry had said, Teddy focused on the baby.</p><p> </p><p>“Lord Potter, this is highly irregular,” grumbled a healer that Teddy hadn’t noticed by the door. He didn’t bother looking at her now, because Harry would take care of everything. That’s what Harry did and why he was awesome. “You need to let us finish—”</p><p> </p><p>“Undersecretary Granger already explained Title II, Section 5 of the <em>Parahuman Act of 1999</em> to you, Healer Faible, so I’m just going to remind you that my godson has inherited lycanthropy traits before you make a complete arse of yourself. You can thank me later.”</p><p> </p><p>Teddy ignored the grownups who continued to argue. The healer would accept that Harry knew everything about everything eventually and right now, the baby was more interesting. Teddy leaned over the bassinet carefully as he tried to get close enough to really smell him. His smell was <em>wrong</em> in a vaguely threatening way. Teddy whined as he pulled away only to bump into Harry.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, it’s okay,” Harry soothed as he held Teddy.  He whined again as his wolf urged him to escape and take Harry with him. “I know James smells a little strange, doesn’t he? Do you understand why?” Teddy stilled, pressing hard against Harry. Harry meant safety. “It’s how he was born, which I know you won’t really understand right now, but I promise that James is safe to be around and I know a trick to help your wolf accept that.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry guided him through the motions of scenting Ginny one last time, which made him realize what the strangeness in James’ smell was. Soon Harry had him and James in a big chair tucked into the corner of the room as the healer took Ginny away. James still smelled strange, but Harry was right about his furry part understanding that James was safe like Harry. Teddy pressed his nose to his new brother’s cheek, memorizing his scent like all the others of their family.</p><p> </p><p>James was <em>his</em>, just like Harry was, and Teddy didn’t care if he was little, he was going to protect them just like Ginny would if she was here. Deep within, his wolf growled in agreement as James wrapped his fingers around one of Teddy’s. Teddy grinned down at <em>his</em> brother.</p></div>
