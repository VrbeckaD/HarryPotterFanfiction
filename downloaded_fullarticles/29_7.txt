    <p>Draco<br/>"First day on the job? You'll do fine just don't start crying like the other guy" A large hand was pushed on my back as I was forced into a busy kitchen. The room was covered in white tile with dark wood flooring. Pots, pans, and other helpful kitchen utensils where hanging on the wall just waiting for someone to use. I tie my hair up and walk fast into an empty space in the kitchen. An apron is thrown at me, I catch it before it reaches my face. I tie it on as fast as I can then start to look for things to do. I start to walk towards the counter where a whole raw chicken lays. Before I can reach it a hand grabs the back of my apron.</p><p><br/>"That's not for you doll" A high pitched voice flows through my ears making me wince. "You're the new guy, right? Well, you get the pleasure of helping me with the appetizers". I look up to find my self staring into the most vibrant brown eyes iv ever seen. "Names Pansy" her short-cropped hair changes loose on her round pug like face, "I'm Draco" I answer timidly, "Well Draco it's nice to meet you" Pansy drags me by my arm to her little station. She stares at the counter trying to think of something worth cooking.</p><p><br/>"I think a bruschetta would be a good appetizer, who doesn't love bread? It's light and easy to experiment with." I look at Pansy then the vast amount of bread on the counter. I cross my fingers in hoping she won't laugh in my face.</p><p><br/>"Brilliant idea doll! I'll start gathering ingredients you start cutting the bread" Pansy's enthusiastic tone calms my nerves a bit. We both start to work on the appetizers in silence. Time starts to fly as Pansy and I start to talk. I find out she left her family in hopes of finding a job to support them. She hates the color red, which makes me laugh because Gryffindoria's national color is red. She has a sense of humor I could get used to. I tell her then I was kicked out of my house for my sexual preference in men. Tall ones with shaggy hair and preferably large hands. I love the color green and I have the world's largest sweet tooth. As Pansy and I add the finishing touches on the appetizer a man comes busting through the door.</p><p><br/>"Appetizers are needed!" The mans voice echoes off the walls of the kitchen straight into my ears. As the man turns on his heels and walks back out the door Pansy takes her apron off and smoothes down her simple gray dress.</p><p>"That's us! come on we have no time to waste". I rip my apron off and start to grab for the plates full of bread covered with roasted tomatoes, cheese, parsley, and various oils. Pansy and I make our way towards the main dining hall. I can feel sweat run down my back, locks of my hair fall from my ponytail framing my face. I make my way down a grand hallway filled with paintings as far as the eyes can see. I can only assume the portraits are of past rulers of the kingdom. The last painting in line had a tall man with dark hair that was slicked back, he wore red clothing that looks soft enough to sleep in. The woman in the chair in front of him had the most mesmerizing eyes. As green, as they come, her hair was fire red and worn in an elegant bun on top of her head. What really caught my interest was the man standing next to his father. His hair was a charcoal black and it was as messy as they come. A true rats nest if you ask me. He has broad shoulders and a strong chest under his shirt. Lastly, he has his mother's eyes. The emerald green feels as if they are staring into my soul, reading me like a book. I could not stare for too long before Pansy pushed me along. I enter the dining room with a cart full of food. It was as grand as they come. Not just one, not two but three crystal chandeliers hang from the grand ceiling. The red rug was laid where the table sat but the rest of the floor was a polished wood. Cabinets lined the room with flowers, picture frames and other rich people things lay on top of them. Grand windows show a beautiful few of the sunset and are framed with deep golden curtains. I can't help but let my self get lost in the setting sun for a moment before making my way to the table. The table was long enough to fill a small army. People in fancy clothing with jewels that cost more than my life sat at said table with there nose high in the air. Pansy and I start to place appetizers on the royal family's plates and esteem guests. The king at the head of the table thanks Pansy when she puts down her plate. I walk over the prince and start to put his plate down.</p><p><br/>"Pardon my reach" I put his plate down then feel a rough hand brush across my face into my hair. My neck snaps to see the prince rolling a lock of my hair in his fingers.</p><p><br/>"Iv never saw hair as white as yours, its fascinating." The prince's voice washes over me and heats my skin like a warm fire. It's deep, rough and everything I crave in a voice. I watch his hand come closer to my face. A finger grazes my cheek liting a fire under my skin. "Your blushing doll, " He says as he shows off his teeth in a widespread grin. I hurry back to where the plates are and continue on. The blush seems to have stuck to my face because I hear the king give a hardy laugh and smack his son on the back.</p><p><br/>"Now Harry place nice. He looks like he will catch fire any moment my boy!" Harry's eyes find mine in a matter of seconds. Time almost feels frozen. I can't move, I can't breathe, my heart is pounding in my chest like a stampede. After a second Harry's lips form a genuine smile, I can't help but smile back at the beauty of the prince's face. I look down at the floor start to walk back to the kitchen with Pansy hot on my heels. I give one last look and see Harry's eyes still glued to my retreating form. Out of the corner of my eye, I see the queen wink at me. Dear god, I think I just experienced love at first sight,</p>
