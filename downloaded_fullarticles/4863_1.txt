    <p>The Hogwarts Express hadn’t been exactly how he imagined it, though things rarely were. The scarlet steam engine was infinitely more beautiful than he thought it would be, and it was teeming with far more people than he ever could have expected.</p><p> </p><p>He clutched the handle of his trunk tightly, and watched the sea of people move and part. He was very acutely aware that he didn’t know anyone in the large station. His parents had wanted to come, of course, but he begged them to stay outside the platform. It was time he learned to do things on his own, and they wouldn’t be able to accompany him to school, after all. As he looked around and saw all manner of parents kissing their children goodbye, fussing with their hair and clothes, rearranging their trunks, he realized he might have made a mistake.</p><p> </p><p>It was okay, though. Remus was used to being alone. He knew the feeling well. He tried to make himself smaller than he already was to navigate the crowd, hoping no one would notice him. He made it onto the train without anyone stopping him, and for that he was grateful. The compartments were mostly full already, a consequence of him having been late. He might have saved some time had he not procrastinated on the platform, not wanting to say goodbye to his parents quite yet. He walked further and further down the train, briefly glancing to check each one before moving onto the next.</p><p> </p><p>He had made it nearly down to the end of the train when he stumbled upon a compartment that wasn’t completely full. A boy he assumed was his age or maybe a year older sat alone, staring out the window. His blonde hair had been flattened to his head in a combover, and he was a little chubby for his age. He looked as out of place as Remus felt, and so he dragged his trunk in and sat across from him. He knew he ought to introduce himself, apologize for barging in, but the words wouldn’t come. Instead, he pulled his trunk close to his knees, and held it tight to his body, as though it would ground him.</p><p> </p><p>The boy looked at him with amusement on his face. “You can put that up, or store it under your seat, you know.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus had known, he had seen the other boy’s trunk stowed away. “Right. Thank you.” It was all he could think to say.</p><p> </p><p>“Name’s Peter, by the way. Peter Pettigrew.” He extended a hand across for him to shake.</p><p> </p><p>Remus, ever the master of social graces, released the handle of his trunk and realized his palms were sweaty. He wiped them off on his sweater before taking Peter’s hand. “Remus. Remus Lupin.” He offered a smile, which the other boy returned. Good. At least that wasn’t so bad. The silence that filled their compartment after their introduction was oddly comfortable. He got the idea that Peter was used to spending a lot of time alone as well.</p><p> </p><p>Remus had been halfway into his trunk to retrieve a book when the compartment door opened again. The two boys who entered were in animated conversation, barely bothering to cast a glance at either Remus or Peter as they settled in.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, the Chudley Cannons are garbage, I like the Harpies, that Gwendolyn is something else -”</p><p> </p><p>“At least the Cannons are funny, way more interesting to watch one of their matches, they haven’t won a game since before Hogwarts was founded.”</p><p> </p><p>Both of the newcomers appeared to also be First Years, though they each had about a head of height on Remus. The first had messy black hair and glasses, he was half into his Hogwarts uniform already, and didn’t seem to notice or care that his cloak was hanging halfway off his shoulders. He was twirling his wand in his right hand, spinning it between his fingers, and he had been smiling since he entered the compartment. This is who took the seat next to him, and he scooted himself so far over to make room that he found himself uncomfortably pressed against the side of the car.</p><p> </p><p>The second had longer, dark hair, which he had just pulled free of its binding and shook loose, running his fingers through it. He was lankier, had a more graceful way of moving than the first, something Remus thought odd. He looked as if he had also changed recently, but instead of his uniform, he was wearing muggle clothes. Another oddity. He got the impression that the two boys had grown up together, or at least that they had known each other for a long time. They were talking fast and laughing loudly. Once they were settled, Remus reached back into his trunk and pulled out his book. He was more than ready to read now, hoping it would stop them from talking to him, sitting the book on his lap as he closed his trunk.</p><p> </p><p>“Oi. You can put that up, you know,” the boy with the long hair said, giving him a smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Already told him that,” Peter murmured, just now moving his eyes from the window.</p><p> </p><p>“Very astute observation,” The one with the glasses said, laughing. “Don’t know how you figured it out from looking out the window. Train’s not even moving, mate.” The boy with the long hair laughed, and Peter rolled his eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not the one who refuses to stow their trunk.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not – refusing. It’s just...more convenient this way,” Remus said, feeling the need to stick up for himself.</p><p> </p><p>“James, he’s trying to <em> read </em>,” The long haired boy said, a hint of disgust in his voice, as his eyes fell to the book in Remus’ lap.</p><p> </p><p>The boy with the glasses, apparently called James, gasped. “Read? On the way to <em> school </em>? How? Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“We can’t allow it. It isn’t right. Enjoy the last moments of your freedom, will you?”</p><p> </p><p>Remus looked at the book in his lap, then back up to the boy with long hair, who was looking at him expectantly. He sighed, sliding the book back into his trunk.</p><p> </p><p>“See? It is convenient. Imagine if it was under my seat, would have had to stand up and everything. Besides,” Remus continued. “I may not know how to store my trunk, but I at least know how to put on a cloak.” He jerked his head in James’ direction. James, just now having realized how off-kilter his cloak was, tugged it on straight with a laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s much better. Save the textbooks for the classroom. We’re going to be doing enough reading to bore me to sleep for the next seven lifetimes. What’s your name, anyway?” The long haired boy was looking at him again.</p><p> </p><p>“Remus Lupin. You?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sirius Black. This one’s James Potter, by the way. Lovely to meet you.” He was grinning.</p><p> </p><p>“Absolutely charmed,” Peter interjected, annoyed that he was being excluded. “Peter Pettigrew, by the way. Did I hear you right? You’re a Black?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of the Noble and Most Ancient House,” Sirius replied, in a voice thick with mockery.</p><p> </p><p>“Wow,” Peter said, looking at Sirius with something new in his eyes. “I’ve heard loads about your family.” Remus had never heard anything about the Black family, but that was likely due to the fact he didn’t know many wizarding surnames. His family kept them somewhat isolated.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well, they’re all terrible, so forget what you’ve heard,” Sirius said, his face curling up in disgust. “Every single one of them. Well, except Andromeda, but you’ve really got to catch her on the right day. My brother’s not so bad, either, but it’s only a matter of time before my Mum gets to him, too.”</p><p> </p><p>“Meanwhile, nobody is asking the brilliant son of the illustrious potion maker, Fleamont Potter, about his family history,” James said, with a dramatic sigh. He punctuated his distaste by falling back into his seat.  “How many things has my dad invented only to get upstaged by the Noble and Most Ancient House of Whatever, No One Cares? Honestly.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve never heard of either of you,” Remus said, truthfully. He was beginning to wonder if he was the only non-Pureblood in the room. The idea made him uneasy – would they care? Would they treat him differently?</p><p> </p><p>“That’s probably a good thing, mate.” Remus didn’t think that he imagined that Sirius looked a little bit relieved.</p><p> </p><p>Still, Peter persisted. “Your whole family’s in Slytherin.” There was a hint of awe in his voice.</p><p> </p><p>“Not me,” Sirius said, as confidently as if he’d already been sorted. “I’m going to be in Gryffindor.”</p><p> </p><p>“Quite right you are, with me. My whole family’s been in Gryffindor. I think my mom’s got a second cousin who got sorted into Hufflepuff, but that’s not so bad,” James said, reaching across to pat Sirius’ arm.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m probably going to be in Hufflepuff,” Peter said, a hint of dismay in his voice.</p><p> </p><p>“What about you, Remus? Where do you think you’ll end up?” Sirius asked.</p><p> </p><p>Remus definitely did not feel particularly brave, so Gryffindor was out. He wasn’t especially smart, so he didn’t think he’d end up in Ravenclaw. He thought he might end up in Slytherin, except he was a half blood and a werewolf, a double no. Even Hufflepuff seemed out of his ability range.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m probably going to end up sick.” It was the most honest future he could imagine for himself.</p><p> </p><p>“Nah,” Sirius said, a smile on his face. “You’ll be in Gryffindor with me. With <em> all </em>of us. Except maybe that one.” He cocked his head towards Peter.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s fair,” Peter said, with a small shrug. “Gryffindor’ll be the<em> last </em> place that hat puts me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sirius is right,” James said, clapping Remus hard on the shoulder. “Don’t worry. You’ll end up with us. And if not, you’ll be our bitter rival, and we’ll never speak to you again.” Remus’ face must have given away his worry, because James erupted into laughter. “Only joking! You went white as a sheet. Don’t worry, we don’t abandon our friends.”</p><p>Remus offered him a nervous smile, his brain getting lost somewhere around the word friend. Friends? They were friends? Already? Was making friends always this easy? His eyes flickered from James to Sirius and finally to Peter. “Thanks,” he managed to say, though James and Sirius had long moved onto another topic of conversation.</p><p> </p><p>“There’s only three hidden passageways out of the castle, that’s what my dad said, and he’s the inventor of Sleekazy’s Hair Potion, and therefore cannot be wrong -”</p><p> </p><p>“Bollocks, my cousin Andromeda says she’s found at least four, but she won’t tell me where they are, says I’ve gotta find them for myself.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus listened to their conversation with interest, but found that he had nothing to contribute. His father had never told him of any passages out of the castle, probably in an effort to protect him. He always thought Remus needed more protecting than he really did. The ache from the full moon was still in his bones, though, and he found himself drifting off to sleep, despite how badly he wanted to keep talking.</p><p> </p><p>-------</p><p> </p><p>“Alberic Grunnion. A true hero. Too bad I’ve got about 20 of him now.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus awoke to the sound of James’ voice, and the feel of something hitting him on the nose. Opening his eyes and reaching up, he discovered a chocolate frog card. He didn’t collect - he had never had anyone to trade with - but he liked the chocolate well enough.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry about that, bad aim. You can keep that one if you like,” James said, fingers busy opening another box.</p><p> </p><p>“About time you woke up, anyway,” Sirius said, flicking an empty box at him.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry,” he said, chucking the box at James, who was too busy reading the back of his newest card to deflect the blow.</p><p> </p><p>“All right, you’ve had your revenge. That's enough. And look, I’ve got Bowman Wright,” he said, shoving the card in Sirius’ face.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, Bowman’s cool, if you’ve never opened a chocolate frog before,” Sirius replied, playfully pushing James’ hand out of his face. He reached into his pile of sweets to grab another frog, extending it to Remus. “You want one? You were sleeping when the trolley came by, and we decided it’d be better not to wake you.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus eyed the box in Sirius’ hand. “Oh, no thank you,” he said, trying to think of an excuse not to take it. “I, um, I don’t actually, er, I don’t like chocolate.” He hoped it would be enough to dissuade him from offering anything further.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, Sirius scrunched his face up, raising his eyebrow. He glanced at James, who gave him a knowing look, and then back at Remus. “You what? <em> You don’t like chocolate? </em>”</p><p> </p><p>“Bollocks,” James said, mirroring the look Sirius was giving him.</p><p> </p><p>“No, really, it’s, um -” Remus was trying to think of something clever to say, but Sirius had unboxed the frog, and was holding it very close to his face. It wiggled, struggling to escape his grasp.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh come on, just take it,” Sirius coaxed, waving it gently in front of him. It smelled wonderful, and Remus found himself wondering if it would be more rude to refuse or to just accept the gift. A surge of pain from the wounds on his back made his mind up for him. He took the frog from Sirius’ hand and took a careful bite. He closed his eyes, letting the chocolate melt on his tongue.</p><p> </p><p>James, Sirius, and Peter all began to laugh at him. And then he was being pelted with chocolates.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s certainly the face of someone who doesn’t like chocolate, all right,” James said, tossing another frog at him between laughs.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re an awful liar,” Sirius said. “You ought to let James and I do the lying for you from now on.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sounds like a deal,” Remus said, around a mouthful of chocolate. “You can lie for me anytime. I’m no good under pressure.” He opened another box to find Godric Gryffindor staring back at him, sword in hand. He smiled, raising the card to show the rest. “Looks like you lot were right, after all.”</p><p> </p><p>“Always am,” Sirius said, sifting through his new cards.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve got the look about you. All mighty, and lion-y. Gotta be a Gryffindor,” James teased, nudging him in the ribs.</p><p> </p><p>Remus found himself feeling much lighter and warmer than when he entered the train, and for once, he doubted it had anything to do with the chocolate.</p>
