    <p>It’s a Monday when Professor McGonagall calls him to her office.</p><p>It’s not a surprise. Not really. She’d been sick for about a year, so Remus had had time to… get used to the idea. If one can get used to such a thing. He doesn’t know if the anticipation made it better or worse. He doesn’t know… well. He doesn’t know anything, really.</p><p>He’s been away from home for so long that in some ways, it’s hard to even understand what it means that she’s gone. The people around him won’t change; the days of classes, the quidditch matches, the full moons, they won’t change. The days will just keep coming, one after the other after the other. But he won’t get any more letters from her. And when he goes home for Easter, it’s hard to understand that she won’t be there. </p><p>It’s been a long time since he was small enough for her to hold him, innocent enough to be comforted by the warmth of her arms. He’s long since known that that sense of security would never hold him again. But now it feels somehow even more distant – a second loss.</p><p>Remus doesn’t even think to face his friends before he’s being whisked through a fireplace into a home that hasn’t really been his since he was eleven, or maybe since he was five and his father stopped looking him in the eye. His father is there now, still not looking at him. There are others too, aunts and neighbors and a ridiculous mound of food on the stove, meat pies and pastries and fucking pots of soup, as if all a mother was were a hand to feed him. Later, he will understand that each dish is an act of kindness, a way for someone to show that they cared when there was nothing else that could be done. But right now, it just makes him feel sick.</p><p>He retreats to his bedroom, feeling like a ghost as he moves through the house, bodies and voices trying to fill a space that will never really be filled again. He sits on his bed. There’s nothing to do here. He doesn’t want to be here.</p><p>He goes for a walk.</p><p>He walks in circles around the perimeter of the village for hours. He has his wand with him, but he doesn’t cast a warming charm, even though it’s November. A warming charm would feel like a lie, a farce, when he doesn’t think he’ll ever be warm again. He’s still walking in circles when night falls, not that it’s late. There’s no brilliant summer sunset, just a draining of light from the sky in the west. It goes faster than it seems like it should, and then it’s dark. The moon is a waning gibbous – a small blessing, though a curse all the same.</p><p>Mum had never hated him for what he became each month. Through every moon, every time they had to move when someone got suspicious, every fight with Da, she never blamed him. Her love was unconditional, like a mother’s love should be. Was. But her love for him doesn’t exist anymore. Tomorrow at the church the pastor will say that she’s watching over them, that her love will always be with them, but that’s bullshit. Mum’s love for her son, be he wizard or no, was a pattern of neurons firing, and those neurons are dead, along with the rest of her. </p><p>Remus falls to his knees on the frozen earth and wants to go home. </p><p>He doesn’t want to go back to the house where he spent Hogwarts summers, hiding from a man who hated him. He doesn’t want to dig an old muggle suit out of the attic and transfigure it to cover his wrists and ankles and stand next to his father like a politician while a parade of old women he doesn’t know tell him what a wonderful person his mother was and how lucky he was to have her and how sorry they are that she’s gone. The cold from the ground is leaching into him where his knees are resting on it. He’s cold and he wants to go home.</p><p>He completes his last circuit around the village, and the ground of what was once his mother’s vegetable garden crunches beneath his feet with frost. He opens the door without knocking; when he steps inside, no one is there. It’s warmer than outdoors, but not by much. Remus retrieves his bookbag from his room and comes back downstairs to light a fire in the grate. He doesn’t see his father.</p><p>Maybe one day, he’ll regret not saying goodbye to her body. Maybe some future him will think he wanted to look down on a small, empty form in the shape of his mother, to kiss its cold skin and say “I love you” even though no one is there to hear it. Maybe. But right now, the fire has sprung to life in the grate and Remus is tossing a handful of green powder into it and telling it to take him home.</p>
