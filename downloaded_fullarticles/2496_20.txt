          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco loved wearing Harry’s jumpers. They were warm and comfortable and most important of all, smelled like Harry. Wearing them made waiting for Harry to come back from Hogwarts on nights he had to grade papers much more bearable. But the best thing about them was how much Harry loved seeing Draco in them and that Draco was always greeted with multiple kisses and sappy declarations when he waited up for Harry.</p>
<p>That night, it was no different.</p>
<p>“I love you,” Harry declared with a soft smile as he stepped into the living room.</p>
<p>Draco wouldn’t trade that for anything.</p></div>
