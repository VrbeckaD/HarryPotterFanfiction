    <p>XXXXXXX</p><p>"I know how you feel, Harry." Dumbledore began.</p><p>"No you don't." Harry responded as he stared at the floor on the headmaster's office. "It's my fault."</p><p>"No…the fault is mine. I knew it was only a matter of time before Voldemort made the connection between you. I thought that distancing myself from you as I've done all year, he'd be less tempted, and therefore you might be more protected."</p><p>Swallowing a knot in his throat, Harry looked up at Dumbledore and spoke again.</p><p>"The prophecy said, neither one can live while the other survives. It means…one of us is going to have to kill the other…in the end."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Why didn't you tell me?"</p><p>"For the same reason you tried to save Sirius. The same reason your friends saved you. After all these years, after all you've suffered, I didn't want to cause you anymore pain. I care too much about you…"</p><p>Rolling over in bed, Harry opened his eyes as laid on his back and looked up at the ceiling as he remembered his last talk with Dumbledore before heading off to the Dursley's house for the summer. For the past few days he'd been back Harry had just stayed in his room, laying in bed asleep. And for the first time in a long time, he wasn't having any nightmares, any dreams, nothing at all so he just slept. It surprised him, especially given what had just happened. He tried as hard as he could not to think about it, to push it out of his mind. But it was getting harder and harder each day, and being here at the Dursley house wasn't helping.</p><p>He was alone with none of his friends around.</p><p>But in the end Ron or Hermione being around would not have made any difference. He knew they cared, put they just didn't understand what it felt like to know that you were responsible for someone's death. They didn't understand the pain and guilt he felt, and the heavy responsibility that had been placed upon his shoulders. Sighing heavily, Harry pushed himself up and swung his legs over the bed. He glanced at the clock on the small table next to his bed and it read five past twelve. Putting his glasses on, he got to his feet and decided to get a glass of water from the kitchen. Being mindful not to disturb his sleeping Aunt and Uncle, Harry slowly walked down the stairs, but just as his foot hit the first step on the way down, a voice echoed through his mind.</p><p>"Nice work, James!"</p><p>Harry shook his head as the voice of his godfather echoed through his head. </p><p>"Avada Kedavra!"</p><p>He then had to hold onto the rail tighter as he heard the sound of Bellatrix Lestrange shouting the killing curse at his godfather, watching helplessly as Sirius was struck, Sirius smiling at him one last time before fading away in the veil. Harry remembered running after her, step by step before finally catching up with Bellatrix and attempting to use the Cruciatus Curse.</p><p>He then heard Lord Voldemort's voice in his ear.</p><p>"You have to mean it Harry…she killed him…she deserves it."</p><p>"You know the spell."</p><p>Harry had spent hours trying to free his mind of all thought, of all emotion, as Professor Snape taught him to do in Occlumency lessons, even though he hated every single lesson he ever had. Whenever he was almost there another image of someone he cared about in pain or dying appeared in his mind. He then realized he had reached the bottom of the stairs and took a short deep breath as he walked to the kitchen. He poured water into a glass and after taking a sip of it, he rubbed his forehead and his fingers brushed over his scar.</p><p>"Sirius!"</p><p>Sirius is dead, Sirius is dead, you killed him, you went to the Department of Mysteries, you made him come there, you killed him…it's all your fault... Harry was suddenly snapped out of his thoughts when he heard the front door open and closed. A little startled, Harry glanced out the doorway to see it was only his cousin, Dudley.</p><p>"Harry," he snarled while walking towards the kitchen and moving past him.</p><p>"What were you doing out so late?" He asked.</p><p>"None of your business," Dudley snapped while grabbing some food out of the pantry. "And what are you still doing up? Another one of your stupid nightmares?" He asked as a grin pulled over his lips. He knew about his cousins nightmares from hearing him in his sleep in the past few years.</p><p>Harry glared at him.</p><p>"Shut up Dudley."</p><p>Harry was use to Dudley's taunts and insults but he just didn't have the energy to deal with his cousin right now. Fortunately for him Dudley took his snack and walked out of the kitchen, taking it up to his room. After he finished the water, Harry set the glass down in the sink and went back upstairs. Sighing, he reached his room and sat back down on his bed. He then glanced out the window, wishing he was anywhere but here. Wishing that he wasn't in the predicament he was in.</p><p>He was still in shock…or denial. Maybe he still hadn't quite accepted it yet.</p><p>Harry then realized he was shaking. He shoved all the thoughts and feelings away, as hard as he possibly could. It was difficult, far too difficult, because they never went away entirely, they never left no matter how much he wanted them to.</p><p>Closing his eyes, he tried to imagine what life would have been like if none of this had happened. If Sirius hadn't died, if there'd never been a Prophecy, if Lord Voldemort had never come to power, if my parents hadn't been murdered, if I never had to come live with the Dursleys. I'd just be normal. I'd just have a normal life.</p><p>That was what Harry had ever wanted. Just to be normal. To not be known as "The Boy Who Lived."</p><p>Laying back down in bed, Harry closed his eyes as he tried to push the thoughts away, but it wasn't working this time. He just kept thinking about the Department of Mysteries, the Death Eaters attacking them, Sirius...</p><p>'You killed him, you led him to his death. He's gone now, forever, because of you. And all those people who the Death Eaters are killing, they're going to keep on dying, all the time that you're getting ready to fight Lord Voldemort, people are going to die. More people you care about are going to die...'</p><p>"Stop!" He then yelled, forgetting all about his sleeping relatives as squeezed his eyes shut, then spoke in a voice just above a whisper. "Just stop."</p><p>XXXXXXXX</p><p>It was now morning and the sun had risen early, already halfway up the sky as it brightened the castle that was HogwartsSchool for Witchcraft and Wizardry. Severus Snape sat across from Albus Dumbledore in his office, discussing the latest Death Eater attack.</p><p>"It appears that the attack left several Aurors dead," Snape began, reluctant to inform the Headmaster of the news. "One of them was Alastor Moody."</p><p>Dumbledore sighed heavily after the potions master said that. Moody was arguably the most renowned Auror of all time. His death would be a tremendous blow to the Order.</p><p>"Because of their failure to obtain the prophecy, I believe the Dark Lord is going to increase his attacks," Snape continued. "Which means Potter must be taken to safer place for the rest of the summer, and I don't believe staying with the Weasleys will be safe enough."</p><p>"I know," Dumbledore said. "Harry needs a visible presence from the Order within reach at all times, to deter any attempts on his life. He needs to stay at a place where the Death Eaters wouldn't even think to look for him there."</p><p>"I agree," said a female voice. Dumbledore looked over as Narcissa Malfoy appeared from the shadows. "Don't look so surprised Albus," she laughed as she walked closer to them.</p><p>"What is she doing here?" Dumbledore asked Snape.</p><p>Snape stared at the desk.</p><p>"Mrs. Malfoy insisted she accompany me to visit you."</p><p>"And why is that?"</p><p>"I want to help." Narcissa began. "I'll take Harry in for you, and keep him safe from any attempts on his life."</p><p>Dumbledore looked back at Narcissa and shook his head.</p><p>"I'm afraid what you are asking is out of the question," he stated calmly, leaning back in his chair and folding his arms over his chest. He wasn't about to turn over the boy who lived to the wife of a Death Eater even if Lucius was locked away.</p><p>Narcissa smiled coolly.</p><p>"You really don't have any say in the matter Albus. Blood traitor or not, Sirius Black was Harry Potter's godfather, his legal guardian. I am his next of kin by blood. Therefore, as the eldest of the remaining Black family, I inherit the Black Manor, all relating properties, the family fortune…and Harry Potter. I am now the boy's legal guardian."</p><p>"His muggle relatives—"</p><p>"Will be more than happy to sign over any legal rights and obligations they have towards him. Severus told me they've never been too happy to have a wizard in the family."</p><p>Dumbledore glanced at Snape and sighed heavily.</p><p>"Narcissa-"</p><p>"You don't have anyplace else for Harry to go, Albus. Any other place you send him to, the Death Eaters will find it, I guarantee you. They would never think that he is being kept at the Malfoy Manor, which means that nobody outside this room can know. No one from the Order, they be can't tortured into revealing Harry's whereabouts if they don't know."</p><p>Dumbledore studied the woman in front of him for a long moment. She met his gaze fearlessly with her head held high, challenge in every line of her posture. Finally, he spoke.</p><p>"What about your son?"</p><p>Her eyes narrowed.</p><p>"I'm well aware that Harry and my son have never gotten along very well."</p><p>Snape snorted. That was an understatement.</p><p>"But, they are both sixteen now. It's time they made amends and began focusing on the real danger they both are facing. As for Lucius, he is in Azkaban. The bonds he laid upon me are gone, I have no desire to return to them."</p><p>Dumbledore was still not sold on this idea.</p><p>"The Order-"</p><p>"Albus, I will not betray Harry to the Dark Lord," Narcissa assured. "I would have nothing to gain from it, and doing so would put myself and my son into danger, and I would never do such a thing. So, are you going to play nice or not? I can do this with or without you."</p><p>Looking down at his desk, the older wizard finally gave in.</p><p>"Only on one condition," Dumbledore began. "Either myself or Severus is to make routine visits to the Manor, just to make sure things are going alright."</p><p>"Deal."</p><p>"Fine," he said while standing up. "I will accompany you to collect Harry, just to make sure he understands the situation."</p><p>XXXXXX</p><p>Back at the Dursley's house, Harry had woken up about twenty minutes ago and was still sitting on his bed with his back against the wall. He was wondering if he should get up and leave the house today, maybe walk to the park. It might do him some good to let the sun hit his face, even if it was just for a few minutes.</p><p>"Hoot!"</p><p>Harry glanced over at Hedwig's cage. She was looking at him as if she could feel what her owner was going through.</p><p>'I'm okay, Hedwig,' he muttered. Harry got up and made the short walk to the cage and opened it up. He began idly stroking her feathers as she rubbed her feathered head against his hand.</p><p>He smiled at the owl, not a genuinely happy smile, but the smile of one who is determined to make himself happy.</p><p>"Here," Harry said as he put some fresh food and water in the cage before shutting it and sitting back down on the bed.</p><p>As he rubbed his head, he looked back over and saw that Hedwig had not touched the food or water he just put it, just continued watching him with eyes that seemed worried. Taking a deep breath, Harry forced himself back up and he changed his clothes. He decided to go for that walk after all. It was still pretty early in the morning and he hoped that Dudley and his Aunt and Uncle were all still asleep so he could avoid seeing them.</p><p>After exiting his room, he walked down the stairs as quickly and quietly as he could. He reached the bottom of the stairs as was about to walk past the living room only to stop in his tracks in surprise when he saw a very familiar person sitting on the couch.</p><p>"Professor Dumbledore? What are you doing here?"</p><p>Dumbledore smiled as he looked at the younger teen.</p><p>"Sit down Harry." The old wizard began. "How are you feeling?"</p><p>Harry walked into the living room and sat down across from him.</p><p>"Um, all right, I suppose, sir," Harry murmured, avoiding Dumbledore's eyes. He hadn't had any contact with the headmaster since they talked about Sirius' death in his office.</p><p>"Good, good." Dumbledore said which shook away Harry's thinking back towards their last conversation. He fell silent for a few minutes, and it struck Harry that the old wizard seemed uneasy as well.</p><p>"Sir, what is it? Why are you here? Is everything alright?"</p><p>"Everything is fine, Harry." He assured. "I've come to tell you that you are going to be staying somewhere else for the remainder of the summer."</p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>"Where?" He figured that he was going to stay with the Weasley's at the Burrow like he usually did, or maybe at the Order's headquarters.</p><p>Dumbledore sighed. He figured it would be easier just to get it all out at once. There was no point in dancing around it.</p><p>"With Narcissa Malfoy at the Malfoy Manor."</p><p>Harry's eyes lingered on Dumbledore for a few moments. At first he thought it was an attempt at a joke, but he could tell by the look on his professor's face he was serious.</p><p>"What? At the Malfoy Manor?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Why can't I just stay at headquarters? Or with the Weasley's?" Harry asked while getting to his feet. "Or anywhere else for that matter?"</p><p>"Because we feel that anywhere else will not be safe enough. Malfoy Manor will be the one place Voldemort and his Death Eaters will not think to look for you there. And only Professor Snape and myself will know where you are. We will check on you from time to time to make sure everything is alright."</p><p>"I'm not going." Harry said while shaking his head. "I'm not going."</p><p>"Harry trust me, this is for your own good. With the increased attacks from Voldemort we can not risk something happening to you. You're too important."</p><p>"So living with the wife of a Death Eater is the safest place?"</p><p>Dumbledore looked down and sighed.</p><p>"Harry, there's more to the reason you're staying with Mrs. Malfoy then I'm telling you. But I feel that it's her place to tell you, not mine."</p><p>Harry's brows furrowed at that and Dumbledore frowned, knowing that the young teenager didn't like this bit.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Harry. I know this is very hard for you. But it isn't the end of the world. Mrs. Malfoy is not going to mistreat you…despite what you may think from your encounters with Lucius, I think you'll find that she is very different from her husband."</p><p>Dumbledore sounded very sure. Harry could only hope he was right. It really sounded like he had no choice…something that he was use to be now.</p><p>"Can I still write to Ron and Hermione?"</p><p>"Yes. Just don't tell them where you're staying."</p><p>Harry took a deep breath. He didn't like but what could he do? Run away? Lock himself in his bedroom? All he could do was hope that Dumbledore knew what he was doing.</p><p>"Fine...I'll...I'll go with her."</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>"Um, what time is Mrs. Malfoy," the name stuck in his throat. "—coming to get me?"</p><p>"She will be arriving soon." He then looked up at the ceiling when he began to hear moving around from upstairs. "Why don't you go get packed. I will explain everything to your aunt and uncle."</p><p>Harry slowly climbed the stairs and went back to his room to start packing. He really didn't have much to pack, all his clothes were still in his trunk. He packed as slowly as he could as he thought about the whole situation in his head…the Malfoy Manor. Narcissa Malfoy coming to get him…why? What reason would she take him in? After he placed his wand in his pocket, he began to hear voices from downstairs. Dumbledore, his Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.</p><p>"Are you serious?" Petunia asked.</p><p>"We thought we'd be stuck with him for another year or so." Vernon said.</p><p>After a few minutes, he grabbed Hedwig's cage and began pulling his trunk out of his room and down the stairs. Harry looked around and saw that Dumbledore was gone. Only his Aunt and Uncle were in the living room and they were hugging each other and smiling, as if they were just told the best news in the world.</p><p>"No more letters." Petunia said.</p><p>"No more owls or feathers." Vernon smiled.</p><p>As they continued talking Harry looked over to the bottom of the stairs, at the cupboard he was kept in for eleven years and anger and rage began to build up inside him.</p><p>"Although why anyone would willingly want him is beyond—"</p><p>"Shut up."</p><p>Vernon and Petunia turned around to see Harry standing there with his wand pointed at them. Vernon eyed Harry cautiously before speaking.</p><p>"You don't scare me. You can't do magic outside of school."</p><p>"Oh no?" Harry asked while walking closer as his Aunt and Uncle backed up. "You want to try me?"</p><p>Harry's eyes lingered on his Aunt and Uncle for a few moments, both of them looked scared as he continued to glare at them. They were supposed to be his family, and this was supposed to be a safe place for him, a home. Where he could go and feel loved, no matter what. Instead this was a place where he was ignored, where he was scared to even exist.</p><p>Suddenly, a knock on the door got his attention. He lowered his wand and Vernon and Petunia ran past him and back up the stairs. Harry sighed and walked to the front door. He opened the door, and standing there was a tall, elegant blonde woman. She looked like she was a high society lady. Harry had a good guess of who she was.</p><p>"Mister Potter." Narcissa greeted him quietly with a slight inclination of her head.</p><p>"Mrs. Malfoy." He replied coolly, not moving.</p><p>"I trust that Dumbledore has explained why I am here?"</p><p>"He has." Harry responded, not openly hostile, but with enough of an underlying threat that he had his wand and was prepared to use it, underage or not.</p><p>"In that case, shall we?"</p><p>Harry began lugging his trunk and owl outside. As he came outside he looked back inside the house one last time, glancing at the cupboard under the stairs before closing the door.</p><p>'Goodbye and good riddance Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. I hope you get what's coming to you.'</p><p>His emerald green eyes watched Mrs. Malfoy warily, like a wounded animal who hasn't decided whether this person in front of him was a friend or foe. Harry guessed that she didn't have any kind of grudge against him, but he could think of a couple of relatives of hers that do.</p><p>"Didn't you arrive here by portkey?" Harry asked.</p><p>Narcissa raised an eyebrow at him.</p><p>"As it so happens, I drove here."</p><p>Harry walked down the sidewalk with her until they came across a jet black Rolls Royce. The chauffeur got out of the car and took his trunk, taking it to the back of the car. He raised his eyebrows in surprise.</p><p>"You came here in a muggle vehicle? I thought you Malfoy's hated everything muggle?"</p><p>"Being rude does not become you Harry, get in." Narcissa instructed. She had always had a fascination with muggle cars and now that her husband was no longer around she could finally get one.</p><p>Harry opened the passenger door and got in. He looked over the car, glancing at its tan leather interior as the chauffeur started the car and they began to drive away from the Dursley house. Narcissa glanced over at Harry and smiled a little when she saw that the young man looked a little nervous.</p><p>"Relax Harry," she said. "I know you may feel uneasy about this situation, but I can offer you the fact that I am unarmed, have not requested your wand, and have </p><p>Dumbledore's signature verifying that I am your new legal guardian."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Narcissa held out a paper which Harry snatched from her hand and began scanning it. There indeed was Dumbledore's signature as well as Uncle Vernon's below his, and finally Mrs. Malfoy's. He thought he was just going to be staying with her through the summer, why would she want to become his legal guardian?</p><p>"Did you know my parents?"</p><p>"Didn't Dumbledore tell you?" Narcissa asked while looking over at him.</p><p>"He said there was more to it than he was saying. That it'd be better if you told me."</p><p>"Ah." She smiled. "I knew your mother. She was a good friend of mine when we were at Hogwarts. I will explain more when we get to the Manor. Draco doesn't know yet that you are staying and he will need to hear the story as well."</p><p>"Figures."</p><p>"I do not condone my son's actions over the past few years Harry, but it is not without complete cause. You might empathize with him a bit more once you get to know him."</p><p>Harry snorted rudely.</p><p>"Put yourself in Draco's place." Narcissa's voice was deliberately calm. "His father raised him all his life to follow the Dark Lord. Now that he's locked away there's a real chance for him not to live up to that expectation."</p><p>They sat quietly for a few moments before she spoke up again.</p><p>"Dumbledore told me what happened to Sirius," Narcissa began. Harry looked over at her gaze and met it squarely. "I'm sorry Harry. He was my cousin you know."</p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>"Your cousin was a good man," Harry said as he throat tightened when he began thinking about him. "He didn't betray my parents to Voldemort…Peter Pettigrew did."

It just wasn't fair. Sirius had spent thirteen years of his life in Azkaban, for a crime he didn't commit…he broke out only to be killed just two and half years later. They were quiet for the rest of the ride with Harry staring out the window. He wasn't aware of how much time had gone by when the car finally passed through an open gate, it made its way up a path to the Malfoy Manor.</p><p>"We're here," the chauffeur said.</p><p>Harry then looked out through the window and his eyes widened when he saw the mansion.</p><p>"It's huge," he said out loud.</p><p>Narcissa smiled.</p><p>"Yes, it's very big."</p><p>Harry and Narcissa exited the car as the chauffeur retrieved Harry's trunk. Narcissa walked up to the gigantic front doors and pushed it open, motioning for Harry to step inside first. He glanced around, the inside was way bigger then he thought it would be. The floor was made of marble and looked like a large chessboard, black squares here and there. There were many portraits and paintings on the walls, and vases sitting on the floor which he assumed were very expensive. Harry looked up to see a beautiful chandelier atop his head. The ceiling looked miles away from the floor and the staircase was long. It looked like it was never-ending.</p><p>Harry then looked over to see a house elf approaching him and Mrs. Malfoy.</p><p>"Topsy, is my son home?" Narcissa asked.</p><p>"No, Lady Malfoy." The elf answered. "I believe he is still out with Ms. Parkinson."</p><p>Harry then shook his head as this was exactly how he pictured Malfoy's life to be. Living in a gigantic house with the best of everything and house elves that wait on him hand and foot.</p><p>"Well, while we wait," Narcissa said while turning to Harry. "I could show you around or perhaps you would like to get something to eat first."</p><p>"I'm not hungry."</p><p>"Alright, follow me please." Narcissa said as she led Harry down a long hallway, passing the kitchen and dining room, leading him to the elevator. She pressed a button and it began going up. "The manor consists of four floors, each with its own magnificence," she began. "There are ten bedroom suites total, twelve bathrooms, three kitchens, five swimming pools, two are located in closed areas of the landscaped gardens, and the third outside pool is an 'infinity pool' located on the roof."</p><p>The elevator came to a stop and Harry stepped out with Narcissa as she kept talking and leading him to his bedroom.</p><p>"There are two indoor pools, one reached by its own private lift. There's a library on the second floor as well as a game room."</p><p>Narcissa stopped as reached her destination.</p><p>"You'll be staying in here."</p><p>Harry walked in and looked around. The room was twice the size of the Dursley's living room. The walls were white as well as the carpet. The room even had its own fire place.</p><p>A king size bed was in the middle of the room and it had about a dozen pillows on it. Harry looked at the corner and saw that there was a bathroom as well. Harry would have been loving this had this not been the Malfoy Manor. Just as Harry stepped inside the bathroom to look around, Draco Malfoy had just reached the second floor and had a glass in his hand full of butter beer. He saw his mother down at the end of the hallway by the door of one of the spare bedrooms and began to walk towards her.</p><p>"Mother, Topsy said you were looking for me, what do you want?"</p><p>Just as he walked into the room, Harry walked out of the bathroom and the glass slipped from Draco's hand when he saw him, shattering upon contact with the floor.</p><p>"What the hell is this?"</p><p>Draco's eyes met Harry's green ones, right before they narrowed into the recognized hatred. They both went for their wands with the speed of a striking snake, only to have them ripped out of their hands by a disarming spell from Narcissa.</p><p>"Mother, why the hell is Potter-"</p><p>"Silencio!"</p><p>Draco was immediately shut up by the spell. Harry couldn't help but grin a little as Draco's mouth kept moving but no sound was coming out. When he finally realized he couldn't speak he started making his way towards Harry with his fists balled up.</p><p>Harry began walking towards him as well but they were both stopped when Narcissa hit them both with immobilizing spells.</p><p>"Before you two do all of the Dark Lord's work for him and kill each other, listen to me!" She snapped. "I am going to release you both, and when I do you will sit down. You will not speak, you will not curse. You won't even look at each other until I am finished. Is that understood?"</p><p>They nodded stiffly and Narcissa removed the spell. Harry went over and sat down on the bed while Draco sat in a chair, the furthest he could be away from Harry in the same room. Both Harry and Draco sat on opposite ends of the room, doing as Mrs. Malfoy had instructed them to do. 

Once she saw that the two of them had calmed down, she took a deep breath and began to explain.</p>
