    <p>Dean turned over the piece of paper on which he had been sketching an uninteresting apple core, glancing over at Parvati who was sitting at the other side of the breakfast table, not quite facing him. She was gazing out into nothing, holding her cup of pumpkin juice with both hands, her braid falling neatly over her right shoulder, ebony black on black school robe. She would always eventually freeze into this pose whenever their breakfast dragged unnecessarily on; she would sigh and look away, a melancholy Indian statue. She wasn’t the same since Lavender had died. She interacted with others like a sleep-walker—it took a lot of watching to notice it—and Dean was even under the impression that she avoided her sister as much as she could get away with. There was nothing he could do but take his pencil and, without a word, try to sketch that expression of hers away.</p>
<p>Hogwarts was no fun without Seamus. He was the only guy of his year in Gryffindor to come back for seventh year. Seamus had popped by in the fall to take some quick exam whilst the other three had left for Auror training; he knew the guys in Ginny’s year a little, but it just sucked. All through the fall they had been torn between talking about the war and not talking about it, trying to get on with their lives but not quite succeeding. There was this unspoken rule that you had to be friends with everyone in your House just because you were on the same side during the war; the inter-house rivalry didn’t mean anything anymore, though some first years were sometimes seen talking enthusiastically near the giant hourglasses. Quidditch was about whether Ginny wanted to play Chaser or Seeker, or playing nice with the younger kids who had to fill in the gaps in the teams; it was hard to vent.</p>
<p>It wasn’t even possible to bash the Slytherins like before. As weeks went by, Dean had realized that the fights that broke out in the corridors weren’t the same. The green-and-silver gits were abused and attacked for no other reason than personal vengeance, though a vast majority of those who had come back to Hogwarts were never “on the wrong side”. The old, healthy animosity was now suffused with bitter resentment and malevolence, genuine rancor that wanted a target. None of the seventh years had come back apart from Malfoy, who probably didn’t have a choice, and Hermione had lectured them enough for them to stop talking about him behind his back. He had helped them win the war, in a way.</p>
<p>So Dean met up with his friends on Hogsmeade weekends and bode his time. The only bright side he found to the new scheme of things and the end-of-all-times atmosphere was that he was free to experiment and try whatever crossed his mind, like flirting with Justin Finch-Fletcher who sat next to him in Transfiguration in November. The Hufflepuff was the one who’d started it, and Dean had found he didn’t mind playing along. It had been a short-lived experience as the guy was only not unattractive to Dean’s taste, and he talked way too much about the bitter pride of being a muggle-born. At least it had broadened Dean’s scope. He had given it a shot with Parvati at the beginning of the year, but had quickly realized it wouldn’t work. Instead, the two of them had grown close, something he found a little sad whenever he thought about Lavender, but he was glad that at least they had each other and she didn’t pretend with him, though it killed him that he couldn’t do anything for her.</p>
<p>Parvati stirred and said she was going to check something at the library before class. Dean tucked away his parchment and started to draw an impression of the Slytherin table.</p>
