    <p>Cars passed the window and people walked by. The sky was clear and a bright blue, not a single cloud to be seen. It was a usual Friday morning in August with the world going along at normal speed, however for one young boy it was all going in slow motion.</p>
<p>The boy was perched on the living room windowsill, nose almost touching the glass as he wished for time to go faster. Every time someone walked towards the house his eyes lit up in hope, only to be disappointed when it wasn’t the person he was waiting for.</p>
<p>His eyes dared to leave the pathway outside as he looked at the clock to his left. He watched as the hands moved painfully slow, almost as if they weren’t moving at all! Closer and closer the hands moved to the hour, but they didn’t quite seem to reach. He willed for it to be eleven o’clock, but it seemed to be taking its time.</p>
<p>It was unusual for the young boy to be awake so early, but he had been waiting by the window, changed out of his pyjamas and in a dark green t-shirt and blue jeans, since early that morning. The only time he had left was to have breakfast when his grandmother came downstairs, and he ate that as fast as he could. Since he returned to the window, now wearing his trainers and waited once again</p>
<p>He tapped his foot against the floor and double checked the pocket of his jeans to make sure that he still had his letter with the list of items he had to buy.</p>
<p>“Sit still child, you’re making me anxious” an old voice chuckled behind him.</p>
<p>The boy looked back at his grandmother who, still in her dressing gown, sat on an old arm chair behind him.</p>
<p>“Sorry” he mumbled, stopping himself from tapping his foot again.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, he’ll be here soon. When has he ever let you down?” she replied softly.</p>
<p>As if on cue the clock chimed eleven and they could hear the sound of the doorbell. The boy sprang up and ran too the front door like a rocket. He swung the door open to the surprise of the man waiting outside. He was middle aged, with messy black hair which was close to covering his eyes, covering an old scar, and round glasses. He wore black trousers and blazer with a dark grey shirt underneath.</p>
<p>“Woah calm down Teddy. You’ll pull the door off!” he laughed.</p>
<p>The two could hear a voice shout from the living room.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve seen him this excited over something before. Now let Harry in and get your stuff”.</p>
<p>Teddy stepped out of the doorway and fetched his dark blue backpack from the bottom of the staircase, slinging it around his shoulders. At the same time Harry closed the front door and walked into the living room, Teddy following behind. Harry greeted the old woman in the chair with a hug.</p>
<p>“Nice to see you again Andromeda” he said.</p>
<p>“How did you get to the door without me seeing you? I only took my eyes off the street for a second?” Teddy asked which caused Harry to give him a confused look.</p>
<p>“He’s been waiting at the window since before half seven this morning” laughed Andromeda from her chair.</p>
<p>This only caused the man to laugh as well. “Well I guess you would want to get going then”.</p>
<p>Teddy’s smile beamed at him and he walked over to stand in the fireplace.</p>
<p>“I’ll pick up his trunk this evening” Harry said to Andromeda before taking a small bag of powder out of his pocket and taking his place next to Teddy. “Aren’t you going to say goodbye to your grandmother?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah”. Teddy jogged towards where she was sat and kissed her cheek. “I’ll send you an owl when I get there”.</p>
<p>“I’ll be waiting for it. Good luck”.</p>
<p>"Ok" Harry said when the young boy returned to his side "Ready?"</p>
<p>"Yes!" The boy shouted, jumping up and down.</p>
<p>Harry grabbed Teddy's hand at dropped the powder.</p>
<p>"DIAGON ALLEY"</p>
<p>With a puff of green smoke, the living room was replaced by a busy cobblestone street. Men, women and children walked up and down looking in the windows of shops, some wearing clothes that would be considered weird to those commonly known as ‘Muggles’. The party of two stepped out of the fireplace and, with Harry’s help, made their way down the street.</p>
<p>“Have you got your list?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>Teddy nodded and handed him a piece of parchment, the logo of Hogwarts in the corner.</p>
<p>“Right then, let’s get started”.</p>
