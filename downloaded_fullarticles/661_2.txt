    <p>Playing Quidditch had seemed like an excellent idea an hour ago, in fact – Harry suspected it could have been one of his best. The idea of flying through the biting air, alone in the sky above the endless Scottish landscape had seemed like a dream. How was he to know that whatever mystic bastard who controlled the weather had decided that this Sunday afternoon was the perfect time for a snowstorm? </p><p>As the clouds rolled in, the wind picked up and the first snow stuck to his eyelashes, Harry fought his broom back to the ground and sprinted for the locker room. If he was quick, he could probably make it back to the castle and the warm common room fire. Harry dashed through the door as the snow picked up and slammed it behind him. You’d think being indoors would improve the temperature, but even without the punishing winds and walls and floor still seemed to seep cold.</p><p>Harry moved as quickly as possible, grabbing his bag and cloak from the bench and was moving back towards the door when it clattered open, blowing snow and cold across the floor. Without seeing Harry, Draco Malfoy rushed into the space and slammed the door, his back to Harry and his forehead resting against the cold wood. He was shivering and slowing moved away from the door, taking a heavy step backwards and rubbing a hand over his face before wrapping his arms tight about himself in an effort to keep in any body heat. </p><p>Harry had frozen at Malfoy’s entrance, cloak half on. The return of Draco Malfoy to Hogwarts had been met with outrage among many students, only Slytherin tolerated him and even they were trying to distance themselves, present a better image than the one Malfoy was unfortunately affiliated with. Harry had not spoken to Malfoy since the trials and had been doing just a good job of avoiding him as he had at following him during sixth year, until now that is. Harry didn’t have a problem with Malfoy, not anymore at least. He’d been trying to move on from it all, distance himself from any and all reminders of the war. Hence the Quidditch idea, he supposed. If he was high in the sky freezing his arse off, he wasn’t sat with Ron and Hermione – multitudes of unsaid things hanging heavy between them. And besides, they had each other now and Harry had, well Harry had Quidditch and school and avoiding Draco Malfoy to distract him.</p><p>Harry gulped and shifted his weight slightly, awkwardly finishing the fastenings on his cloak as quietly as possible. Malfoy seemed to sense he wasn’t alone and stiffened before slowly looking over his shoulder and turning to face Harry, dropping his hands to his sides and trying to lift his head a fraction in a shadow of his lost power. He looked like hell, Harry noted. His cloak, once fur lined and with the pompous Malfoy crest emblazoned on the breast was instead simple, too thin and without a doubt cheaper. The type of cloak you’d wear in early Autumn, not a snowstorm. He had shadows under his eyes and his once shining blond hair was limp and dull, pulled back in a ponytail at the nape of his neck with a few escapee strands falling into his face. If possible, he seemed even more scrawny than back in sixth year. His always prominent cheekbones now looked painful and his narrow frame looked as if it could be blown over by a light breeze, never mind the loud storm that was picking up outside.</p><p>Speaking of the storm, Harry should really be getting to the castle if he had any hope of even finding it in this sudden blizzard. He cleared his throat and moved to walk past Malfoy out into the storm. At his obvious dismissal of him, Malfoy seemed to slump and simply shuffled to the side to let Harry pass.</p><p>Harry was pulled up short. This was Malfoy, stuck up prat and all-round jerk and yet here he was defeated and empty. Harry didn’t like it.  And what was he even doing out here anyway? Harry noticed his lack of gloves, it seemed as good a conversation starter as any.</p><p>“Where are your gloves?” He asked as he stopped at Malfoy’s side. Malfoy jumped, obviously expecting Harry to just keep on walking. He snapped his head to Harry and opened his mouth, before closing it again, evidently struggling to find an answer to the frankly simple question. Eventually he coughed, straightened his spine and turned full to face Harry. Harry watched in amazement as his whole demeanour changed from a broken boy to what could pass as the old Malfoy, if you squinted hard enough.</p><p>“I don’t own any,” he said with as much dignity as possible, as if the idea of gloves was ridiculous and only establishments such as Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes would bother selling them.</p><p>“Why?” Harry looked at Malfoy’s hands, the skin so pale it could be blue.</p><p>Malfoy raised an aristocratic eyebrow and folded his arms, hiding his hands. He was still shivering. “Because Potter,” he sneered, “I’m not sure if you are aware of this, but the Ministry decided that in recompense for my family’s actions in the war the claiming of all our property in reparations as well the incarceration of my father, the house arrest of my mother and the all-round humiliation of me would be sufficient payment.”</p><p>“Well, yes, I did know that,” Harry stammered, he had been at the sentencing of course, “But it’s nearly the middle of winter. But I’d assumed the Ministry left you enough for basics, like gloves.”</p><p>“You’d assumed wrong. The so-called allowance we have been granted is barely enough. I made the elective decision to use it to pay for my mother’s needs. I don’t need any here at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“I think you’re proving that wrong.” Harry gestured to Malfoys still shivering form.</p><p>“Would you rather I let my mother starve?” Malfoy snapped his voice rising a fraction before he got a hold of himself and pulled his arms tighter about himself. “It’s stupid that I’m out here. I wasn’t expecting a storm to hit.”</p><p>“Neither,” Harry raised his broom a fraction, indicating where he’d been, “Why are you out here anyway?”</p><p>Malfoy assessed him quizzically, obviously wondering why Harry would even want to know. Harry himself didn’t have a clue. Why did he suddenly care where Malfoy had been? And about the state of his winter wardrobe? He supposed he had always been a little obsessed with Malfoy (whether that was following him or pointedly avoiding him for years), and seeing him so changed like this was a rather large shock to the system. The boys stood surveying each other for an awkward minute before Malfoy seemed to come to some decision.</p><p>“I was walking,” he said and moved to sit on a bench, pulling his cloak tightly about him. Harry watched him move and glanced at the door, it shook in its frame. He moved towards it and took a fortifying breath before throwing it open.</p><p>“What are you doing, you oaf!?” Malfoy jumped to his feet but stayed as far away from the open door as possible. The storm had definitely picked up. Snow drifts were forming along the walls of the locker rooms and when Harry had opened the door a pile of it fell inwards. The sound of the roaring wind filled the room and cut through the boy’s clothing. “Shut the door the imbecile!” Malfoy yelled as he protected his face from the cutting wind and snow that whirled around the space and Harry wrested the door closed again. “What were you thinking?” Malfoy slumped back onto the bench, looking even more exhausted if that were possible.</p><p>“Looks like we’re going to be snowed in,” Harry ignored the question, it really had been a bit of a reach to think they could make it back to the castle at this point.</p><p>“Really,” Malfoy drawled, “I hadn’t noticed.” </p><p>Harry stood against the door and shuffled his feet. He shivered. Malfoy shivered and hunched over a bit more. </p><p>“Well then,” Harry said decisively and threw his plans of avoiding Draco Malfoy out the window as he marched over the bench and sat down next to him, throwing an arm around his startingly frail shoulders and pulling him into his side. Malfoy stiffened but didn’t pull away or say anything. “I guess we’re stuck here for the foreseeable future and in your current state you’d probably die of hyperthermia before the hour was out.” Malfoy didn’t argue for once and instead relaxed a fraction into Harry’s half embrace.</p><p>Harry shuffled a bit and reached for his wand, casting a warming charm over the two of them. Malfoy relaxed even more into the warmth. Harry wondered how long he had been outside. His body radiated cold, it was like holding a block of ice. He said as much.</p><p>Malfoy huffed, “Well when nobody wants you around, a walk through the grounds doesn’t seem like a bad idea. Takes me away from everyone and gives me space to think without being constantly watched.”</p><p>Harry thought about that for a few minutes. It felt too much like something he would do, how he often feels. When he’s around his friends he knows he brings a dampener with him. He hasn’t laughed properly in months and he gets the impression that often when he walks into rooms conversations abruptly stop. He finds himself alone more than he’s with people, flying, walking, even studying. </p><p>“I get that,” he murmured with such sincerity that Malfoy lifted his head and looked into his eyes, his face only inches away, studying him.</p><p>“Yes, I think you do,” He whispered before dropping his head back to Harry’s shoulder. The boys sit in silence for a while, listening to the roar of the wind still raging outside and the smaller sound of their own breathing. </p><p>At some point Malfoy fell asleep. Harry wondered at this, his former enemy falling asleep against his side. Trusting him enough to allow himself to let go, if only for an hour or so. Maybe Harry had got it wrong. He shouldn’t be avoiding Malfoy, he should be seeking him out. They had a surprising amount in common, plus shared trauma he supposed. Harry hesitantly reached out and took Malfoy’s hand. Ice cold. Harry shivered and pulled the sleeping boy closer before pulling off his own gloves, putting them on Malfoy and refreshing the warming charm. How had Malfoy let himself come to this. If Harry hadn’t been here, he dreaded to think what would have happened. In Malfoy’s weakened state and in hardly the correct clothes he can’t imagine him making it through the storm. An unwanted image of Malfoy huddled on a bench, his too thin cloak wrapped about him, violent shivers wracking his body, until they didn’t. Harry took off his hat and scarf as well, putting them on Malfoy. He smirked a little at seeing the Gryffindor red and gold around Malfoy’s neck. Then he pulled Malfoy closer to him still and Malfoy reached a newly gloved hand over Harry’s middle and fastened onto his waist. </p><p>Harry stiffened a moment before relaxing. This was nice. If he closed his eyes, he could imagine they weren’t freezing in the Quidditch locker rooms but were instead cuddled up on a sofa in front of a fire, the storm blowing safely outside the window. Harry slid down the bench a bit and wrapped both arms around Malfoy, holding him close and protecting him from the cold. </p><p>Now, Harry knew he was gay. He’d suspected since sixth year and confirmed it after the war. Venturing out onto London streets and into clubs, dancing with strangers into the early hours, and falling into bed with a few of them. That didn’t mean Harry had ever been attracted to Draco Malfoy. Definitely not. So, what if he’d discovered he liked blonds best? Specifically, mouthy sarcastic blonds, he corrected himself and sighed. Who was he kidding? Watching anyone with the intensity and passion with which he and tracked Malfoy during sixth year would result in some sort of feelings. And Harry’s avoidance of Malfoy this past term was really just hiding from himself, he knew that. Knew that there was unfinished business between the two of them (plus this unhelpful crush on his part). Harry wondered at why this crush hadn’t diminished as Malfoy’s own physical looks deteriorated but he supposed that was just his hero complex, look out for the weak, protect the needy, and bring back who they once were. Harry suddenly wanted to do that for Malfoy. To keep protecting him as he was right now, holding him in his arms and to pull the old Malfoy back. Restore his confidence, and generally fix him. Oh fuck. This was bad.</p><p>The wind was dying down as Harry himself fell asleep, the now softly falling snow creating a dampener and a peaceful silence in the room. When he woke again, Malfoy was gone. Harry’s hat, scarf and gloves were neatly stacked on the bench next to him along with a scrap of parchment that he suspected had been pilfered from his own bag as Malfoy definitely hadn’t had any on him.</p><p><i>Thank you</i>, it read in Malfoy’s looping handwriting.</p><p>Harry pocketed the note and put on his hat, scarf and gloves, smiling properly for the first time in months as he made his way out of the locker room and followed Malfoy’s footprints back towards the castle.</p>
