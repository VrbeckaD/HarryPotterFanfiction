  <p>“Oh, I will be cruel to you, Marya Morevna. It will stop your breath, how cruel I can be. But you understand, don’t you? You are clever enough. I am a demanding creature. I am selfish and cruel and extremely unreasonable. But I am your servant. When you starve I will feed you; when you are sick I will tend you. I crawl at your feet; for before your love, your kisses, I am debased. For you alone I will be weak.”</p>

</p><p> </p><p>Tom Riddle had always known that he was not like other people.</p><p>By <em>not like other people</em>, he didn’t mean that he could do magic, or that he was fundamentally better than all the rest—although both were true—but that the patterns of his thoughts and feelings were utterly unlike theirs. This was not an advantage: their softness, their vulnerabilities, their reactions confused him, and Tom hated to be confused. He did not understand them, could not empathize with them, and he doubted he ever would.</p><p>He’d found that he could compensate for this disconnect, however, if he approached life as one might approach an especially complex game of chess. People were easier to understand and manipulate if he didn’t try and see them as <em>people</em>, as creatures like himself, and instead divided them up and approached them as either pawns or opponents. Pawns could always be sacrificed and discarded, and his opponents—well, he had a talent for anticipating their moves and planning accordingly.</p><p>Hermione Granger wasn’t the <em>first</em> to have ever surprised him, but she was one among an elite few who’d managed to do it so often and so consistently.</p><p>“You can’t kill me,” she told him, defiant, as if by saying it with enough fierce conviction, she could make it so. She spoke the words as if they were spell work, as if the magic that had somehow cropped up in her despite her muddied ancestry could imbue them with the power to shape reality.</p><p>It couldn’t, of course: there was a great deal more to spell craft than will and conviction, for all that they <em>were</em> key components. Tom supposed she deserved credit for trying, if nothing else.</p><p>When he allowed his skepticism to show on his face, curious as to what she’d do with it and how she’d react, she said, waspishly, “Yes, yes, I know that you very well <em>can</em>, but what happens after? Everyone knows that you’re my—<em>God</em>—that you’re my <em>boyfriend</em>.” She said <em>boyfriend</em> the way other people said <em>cunt</em> or <em>bastard</em>, and, despite himself, Tom found that he had to swallow a laugh: he wouldn’t want to ruin her moment, after all, and she’d only just begun to gather steam.</p><p>She was still talking.</p><p>“—Statistically speaking, the majority of murder victims are killed by the people closest to them. You’ll be on the short list of suspects and you bloody well know it. Who’s <em>stupid</em> now?”</p><p>Watched too many true crime documentaries, this one had. And it seemed that she was still smarting from the insults he’d paid to her intelligence, as well, as if her reputation as the brightest student in her year meant more to her than her life.</p><p>Curious little thing.</p><p>She finally shut her mouth, apparently waiting for—what? A counterargument? Was this all some sort of<em> debate</em> to her? All right, then: far be it from him not to indulge a dying woman.</p><p>“But we’ve only been seeing each other for a very little while,” he said, wondering if this was what she wanted to hear. He could have skimmed across the surface of her thoughts to confirm it, but he found that guessing at what she would do next was rather—well, interesting. <em>Exciting</em>, even. “I’d hardly call that close—and, as no one else can open the Chamber, the authorities will chalk you up to a missing person’s case, at least at first.”</p><p>Hermione’s eyes wavered with something like panic, or perhaps despair, but Tom didn’t want her to give up just yet, not if it meant losing these frissons that were zipping up and down his spine, so he said, rather generously, “Still, you make a fair point.”</p><p>Her eyes had dimmed only seconds ago, but now they brightened once more as if she’d never had cause to resign herself to her own mortality. Strange, how easily she could bounce from one emotion to another; all of it genuine, none of it artifice. One hardly need be a Legilimens to read her: all her thoughts and feelings sat naked on her face, there for anyone to see. To exploit.</p><p>“A-and,” she stammered, only to hesitate as though she’d spoken before she could complete her thought. Her pulse thrummed against his thumbs, and Tom’s fingers trembled as he fought not to snap the skinny bird bones in her wrists just because he could, just because his groin was still smarting from the blow she’d landed to it with her absurdly pointy knee.</p><p>She was lucky, really, that he was humoring her at all. The last person who’d struck him had got their pet rabbit strung from the rafters, and he’d grown creative and more powerful in the years since.</p><p>“If you kill me,” she went on, coaxing his thoughts away from whether her broken wrist bones would feel like splintered twigs beneath his palms, “I could come back as a ghost. Myrtle didn’t see her killer, but I will. Would.”</p><p>He’d already accounted for that, but he had to give her credit for evaluating the realities of a wizard’s death when her own was staring her so immediately, so hungrily, in the face.</p><p>“True enough,” Tom said in tones of warm approval. “I could always Obliviate you before I kill you, though. Come to that, I could Obliviate you and let you live. Wouldn’t that be better than dying?”</p><p>The dawning hope on Hermione’s face crumpled and died, and she wasn’t wrong to look that way. Having your brain cracked open and emptied couldn’t’ve been a pleasant experience, least of all for someone with a brain as unique as <em>hers</em>.</p><p>“But that might damage that bright mind of yours, and we wouldn’t want that, now, would we?” Tom’s sigh was deliberate, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t genuine. He didn’t want her putting his ambitions at risk, but neither did he want to see all that potential go to waste. “What to do, Hermione? You’ve left me with very few choices, and none of them good.”</p><p>The despairing look soured, and the hands he’d pinned to her sides bunched into fists. “You could always take a third option and piss off.”</p><p>Tom’s eyes thinned: rare was the individual who had the nerve to speak to him so. But<em> was</em> it nerve, or was it bravado? Curiosity won out over his desire to be surprised, and he skimmed a light, questing touch over the shallowest end of her thoughts, getting a flash of red hair and freckles for his efforts.</p><p>The second-youngest Weasley, was it? Ronald or Roland or something like that, often rude and rarely clever and always shoveling great heaps of food into his gaping mouth. Hermione was thinking of what <em>he</em> would say in this situation, and the thought was accompanied by a tangle of fear and regret and what Tom assumed was <em>affection</em>.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>That was the key to everything, wasn’t it? To control someone, to<em> truly</em> control someone, one had only to threaten that which they held dear.</p><p>As remarkable as she often was, in this, Hermione was the same as everyone else.</p><p>Tom smiled without artifice. What an excellent turn this had taken.</p><p>“Your friends,” he said, withdrawing from his shallow dip into Hermione’s thoughts. “They mean a great deal to you, don’t they? You’d do almost anything for them, wouldn’t you?”</p><p>With what looked like a pained sort of effort, Hermione kept her mouth shut. Perhaps she thought she could stop this from happening if she refused to verbally acknowledge it. Irrational and childish, but Tom supposed she had very little left to cling to.</p><p>“I want to keep you alive, Hermione,” he said, and leaned farther into her as though physical proximity could convince her of his sincerity. “I’ll let you out of the Chamber. You and I shall carry on with our—relationship—”</p><p>Hermione scoffed, and Tom clenched his jaw. Really, here he was being<em> kind </em>to her, and she <em>mocked</em> him for it.</p><p>She’d learn. In due time, she’d learn.</p><p>“But,” he carried on, generously turning a blind eye to her disrespect when he would have broken anyone else’s wrist, “you’ve got to promise me—you must swear to it, and because I’m so very magnanimous, I won’t even ask that you make an Unbreakable Vow—but you must promise to keep your precious mouth <em>shut</em> regarding Myrtle Warren, the Chamber, and my association with either.”</p><p>Having outlined his terms, Tom waited for her to agree to it or fight him—and if she was half as clever as he hoped she was, she’d overcome her Gryffindor nature and choose the path of self-preservation as any good Slytherin would—but she only said, “And Evan Rosier?”</p><p>Really, now: <em>must </em>she insist upon beating that particular dead horse when her life was on the line?</p><p>“What of him?” Tom asked, impatient. “He committed suicide, Hermione.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m sure he did,” Hermione snapped, but just when Tom feared that she would refuse to drop it, she said, “And what if I don’t cooperate? What will you do?”</p><p>As if she didn’t know.</p><p>“You know very well what I’d do,” said Tom, watching for and catching her flinch of acknowledgement. “That’s the trouble with caring, Hermione; it gets you into all sorts of trouble.”</p><p>Because she loved them: she loved Potter and Weasley, or at least, she thought she did. Tom didn’t know what it was about them that was worth caring for, but the <em>why </em>of it didn’t particularly matter. All that mattered to Tom was that he could weaponize Hermione’s loyalties for his own purposes.</p><p>With that in mind, he gave the surface of her thoughts another skim to confirm that he wasn’t wrong about the lengths to which she’d go for her friends, but caught something else while he was at it. Something irritating, but not unexpected.</p><p>“And don’t bet that you’ll be able to get to the authorities before I can kill you or your friends,” he said. “I’ll know what you intend to do before you can do it. If you believe nothing else that I say, believe that.”</p><p>She swallowed—he watched her throat stretch with the reflex and entertained thoughts of crushing her windpipe—but her hesitation was only a formality. They both knew who would win at this.</p><p>Tom dipped in closer, forehead grazing Hermione’s. His fixed his mouth in the saccharine smile that girls loved best but which had been entirely ineffective at charming the one sat in front of him.</p><p>“If you do as I ask, Hermione, then I won’t harm a hair on your friends’ heads. I swear to it.”</p><p>Her eyes darted to his face, then away. She licked her lips convulsively. She clearly didn’t believe him, and why should she? She knew him to be a liar.</p><p>But even if she didn’t believe him, she’d still agree to what he’d proposed. He saw the<em> yes</em> sitting on her tongue, saw resignation dawning in her eyes. He leaned farther into her still, hungry for it, for her capitulation.</p><p>“All right,” she said, in the tones of someone agreeing not to fight their own death sentence.</p><p>Tom’s smile grew, unfurled. He half wanted to stroke an approving hand through her unruly hair.</p><p><em>Not an opponent any longer, </em>he thought. <em>But a pawn.  </em></p>
