    <p>“Y/N! Hurry up! The candy will be gone by the time we walk out!” Your little brother whined as you finished putting on your scarf, your wand already in your hand. </p>
<p>Your mother asked you to take Mason trick-or-treating alone, as she and your father had been invited to a Halloween party, and couldn’t come with you. It was only a walk around the neighborhood, nothing too drastic, so you accepted, excited to wear your new Gryffindor scarf as part of your costume, you’re never too old for trick-or-treating.</p>
<p>“I’m coming, calm down!” You said as you walked out of your room and closed the door. You swiftly grabbed the house keys from the table and met your 8-year-old brother, who was beaming excitedly. You took his hand and walked out the door, making sure that the sign informing everyone that you weren’t handing out candy this year was able to be seen, locked the door and started your walk around the neighborhood. Living in one of the calmest parts of San Francisco had its perks.</p>
<p>After you and your brother got enough candy to rot your teeth, you both lied down in your backyard, looking at the stars. Mason had suddenly taken a liking towards the stars and many constellations, and you were happy to teach him what you knew, both from the Internet and from investigating a bit on the astronomy aspect of Harry Potter.</p>
<p>“What are you teaching me today, Y/N?”</p>
<p>You thought for a bit before smiling widely. “How about the star called Sirius?” You watched as your brother nodded at you, before looking at the starred sky again. “Remember how to locate Orion,” you started, watching Mason’s eyes travel wildly before stopping in the general direction of Orion’s belt, which made you continue. “Now, from Orion’s belt, draw a diagonal line, this will make you find it easier. Sirius is the brightest star in the sky.”</p>
<p>“I see it!” He smiled wildly while pointing up. You congratulated him and listened as he kept pointing at different constellations, all which you had taught him how to find. Suddenly, you saw a flash of light soar across the sky before disappearing right as it reached Sirius. “A shooting star! Make a wish, sis!”</p>
<p>“Uhh, I wish to be part of the magical world of Harry Potter.” You said out loud, still looking at the sky.</p>
<p>“I wish for more candy!” You rolled your eyes playfully, laughing slightly. Then gave him some of yours. He gasped. “My wish came <em>true!<em> That means that your wish will come true, too, Y/N!”</em></em></p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em></em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>“Let’s just go to sleep, I’m tired, and it’s past your bedtime already.” You ruffled his hair as you both walked to your rooms. Mason jumped up and clung to you as he wished you goodnight and gave you a loving kiss on your cheek, to which you did the same and carried him to his bedroom, tucking him in. “I love you, Mace. ‘Night.”</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em></em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>With that, you went to sleep, not knowing what awaited you.</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em></em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>As you fell into a dreamless sleep, you awoke to the feeling something hitting your side a bit roughly. You opened your eyes to see a cart next to you, and a girl with flaming red hair and green eyes running towards you. </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em></em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>You decided to question your mental health later and quickly caught the cart before it went further, and looked around quickly, noting the many people walking by. “...Toto, I’ve a feeling we’re not in Kansas anymore.” You muttered to yourself, the gears in your head turning as you scanned the cart in front of you. </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em></em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>The girl, who looked an <em>awful lot<em> like Lily Evans, got to you and grabbed the cart. “Thank you, I’m really sorry for that, it suddenly slipped from my hands.”</em></em></p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>“It’s alright. At least you caught it before it hit someone else.” You smiled, trying to keep your calm as you noticed your surroundings and her English accent. You’re pretty sure the girl noticed yours, too, as she gave you a curious look.</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>“You’re not from here, are you? I’m Lily Evans, nice to meet you.” She smiled and shook your hand, not knowing that what she just said made you panic internally.</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>“Y/N L/N, nice to meet you. And to answer your question, no, I’m from San Francisco.” You smiled back, thanking the heavens that you had been in the drama club most of your time at school. You didn’t know how this would’ve gone otherwise. Being a theatre kid really had its benefits, besides being awesome, of course.</p>
<p>

        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>“Have you always been here? Or did you transfer from another magical school recently?” She questioned, looking at you kindly. You quickly decided to let your instinct and improvising skills do their job while you mentally scanned the place, making sure she didn’t notice. You held your gasp when you saw a huge red train waiting to leave. Were you in platform 9 ¾?</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>“I’ll be starting my fourth year, but I just transferred from Ilvermorny, so actually, this is my first year here. What year are you in?” You mentally sighed in relief as she smiled, telling you that she was also in the fourth year. You quickly looked around and spotted a group of four guys that looked very familiar. Conveniently, they were near the place where an entrance to the train was located, so you could talk to them and see what happens. “I’m really sorry, Lily, but I have to go, the train will leave soon.” </p>
<p>

      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>You both promised to meet later, and so you grabbed your cart, which was next to you and you just noticed, quickly walking forward, a plan already starting to form in your head.</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>You walked forward and looked at the black cat sleeping on top of a book on one of your trunks, deciding that it would be part of your plan. You picked it up and smiled as it purred before opening its large, green eyes. “Hey, sweetie. I’m guessing that if I was granted this wish, you’re going to be helping me a lot.” The cat meowed and you took it as a sign that it understood. “You’re a smart one, aren’t you? Well then, would you help me?” After it tilted its head and meowed once more, you told the cat what to do, smiling excitedly, although you questioned your sanity a bit, as it jumped out of your arms and started running towards the group of guys from earlier, you waited a few seconds before running after it.</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>You saw one of the guys, who had shoulder-length hair, notice your cat running towards them, then look at you running after it, and swiftly managed to pick it up in his arms, watching the cat tense, but stay still.</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>You caught up to them and smiled, your breathing slightly heavy. “Thank you so much. I don’t know what he saw but it seems like it was worth escaping.” You chuckled and picked him up as the stranger handed him to you. You scratched behind your cat’s ears and watched as he relaxed and purred, your smile getting a bit wider. You were already growing fond of this cat.</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>“No problem, anything for a damsel in distress.” The guy smiled at you and winked, and you dramatically placed a hand over your heart.</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>“My knight in shining armor!” You fake swooned, then laughed. “No, but really, thanks.” You grinned.</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>“You’re not from here, are you?” Another guy raised an eyebrow, he had round glasses that confirmed your theory further.</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>The guy with long hair wrapped an arm around your waist.  You shook your head and explained the same way you did with Lily. “American, huh? Well, glad to have an exotic bird coming from afar, and beautiful, even.” He flirted.</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>You smiled and fought the blush, you couldn’t act like one of the many bimbos you read about, not if you wanted this plan to work. “Thank you, no one’s ever told me that before.” You suddenly realized that you hadn’t introduced yourself. “I’m Y/N L/N, a pleasure to meet you.” You extended your hand at him, also looking at the other three guys, expecting him to shake it.</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>You did <em>not<em> expect him to grab it and plant a kiss on the back of your hand, maintaining eye contact. “Sirius Black. The pleasure’s all mine.” You rolled your eyes playfully and gently pulled your hand back, biting the inside of your cheek.</em></em></p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em>
          <em>
            <em></em>
          </em>
        </em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>“Now, Padfoot. You’ll scare her off.” A guy with scars on his face said, from what was happening, you were pretty sure that you knew who he was. “Remus Lupin, nice to meet you.” You smiled.</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em>
          <em>
            <em></em>
          </em>
        </em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>“Likewise. However, it takes much more to scare me off, believe me.” You chuckled, then looked to the side as you felt an arm wrap around your shoulders. James, you guessed, as he wore glasses that reminded you of Harry Potter and had hair equally messy if not more.</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em>
          <em>
            <em></em>
          </em>
        </em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>“I’ll consider that. I’m James Potter and he’s Peter Pettigrew, a pleasure to meet you.” You smiled at them, keeping your calm as to not murder Peter right then and there. You knew you had to be friends with him too, in order for this to work.</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em>
          <em>
            <em></em>
          </em>
        </em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>“So, love, got a seat on the train already?” You heard Sirius behind you, and you turned your head to see him standing awfully close to you, to which you took a step forward, making the space between you wider, and answered that no, you didn’t. “Would you like to sit with us, then?” </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em>
          <em>
            <em></em>
          </em>
        </em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>You looked around to see James and Remus smiling, so you knew it didn’t bother them. “Uh, sure. Let me get my cart real quick.” With that, you put your cat down and started walking quickly towards your cart, watching as your cat walked by your side. You really needed to name him.</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em>
          <em>
            <em></em>
          </em>
        </em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>As you walked back, you saw them talking, but when you approached, they shut up immediately. Remus walked towards you and looked at the book your cat was previously sleeping on top of. The book was the size of your hand and thick enough to be around 300 pages. “‘To Kill A Mockingbird’, huh? You’ve got a good taste in books.” Remus smiled at you, to which you smiled back and thanked him.</p>
<p>

          </em>
        </em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>“Want us to help you with those?” Sirius asked while picking up one of your trunks. They looked heavy, and you saw Sirius struggling to carry it.</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em>
          <em>
            <em></em>
          </em>
        </em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>“Um, no, thank you. I can handle it.” You answered while easily picking up the trunk still on the cart, and swiftly grabbing the other one from Sirius’ grasp, to the boys’ amazement. You watched your cat pick up your book with its mouth, kind of like a dog would, and walked into the train.</p>
<p>

          </em>
        </em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>After you settled in an empty compartment, you sat down and looked through the window, thinking and from time to time muttering to yourself.</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em>
          <em>
            <em></em>
          </em>
        </em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p>
<p>How could you be part of the Marauders, while at the same time not asking them, so you did not look desperate about it, therefore making <em>them<em> want to be friends with <em>you<em>?</em></em></em></em></p>
<p>
  <em>
    <em>

          </em>
        </em>
      </em>
    </em>

<p>You gasped softly as the answer hit you like a truck. You smiled mischievously, your eyes shining.</p>
