    <p>a month after the war has ended, after all the trials are done, harry decides to return malfoy’s wand. after all, he knows malfoy isn’t stupid enough to do anything bad with it with the ministry watching him and his mother so closely. <br/>he goes up to the gate, shivering slightly at the building in front of him. it doesn’t look like it did then- the manor seems much lighter, and the plants in the front gardens are thriving. there are lights on in almost every window, almost as if the malfoys are wary of letting it be dark. maybe they are, harry thinks. <br/>he doesn’t know how to get into the wards, so he clears his throat, unsure on what to say. maybe his name will get him in- it did last time, didnt it? “it’s harry potter,” he says. “i, uh- i wanted to return malfoy’s wand.” <br/>there is a pause, like someone inside the house is debating whether or not to let him in. then the gates swing open. harry starts up the path, willing himself to focus on the differences from the last time he was here, rather than the similarities. the rose bushes are beautiful, he thinks, and it smells fresh. freer. the sense of rot and decay that formerly hung over the home is gone. <br/>he gets to the door and gulps before knocking. he doesn’t know who he wants to answer, and cannot decide who will be worse- malfoy, or his mother. he’s saved from debating the pros and cons of each, though, because the door swings open about forty-five seconds later. <br/>it’s malfoy. though technically, harry thinks, the person answering the door would be malfoy either way.<br/>his hair is grown out a bit, and lacking his signature slicked-back look. it’s loose, and a bit wavy, and harry isn’t used to this. <br/>and he really isn’t used to the fact that malfoy is wearing makeup. his lashes, usually pale, are stark black against the lightness of the rest of his face. they make his eyes pop, make them look wide. his cheeks are shimmering, and so is the bridge of his nose- his cheekbones somehow look more defined, and his eyelids have pops of color on them. his eyebrows are darker than usual, and his lips are a dark red, making his teeth look even whiter than before as he grits them, looking behind him at someth-<br/>someone.<br/>oh, joy. parkinson’s here too. she was right behind malfoy, a shimmering brush in hand, pouting at him. “come on, draco, make it quick!” she didn’t look at harry. he was a bit glad- he wouldn’t know what to say. <br/>“potter.” god, this is awkward. he knew it would be, but- god. add on the fact that he can’t stop staring at malfoy’s lips, and. well. that does not make this better. <br/>harry cleared his throat again, forcing his eyes to meet malfoy’s. “malfoy. er, like i said, i wanted to return your wand.” he raised his hand a bit, gesturing for malfoy to take it. <br/>“oh, no,” said parkinson with wide eyes, a barely hidden smile on her face. “now he’ll be able to hex me for making him be my model.” <br/>“you know,” malfoy turned to her with a grin, “i wasn’t even thinking about that. thanks for the idea, though.” he took the wand from harry, locking eyes with him, his face becoming serious again. “thank you, potter.” <br/>parkinson laughed. “ha! g-“ <br/>“i will kick you out of this house before you can even say ‘merlin.’” malfoy stuck her with a glare, before they both started laughing again. <br/>harry stared at them, bewildered, before parkinson looked back at him. “what, potty? surprised the evil little slytherins can laugh?”<br/>“pansy.” malfoy said in a warning tone. they shared A Look, like they were having a conversation with just their eyes. it was weird. reminded harry of ron and hermione- and comparing malfoy and parkinson to ron and hermione was about the last thing he’d ever thought would happen. ever. <br/>parkinson sighed. “fine. sorry, potter.” <br/>“you don’t look very sorry.” harry noted, tilting his head a bit. <br/>parkinson gave him a sharp little smile, while malfoy stepped more in front of her, that familiar mask of cold determination covering his face. malfoy was obviously trying to protect her- which, again. one of the last things he’s ever thought would happen. ever. <br/>he wasn’t very intimidating, though, considering that harry had grown about four inches taller than him in the last year, and that malfoy’s face was legitimately shimmering. but it was fine. <br/>now that harry’s attention was drawn to the makeup again, he couldn’t help but take in every detail. after a moment, he noticed malfoy’s cheeks had a pink tint to them- one that hadn’t been there before. parkinson was snickering a bit, elbowing malfoy in the side and covering the lower half of her face with her hands. <br/>a voice came from one of the stairwells. “draco? who was at the door?” <br/>narcissa malfoy. oh. joy. <br/>harry’s too tired for this. it took a lot of effort to get here today. if he sees narcissa, he’ll feel the urge to thank her, and honestly- he doesn’t want to deal with that today. he doesn’t want to remember. <br/>“well. i should, er, get going.” he glanced down at malfoy’s wand in his hand. “i’ve done what i came here to do. bye.” <br/>malfoy’s eyes flashed with understanding, and he gave a small nod. “see you around, potter.<br/>and he closed the door in harry’s face. <br/>as harry started walking back down the path, he could’ve sworn he heard a high squeal from behind the door.</p>
