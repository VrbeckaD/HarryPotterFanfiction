    <p dir="ltr">Luna sat in a compartment, swinging her feet while she read the Quibbler. She wore a faint smile on her face that she always wore, but this time it was different.</p><p dir="ltr">She had friends! Actual friends! Her bestfriends were two Gryffindors, Neville and Ginny. She sent them letters all summer and even sent some to Harry.</p><p dir="ltr">She didn't think Ron liked her very much, but that didn't bother her. Hermione was nice to her, but she could tell she didn't really like it when she talked about magical creatures her father wrote about, but it was okay, she was just a little close-minded. Maybe one day she'd come around.</p><p dir="ltr">The compartment door opened and Neville poked his face in. He gave her a confused look while he came in and sat across from her. "What's on your face?"</p><p dir="ltr">She brought her fingers to the glasses she was wearing and her smile widened. "They are called Spectrespecs and they help me see Wrackspurts." She explained.</p><p dir="ltr">"What are those?" Neville asked curiously.</p><p dir="ltr">"They are invisible creatures that make your brain go fuzzy."</p><p dir="ltr">He nodded his head in understanding. Harry Potter pokes his head through their compartment door. "Er, can I join you?"</p><p dir="ltr">"Of course." Luna beamed.</p><p dir="ltr">He sat down next to Luna happily. He asked about her glasses and happily explained everything to him as she did for Neville.</p><p dir="ltr">"How is the Quibbler doing?" Harry asked curiously.</p><p dir="ltr">"Amazing, the interview with you is still selling our magazine. Daddy is quite pleased."</p><p dir="ltr">Harry was about to reply when Romilda Vane poked her head into their compartment.</p><p dir="ltr">Luna noticed her already changed into her uniform and her skirt was shorter than the requirements. She gave Harry an alluring smile. "Harry, do you want to join me and my friends in our compartment?" She looked at Neville and Luna with disdain.</p><p dir="ltr">Luna was used to the looks, but Harry didn't seem so pleased to see the look she shot his two friends. "No, I'm fine here, thank you. These are my friends." He tried to force a friendly grin, but his displeasure showed on his face, making Romilda surprised.</p><p dir="ltr">"O-okay." She didn't expect that reply and hesitantly left the trio alone.</p><p dir="ltr">"People just expect you to hang out with cooler people." Luna shrugged.</p><p dir="ltr">"You are cool." Harry shrugged.</p><p dir="ltr">They both gave him a warm grin, he noticed they both were very happy to hear that statement, but to him, it was true.</p><p dir="ltr">They spoke about Harry's summer, which wasn't the best, but he was vague.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry noticed Draco and his goons walk passed with Pansy following suit. Luna had a run in with her and her gang of Slytherin girls. She knew one of them to be Daphne Greengrass. Her sister Astoria was a year younger. She was quiet and kept to her small group of friends.</p><p dir="ltr">Luna didn't hate anyone, but she very much disliked those Slytherins. But she knew not all were bad and the ones that were, were only that way because they were misguided, she hoped one day they'd see their mistakes and grow. And she'd be ready to forgive them for their unkindness.</p><p dir="ltr">"Er, I uh... I'll be back." Harry got up and left. Luna assumed he was going to spy on his rival, it wasn't very hard to tell.</p><p dir="ltr">"Where do you think he's going?" Neville asked.</p><p dir="ltr">"Spying on Draco." She said matter-of-factly.</p><p dir="ltr">It was the most logical sense. Luna felt bad for the rich boy. She could see how badly he just wanted his father's acceptance. She noticed how he wasn't naturally cruel, it was learned, and from his father. He was mean to hers, making it clear. Draco also said insults she heard his father throw.</p><p dir="ltr">She pitied that boy, he must truly have an unhappy life. Her mother always said that no one is born evil, but taught it. And Draco had constant reinforcement for his cruel behavior, so clearly he'd only continue his poor ways.</p><p dir="ltr">By the end of the train ride, Harry never came back and she expected that. He would get caught up. Luna stayed behind, scoping out each of the compartments for Wrackspurts.</p><p dir="ltr">She made it to the another part of the train, she saw a cluster of Wrackspurts on the floor. She furrowed her eyebrows curiously. She waved her wand and an invisibility cloak revealed Harry with blood running down his face with his nose clearly broken.</p><p dir="ltr">She waved her wand again and he was able to move.</p><p dir="ltr">"Luna!" He exclaimed. "How did you find me?"</p><p dir="ltr">"Wrackspurts, your head is filled with them." She explained.</p><p dir="ltr">The two exit the train just in time. They walked down the rural path to the castle, they were too late for a carriage.</p><p dir="ltr">They walked along the dirt path, the moon lighting their way.</p><p dir="ltr">"What happened?" Luna asked her friend.</p><p dir="ltr">"Malfoy." He muttered bitterly.</p><p dir="ltr">She nodded her head. "He can be very unkind."</p><p dir="ltr">"Yeah." He agreed.</p><p dir="ltr">They finally arrived to the castle. They spot Mr Filch holding onto a cane, Draco ripped it out of his hands, calling him names.</p><p dir="ltr">Draco sneered at Harry. "Nice face, Potter." He quickly left.</p><p dir="ltr">"I can fix it if you like." Luna beamed.</p><p dir="ltr">"Have you fixed noses before?"</p><p dir="ltr">"No, normally toes, but how different are they really?" She gave him a small giggle.</p><p dir="ltr">"Okay, sure, go for it." He shrugged.</p><p dir="ltr">"Episkey!" She flicked her wand.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry let out a grunt, but then looked like he was okay. "How does it look?"</p><p dir="ltr">"Exceptionally ordinary." She grinned.</p><p dir="ltr">"Brilliant." He seemed a little surprised it worked.</p><p dir="ltr">They got around to change into their robes, they made it to the great hall during Dumbledore's speech. Luna gave some familiar Ravenclaws a smile. She listened to the remainder of the speech, but she could only focus on the blackening hand the headmaster had. She felt concerned, would he be okay? Would he live without pain?</p><p dir="ltr">She noticed across from her table was Draco at his. He sat his chin in his palm and looked very disinterested. He stared out at nothing and didn't even clap when his godfather was announced to be the new defense against the dark arts teacher. Professor Slughorn would be taking his position. She imagined Snape was happy with this arrangement.</p><p dir="ltr">Draco stared at nothing, unable to think of anything other than his interaction with the Dark Lord.</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>"Do you swear allegiance to me?" The Dark Lord asked him in his cool </em>
  <em>voice</em>
  <em>. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>"I swear." Draco </em>
  <em>forced</em>
  <em> from his mouth. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">He remembers the burning on his forearm and the pain from when the dark mark when it first formed. Draco knew he should have been excited, but he wasn't. And he felt anxious. Draco had to kill Dumbledore, that was his task from the Dark Lord and if he didn't, he'd be killed and so will his family. He had to do this, he had no choice.</p><p dir="ltr">The idea of being a death eater, excited him at first, but now... he feared Voldemort. He missed his father and wished that this responsibility would be his. He was just a boy, but he would have to prove to be a loyal servant to the Dark Lord and to make up for his father's failures. If only his father didn't let the Dark Lord down. He didn't want to kill his headmaster, but he didn't want to be killed either.</p><p dir="ltr">Over the summer he had multiple thing prepared for the assassination, if one thing failed, another was ought to succeed. He didn't want to have to do it in person, he couldn't. He was a coward.</p><p dir="ltr">He hated himself for being a coward. He also had to fix a broken vanishing cabinet to get death eaters into the castle. God, he was so stressed out and depressed.</p><p dir="ltr">A part of him just wanted to kill himself, but he feared for what would happen if he did. Would the Dark Lord kill his family in retaliation? Most definitely.</p><p dir="ltr">"Draco, are you okay?" Pansy asked him softly.</p><p dir="ltr">He broke up with her so he could focus on his task. He didn't have time to have a girlfriend, especially one demanding as Pansy. She always wanted attention and wants to snog and no matter how much Draco wanted to snog her, he couldn't. He was treated like a man now, he couldn't enjoy the moment.</p><p dir="ltr">"Fine." He muttered. She was still his friend and he still cared for her in a way. "Just tired."</p><p dir="ltr">"You see Potter come in with Loony Luna?" Blaise snickered.</p><p dir="ltr">"I bet he snogged that freak." Pansy giggled.</p><p dir="ltr">"Definitely." Draco was only half-listening. He just wanted to retreat from social interaction.</p><p dir="ltr">He looked forward to when the feast ended and he could go off to bed, only for dark thoughts to swim within his brain.</p>
