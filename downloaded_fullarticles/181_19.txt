    <p>Draco had grown bored with the company of his friends rather quickly. Blaise was getting close to his heat cycle and had been following him around for a few days. He had gotten cross when Draco told him to go to the hospital wing to request a private room and sedation if he couldn’t control his own body. </p><p>This had caused a very large uproar amongst the few other omegas, saying that an alpha could never understand what they had to go through during a heat cycle. “And you think a rut is bloody easy?” Draco had scoffed. He had rubbed himself raw the first time. His second rut, he had tried using a beta. That was almost as bad because a beta couldn’t take an alphas knot. Now he just went through the sedation for a few days. It was very unsatisfying, but it would do until he found a proper mate. </p><p>Growing weary of being cooped up in the castle, he decided to stretch his legs down by the lake. The day was lovely, the crisp autumn breeze caught his cloak and made it billow behind him. He turned his face up towards the sun, enjoying the warmth against his skin. Hearing laughter, he turned to see who was out. When he saw the golden trio, he almost turned around and went back to the castle to avoid any confrontation. </p><p>No, he wouldn’t do that. He had every right to be here. He adjusted his path so that he could avoid them as much as possible. Before he could get too far, however, Granger called out to him. He had several classes with her and they were partners in Advanced Potions so they had been trying very hard to at least be polite to each other. Draco had been pleased to see that they actually worked quite well together and she was almost as good as Theo at Potions and much better than Pansy or Greg so he could live with it. </p><p>“Hey, Draco,” she called out, waving him over. He raised an eyebrow at the use of his name, but walked over casually to see what she wanted. He nodded his head to Potter and the Weasel. “Do you have a moment?”</p><p>He almost said no, but she was trying so hard to be nice to him lately and he had treated the girl horribly in the past. He released a heavy sigh and tilted his head towards her, “Only because you loaned me that book for the Arithmancy essay. What can I do for you?”<br/>
She smiled brightly and he couldn’t help but to grin, just a little. It seemed to annoy the Weasel, so that was an added bonus. “These two are not understanding this potion and they won’t listen to me, so I was hoping you might be able to help.” </p><p>He looked down at the open book in front of them. “If you can’t explain it, Mione, I don’t know why you’d think he could,” Ron huffed. </p><p>Draco rolled his eyes, but otherwise ignored him. “He’s been tutoring Goyle since first year. If he can explain it in a way that I can’t it may make it easier for you to understand it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I’d rather not take lessons from a Ferret, thank you,” Ron growled, eyes narrowing at Draco. </p><p>“Shut it, Ron,” Harry groaned. “If you don’t want his help, then fine. But I seriously need to pass this course with at least an E so that I can get into the healer’s courses at St. Mungo's next year.” He looked up at Draco, “If you’re willing to help, I’d be extremely grateful.”</p><p>Draco looked down at Potter. He looked so earnest and helpless. Draco sighed as if he was extremely put upon. “I’ll help you, but I want to finish my walk. When I’m finished, we’ll go to the library. The common room is entirely too crowded today.”</p><p>Harry grabbed his things and got to his feet. He had apparently taken Draco’s words as an invitation to walk with him before going to the library. Draco rolled his eyes and took Harry’s bag from him, slinging it over his shoulder. He ignored the scowl from the Weasel and the odd look Potter gave him. “I can carry that,” Harry said as he looked up at Draco. </p><p>“If my mother found out that I was behaving below my station by making an omega carry his own things, she would politely ring my neck,” Draco stated as he started walking away. </p><p>“I’ll catch up with you guys at dinner,” Harry called to his friends as he jogged to catch up to Draco. “How’d you know that I’m an omega?” Harry asked as he caught up to him.</p><p>“I’m an alpha, Potter,” Draco’s tone was a bit colder than he’d intended. He was off to a bad start already. “I can smell you.” </p><p>Harry didn’t look offended, only puzzled. “Ron couldn’t smell me. I use scent blockers to mask it and I haven’t told anyone but Hermione. Not even Ron.”</p><p>“You use scent blockers?” Draco stopped and ran a hand through his hair. “Fuck,” he hissed. “When was your last heat, Potter?”</p><p>Potter looked confused. “I’m not sure. It’s been awhile. I used a suppressant before and my healer said that the stress of the last year likely repressed it. Why?”</p><p>“If you’re using a suppressant, I shouldn’t be able to smell you,” Draco said slowly. “We need to get you to the hospital wing. I think you’re about to go into heat.”</p>
