</p><hr/><p>Olivia said goodnight to Ross and made her way into her apartment complex. She felt as if she were in autopilot when Mallory had called her into headquarters, even though she was legally dead. The surprised and shocked faces of agents and staff would have humoured her if it hadn't been for the situation, that MI6 currently found themselves in.<br/> <br/> She was adamant about refusing Mallory's offer to get meddled back in MI6 affairs, but when he had told her it concerned Bond, she knew she couldn't say no. She had never got round to telling him that she was alive after Skyfall. The only comfort she could give him was a pre-recorded video in the event of her death to track down Marco Sciarra and finish what she had started. But it seemed her plan had worked too well and now Bond was missing. Even Q's smart blood couldn't find the agent, which could only mean he was dead. She didn't want to believe it, but there was no other possible explanation for it.<br/> <br/> Q and Mallory had shown her all the data Bond had managed to gather on his uncertified mission. When they had told her Quantum was a part of SPECTRE, everything over the years started to fall into place, which made her frustrated that they didn't find the link sooner. She remembered James' file detailing a man called Oberhauser who died in an avalanche with his father, but she could never have guessed that he was the reason for everything that had occurred in Bond's life or the fact that he had sent Silva after her, probably due to a vast range of reasons. The main reason being revenge for leaving him in the hands of the Chinese, and then there was also the fact that she was probably too close to finding out the truth. So, they had sent Silva to silence her. All reasons were plausible, but she couldn't think of a reason as to what happened to James. Unless White's daughter had a hand in it, but she prayed that wasn't the case. They didn't need another Vesper incident on their hands.<br/> <br/> Bond had been missing for three weeks before Mallory had decided to tell her. She thought he had wanted her help in finding him, but she should have known better. It seemed Mallory had already written him off. She understood that the man's hands were tied and he would be out of a job in the next few days, but he could at least try and find him to bring him home. Bond, at least, deserved that, after everything he had given to the service over the years. She had never been so angry with Mallory, not even when he suggested retirement planning to her after she lost the hard drive. It seemed such a lifetime ago when in reality it had only been over a year.<br/> <br/> When the elevator doors opened, she walked down the corridor to her apartment only to stop in her tracks when she noticed her front door was slightly ajar. Taking a few tentative steps forward, she reached into her bag, pulled out the Derringer and took off the safety. Creeping closer to the door, she cautiously opened it, and stepped inside, holding the gun in front of her. As she walked down the slightly lightened corridor, she heard rustling coming from within her living room.<br/> <br/> Pushing the door open, she finally saw who the perpetrator was and felt a surge of annoyance flow through her.<br/> <br/> "What the bloody hells are you doing?" Olivia hissed.<br/> <br/> The person stopped what they were doing and turned to look at Olivia caught between disbelief that she was alive, and anger that she had been kept in the dark.<br/> <br/> "What the hell am I doing?! You're the one that's supposed to be dead! Were you ever going to tell me?!"<br/> <br/> Olivia lowered her gun and tried not to flinch at the accusation. She was so caught up in thinking about Bond's whereabouts; she had completely forgotten to inform Minerva she was alive. She had intended to tell her at some point, she just never got round to it.<br/> <br/> She put the safety back on the gun and sat it on the table, before taking a seat on the couch as she looked up at the other woman, who now had her arms folded across her chest as she waited for an explanation. It was the first time she had seen Minerva in years without her emerald green dress robes and hat. Now, she was dressed in black trousers and a red blouse. Her hair was no longer in her famous tight bun, but rather sitting on her shoulders. To Olivia, it looked shorter, which made her wonder why she had changed it. She could feel Minerva's blue eyes staring at her as she waited for her answer.<br/> <br/> "What do you want me to say, Min?!"<br/> <br/> "I want you to tell me the truth! I'm your sister in all but blood, and you didn't even have the courtesy to tell me you were alive!"<br/> <br/> "I was going to tell youâ€¦"<br/> <br/> Minerva gave a scoff, "When were you going to tell me?! I had to find out from Bond that you were dead! Was he in on your plan?"<br/> <br/> "Min, calm down."<br/> <br/> "Don't you dare tell me to calm down, Olivia Barbara Mansfield! The both of us mourned you for months! I even had to check on that poor man to make sure he ate and slept! He blamed himself for your death! So don't you dare sit there and tell me to calm down!"<br/> <br/> Olivia didn't know what to say, other than she should have told them both what she and Mallory had planned. It wasn't one of her greatest moments. She realised that now.<br/> <br/> "I wouldn't be surprised if Bond was in on it with you! Did the both of you enjoy taking me for an idiot?! Speaking of Bond, where the hell is he! I need to have a few chosen words with him as well! If he knew you were alive after all these months, he should have told me, if you didn't have the nerve to do it yourself! Now, I know why the hat never placed you in Gryffindor all those years ago; you are too much of a coward." Minerva looked down at her in disappointment.<br/> <br/> Olivia tried not to flinch at her words, "If you've quite finished Minerva, then perhaps you should take what you came here for and just go."<br/> <br/> Minerva heard the defeated tone in her voice and the flash of hurt in her eyes, as she looked away from her and stared down at the floor. She had expected her to argue back at least, but not give up without a fight. This was not the same Olivia she knew; something had happened and whatever it was she would find out, even if it took all night to do so.<br/> <br/> "What's happened, Liv?" Minerva asked softly uncrossing her arms and taking a seat next to her.<br/> <br/> "I'm not in the mood to speak about it, Min."<br/> <br/> "I'm not leaving until you tell me."<br/> <br/> "Then you are going to be here for a while," Olivia told her, holding her head in her hands, wishing Minerva would just leave her alone.<br/> <br/> "It's about Bond isn't it? He's the reason you are acting like this."<br/> <br/> When Olivia didn't answer her, she knew she had hit the nail on the head.<br/> <br/> "Olivia, answer me. Is it Bond?"<br/> <br/> Olivia knew she would need to tell Minerva at some point, so she may as well get it over with now rather than later.<br/> <br/> "At nine o'clock this morning, I received a call from Mallory, informing me that he needed to see me about an urgent matter. He wouldn't discuss it over the phone, only that it regarded James." She whispered, trying to keep her emotions under control.<br/> <br/> Minerva's face paled, wondering just how bad the situation was that Mallory couldn't tell Olivia over the phone. Ever since she met the man, she knew without a doubt that he had feelings for Liv; you had to be blind not to see it. She would never forget his face when he stood on her tail in cat form causing her to transfigure back to her human self. It was a cross been shock and denial at what he had just witnessed. It amused her to no end. The rest of the night was spent with herself and Olivia telling him about the wizarding world which led to an endless onslaught of questions that she left for, Olivia to answer.<br/> <br/> Over the years, she had taken a shine to him much as Olivia had done, except her relationship with James was that of a mother and son. They had helped each other through their grief of losing Olivia; she couldn't imagine him not being here. Minerva could only imagine what Olivia was feeling when she heard whatever news Mallory had to tell her.<br/> <br/> "The reason James couldn't tell you I was alive is because one he didn't know and two he's missing." Olivia bluntly informed Minerva, finally turning to look at her.<br/> <br/> "Missing? What do you mean missing? A man just doesn't disappear off the radar!"<br/> <br/> Olivia gave a humourless chuckle, "This is James we're talking about, Min. It isn't the first time he has disappeared."<br/> <br/> "But you think he hasn't gone off on his own accord this time?"<br/> <br/> "Exactly. I left him a message in the event of my death to take care of a man known as Marco Sciarra, who until recently I found out was a member of SPECTRE."<br/> <br/> "SPECTRE, catchy name. Just who are these people exactly?"<br/> <br/> "Do you remember the fiasco I told you we had with Quantum a few years back?"<br/> <br/> Minerva's eyes narrowed, "How could I forget, considering one of their members was also your personal bodyguard who almost killed you. But what have they got to do with this SPECTRE?"<br/> <br/> Olivia was going to need a stiff drink after this.<br/> <br/> "From what Q told me, it seems that James managed to acquire a ring from Sciarra before his death as well as information on someone known as 'The Pale King'. I told James that after he had taken care of Sciarra to go to his funeral. If he were an important member of their organisation, then he would find clues to lead him to the next piece of the puzzle. It seemed my hunch was right and it turned out that 'The Pale King' was none other than our, Mr White."<br/> <br/> Minerva rubbed her forehead trying to process this, "So, what you are essentially telling me is that Quantum is a part of SPECTRE?"<br/> <br/> "That's precisely what I'm saying, Min. They took us for fools from the start. James found White's daughter, at the Alpine Facility in Austria, she was working as a psychologist there I believe, but that isn't the best part of it."<br/> <br/> "What do you mean?" Minerva asked warily not liking where this was going.<br/> <br/> "Has James ever told you about his childhood, Min?"<br/> <br/> "He did. It was only a week after your death before he started to tell me bits and pieces."<br/> <br/> "Then you'll know that after James' parents were killed that Hannes Oberhauser became close to him, along with his son Franz."<br/> <br/> "I vaguely remember James telling me about them. James thought of him as a second father and Franz as an older brother. The both of them are dead. I don't see what this has got to do with SPECTRE, Liv." Minerva stated, wondering what Olivia was thinking in that head of hers.<br/> <br/> "It turns out that Franz Oberhauser faked his death."<br/> <br/> "What? Why? Minerva had asked before her eyes widened in realisation. "He killed his father?"<br/> <br/> Olivia gave a nod of her head, "It would appear so, and that's not the top of it."<br/> <br/> "What more could there be?"<br/> <br/> "Remember I mentioned the ring?" Olivia questioned as she saw Minerva nod. "Q did a toxicology scan from it and the findings were disturbing, but it all started to make sense."<br/> <br/> "What started to make sense?" Minerva asked confused.<br/> <br/> "The results from the scanned ring brought back DNA matches for seven known associates; Dominic Greene, Le Chiffre, Patrice, Tiago Rodriquez, Marco Sciarra, Mr White and at the top of the pyramid, Franz Oberhauser. All of them linked to one larger organisation known as SPECTRE."<br/> <br/> "Tiago was a part of it?" Minerva asked needing to make sure she had heard her right.<br/> <br/> "He was and as I told Mallory earlier, there was a chance that Oberhauser sent Silva after me, once they realised I was tracking them. And let's not forget that I was the one that betrayed Silva to the Chinese, he was a time bomb waiting to happen."<br/> <br/> Minerva shot her an angry look, "You had no other choice. If Silva, wanted to play hacker, he should have thought about the consequences. You were just doing your job; anything else was his fault. Don't you dare sit there and blame yourself for what he's done!"<br/> <br/> Olivia knew Minerva was right, but her actions from her past had caught up with her and it had cost many agents their lives in the process. She just couldn't forget, no matter how much she tried. The accusations from the agent's families were the final nail in the coffin, and she didn't blame them for holding her accountable.<br/> <br/> "Now, back to Bond. Where did he go according to this Q after he left Austria? Well, I'm assuming he left Austria."<br/> <br/> "Q said White's daughter; Madeleine Swann was taking James to L'Americain. While there James found coordinates to a barren piece of land in the Morocco Desert. It was only when Q checked the satellite imagery that there appeared to be a facility inside a crater. Everything seemed to be fine until they lost contact with James less than twenty-four hours later."<br/> <br/> Minerva stood up and started to pace the length of Olivia's living room, thinking everything over. James may still be alive; he has been in worse situations than this, but what if this time it was one too many?<br/> <br/> "How were they tracking him?" Minerva demanded.<br/> <br/> "Q injected him with smart blood. It's new nano-gene technology that contains a tracker that becomes a part of your bloodstream."<br/> <br/> Minerva looked at Olivia as if she were crazy, having no idea what half of that technobabble meant.<br/> <br/> "So, if it's as you say, how can they have lost him? If his last known location was in Morocco, why hasn't Mallory sent agents to check the facility?" Minerva stated the obvious.<br/> <br/> "He has, but the facility was deserted and there was no sign of James, Madeleine or Oberhauser." Olivia frowned realising James' outcome looked bleaker with each minute that passed.<br/> <br/> "Olivia, answer me this, do you believe he's dead?"<br/> <br/> "Mallory has already written him off, and as of now MI6 won't fund any more time and resources to find him. I don't want to believe it, Min, but how else can you explain why his tracker isn't working?"<br/> <br/> Minerva bit her lip trying to think of an answer for her, but she could think of none.<br/> <br/> "Did Q or Mallory say anything else to you?"<br/> <br/> "Only that the smart blood could be traced on Q's laptop. It was in the net- Christ that's it." Olivia murmured as she quickly stood up, walked over to her desk and accessed her laptop.<br/> <br/> Minerva curiously walked over and stood next to her, watching as she typed away on the keyboard.<br/> <br/> "Are you going to tell me what it is you think you have found?"<br/> <br/> "It may be nothing, but Mallory was filling me in on a new Surveillance Intelligence network known as 'Nine Eyes' that was created by Max Denbigh."<br/> <br/> "I'm going to pretend I know what all of that means, but that still doesn't explain why you think this Mr Denbigh or his programme will help us find Bond."<br/> <br/> "Q mentioned that he was tracking all of James' movements on his laptop before Mallory ordered him to destroy all the smart blood files. Denbigh's Surveillance network has access to every form of software around the globe." Olivia kept her eyes on the laptop screen as she put in Mallory's codes.<br/> <br/> "Do I want to know how you got those?" Minerva tried not to smirk.<br/> <br/> "Let's just say that James is starting to rub off on me."<br/> <br/> <em>'He's certainly done more than that,'</em> Minerva thought to herself as she watched Olivia bring up the files on 'Nine Eyes.'<br/> <br/> "What are you looking for?" Minerva leant over Olivia's shoulder to take a closer look at the screen.<br/> <br/> "I'm not sure; it's probably a long shot. But if 'Nine Eyes' has access to computer networks, what's to stop it from hacking into Q's laptop." Olivia stated before cursing as she found nothing that would be helpful.<br/> <br/> "Who else has access to 'Nine Eyes' other than Mr Denbigh?" Minerva asked lost in thought.<br/> <br/> "Only him, he is the head of the programme." Olivia looked up at Minerva, "why? What are you thinking?"<br/> <br/> "Can you do a check on him?"<br/> <br/> Olivia looked back towards the screen and did a background check on Denbigh and quickly brought up his file.<br/> <br/> To Olivia, everything seemed to be in order, but she knew appearances could be deceiving.<br/> <br/> "There's nothing, Min. If he is in control of the network, it will allow him to change his file. Not to mention if he accessed the smart blood files he could have done something to disable James' tracker."<br/> <br/> "Olivia, you do realise you are accusing this Denbigh, without any evidence to go on that that proves what your saying is true." Minerva cautioned, knowing if Olivia were wrong it would end in disaster.<br/> <br/> "What if I'm right, though, Min and he is behind all of this, maybe even working for Oberhauser. It wouldn't be the first time henchmen from their organisation worked in SIS without our knowledge. I can't take any chances with him."<br/> <br/> Minerva looked away from Olivia and back to the screen. "Where can we find him?"<br/> <br/> "He works at the Center for National Security. Their headquarters are situated in City Hall." Olivia pointed to the photo on the screen of the oval glass building. "Why? What do you have in mind?" Olivia questioned seeing the thoughtful look on Minerva's face.<br/> <br/> "That I think it's time we paid Mr Denbigh visit. You need proof that he might be working for Oberhauser and behind Bond's disappearance, then he will be the one to tell us."<br/> <br/> "And how do you propose we do that?" Olivia asked seeing the glint in Minerva's eye knowing she had something planned.<br/> <br/> "Olivia, I know you haven't been in the wizarding world for years, but even you can't have forgotten we witches have a way of doing things." Minerva smirked as she saw Olivia catch on.<br/> <br/> "Legilimency?"<br/> <br/> "I may not be the greatest at it, but Severus and Albus taught me a thing or two through the years before their deaths." She gave Olivia a sad smile as she thought about her two colleagues.<br/> <br/> "We had best make a start then." Olivia stood up and walked over to the living room cabinet to retrieve her wand.<br/> <br/> "Liv, before we go. You need to be prepared that this may not give us any new information on Bond's whereabouts."<br/> <br/> "I know, Min. But we've got to at least try. Even If it takes years, I'll find him and bring him home. James deserves that much."<br/> <br/> Reaching for her wand, she felt a warmth flow through her, as soon as her hand had touched the Alder wood. It had been years since she had last touched it. She only wished she had kept it with her when she had the hearing before Silva attacked, and then the mess at Skyfall could have been avoided.<br/> <br/> Grabbing the wand holster that was sitting on the shelf next to where her wand was, she took off her coat, attached it to her arm and placed the wand in it.<br/> <br/> "What about Mallory?" Minerva asked as she buttoned up her coat. "Do we tell him about your suspicions about Denbigh?"<br/> <br/> Olivia put her coat back on and turned to Minerva, "no. As you say, it might be nothing. We'll wait and see before we inform him.<br/> <br/> Minerva gave a sigh, "all right. I'm ready when you are."<br/> <br/> "There is just one more thing before we go, Min. How did you know where to find me? And what exactly was it you were looking for?"<br/> <br/> "Your wand."<br/> <br/> "What?" Olivia asked confused.<br/> <br/> Minerva smiled and shook her head, "You're memory is going in your old age."<br/> <br/> "Less of the old, thank you. Now, you were saying."<br/> <br/> "Remember when we were in our third year, and you got into a spot of trouble with Pamela Thompson and her little band of friends?"<br/> <br/> "How could I forget, and they say we Slytherin's were bad to the bone when it was four girls from your <em>own</em> house that cornered me, just because I accidentally messed up Thompson's potion during class."<br/> <br/> "Yes, and it was only because I was nearby that <em>you</em> were saved from having to spend time in the hospital wing. It was then we decided to cast a tracker spell on our wands, should either one of us get into trouble. And since both, our wand cores are dragon heartstring it only made the connection stronger."<br/> <br/> "I vaguely remember, but if you knew I was dead, why did you try to cast reperio?"<br/> <br/> Minerva gave a chuckle, "You were never good at hiding Liv. I was in London yesterday and I saw you. Well, at the time it was someone who looked like you. I never expected it to be you. That was why today I came back to London and tried reperio and it led me to here. I thought someone had gotten a hold of your wand and I was about to take it with me when you walked in. You really should keep that wand of yours on you at all times, Liv."<br/> <br/> "I'll keep that in mind in the future." Olivia returned Minerva's smile. "It's good to see you again, Min."<br/> <br/> "Same, Liv. Now, pleasantries aside, we have a missing agent to find and an appointment with Mr Denbigh. We don't want to keep the man waiting do we?"<br/> <br/> Olivia smirked, as she walked over to stand next to Minerva. "Would you like to do the honours?"<br/> <br/> Minerva held out her arm for Olivia to hold on to, "It would be my pleasure."<br/> <br/> Olivia looked at her apartment one last time before she felt Minerva's arm twist away from her and everything faded to black.</p>
