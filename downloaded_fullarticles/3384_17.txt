    <p>Being one of the saviours had once again landed Neville on a bad relationship. Arrays of pints and shot glasses clattered in front of him as he drank away his depressing love-life. <em>Isn’t there any witch or wizard who’d actually like him for being himself?, </em>he thought angrily.<em> Why is it so hard to find someone who isn’t just crazing over his saviour title and his new </em>slim<em> look!?</em></p><p>Not that his new look was a bad thing, but bloody hell! Once his more clumsy side came out people run away faster than oil catching fire!</p><p>In the process of intoxicating himself, Neville saw a familiar figure entering the bar. He wasn’t really thinking much when he called, “Zabini!”</p><p>Blaise looked back at Neville with mild confusion before approaching, “Longbottom,” he said with a curt nod before adding, “you’re drunk.”</p><p>Neville shook his head wildly, “No! But-” he paused a bit trying to form words, “I will be!”</p><p>Blaise snorted and took a seat beside him. He waived at the bartender for a drink then returned his attention to the Gryffindor, “Why are intoxicating yourself?”</p><p>Neville scrunched his face, “Being fit and popular sucks,” he mumbled, bleary eyes tried to focus on his Slytherin companion, “They only want me for my <em>body!</em>”</p><p>Blaise actually laughed at that. The sound ringing pleasantly. He looked the drunk Gryffindor up and down “I won’t disagree with that. You are pretty fit.”</p><p>Neville squinted his eyes at Blaise, “I won’t let you break my heart,” he said, trying to be intimidating. The other man only raised a brow at Neville, before turning away to enjoy his drink.</p><p>Neville frowned at him. Most of his friends are not the type to leave him be with his love life. He took this chance to actually take in the man beside him. Blaise looked good. He looked good since Hogwarts with his dark skin and tall frame. Neville already caught up with his height though, his own build a little wider even, “You’re also hot,” Neville blurted out.</p><p>The comment took Blaise off guard, he glanced at Neville briefly before saying between sips, “I also won’t let you break my heart, Longbottom.”</p><p>“I’m not a heartbreaker,” Neville took offence.</p><p>“You’re drunk,” Blaise said again with an air of finality. He pushed away from the counter, “Should I call your Gryffindor friends?”</p><p>“You’re leaving,” Neville noticed and abruptly stood up, swaying a little,“Why are you leaving? What did I do?” he must’ve sound pretty pathetic because Blaise’s eyes soften. <em>Blaise has beautiful eyes. </em></p><p>“You didn’t do anything,” said Blaise, “I don’t plan on drinking too much tonight, that’s all.”</p><p>Neville pouted, “You are breaking my heart.”</p><p>“No, I’m not.” Blaise raised an eyebrow, amused, “You won’t let me, remember?”</p><p>“But you are! You’re leaving!”</p><p>“I can’t stay.”</p><p>“Then take me home with you?”</p><p>“Longbot- Neville, why on earth would I do that?” Blaise asked incredulously.</p><p>“I’m hot. You’re hot.” Neville brought up his fingers in an attempt to count.</p><p>“You’re drunk,” said the Slytherin. But Blaise didn’t move to leave. He took in Neville’s drunken state and sighed, “Alright, I’ll let you stay at my house until one of your Gryffindork friends pick you up.”</p><p>Neville grinned at him brightly, then attempted to walk towards the other man. He didn’t do so well.</p><p>“You’re a mess,” Blaise hooked an arm under Neville to keep him standing.</p><p>“I’m a hot mess!” he declared as Blaise duck his head to hide his face from the crowd.<em> Gryffindors. Always so loud, </em>he thought.</p><p>They apparate to Blaise’s home without much difficulty, to Blaise’s surprise. He helped Neville to the couch before moving towards the Floo. <em>Maybe he could call Draco,</em> he thought, <em>and Draco could contact Potter or whatever—</em></p><p>A hard tug on his cloak made him look back. Neville was almost falling off the couch in his attempt to catch Blaise, “Where’re you going?” the drunk man asked with a frown, “I thought we’re going to <em>snog.</em>”</p><p>Blaise let out a soft choke, “We’re <em>not</em> going to snog.”</p><p>“Why not!?” Neville exclaimed, tugging even harder, “You said I’m fit!”</p><p>“Go to sleep, Longbottom,” Blaise said curtly, “I’ll contact your friends.”</p><p>“I’m not sleepy,” he whined, “And I prefer 'Neville'.”</p><p>“Neville—”</p><p>“Can I at least get a kiss? Or a hug?” said the Gryffindor pleadingly, “I just got dumped.”</p><p>Blaise looked back at him, eyes unreadable as he considered what Neville just said. “A hug then,” he nodded as he spoke. Then he walked towards the couch.</p><p>Neville gave him a sleepy smile, arms open wide as Blaise leant down to hug him. The Gryffindor hugged him tight, “You smell good,” he said and nuzzled the dark Slytherin. Blaise hummed and patted Neville’s back, he could feel the drunk man slowly slumping forward.</p><p>“Can I…” Neville started sleepily, “can I get a kiss too?”</p><p>Blaise gave him a light peck on the lips, “Good night,” he said, before moving away. And tuck the other man snugly in the couch.</p><p>“That’s not a proper kiss,” Neville complained, eyes drooping...</p><p>“You may have a proper kiss tomorrow,” Blaise said as he watched the other man fell into slumber, “If you remember anything, that is.”</p>
