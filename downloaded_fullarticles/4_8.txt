    <p>PART I</p><p>ONE: THE LESSON</p><p>
  <em>I fly high above the ocean, the sun radiating down from above onto my unfurled wings.  The air is fragrant with the smell of brine, and warm, even at this altitude.  The breeze is such that I do not even need to move my wings: I simply soar, watching the water ripple below me.  It catches the sun’s rays, seeming to throw off countless sapphires as the waves play and flirt with each other.  I bank, coming lower, now seeing dark cliffs of steep rock, the water foaming white as it breaks where stone meets sea.  If I stretch my mind, I can see fish below, even an octopus, its ever-probing tentacles sensing the eddying currents and bumbling prey.  I see all of it…I know all of it…I am part of it…</em>
</p><p>The jangling of her alarm clock jarred Robena March violently from her dream.  It was a flying dream, the best kind, but it was irretrievably gone now.  She silenced the clamor after a moment’s clumsy groping with a lazy wave of her wand, blinked twice and opened her eyes.  She then yawned and looked towards the window of her new room.  The light coming through was dim and gray, but it was early and summer had long since given way to autumn, as Robena greeted the seventh day in her new home and her new role as Lucius Malfoy’s governess.    </p><p>Robena had been raised by Muggles, in a townhouse at the end of a cul-de-sac.  It was located in a neighborhood that looked as if someone had created it with a rubber stamp, block after block of numbing monotony.  Hogwarts followed, of course, but even after the grandeur of the castle, it had taken some getting used to to call the formal, imposing homes of the pureblood families she had served since then <em>home</em> and Malfoy Manor was the most formal and imposing yet.  <em>Still, what else would you call the place where you rest your head and care for those within?</em> Robena reasoned as she swung her legs over the side of the bed and placed her bare feet on the freezing marble floor, <em>Surely that must be a home, at least, after a fashion.</em></p><p>For now, Malfoy Manor was just a house; only time would tell if it would truly become a home.  Nonetheless, Robena could be the first to admit that it was, indeed, an extraordinary house. As nervous as she had felt in starting this new appointment, she quickly found some of the many advantages therein.  Never mind the prestige of the family that owned said house and the connections that her new position could lead to in the future, these were obvious.  Conversely, Robena was beginning to discover some of the things that an outsider would not consider a given.</p><p>First, the house and the grounds fairly crackled with magic.  If rumors were to be believed, Malfoy Manor was built on a convergence of two ley lines, ancient fibers of considerable magical force that leant their power to whatever was nearby.  Robena did not yet have such passing familiarity with its inhabitants to verify this in asking.  However, the ease with which she found she could cast magic and the plethora of magical plants and creatures she had already noticed upon the estate lent credence to this theory.  The idea excited Robena, not just for herself, but for her new charge as well.</p><p>Second, even though Robena considered herself to be a progressive sort of witch, she had to admit that having not one, but multiple house elves only too happy to help at a moment’s notice a strange, but not unwelcome luxury.  For example, they wouldn't hear of her making her bed.  Robena had tried the first day, as she had every day since childhood, but was stopped by Dobby, a friendly, if somewhat overzealous representative of their race.  </p><p>Although Dobby had found Robena’s attempt to make her own bed charming, he was quite firm about her not ever doing it again.  He assigned Robena her very own house elf, a female named Bonnsie.  She didn't talk much, although when placed next to Dobby, any other house elf would seem quiet by comparison.  Bonnsie washed and ironed Robena’s clothes and proved to be quite adept at plaits and styles for Robena’s hair.  Even though Robena believed she hardly needed such spoiling, Bonnsie seemed quite content to do it.  Robena thus made a guess that Bonnsie had likely performed this task for the late Mrs. Malfoy, and so, without a lady of the house to serve any more, at the very least, Bonnsie wished to keep up her skill.  After all, the rest of the household was decidedly male.</p><p>Shivering, Robena stood and drew a plaid flannel dressing gown around her before going over to her washstand to freshen up as she considered her new charge.  So far, Lucius had presented himself as a polite, courteous, if somewhat reserved child.  Robena had expected a spoiled, entitled monster, especially after her experience with Percival Selwyn, the youngest of her previous family’s sons and a complete tyrant, but Lucius’ behavior thus far had been exemplary.  Granted, Robena had only been his governess for one week, so who knew?  Nonetheless, in her experience, most children given to horrid behavior showed their true colors early.  Initially, they would test the new authority figure with gnomes in the bathtub, fanged Frisbees for dinner planes, and other such nuisances.  Lucius hadn't done anything resembling this.  </p><p>Robena often wondered if this reticence and decorum on Lucius' part was secondary to being raised in a rather strict, authoritarian environment.  The notion gave rise to those things about Robena’s new assignment that gave her pause.  Although she had only met Lucius’ father Abraxas Malfoy once, at the interview, he hadn’t seemed particularly impressed by her.  Then again, Robena’s own expectations of the interview had been low.  In fact, it was only with the greatest surprise that Robena received the Malfoy-sealed envelope that bore the offer via owl post a week after the interview.  Of course, Robena immediately accepted.  No one said no to the Malfoys.</p><p>The other piece of the puzzle that Robena could not seem to be able to fit was the fact that surely Abraxas Malfoy had ascertained her blood status in addition to any other background checks he might have undertaken prior to hiring her, or anyone, to care for his sole heir.  Perhaps Robena wasn’t giving herself enough credit, but she also couldn’t imagine her resume contained anything formidable enough to make a man like him ignore her Muggle parents, and their parents before them, <em>ad infinatum</em>.  Then again, Robena was merely a governess, another servant within the Malfoy estate, so perhaps her blood status didn’t matter in that context.</p><p><em>Typical Ravenclaw, overthinking it,</em> Robena chided herself as she picked up a brush and started running it through her long auburn hair.  She then performed the requisite wandwork that she had learned her first day at Malfoy Manor to summon Bonnsie.  Moments later, Robena heard the soft knock of the elf and let her in.  Bonnsie greeted her politely, and then set herself to arranging Robena’s hair into a half-up French braid that kept her hair out of her face while leaving most of it loose.  Robena thanked her and Bonnsie curtsied, made sure that Miss didn’t need anything else, and then Disapparating.</p><p>After breakfast, Robena found Lucius in the library, one of the discoveries about Malfoy Manor that made Robena the happiest.  The sumptuous space boasted two tiers of shelves with symmetrical carved spiral staircases and a large, cushioned bay window overlooking the formal gardens.  The wood comprising the banisters, the stairs, and the myriad bookshelves was oak, polished to a high shine, and the entire room was one of the most well-lit in Malfoy Manor, to say nothing of being the warmest, both in color and in temperature.  It had the added benefit of smelling like old parchment, leather, and wood polish.  Put simply, it was wands-down the best room in the house as far as Robena was concerned.</p><p>That morning, Robena was surprised to find Lucius already waiting for her at one of the lamp-lit tables, surrounded by books and piles of parchment.  So far, they had spent much of Lucius’ academic time with Robena trying to ascertain what he already knew with the goal of uncovering any knowledge gaps he might possess for a boy of his age and station.  Lucius seemed bright and quick-witted, able to answer Robena’s questions and help her craft a curriculum for him, although Robena knew that all of it would need Malfoy Senior’s stamp of approval before she could deliver it.</p><p>The worked all the morning and after lunch, Robena excused herself back to her room to write a quick letter to the Selwyn children, as she had promised upon leaving their household two weeks prior.  Her quill scratching rapidly over the parchment, Robena found that indeed she had a lot to say and she quickly lost herself in writing.</p><p>"Are you going to leave too?"  </p><p>Robena looked up with a start.  It was Lucius, standing at the doorway to her small room.  This surprised her, as she would have expected him to send a house elf if he needed something.  After all, it was what the Selwyns had done, running their house elves ragged fetching Robena for even the most trivial things such as a lost hair ribbon or a newly-found pixie.  Perhaps it was different with the Malfoys.  "I beg your pardon?" Robena asked.</p><p>Lucius regarded her for a moment.  He was tall for his age of nearly 11 years, only a few inches shorter than Robena herself.  However, Lucius was lithe, quick, and graceful where other boys might be just starting into a lanky and awkward phase.  Robena surmised that he must have his late mother's appearance, as Lucius had high cheekbones and fine features where his father was chisel-jawed and stern, and had white blond hair where his father's was brighter flax.  Lucius didn't answer her directly, but broke his glance to look around the room.  "This is where the other ones stayed also, you know," he finally said.  </p><p>Robena frowned, wondering if Lucius was always this obtuse or if he was just testing her.  "I'm sure your father put me in the place he found most appropriate," she said carefully.  There was really nothing wrong with her room.  While it wasn't luxurious by anyone’s estimation, it did have the benefit of a south-facing window, its many diamond panes of leaded, highly-polished glass often awash with sunlight and a becoming view of the meadow.  The room had a braided rag rug, a washstand, a bed, an ancient but serviceable wardrobe (ready once Robena had chased out a small Bogart), and the writing desk at which Robena now sat.  </p><p>Lucius smiled slightly.  "No doubt," he answered, and Robena thought she could detect just the thinnest underlay of sarcasm, although she couldn't be sure.  He continued to stand at the doorway, respectful enough not to come in unless she invited him, even though it was his own house.  </p><p>Robena set her quill down now and saw that the ink was dry.  Deftly, she folded the parchment into a neat parcel that did not necessitate a seal.  She had learned the trick from an old Hogwarts boyfriend named Harris Nedermeyer, whose father trained owls for the post office. Lucius watched her, interest lighting his gray eyes.  "How did you do that?" he asked.  </p><p>Robena smiled as she made out the address to Selwyn Close, but turned her head from Lucius so he couldn't see her face.  After all, even though she was starting to warm to Lucius, she must keep her authority intact.  One thing that she already liked about Lucius was that he was inquisitive, almost to a fault.  She couldn't help but wonder if he would be the first Malfoy in wizarding history to be sorted into Robena’s own house when he went to Hogwarts the following year. Perhaps not, but one could always hope.  Robena held the letter up.  "It's called Gerard's Fold."  </p><p>"Can you teach me?"</p><p>Robena tilted her head to the side and looked back at him.  "Perhaps," she answered.  "If you show me to the Owlery, that is."  </p><p>Lucius offered his arm with all seriousness, and Robena had to hide another smile.  She stood and took his arm with equal solemnity.  "And if you ask me politely." </p><p>"Will you please teach me Gerard's Fold, Miss March?" Lucius asked, smiling even as he side-eyed her.  </p><p>That was the other thing that Robena already liked about Lucius: he was undoubtedly charming.  However, Robena could admit that charm in wizards and witches of any age could hide a certain level of manipulation about which she would have to take care.  Lucius might end up in Slytherin after all.  "Yes, I will," she answered.  </p><p>Lucius walked her down to a side door and out into the meadow.  Clouds were gathering, painting the sky above Malfoy Manor a slate gray, but the sun still shone through, lighting the trees of the Malfoy parkland in bright hues of gold and orange.  It was a sky one only got in autumn, beautiful, harsh and dramatic.  The day was just starting to cool and a breeze brought in the smell of downed leaves and loam from the forest beyond the manicured yards and statuary directly surrounding the house. </p><p>Lucius led her around the tall yew hedge that marked the perimeter of the formal garden.  However, rather than leading her through the formal garden itself, he opened a filigreed black wrought-iron gate and led her over the mowed lawn just outside and then into the meadow proper.  He walked slowly through the waving golden grass, trailing his graceful fingers over the fringes of seed heads, discharging a few of them for the wind to carry away.  Although his demeanor was casual, Robena noticed that Lucius' eyes darted constantly, as if taking in every nuance of the scene and filing it away for later.  </p><p>"Why did you ask if I was leaving?" Robena asked after a few minutes.  By now they were at the back side of the house, still outside the formal gardens, but not quite in the forest of the parkland. </p><p>Lucius shrugged.  He balanced on a fallen log, placing one foot in front of the other as he traversed its mossy surface.  "All the others did, obviously." He hopped off, and looked at Robena again.  Although he maintained his casual affect, he looked somewhat troubled.</p><p>Robena stopped walking and folded her arms.  "Were you such an ogre as to drive them off?" </p><p>Again the thin smile graced Lucius' face.  "Why no, Miss March; I'm as good as a Galleon."  </p><p>Robena wasn't sure if he was joking or not.  "Well..." she said slowly, "I'm sure they had other engagements."</p><p>Lucius turned from her and started walking once again.  "That's what my father told me."  </p><p>"Well then, there you are."  Robena said it with confidence, but something about the entire conversation was surreal, as if Lucius was somehow assessing her; it was obvious also that he wasn't telling her everything.  Still, he was a child and if there was some other reason that his other governesses had left, either he didn't know fully what it was, or else he didn't trust her yet.  Perhaps patience would prove the best method.</p><p>They rounded the corner of the hedge.  "You still haven't answered my question," Lucius said. </p><p>"Because I don't know the answer," Robena said crisply.  "These next few weeks are to be a probationary period for everyone involved."  She knew full well he didn't deserve an explanation, but something about Lucius made her want to render one anyway.  He seemed to crave knowledge the way other children craved sweets and, being a Ravenclaw as well as his governess, Robena couldn't seem to help but indulge him.</p><p>"Meaning?"</p><p>"I have to decide if I like being your governess.”</p><p>"Oh, I think you will," Lucius said with a smirk.</p><p>"Because you're as good as a Galleon?" Robena replied dryly.</p><p>"Of course, Miss March," Lucius said, now with wide-eyed innocence, "But please continue."</p><p>"Additionally, you and your father will have to decide if I am a suitable governess for you."  </p><p>Lucius shrugged again.  "Very well."</p><p>"Was this process any different with your other governesses?" </p><p>Now Lucius sighed.  "I suppose not.”  Before Robena could say anything else, Lucius gestured ahead of them with one hand.  "The Owlery, Miss March." </p><p>The Owlery was a free-standing stone building.  It had an iron-bolted wooden door set into a stone arch with a keystone above bearing the Malfoy <em>M</em>.   Robena studied the Owlery from the bottom to the top.  Although it wasn't unheard of to have a free-standing owlery, it was unusual, if for no other reason than convenience.  Then again, this was assuming that one did not have an army of house elves to make the trek through rain, snow, or sweltering heat to post a letter.  Robena knew from the Selwyns that house elves only Apparated to respond directly to one of their masters; such had always been the custom.  Aside from that, they walked or ran. </p><p>Robena looked beyond the Owlery to see the granary.  The relative placement made sense to her, but she wondered if Lucius understood it.  "Tell me," she said, "why did your ancestors decide to put the Owlery here, as opposed to within Malfoy Manor proper?"</p><p>A flicker of doubt crossed Lucius face before he looked affronted.  "How should I know?  That's the servants' business, not mine."  </p><p>Robena suppressed a smile.  Lucius was quick, but not as quick as he thought he was.  He didn't know and now he was attempting to hide it with contempt.  "Perhaps you shouldn’t," Robena said nonchalantly.  She opened the door to the Owlery and started up the stairs, not paying the owl droppings on the stone steps any mind.  Lucius followed her.  "But it's a shame, really," Robena continued, not breaking her stride.</p><p>"What's a shame?" Lucius tried to sound bored in spite of breathing faster in his attempt to keep up with Robena as she marched purposefully up the stairs in their spiral.</p><p>"You stand to inherit Malfoy Manor, am I correct?"</p><p>"Of course you're correct.”  </p><p>"Then how is it that I, your lowly governess of one week, already know more about your ancestral estate than you do?"  Robena stopped at a window.  </p><p>Lucius stopped next to her, scowling, even though he didn’t deny it this time.</p><p>"Look, Lucius."  Robena gestured out the window to the granary and beyond that the other outbuildings that comprised the farm.  "What do you see?"  </p><p>Lucius' gray eyes swept the buildings.  "The granary," he said, catching his breath.  "So what?" </p><p>Without answering, Robena turned from him and continued upwards.  Above them, she could hear the sounds of the owls themselves, the occasional hooting call and the movement of wings.  She got to the top of the stairs and clambered through the opening onto the floor of the Owlery.  As soon as she stepped out, her feet shattered countless tiny animal skeletons.  She looked down at the noise.  "And now what do you see?" she asked.  Lucius' own shoes crunched over the grisly remainders of centuries of owl suppers as the musty smell of excrement and decay assaulted her nostrils.  </p><p>"Dead animals," Lucius answered.  "What of it?"</p><p>"Indeed.  Be more specific, if you please."</p><p>Lucius looked down again, lifting up one foot and observing the white bone fragments now coating the layer of owl refuse on the bottom of his shoe, disgust warring with curiosity on his face.  He also wasn't as good at hiding his emotions as he thought he was.  "Some birds, some bats...mostly mice and rats."  He looked up at Robena, waiting.</p><p>As Lucius mulled it over, Robena had stepped around him and held her letter out at arm's reach, waiting for an owl.  One specimen had landed: a little owl.  Lucius did a double take.  "Not that one, Miss March," he said, a warning in his voice.  "He's a biter."  The little owl looked at Lucius balefully; clearly, their enmity was long-standing.  Robena took a bag of owl treats out of the pocket of her skirt.  Carrying owl treats was simply a throwback from spending time with Harris, one that she hadn’t yet broken, especially knowing she was going to the Owlery.  <em>Remember, Ro, you must be patient and kind, but not allow yourself to be intimidated by these creatures,</em> Harris had always said.   </p><p>Robena took one owl treat from the bag and held it in the hand that did not possess the letter. The owl's bright, round eyes followed the treat greedily.  Robena set the treat on the wooden railing in front of her.  The owl dove for it, tipped its head back, and swallowed it whole, before hopping up to Robena and sticking its foot out for her to attach the letter.  Without further ado, it then flapped out of a window near the top of the tower.</p><p>Lucius watched it go, his mouth set in a disapproving line.  "It didn't deserve that, Miss March," he scolded her.  "Now it's going to expect an owl treat every single time you want to post a letter."</p><p>Now it was Robena's turn to shrug as she watched the owl get smaller in the distance.  "I can't imagine how it could possibly matter," she said.  </p><p>Lucius tilted his head to the side.  "Do you not?  You'll spoil it.  It won't be good for anything."</p><p>Robena felt the corner of her mouth turn up as she watched Lucius' incredulous face.  "Is it good for anything now?  Does it carry your letters?  It looks to me as if you share a mutual animosity, an arrangement hardly effective for either of you, or so I would think." </p><p>That shut him up.  Lucius looked back out the window, mollified.</p><p>"Some problems can be solved with grace or compromise more readily than with force or intimidation."  Robena now allowed herself the wry smile that had threatened before.  "That said, have you solved the mystery of the Owlery itself?"</p><p>Lucius' brow darkened before he finally sighed.  "No," he admitted.  "I don't suppose you would give me a hint."</p><p>Robena waited.</p><p>"If you please, Miss March."</p><p>"As you wish.  Follow me."  They made their way back down the spiral stone staircase.  The light had diminished with the coming twilight and the wind had picked up even more, making stirring sounds as it blew through the hedges.  Robena now walked directly between the Owlery and the granary.  "That's far enough," she said, holding up a hand.  Lucius stopped and looked at her.  Robena drew her wand and pointed it at the ground.  "<em>Tractus Revelio</em>.”</p><p>Within seconds, footprints materialized, ghostly in shimmering shades of blue.  There were a few house elf footprints, but most were animal tracks.  Tractus Revelio was a charm that Robena was moderately good at but truthfully Francois Selwyn, the eldest son and heir of that family, was the true expert.  He could cast the charm and then, when he closed his eyes and placed his hand over the tracks, he could see what had transpired if it was fairly recent.  Such casting skill had made Francois handy for the Aurors on more than one occasion.  Although Robena's casting was not that powerful in this instance, she could still bring up tracks up to a year old, even if she could not see them in their exact context. </p><p>Lucius crouched to investigate, his white blond hair falling over his forehead, studying the prints of foxes, cats, and, as Robena had expected, hundreds of tracks from small rodents.  "Follow some of the mouse tracks and you shall see," Robena told him.  </p><p>Lucius obeyed.  "Some of them stop suddenly...surrounded by a sort of a two-sided fringe…" he said.  He stood and looked at Robena.  "Taken from above...by a winged predator..." He turned towards the granary.  "On their way from stealing the grain."  </p><p>Robena nodded, pleased.  "Yes."</p><p>Lucius turned back to her and smiled, proud of himself for having figured it out.  "Building the owlery close to the granary solves two problems: the mice as grain-stealing pests and the owls' need to find ready prey."  </p><p>"So, what did you learn?"</p><p>Lucius now frowned.  "That wasn't the lesson?"</p><p>Robena inclined her head.  "Your reasoning was sound, Lucius," she answered, "But there is a larger lesson here than owls and mice.  Such a configuration smacks of cunning and pragmatism and can tell you much about the designer.  I wouldn’t necessarily expect you to know any of that, at least not yet.”  She smiled. “Not being able to provide an answer from time to time is acceptable; no one possesses all earthly knowledge. Of course, if you don't know an answer, I shall expect academic rigor from you to rectify this, as I cannot abide intellectual laziness."  She softened.  "I can tell already that you are clever and inquisitive.  I strive to hone these aspects in you, of course, but they shall amount to naught if you lack the discipline to follow those inquisitions to the end.  Do you understand?"</p><p>Lucius nodded gravely.  "Yes, Miss March."  </p><p>"And I'll be wanting six feet of parchment on the five owls native to Britain in my hand two days hence."</p><p>Lucius' eyes widened in dismay.  "Six feet? As much as that?"</p><p>Robena knew he would balk at that; any child would.  Still, she opted to deliberately misinterpret him.  "Yes.  I'm pleased to see you embracing this opportunity to learn so much about owls, given their importance not only to your family, but to the wizarding world at large.  In fact, I daresay you shall be better-versed on the subject than any other wizard your age, assuming you bend your considerable will to the task.  How clever of you to recognize that and react accordingly."  She sighed and let her eyes drift in the direction of the house.  "Now I feel stingy for only assigning six feet..."</p><p>Lucius put both hands up.  "No, no," he said.  "I shan't disappoint you, Miss March."  </p><p>"Excellent.  I'm so glad that we are of one mind in this."</p><p>Just then, a house elf came around the corner.  As it got closer, Robena recognized it as Dobby.  Even in the darkening twilight, Robena could see Lucius' jaw tighten and his eyes narrow.  "What, Dobby?" he asked, his voice cold.  "What could you possibly want?"</p><p>Robena lifted an eyebrow, curious as to their relationship; there was enmity there as well, but she expected it was something more complex than Lucius' relationship with the little owl.</p><p>Dobby bowed low in response, before standing to deliver his message.  "Dobby didn't mean to interrupt Master Lucius, sir.  Dobby only wanted to tell him that Master Abraxas had returned and is expecting him in his study.  Master Lucius and Miss March."</p><p>"Fine.  Tell him we'll be there directly.  You're dismissed."  Dobby bowed again, snapped his fingers, and Disapparated with a pop of displaced air.  </p><p>Lucius sighed in irritation and glared at the empty spot where Dobby had been mere moments before.  After a heartbeat, he looked at Robena.  He smiled, but it didn't quite reach his eyes.  "Father calls.  We'd best hurry; he'll not want to be kept waiting."</p><p>TWO: EXPECTATIONS</p><p>Although serving the esteemed Selwyn family had presented its own challenges, many of which Robena had navigated with a measure of success, she still felt thoroughly intimidated by Abraxas Malfoy.  Lucius was the one to knock on the door of Abraxas’ study.  After a moment, they both heard the requisite command of <em>enter.</em>  Lucius then went in first with Robena following behind.  She kept her shoulders pulled back and her face relaxed, even though she couldn't help but feel nervous.  After all, this was the first time she had interacted with Malfoy Senior on his own grounds.  Her interview with him had been in an upstairs meeting room in the Leaky Cauldron, a place one might consider no-man’s-land, and even then it had been harrowing.  Abraxas’ cutthroat reputation had preceded him and his uncompromising demeanor during her interview had done little to reassure Robena that the things people said about him were mere exaggerations.  </p><p>Robena shook her head impatiently at the memory.  This man wasn't her enemy; he was merely her employer, nothing more.  She resolved her mind to calm and let her face reflect this, attempting to look serious without looking surly.  She and Lucius made their way over to the desk where Abraxas sat, quill scratching over parchment.   He neither stopped, nor even looked up at her and Lucius.  </p><p>Although his hands were big, they moved with deftness and precision as he finished and rolled up the document.  Robena also noticed that Abraxas still wore his wedding ring.  For his part, Lucius stood in front of the desk, his hands clasped behind him and his head inclined slightly down, waiting respectfully.  Robena stood next to him, hands at her sides, also waiting.  As she did, she watched as Abraxas melted red sealing wax in a candle flame, before letting it drip, blood-like, onto the rolled parchment.  He pressed in the Malfoy seal and set the parchment aside.  Only then did he look up at them, his eyes meeting and fixing Robena first.  </p><p>One winter at Hogwarts, she and Harris had snuck out to the Black Lake.  Harris had transfigured their shoes into ice skates, and then they glided breathlessly onto the lake’s frozen surface.  It was early spring, and neither of them had possessed the presence of mind to check the thickness of the ice before going out.  Robena had skated out far, trying to impress Harris, but all at once, the crust under her feet shattered with a resounding crack and she fell through and into the frigid water.  For just a moment, she looked up and saw the sun shining through the ice above her, a stunning, deadly shade of blue, identical in hue to the color of the eyes that met Robena's eyes now.  Robena remembered thinking, even moments from drowning, that it might be the last thing she ever saw.  </p><p>Abraxas’ hair was golden blond, slicked back on top and cropped close on the sides, not one hair out of place and without the merest trace of gray yet.  He had a square jaw, and his mouth turned down naturally at the corners.  He also had two permanent creases between his eyebrows.  Although he was undoubtedly handsome, his entire affect was one of severity.  As he stood, his imposing physicality only magnified.  Abraxas was over six feet tall, with broad shoulders, powerful beneath his bespoke black robes.  However, like Lucius, he moved with leonine grace as he came around the desk.  </p><p>He stood in front of the desk and folded his arms, looking now at his son.  "Lucius."  When Abraxas spoke, his voice was quiet, but carried authority nonetheless.  </p><p>Lucius looked up at him.  "Father."</p><p>"What have you been doing with the newest addition to our household?"</p><p>Robena watched the two of them.  She had expected austerity from the elder Malfoy, but his question sounded almost accusatory and lacked any trace of warmth.  Also, Lucius' father hadn't seen him in a week and vice versa, and yet there was no inquiring about each other's well-being.</p><p>"She wanted to post a letter, sir, so I was showing her the Owlery."  </p><p>"And?"</p><p>Lucius took a deep breath.  "She taught me that it was built near the granary, likely so the owls could feed off of the mice going in and out."  Robena heard tentative hope in Lucius' voice as he responded to his father's interrogation.  "She seemed to think that our ancestors were quite clever, father."  Now Lucius let that slim smile warm his pale face.  </p><p>Abraxas grunted in response, seemingly satisfied with this answer.  He turned his gaze to Robena once more.  "In the future, Miss March, you have but to hand your letters to one of my many house elves, and any of them shall post them to the Owlery for you."</p><p>"Oh, it was no trouble, Mr. Malfoy," Robena answered.  "I'm certain your house elves have better things to occupy their time than carrying my post."</p><p>"I insist, Miss March."  Abraxas’ voice had both chilled and quieted further.  "After all, you have charge of my sole heir's well-being and education; I wouldn't want anything to divert your attention from these most important of tasks."  Unexpectedly, a shiver of fear crept up the back of Robena's neck.  It wasn't as if Abraxas was explicitly threatening her, and yet she heard the warning in his refined voice, pulling like an undertow to the ocean of his command with its mist of mild derision.  At the very least, he was testing her willingness to obey him.</p><p>Robena maintained his gaze as the moment stretched.  Finally, Robena relented.  Even though it was a strange and perhaps arbitrary rule, it wasn't worth a row, not this time.  "You’re too kind, Mr. Malfoy," she said, letting her own mild sarcasm in to match his, but keeping her tone light.  </p><p>"Think nothing of it."  Abraxas then looked back at his son.  "You're excused, Lucius.  I would speak with Miss March alone and you are overdue for your dinner.  I shall meet with you after."</p><p>"Yes, father."  Lucius nodded to Robena and walked out, shutting the door behind him.  As he did, Abraxas walked back behind his desk and stood by one of the windows, looking out at the deepening twilight. "Your accommodations are satisfactory, I trust?" It was clear that Abraxas held no interest whatsoever in the answer, but was only asking the question out of basest politeness.  He ran a fingertip over the slate-colored lead binding the diamonds of glass to one another before pulling it back to inspect it for dust.</p><p>"Very much so, sir.  Thank you."  </p><p>Apparently finding no fault, Abraxas put his hands behind his back, although he still didn't turn to face Robena.  "Then I'll get straight to the point.  You are the fifth of Lucius' governesses."</p><p>"Is he so difficult to govern?" The question was out of her mouth before Robena could stop it.  As soon as it was spoken, Robena clamped her lips shut, feeling warmth rush to her cheeks.  She suspected that Abraxas would not respond well to cheek and preemptively winced.  </p><p>However, rather than sanction her, Abraxas turned just his head and smiled coldly.  "Perhaps he is.  Or perhaps his prior governesses could not withstand the demands inherent in serving the Malfoy family."  He turned completely and faced her.  "You see, Miss March, I expect the best from my son because he has the best of everything, from the bed he sleeps in, to the broom he rides, to the governess who instructs and guides him."  </p><p>"And I'm the best?" Robena tried hard to keep the irony out of her voice this time.  </p><p>"That remains to be seen, does it not?  Granted, I like to think my taste in all things is superlative, but you've only been here one week, and as I say, you are fifth in a succession of other governesses that ultimately disappointed me."</p><p>Robena kept her face blank, but something didn't add up.  Lucius had specifically asked if she was going to leave.  He had said that his father had told him that the previous governesses left because they had other engagements, not that Abraxas had found them unsatisfactory and thus sacked them, an implication Abraxas was strongly hinting at now.  Failing to meet an unreasonable standard and being let go was one thing; quitting employment for the Malfoys voluntarily was something else altogether.  Robena badly wanted a straight answer, but knew first that it was not her place to demand one, second, that her timing would be poor, and third, that Abraxas could easily lie to her.  She decided to play his game this time.  She lowered her eyes.  "What must I do to meet your justifiably high standards, sir?" </p><p>"Look up, Miss March."  </p><p>Robena's head snapped up.  </p><p>"Don't attempt to flatter me.  That's my first requirement."</p><p>Robena's mouth dropped open.  She couldn't help herself.  She felt the blood rising in her ears.  <em>Perhaps you shouldn't flatter yourself, you pompous megalomaniac.</em>  Luckily, Robena stopped the insolent words behind her teeth.  She took a deep breath, disciplining her emotions all while wondering at the ease with which Abraxas could provoke her.  "I meant no offense, sir," she said.  "I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute whatever I may to Lucius' education and well-being, I do consider it an honor and as such, I take it seriously.  Please understand that I have taken all of my charges seriously, from those who live in hovels to those who live in mansions.  No child under my care deserves less and I have never, ever been dismissed." </p><p>Abraxas raised an eyebrow but said nothing.</p><p>Robena let her fingers uncurl, unaware even that she had clenched them into fists.  Perhaps Abraxas was merely goading her to see if she could be cowed.  Resolved, Robena continued.  "With all due respect, Mr. Malfoy, you hired me and here I am.  Now, if you please, tell me how I may best be of service."  </p><p>Abraxas smirked.  "Have a seat, Miss March."  Robena sat in one of the armchairs facing the desk, keeping her posture in check.  Abraxas sat as well and folded his hands on the mirror- shined mahogany of his desk.  Robena couldn't help but notice that she was seated lower than him and doubted very much that it was an accident.  She had worked for powerful men before but she had never been in the presence of a wizard so keen to establish his dominance.  Robena found this constant need to remind everyone around him of his superiority unnerving at best and downright repulsive at worst.</p><p>Abraxas’ look to her at this point was appraising.  "How old are you, Miss March?"</p><p><em>None of your Merlin-blessed business,</em> Robena thought.  "Twenty-two, sir."</p><p> "And unmarried, obviously, and without children of your own."  It wasn't a question, so Robena said nothing.  Abraxas continued.  "I mention it only because the chief failing of governesses in general is that, due to your lack of life experience, you don't fully understand what siring and raising a child truly encompasses.  Now, you said that you have treated each of your charges the same, whether rich or poor or, I assume, pureblooded or Muggle-born."</p><p><em>And there it is</em>, Robena thought, <em>now we get down to the heart of it.</em>  </p><p>Abraxas extended a hand towards her.  "Your statement implies that all children are the same when in fact, nothing could be further from the truth.  I wouldn't expect you to understand, coming from a family of Muggles yourself, but make no mistake, Miss March, the requirements of a pureblooded child such as Lucius are quite different from any others."  </p><p>"Forgive me, sir, but my last engagement was with the Selwyns and lasted two and a half years.  This is hardly my first experience with pureblooded families.  Also, you'll find I am well-versed in pureblood etiquette and traditions.  My own upbringing should not come to bear in this respect."  </p><p>Abraxas smiled patronizingly.  "I can appreciate that you feel that way, Miss March, but there are certain aspects you shall never understand, regardless of what you may have read or experienced."  </p><p>Robena took another deep breath slowly through her nose.  He was clearly trying to bully her into admitting that she was less than the Malfoys or the Selwyns due to her birth and she wasn't going to do it.  She would rather burn in Hades.  Robena also began sincerely to wonder as to the purpose of this little meeting and wished that Abraxas would just come out and say what he meant.  <em>To the devil with it,</em> Robena thought with resignation.  "What's your point, sir?"</p><p>Abraxas steepled his hands in front of his chin.  "While you have my leave to teach Lucius natural history, writing, wizarding lore, mathematics, pianoforte, and any other subject or skill of which you have expertise, you are never to teach him that mixing with Muggles or Muggleborns is acceptable in any way."    </p><p>Robena felt tired suddenly.  Ulrich Selwyn, the patriarch of her previous Sacred 28 family, had given her a similar speech, although he at least had tried to be civil about it, delivering his version of it with hesitancy, his weak chin quivering.  As to Ulrich’s timing, Robena made a guess that he only did it because his gimlet-eyed wife Adelaide had compelled him to do so after she started suspecting, correctly, that there was something going on between their eldest son, Francois, and Robena.  </p><p>Robena supposed she had it coming in even agreeing to work with pureblood families at all.  Also, she could admit that she and Francois (who was older than her by 18 months and most assuredly <em>not</em> one of her charges) were not as discreet as perhaps they should have been.  Still, where this long-standing prejudice used to rankle her, particularly during her time at Hogwarts, now it just drained her.  She took one last deep breath and resolved right then and there not ever to let Abraxas Malfoy or any other pureblood see that they were getting to her.  "As you wish, sir," Robena said, clearing her tone of any defiance, defeat, anxiety, or other feeling upon which Abraxas could feed.   </p><p>"Excellent," he said softly.  </p><p>Robena cursed herself for being so transparent.  Ascertaining if he could get under her skin was exactly what Abraxas was doing and Robena had walked right into his trap with her indignation and her fiery retorts.  Robena suspected the main reason that Abraxas had found such success was because Robena was still smarting from her experience with the Selwyns.  In any case, Abraxas had won this round, of that Robena was certain.  There was nothing for it but to try and retreat gracefully and live to duel another day.  Robena stood.  "Will there be anything else, Mr. Malfoy?" </p><p>Abraxas’ eyes swept over her and Robena felt a chill.  "Nothing whatsoever, Miss March.  You're dismissed."</p><p>Robena nodded, performed an about-face and walked out Abraxas’ office, feeling his eyes on her every step of the way.  As she closed the door behind her quietly, she felt her shoulders relax, grateful to be out of his presence.  <em>Well,</em> she thought, as she started back towards her room, <em>he may be an egotistical, controlling bigot, but at least he's not home very often.</em>  She would simply have to watch her step around Abraxas Malfoy; that was all there was to it.  As Robena walked down the hall, she wondered for the first time if taking this assignment had been a mistake.  </p><p>THREE: AS GOOD AS A GALLEON</p><p>After being dismissed, Lucius closed the door to his father's study and leaned against it, brow furrowed.  He wondered what his father and Miss March were talking about cloistered therein.  Lucius had told Robena the truth; he didn't have any clear idea why his governesses had left, only half-brewed speculations, and his father, in typical Abraxas Malfoy fashion, had not chosen to include Lucius in the details.  Lucius stood up and continued down the hall towards the small dining room, his stomach growling.  </p><p>As his feet moved over the marble floor enchanted to ripple with each of his footsteps, Lucius reminisced. The first governess that he could remember had been Georgina Bailey.  She had been full of light and life, with long curly golden hair and freckles.  She laughed a lot and always had games and songs for him.  Georgina had remained his governess for many years and Lucius had unrestrainedly adored her and so was justifiably despondent when she left.  After all, she had not even said goodbye to him; one morning he had awoken to find her gone without a trace.</p><p>Of course Lucius confronted his father.  When Abraxas told him it was no concern of his, Lucius protested this injustice vehemently.  That was a mistake.  His father's backhanded blow knocked Lucius to the floor and made his left ear ring and go temporarily deaf, ending any inquiry Lucius could make in the matter.  Lucius should have seen it coming, he supposed later; his father abhorred disobedience above all things.  That is, all things but Muggles and Mudbloods, the latter of which Georgina had been, and all governesses thereafter, up to and including Miss March.  </p><p>Lucius took a Boomerang Ball out of his pocket and started bouncing it, farther and farther away, watching it come back to him and then catching it.  It was a toy purpose-built for only children, particularly ones who lived in giant marble halls with a multitude of hard surfaces.  As Lucius started tossing it at the marble columns, he wondered as to the mystery of his governesses' blood status.  As with all pureblooded aristocratic children, Lucius had been taught that he was made of finer stuff than any Mudblood, so he wondered why his father hired them over and over.  Once he could understand as a mistake or an exception, but Miss March was the fifth Muggle-born witch to hold what his father surely believed was a fairly important position.  It was a pattern that defied all reason.  </p><p>Moreover, the blood status of his governesses put Lucius in a quandary because even though he knew that they were lesser, he respected them and had even loved them, particularly Georgina.  He couldn't bring himself to generate the contempt for them that his father seemed to think was appropriate. Lucius threw the the Boomerang Ball hard enough that it ricocheted off the ceiling and the floor before it returned to his hand.  It seemed also that his feelings about Miss March were not going to be any different than those towards his other governesses.  Even though she had only been his governess one week, Lucius tentatively liked her.  After his experience with Georgina, Lucius guarded his feelings carefully as he did not relish the thought of having his heart broken again.  </p><p>Lucius caught the ball off of a suit of armor that had turned its head at him in indignation for having the impudence to bounce a ball off of its helm.  Lucius realized why he liked his new governess already.  Robena was the first of his governesses to treat Lucius as an adult.  That was something of a novelty.  His previous governesses had treated him as a child, whether that meant doting on him or talking down to him.  His father certainly didn't treat him like an adult, unless it was an adult who was an underling.  </p><p>Distracted, Lucius threw the ball and it hit a vase made of fine, almost translucent white china.  The vase fell off of its plinth and onto the stone below, shattering into a hundred pieces and making a terrific, echoing crash.  Lucius winced, and then collected himself, waiting.  Within seconds, Dobby manifested.  Dobby looked at the vase and then at Lucius, his huge eyes reproachful.  "Do you have something to say?" Lucius asked.  </p><p>Dobby continued to look at him, until it seemed they were in a contest of wills.  Lucius wasn't concerned.  He already knew who would win.  Dobby finally looked down.  "No, Master Lucius.  Dobby was just thinking."</p><p>"You're not here to think, Dobby," Lucius said.  "You're here to repair the broken vase."<br/>
Dobby looked as if he was about to say something.  Lucius rolled his eyes.  "Oh, sweet Merlin, <em>what?</em>  What, Dobby?"</p><p>"It is difficult, Master Lucius."</p><p>"Just say it, Dobby.  That's an order."</p><p>Dobby bit his lip and looked pained, but Lucius knew he'd ultimately have to obey the sacred phrase.  "Perhaps Master Lucius should just tell Master Abraxas what happened, just this once."</p><p>Lucius folded his arms.  "Or perhaps I should just forbid you from mending the vase, tell Master Abraxas that you broke it, and have you to take the punishment."</p><p>Dobby's eyes widened in alarm.  "Please no, Master Lucius, Dobby is begging."</p><p>Lucius paused, vindictive glee over Dobby's discomfort and fear warming his core.  "I'll overlook your insolence this time, Dobby, but you must repair the vase and I forbid you from speaking about this to anyone."</p><p>"Yes, Master Lucius."  Dobby turned to the vase and snapped his fingers.  The pieces immediately flew back together seamlessly, and the vase flew back up to its plinth.  Dobby looked back at Lucius. "Shall there be anything else, sir?"</p><p>"No, Dobby.  You're dismissed."  Dobby bowed, snapped his fingers once more, and Disapparated.</p><p>Lucius smirked and took up the ball from where it had rolled, a few yards from the vase.  He was tempted to knock the vase off again and make good on his threat to Dobby, but decided finally to give the house elf a pass.  After all, he was hungry.  Lucius carefully stepped around the vase, looking at it out of the corner of his eye.  <em>As good as a Galleon,</em> he thought.  He then turned his attention to the hall in front of him and tossed the ball once again.  </p><p>After he ate, Lucius went back to his father's study, but it was dark and empty, so Lucius went to the other place he suspected his father might be: the small drawing room in the eastern wing on the second floor.  He made his way to the grand staircase in the atrium at the center of the house.  A chandelier hung from overhead, its thousands of cut glass pieces dark for the time being.  The only light came from sconces lining the walls.  They guttered in the unceasing drafts, throwing shadows onto the wall cast from the statuary lining the staircase.  They were dragons, all, but each was different, some wyverns, some wyrms, curling back onto themselves to make tall, ornate pillars.</p><p>When Lucius was younger, maybe five years old, he found the dragons terrifying, to the point of not ever wanting to walk up the staircase, particularly at night when the sconces were lit.  He would take the servants' staircase as much as possible, which happened frequently, as he was typically in the company of Georgina or another governess.  All of his governesses would take him that way, mostly out of convenience, as it was the quickest route from the exterior of the manor to the nursery.  </p><p>Of course, it was only a matter of time before Lucius' father caught wind of his avoiding the grand staircase, and why.  Abraxas prided himself on his powers of observation and insight, a characteristic most valuable to the man who ostensibly ruled the wizarding world.  One night, Abraxas had sent Lucius to bed, but had followed behind.  He must have seen Lucius hesitate at the bottom of the staircase, eyes wide, body poised like a mouse sensing the overhead presence of an owl swooping for the killing stroke.</p><p>At the time, Lucius knew that his father was behind him and, even then, understood that his father would not approve of his snubbing the grand staircase for that of the servants.  A war started then in Lucius' mind.  He knew that he should just climb past the dragons, lest he risk his father's sometimes-violent displeasure.  And yet, there were just so many of them, on the pillars, on the walls: enormous, daunting, predatory, and obviously alive.  </p><p>Lucius had frozen, immobilized.  He wavered for so long that eventually his father caught up with him.  Abraxas stood over him, his arms folded, his mouth turned down, and his brows lowered.  "What are you doing?" he asked.</p><p>Lucius didn't answer; he could no more speak than move.  The moment expanded like a soap bubble.  </p><p>Abraxas sighed, a rapid intake and exhalation of air through his nose.  "I dislike repeating myself.  I said, what are you doing?"</p><p>Lucius' eyes fell to his father's expensive black shoes, polished to a glossy shine by one of the house elves.  Mouth dry, all Lucius could manage was one barely audible word: "Dragons."</p><p>Another sigh.  "I cannot hear you when you mutter."</p><p>Lucius looked up at his father.  "I'm frightened of the dragons."  He braced himself for either a verbal or a physical rebuke.  Weakness in any form was another thing his father detested.  </p><p>To his surprise, his father actually smiled.  It was not a cruel smile, nor a patronizing smile, nor a flattering smile, but a genuine one, his blue eyes crinkling.  To Lucius' further amazement, his father took a knee, coming down to Lucius' level.  "Surely you misunderstand," he said.  "Do you know what those dragons are?"</p><p>Lucius shook his head quickly.  He didn't want to do anything to ruin his father's demeanor to him in this moment.</p><p>"Why, those are the guardians of the Malfoy family, <em>our</em> family.  They watch over us and protect us from any who might do us harm."</p><p>Lucius looked from his father to the dragons.  </p><p>Abraxas continued.  "While they may seem ferocious, their ferocity is only in the service of our family."</p><p>In spite of himself, Lucius felt the corners of his own mouth turn up.  "So they're...friends?"</p><p>"In a sense, yes, but more to the point, they are loyal servants.  Ergo, to whom do those dragons belong?"</p><p>Lucius turned back to his father.  "Me?"</p><p>Abraxas nodded.  "Indeed.  And me, of course."</p><p>Lucius now looked at the dragons in wonder.  They were his dragons, his father's dragons.  They wouldn't hurt him.  </p><p>Abraxas stood once more.  "Now, are you still frightened to climb the staircase?"</p><p>Lucius shook his head again.  "No, sir."  </p><p>"Good.  Now, up to bed."  Never one to be demonstrative, Abraxas hadn't embraced Lucius or even patted his head, but Lucius didn't need him to in that moment.  Abraxas' brief act of kindness was enough for Lucius to believe himself loved, at least then.  </p><p>Back in the present, Lucius climbed the stairs without a second thought to the dragons on his way to the eastern wing.  Looking down the hall, he saw light spilling from one of the rooms.  Unlike the wan, flickering orange light from the sconces in the halls, this was the warm, golden light of many candles and most likely a fire as well.  Lucius stopped at the threshold and looked in.  His father wasn't there, which likely meant that he was at dinner himself, or had finished and was thus on his way to the small sitting room now.  </p><p>Assured that he was alone at least for the time being, Lucius flopped on the crimson brocade couch.  Once his father manifested, Lucius would be expected to sit properly, but for now, he could relax.  As Lucius had guessed, a fire roared in the grate and several salamanders rushed over the lower logs that had become bejeweled with ruby coals.  The skins of the salamanders changed from black to red to orange as they moved, sometimes flashing too quickly for Lucius to keep up.  Lucius had always enjoyed watching them.  They weren’t pets, at least any more than the owls were, but they were part of his home, and a comforting and magical part at that.</p><p>Completely at his ease now, Lucius felt his eyelids growing heavy.  He yawned hugely, desiring little more than to seek the comfort of his bed.  Still, he knew this was not to be until his father finished with him, whatever that might entail.  Of one thing Lucius was certain: his father would expect him to be sharp.  With some regret, Lucius adjusted his posture on the sofa and closed his eyes, listening.  </p><p>He heard the cracking of the fire as air bubbles in the wood expanded and burst, letting sparks fly up.  He heard the subtle rustling of the salamanders.  Above all, he heard the faint footfalls of his father approaching.  Lucius allowed himself a small smile and held his breath, concentrating.  Sounds traveled far in Malfoy Manor, there was little to soften or deaden the myriad echoes generated by the unnumbered tons of ancient stone.  Despite this, through careful observation, listening, and practice, Lucius knew where his father was.  </p><p>Thus, Lucius timed it perfectly, standing and turning just as his father crossed the threshold.  He inclined his head respectfully.  “Father.”  </p><p>To Lucius’ satisfaction, a tiny flash of respect crossed Abraxas’ features before he adopted his usual unyielding demeanor.  “Sit,” he replied.</p><p>Lucius responded with alacrity, his posture flawless.  He kept silent, as was expected of him: he would not speak until given leave.  For Abraxas’ part, he crossed behind the couch and to the sideboard.  There, he removed the stopper from a cut-glass decanter and poured two fingers of Firescotch into a matching crystal tumbler.  It was not the finest they had, but still superb; as Abraxas himself had said, <em>I refuse to drink anything younger than you, Lucius.</em>  Put simply, it was merely one of Abraxas’ many reminders, even if just to himself, of how high his standards were.</p><p>Abraxas replaced the stopper in the decanter with a clink, approached the couch and sat on the side opposite Lucius.  He fixed Lucius with a penetrating stare, and Lucius resisted the urge to squirm.  After all, he had done nothing wrong, and thus, he knew from experience simply to practice patience.  Thus, he kept his gaze neutral and waited.  Without breaking eye contact, Abraxas took a drink.  “What say you of the new governess, Lucius?” he finally asked.</p><p>At this, Lucius could not keep the surprise off of his face as he now felt both eyebrows go up before lowering again.  This was the first time his father had ever posed such a question to him.  He would have to answer very carefully.</p><p>“Well?”  </p><p>“It may be too soon to tell, father.  She seems…smart,” Lucius knew that this reply was weak potion, but he was not sure which way to jump and so opted to test the waters first.  </p><p>Abraxas made no reply of his own, but simply took another sip of his beverage.</p><p>Lucius continued, still with caution.  “I mean…she doesn’t just give me answers to questions, she makes me figure things out.  She called it…academic…ri…rig…something.”</p><p>“Rigor?”    </p><p>“Yes, father, that was it.  Also, she can beat me up the Owlery stairs,” Lucius reluctantly added.  </p><p>A small smile crept onto Abraxas’ face.  “Hmm,” he said.  “Perhaps I should add physical training in along with your magical and didactic education.”  He turned serious once more.  “But I was not asking about Miss March in terms of your opinion about her.  The results of her employ as manifested in your general outcome are far more important than whether or not you like her.”</p><p>Lucius felt his heart sink.  <em>Of course father doesn’t care what I think, not really.</em> He stared back at the fire, noting with a small frisson of disappointment that the salamanders were no longer there.  </p><p>His father continued, “No, what I meant was, what did you observe about her?”</p><p>“She’s Muggle-born, is she not?”  Lucius asked dully, anticipating that it was where his father was going with his line of questioning.  </p><p>“She is.”  </p><p>“Why?” Lucius burst out before he could stop himself.  </p><p>Rather than becoming angry with Lucius’ questioning of one of Abraxas’ decisions regarding his upbringing, he raised an eyebrow.  “Why not?” he countered.  Lucius said nothing; the question was clearly rhetorical.  “She’s a servant,” Abraxas continued coldly.  “As with any other servant, such as a house elf, only time will tell if she will perform satisfactorily in her commissioned capacity.  And as with a house elf, I have ways of correcting her should she prove unruly.”  </p><p>A sliver of fear edged into Lucius’ heart like a splinter working under his skin.  There was something on the edge of his consciousness, something to do with Georgina, but it slipped away from him, maddeningly.  Lucius swallowed, but kept the same politely impartial expression on his face.  </p><p>Abraxas took another drink.  “That said,” he continued, “because she is a Mudblood, and because I am nothing if not careful, I shall have to keep a closer eye on her than I would if she possessed cleaner lineage.  For this, I shall certainly have to rely on you, Lucius.”</p><p>“Me?” Lucius found his throat was dry so the word came out barely above a whisper.</p><p>“But of course.  You reported to me just moments ago that she was able to outpace you up the Owlery stairs.  She never should have made it that far.”</p><p>Lucius furrowed his brows once more, “I don’t understand why, father.  I was being polite, nothing more.  She wanted to post a letter, asked where the Owlery was, and so I showed her.  I don’t see the harm.”</p><p>“Of course you don’t,” Abraxas said.  “Nor would I expect you to grasp the intricacies of subtle control.  Yet.  For the time being, you need understand only two things.”  Abraxas held up the thumb of his left hand.  “First, all of her letters must go through the house elves.”  His index finger then joined his thumb.  “Second, thanks to you, she now knows how to get to the Owlery, thus I shall consider it your responsibility that she complies with this request.”  </p><p>Abraxas’ expression indicated that this statement should not generate any sort of argument out of Lucius.  The implication was that his father had made this request because he fully intended to read Miss March’s letters prior to them finding their recipients.  The violation of Miss March’s privacy bothered Lucius, but he knew better than to gainsay Abraxas on this matter, or really on any other.  “Yes, father,” Lucius said.  </p><p>“Good,” Abraxas replied.  He turned his eyes to the fire, now aglow with orange embers.  “I am absolutely confident in your loyalty, Lucius.”  </p><p>Lucius felt a small shock of pleasure at the compliment before a sickening new doubt shot through him: <em>what if it’s not a compliment, but a threat?</em>  The hopeful smile that pulled at the corners of his mouth disappeared instantly.  </p><p>Abraxas looked back at him.  “You’re dismissed Lucius.”</p><p>It was as warm a <em>good night</em> from his father as Lucius ever received and so he stood and departed, closing the door behind him without making a sound, all while ambivalence warred within him.  He felt honored that his father placed such trust in him, and yet, he could not shake the feeling that he was betraying someone, perhaps the only one that could stand as an ally to him, especially if she was anything like Georgina had been.  Thus perturbed, Lucius measured the long, echoing hallways back to his own room, before he fell into an uneasy sleep.</p>
