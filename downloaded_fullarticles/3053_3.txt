    <p>Harry Potter sat on the molded floor of the small shack that his aunt and uncle had placed them in. The ratty blanket they had given him did little to drive out the cold that stuck to his bones. The weariness that seemed to place itself as the clock finally struck, another birthday to be forgotten by his so called family, for him he doubted this memory was going anywhere. His arms Jared from the I confines in shaky unstable movements. The cold seemed to almost pry his skin apart and let him stay vulnerable to the outer forces that tainted him.</p><p>        His fingers traced the familiar pattern against the sand. A cake domed from the indentations in the sand. Eleven candles poked wobbly from the cake. Harry smiled and leant forward,  his dark hair shifted and revealed a long scar. He blew across the sand, his only wish; to leave this horrid place, and these horrible people.</p><p>    He closed his eyes, the vast darkness cooled his retinas and rods. A firm chill grasped at his spine, as if sensing his unease the sky gave a thunderous clap. Startled he found himself frozen on the floor as the door was burst off its hinges. A man dressed in a black robes walked, the silken fabric billowing like ribbons with the weight of the man's steps. His eyes, black as the raging sky behind him took in the state of the decrepit building. His eyes latched on to the figures rocking the house's rickety frame with whale like masses. The one leading the assault on the structure clutched a sawed off rifle in his hands with ignorance.</p><p>    The cloaked man seemed stared at the gun for a moment before he pulled out a long pointed object from an inner pocket. </p><p>    "What do you think you are doing!?" Exclaimed Vernon, his gun pointed right at the man's angular face layered in greasy black hair. A sneer twisted the man's face as he pulled out the long jabbed stick in full view. Wordlessly he shot a curse from the tip of his wand, a deep red beam that struck directly at the sawed off shotgun and blasted the offending item. The man looked quite pleased to see Vernon squirm. </p><p>    "You!- and your kind n-need to leave us alone!" The angered man yelled with the last few drops of his liquid courage left. "Indeed we do." Snape replied with a small smirk tugging at his lips. Vernon looked startled. "Off with you then! Sh-shew!" He attempted.  </p><p>    "Soon, but I must take my kind with me." Snape chided. Although he would never admit it to anyone, he was in fact mentioning the scrawny boy Frozen in the corner. "Harry Potter." Vernon breathed.  </p><p>    "He is of my kind, is he not?" Snape's amusement got the better of him as he let out a smirk worthy of a pureblood. "Your kind?" Crept a sentence from the shadowed expansion left untouched by light. "Of course." He replied turning to see if there where more whale like humans residing in the rickety building. </p><p>    His thoughts halted as a bare foot stretched into the light. His skin adorned a light tan. Although as the speaker moved forth he saw a boy, much like his arch enemy, although there was something that frightened him. Stoic red eyes that seemed to take in every move that Snape made before he made it. His eyes widened as he felt a sickness brew within his stomach. </p><p>    "What is, our kind?" The boy asked, his arms had been held in front of him, pushing the tips of his fingers together and rolling them against one another. "Wizards of course." He added with a sneer. "Magic is a wondrous topic. Although it seems to not stretch past my mind." The red eyed boy commented. </p><p> </p><p> Snape felt a wave of exhaustion creep over his mind. He had no time, nor the want to stand here and chat with this boy. "We will discuss this later. Pack your things." He instructed, yet the boy did not walk upstairs. He took a broad step forward and started him in the eye. </p><p> </p><p>   Snape stared down at the boy, his ghastly familiar crimson eyes bore into his own. The frail limbs that lay at his sides and the mop of deathly black hair. "I am my only belonging in this world." The cool words that croaked and creaked from his throat nearly made Snape want to leave him here to rot with these Muggles. He fully deserved to as well, in Snape's opinion at least. He had dealt with Voldemort, what could this child possibly do</p>
