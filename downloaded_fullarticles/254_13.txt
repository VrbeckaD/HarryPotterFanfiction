He looked and saw that he was in a brown skinned child's body he looked around Five years old and he saw a light brown skinned man over him. Harry whimpered and the man said ''Ok little one I'm not going to hurt you'' he put up his hands in a peaceful gesture. Harrison watched the guys eyes change into cat eyes and he whispered ''I'm like you see'' he waved his hand and flames appeared over his hands.</p><p>Harrison whispered ''You have Magic''</p><p>The man nodded and said ''I'm a warlock like you are''</p><p>Harrison said ''I'm notâ€¦'' he felt something move behind him and Harrison touched his wings and yelped.</p><p>The man said ''Calm down angel calm down'' Harrison was pulled into his chest and Harrison relaxed in his hold and Magnus whispered ''My name is Magnus Lightwood-Bane you are in the New York institute''</p><p>Harrison looked up at him and whispered ''My name is Harry but I like Harrison'' Magnus smiled down at him and Harrison snuggled into his chest.</p><p>Magnus said ''Let's go meet my husband and then we can find out where you came from ok'' Harrison nodded and put his head back into Magnus's neck and Magnus picked him up.</p><p>Max Lightwood-Bane groaned ''When are we going on a mission Rafael?'' The 12-year-old looked at his older brother and Parabatai sure Max was a warlock and Rafael a shadowhunter but they didn't care what people thought.</p><p>14-year-old Rafael looked up from his book and said ''When Papa thinks it's time for us to have one'' Max groaned his skin and hair turned blue and Rafael snickered softly and he heard their Daddy walking into the room and saw a child with brown skin and wings clinging to him like a Koala bear.</p><p>Magnus walked over and said ''Hello my darling boys I need you two to watch this little one'' he plucked the little one from his side and handed him to Rafael and walked away to go find his husband.</p><p>Rafael blinked and the warlock child blinked right back at him and Rafael said ''Um my name is Rafael this is my brother Max''</p><p>Max looked at him and said ''Hi''</p><p>The boy whispered ''Hi I'm Harry but I like Harrison better''</p><p>Max asked ''Can you fly?''</p><p>Harrison tested his wings out and he flew out of Raphael's arms and fluttered around the room until his wings got tired and he landed back in Rafael's arms and he mumbled ''Can I sleep now?''</p><p>Rafael smiled and said ''Sure little brother'' Harrison hummed and fell asleep in his arms.</p><p>Alexander looked when the door opened and saw his husband Magnus said ''Alexander'' and kissed him.</p><p>Alec said ''I missed you too Magnus'' and kissed the top of his head.</p><p>Magnus sat in his lap facing him he said ''How would you feel about having another child?''</p><p>Alec looked taken aback and he said ''What I wouldn't mind but there are no children to adopt and we shouldn't adopt a mundane.''</p><p>Magnus said ''I found a child a Warlock child outside the wards he's beautiful Alexander he looks to be five years old and he was just lying there. He's with the boys in the training room.''</p><p>Alec said ''You can't just take a child what if his parents?''</p><p>Magnus hissed ''He was outside alone Alexander.''</p><p>Alec sighed and said ''Let me at least do some research on him and then we can ask him if he wants to be adopted by us deal.''</p><p>Magnus nodded and said ''Fair enough deal.''</p><p>That night</p><p>Alexander walked into the living room of their apartment and saw the child playing with Chairman he smiled and Chairman meowed at him like ''Look what I found?'' Alexander squatted in front of the child and Magnus was in the kitchen cooking.</p><p>Magnus watched them and Alec said ''Hello my name is Alec''</p><p>Harrison looked at him and said ''Are you going to be my Papa that's what Daddy said.''</p><p>Alec looked at his husband and said ''Did he now?'' Magnus snapped his fingers and an iPod appeared in his ears and he whistled to the music. He turned around to the stove and went back to cooking. Alec smirked and said ''Well yes if you want us to be your dad's we can be''</p><p>Harrison whispered ''I want you two to be my dad's and I want Max and Rafi to be my brother's.''</p><p>Alec said ''Alright then you will be Harrison Lightwood-Bane from now on'' Harrison smiled up at him and nodded and hugged him.
