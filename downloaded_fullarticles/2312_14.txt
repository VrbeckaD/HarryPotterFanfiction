    <p>She sighed as she stared moodily at her pint. It had been a long 5 years. She still felt at sea and no interest in anything really. She knew on an intellectual level she was still suffering from PTSD from the war and had never received proper treatment for it. Knowing something and being able to do something about it though, were two completely different things.<br/>

She sat, looking back at the past, at what had caused her to get to this point.<br/>

She had been part of the ‘so called’ golden trio. The battle of Hogwarts! All that death! She was still haunted by their faces, some of them so young. Consequently, she had found it so hard to pick up the pieces afterwards. She finished her last year at Hogwarts on autopilot haunted by it all. She could not face going on to Wizarding University. Working at the ministry was also out as its attitudes pre, during and post the war disgusted her. She no longer had the zeal or idealism to think she could change it from within.<br/>

Hermione thankfully realised before it was too late that her and Ron were a mistake. She had just let a relationship develop through sheer inertia on her part. It had at the time seemed to be the right thing to do. It just seemed expected from all around them especially from the Weasley clan, so she just went with it. She had just laid there, letting Ron get hot and heavy and feeling nothing. She almost let him go all the way but at the last minute, the need for it not to happen was stronger than the oh just let it happen it will be easier fog she had been under. Ron had many faults, but one thing he would never do was force himself on her. He gracefully took no for an answer. He was though, bewildered by her change in attitude to him. He though accepted how she felt.<br/>

It sadly, had changed things between them, which meant they could never be close friends again. Harry had really always been more Ron’s friend than hers, so Hermione did not make him choose but withdrew quietly from their friendship and with some relief.<br/>

After Hogwarts Hermione drifted. She went to live in Spain for a bit, working shifts in tapas bars. One on the magic side and one on the muggle side, just to make ends meet. With her parent gone to goodness knows where, not knowing they had a daughter, she had no other means of support but what she earned. She was not completely alone. She had been reunited with Crookshanks. Whilst in Spain Hermione also discovered something else about herself. She was a lesbian. She had got involved with an older woman. It ended badly. Her ex, was quite an influential witch in the Spanish magical community. Hermione therefore had to move back to the UK.<br/>
Still not sure what she wanted to do, Hermione ended up as a shop assistant in Flourish and Blotts, in Diagon Alley. She lived not far from work, in the aptly named Pride alley, in a tiny studio flat. The area was not particularly wealthy but not dangerously poor either. More importantly there was a big LGBT community in the alley, so for the first time she felt quite safe, because here blood status did not matter.<br/>

Despite that, Hermione did not really try for a relationship again after the Spanish debacle. If she was being truthful was entirely her fault they split. She had since then, a few one night stands, usually when she was drunk but no one she wanted to continue with.<br/>

Hermione was aware that she was drifting and that she really ought to drag herself out of this pit of despair. She knew she was wasting her life, but so much was standing in her way. So she continued to work at a low paid low grade job. Like everything else in the wizarding world, any chance of promotion was blocked by her being Muggleborn. So it was low paid work, one night stands and beer for her with the only constant in her life being Crookshanks.<br/>

As Hermione stared glumly at her beer she became aware that someone had just sat in front of her. Hermione really was not in the mood for a hook up tonight. She debated to just ignore the person opposite but it really was not her style. Hermione looked up and her blood froze at the sight of the worst person ever to be in front of her …. Bellatrix Lestrange!</p>
