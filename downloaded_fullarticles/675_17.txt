  <strong> <em>October 2019</em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Draco Malfoy walked into their Victorian house in Wiltshire, England. Unlike the grandeur of his parent’s manor, their home was landscaped with dwarf bushes and low shrubbery, with two majestic beech trees that stood at either side. It was a five bedroom two story house with a wraparound porch. It has a large green lawn and a gazebo. At the back of the house was an acre of land, where their children were free to roam.  </p><p>Two large white rockers sat at the front and between them was an antique tea table.  He walked through the glass front door into a large hall where a crystal chandelier illuminated the foyer that complimented the hardwood floor. It also had a beautiful wooden hand carved staircase that led to the bedrooms.</p><p> He was surprised everything was so quiet. Too quiet. It was a little over six, and wondered where everyone was.</p><p>“Hermione? Baby, I’m home.”</p><p>“Up here.”</p><p>Draco was hungry as hell and he walked straight into the kitchen. It didn’t smell any food. So, He grabbed a couple of cookies at the cookie jar on top of the counter. He then climbed up the steps, a little slower this time. He was forty-six, not too old and quite fit but his knees said otherwise.</p><p>He went into their bedroom and gasped upon his wife who was naked in their four poster bed with a rose between her teeth. She beckoned him with her finger to her side.</p><p>It started years ago, then it became their tradition and it somehow continued on special occasions when one of them outweighed each other’s surprise. He planned on doing it on their twentieth wedding anniversary which he knew was next year. Tonight, he couldn’t figure out what he missed.</p><p>Hermione saw his confusion and giggled. “Do you know what day today is, Mr. Malfoy?” she asked coyly.</p><p>Fridays were usually their ‘date nights’ It was mutually decided that no matter how hectic and crazy their whole week went, Fridays were sacred. Draco as CEO for Malfoy Industries and Dr. Hermione Malfoy as head of Neuro- Surgery. It was sometimes impossible for them to caught on to each other. Draco looked at his naked wife in bed and tried to concentrate. His erection quite evident.</p><p>“Where are our little devils? It’s too quiet and it’s scary.” Draco asked and looked around. “The last time something like this happened, Scorpius dyed Astrid and Aurora’s hair blue and Phoenix tried to set the house on fire.”</p><p>“Why are you so surprised?  They are your kids after all.” Hermione smirked.</p><p>“Did you just smirked at me?” he gasped. “Where is baby Leo? He never misses to greet me when I come home.”</p><p>“Scorpius, Astrid and Aurora are over at Harry’s for a sleepover. Phoenix and Baby Leo are with your parents at the manor.” Hermione replied.</p><p>Draco smiled. They had five beautiful children. Scorpius who was now eighteen; The twins Astrid and Aurora are soon to be sixteen; Phoenix at age 10 and five-year-old Leo.</p><p>Draco wanted another daughter but Hermione had looked him in the eye and announced ‘shop closed’ His five children were his pride and joy. It did break the Malfoy curse of one child per generation.</p><p>He stared at Hermione’s naked body as she grinned at him.  Stretch marks crisscrossed her round belly, her full breasts that nursed all his five children, still caused his member to jumped into full attention.</p><p>Draco adored his wife’s body. Every stretch mark and cellulite ridge represented what Hermione had given him, His children. His devotion to Hermione never diminished. They had shared a love and life for more than thirty years, they knew that they belong together.</p><p>He smirked at her as he stood over the bed.</p><p>“I don’t think it’s proper to greet your man like this after a hard day’s work. I need a meal woman.” he asked. “I didn’t smell anything cooking.”</p><p>“Oh really, you don’t smell anything?” she teased and spread her legs wider.</p><p>He hurriedly took off his shoes and pulled the knot on his tie. “What are we celebrating?” he asked.</p><p>Hermione threw the rose at his chest.</p><p>“You have no idea what today is?” she replied.</p><p>“Nope.” Draco said. He stepped out his pants and boxers.</p><p>“October 30, 1989” she murmured.</p><p>“Last I checked, that’s not our anniversary.” he said.</p><p>“Nope.” Hermione agreed and sat up.</p><p>“Alright, I give up! you know, I’m bad with dates.” Draco admitted. He stood naked before his wife at full attention.</p><p>“What? Okay, I changed my mind.” she stood up.</p><p>“Oh, hell No!” Draco protested. “I come home with no food, children on MIA and you naked in our bed and now you change your mind? No! No! No!”</p><p>He kissed her hard. “Now, why don’t you tell Daddy what he forgot and I promise to make it up to you, Babe.” he whispered in her ear.</p><p>“Thirty years ago, today at Hogwarts. We were both on our way to the library. Well, I was on my way out. I don’t know about you though… You just came out of nowhere.” she chuckled. “I was bullied because I was a person of color who doesn’t belong there. remember? and this pale white boy broke the nose of that bully.”</p><p>“Ah.” Draco said. “Now, I remember. Has it really been that long?”</p><p>“Uh huh. and you said I was beautiful even I had bucked tooth and that my hair looked weird. After that, you just went off running like crazy.” Hermione giggled.</p><p>“I’m sorry. You thought I was a stupid git.” He admitted. “I really was just shy.”</p><p>“You were far from shy!” Hermione protested. “You stalked me like a pervert!”</p><p>“Did not! I courted you proper!”</p><p>“Did too! You made it clear to all the boys that I was your girlfriend without me knowing it!”</p><p>“You lured me into the library under false pretenses” Hermione replied. “You yanked my knickers and licked me!”</p><p>“You liked it though” Draco snickered.” Baby, you almost pulled my hair out while coming all over my face. you had a juicy pussy.”</p><p>“Excuse me? Had?” she raised her eyebrow.</p><p>“Babe, you know you still do.” he grinned. “The first time I tasted you was September 1, 1990. “I’ll never forget that day at the library.”</p><p>“You don’t remember the first day we met and yet you remembered the date we first had oral sex? You’re unbelievable!” Hermione sighed.</p><p>“The taste of you is forever in my memory” Draco smirked. “Allow me to pay for my forgetfulness.”</p><p>He pulled her by the legs to the edge of the bed and spread her wide. He slid down her body and his full attention was on the task at hand. He bit her inner thigh, sucked and licked. He did to her what he had done the first time at the restricted section of their school’s library.</p><p>“I love you, Hermione.” he said.</p><p>Hermione stared at her husband as she recovered from her orgasm. She saw the wrinkles around his eyes and the hint of grey at his temples. They both had been through a lot. And their love never wavered.</p><p>“I love you too, Draco Malfoy.” she pulled his face down to hers and kissed him hard.</p><p>Draco positioned himself at her entrance and surged forward. He moved inside of her and stared down into her eyes.</p><p>“I told you that you’d be mine.” he said. “Only mine, remember?”</p><p>“I remember.” she replied as he began to move faster.</p><p>“Mine!” he repeated as they both came hard, their bodies trembled at the impact of their orgasm.</p><p>“Always!” Hermione cried.</p>
