  <b>Prologue. I’m Falling</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <u> <strong> <em>September 1, 1998. FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.</em> </strong> </u>
</p><p> </p><p><em> Bloody hell, it’s going to be a long year </em>, thought Harry as he exited the Great Hall. He had escaped the feast early, wanting to get away from the crowd, from all the familiar faces—and all the missing ones.</p><p>He knew coming back to Hogwarts would be hard; but he hadn’t expected it to hurt that much. He wondered how the others could do it. How they were able to eat, smile, joke around, laugh, and look so happy, like nothing had happened, when they had been fighting for their lives on these very grounds, in this very Hall, barely four months ago.</p><p>Harry kept picturing the long row of bodies that had been lined up where the House Tables now stood once more. He kept seeing Remus Lupin’s face, more at peace than he had ever seen it since Sirius had died.</p><p>At the time, Sirius’s death had been one of the hardest things to ever happen to Harry; but Remus’s had been worse in so many ways. It had left him bereft of any sense of family, of any tie to his past, and made him as painfully aware as ever of just how much he had missed, how much he would never know, how much he had irretrievably lost—and all of it, always, because of Voldemort. Killing him had changed nothing. Killing him had done nothing but prevent further harm. Killing him had been a relief, and yet, it had all been over too quickly. Tom Riddle should have suffered, or at the very least, atoned for all the harm he had caused. Even in death, he still had won in too many ways. It was bitterly cruel and painful.</p><p>As long as Remus had been alive, Harry still had someone. Someone who knew his parents, someone who had grown up with them, someone who had known Sirius, someone who knew what could have been. Someone with whom he could mourn all of them. No matter how much he loved the Weasleys, and how welcome he felt in their midst, he was not one of them—and he would never be. And now, how could he possibly face Molly and Arthur and George when Fred’s absence stood out like a sore thumb. He could barely face Ginny and Ron as it was.</p><p>And then there was Teddy. Harry’s heart sank when he thought about the similitudes of their fates; both orphans, both as infants, both because of Voldemort. He took comfort in knowing that at least, Andromeda would be a much better family to Teddy than the Dursleys had been to him. And contrarily to his own godfather, he at least would be there for him as well. It was heartbreaking to think how hard it must have been for Sirius to be wrongfully condemned to Azkaban with no hope of ever getting out, not only because it was unfair and the result of the worst of betrayals, but knowing his best friends were dead, knowing his godson was alone in the world, knowing there was nothing he could do about it. And all of these feelings, with the Dementors feeding off them… Merlin, but how he missed Sirius, how he wished they could have had more time, how he wished they could have been given a proper chance. So much pain, so much hurt, and for what?</p><p>Harry slowly went up the stairs, letting the noise of the Great Hall fade out. From an open window, he could feel the warm breeze of the ending summer; for a second, he was almost tempted to go by the lake.</p><p>But he couldn’t face the grounds yet. Especially not at night. The signs of the battle were still everywhere; in the missing trees, the fallen rocks, the holes in the ground, and the simple white crosses at the edge of the Forbidden Forest with nothing on them but a name and a date.</p><p>And he could certainly not face the Forest, its deafening silence, its eerie calm; this was where he had decided to die, where he had made peace with not surviving Voldemort, where he had greeted death as the friend that had followed him ever since that fateful 31st October 1981. He was not scared of the memories, of the pain, of reliving everything; no, quite the opposite, he was scared he would be too tempted to finish the job. To die like he had meant to. Like he hadn’t been able to. To feel again the peace he had briefly found, and knew the world of the living could never offer him. ‘Pity the living’, had said Dumbledore then. It was not pity that Harry felt for himself, but longing for it all to end.</p><p>No, the castle was still safer; the signs were scarcer there. Most of the damage had been repaired already. A team of Unspeakables had even cleared the stones of most of the dark magic left by Voldemort and his followers. Of course, there were marks of the battle that would never disappear; the battle was part of Hogwarts history, now, just as much as the Chamber of Secrets. And if Harry had learned anything over the past few years, it was that burying History only made it easier for it to repeat itself, over and over again.</p><p>Didn’t make it easy in the present, though.</p><p>With a shudder, Harry climbed the long way to the Gryffindor tower. Belatedly, he realised he didn’t know the password yet. Or if that was even where the Eight Years were sleeping either. There were so few of them… Maybe he should have asked before leaving the Hall. But the thought of waiting for a professor or the prefects was too much for Harry right now.</p><p>“Harry? Where are you going?”</p><p>Harry closed his eyes. He had done his best to avoid Ginny all summer, with more or less success.</p><p>“Wotcher Gin,” he greeted her, plastering a pale smile on his face. “Is the feast over yet?”</p><p>Ginny quickly went up the few steps between them. “Almost. I saw you leave and… Well, I know you cannot possibly be alright right now, but I just wanted to check on you.”</p><p>Harry’s face softened as he looked at her concerned frown. “Thank you, Gin. I really appreciate it. But… I don’t think I can handle being around people right now.”</p><p>She scoffed. “I know what you mean.”</p><p>Harry hesitated. “I can’t… I can’t stop thinking. About them. About Remus. About Fred. About Lavender. About Colin.”</p><p>Ginny nodded, a sad smile on her lips. “Me neither. Everywhere I look, I see him and George, and…”</p><p>Harry felt his throat constrict at the pain he could see on Ginny’s face; it was the same pain he was constantly feeling. Gently, he took her hands and pulled her into a hug. A part of him wished he were less broken, less angry, less sad, so he could love her properly, like she deserved. He knew she would still take him, if he tried. But he just couldn’t. He was not the person she needed, and he never would be. And he didn’t want to be, he realised.</p><p>“Is everything ever going to be okay, Gin? Even after all of this?”</p><p>She shrugged. “It has to, right? This, too, shall pass, and all of that?”</p><p>Harry hummed noncommittally. Still hugging, they remained in a companionable silence until they could dimly make out the sounds of a horde of people coming up from the Great Hall.</p><p>Ginny slowly let go of him. “What are you even doing up here, anyway? I thought the Eight Years had a common room of their own.”</p><p>He shook his head. “No idea, actually. Should probably find out, I reckon.”</p><p>She snorted. “I reckon you probably should, if you don’t want to sleep in the corridors.”</p><p>Harry tried to smile, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “Can you… tell Hermione that I will be there by curfew?”</p><p>Ginny arched an eyebrow. “She won’t like it.”</p><p>“I just—it’s just—I can’t—”</p><p>Ginny held out a hand, stopping him. “It’s okay, Harry, I will. But I can’t guarantee she will not come after you and wake up the whole bloody castle if you are even just a minute late.”</p><p>Harry raked his fingers through his already messy hair. “Yeah, yeah, I know. Thank you, Gin. You’re the best.”</p><p>She shoved him playfully. “Yeah, yeah, I know. Now go, before I change my mind.”</p><p>The clamour was growing louder and louder and Harry barely had time to get up a few flights of stairs and hide before the pride of lions flooded the area, headed by Hermione.</p><p>He looked at her with a sad smile, before sneaking out towards the Astronomy tower.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p><em> Bloody hell, it’s going to be a long year </em>, thought Draco, as he made his way out of the Great Hall, under the scrutiny and ill-suppressed disgust of most of the students.</p><p>He tried to look in front of him and keep a blank face; the last thing he wanted was people thinking he felt any kind of superiority or smugness. And indeed, superior or smug he definitely did not feel. He barely felt anything at all, these days. But he also wouldn’t cower in shame. He was a Malfoy, no matter how much he hated it at the moment, and in adversity like prosperity, Malfoys lay low, and defeat never show. He could still remember the first time he heard his father saying these words; he must have been five or six years old. It was too ingrained in his ways for him to change at this point.</p><p>The feast was almost over, and people were starting to get up and gather in small groups. He walked faster, wanting to avoid the crowd at all costs. Out of habit, he glanced at the Gryffindor table. As he let his eyes drift over, looking for one head of messy black hair in particular (why was he even looking for it, by the way), he caught Granger’s gaze and almost froze on the spot. She must have seen something in his eyes, though, because she simply arched an eyebrow in question and nodded at him. Draco nodded back mechanically before breaking eye contact and making his swift exit out of the now bustling hall.</p><p>He climbed the stairs very quickly, only pausing when he had put some distance between the Great Hall and himself. Leaning on a window sill, he looked down at the grounds, shadows slowly growing under the fading sunlight.</p><p>Though Draco was grateful that the Eight Years were in a dorm of their own, he knew he would have to face the Slytherin common room sooner than later. And yet—how could he? How could he face the green room without counting how many had not come back, how many had fled, how few of them were left? How could he face the First Years, scared and distressed at having been placed in the House that betrayed The Boy Who Lived? How could he face the older students, who knew what role he had played in the War, who knew he only escaped Azkaban because of testimonies from the Golden Trio and with the firm promise to finish his schooling and do community work? How could he face the fact that Snape would never barge into the room ever again, with some announcement or another, or ask to talk to Draco alone to comment on his Potions homework, with a glint of pride in his eyes? How could he face this, how could he face them?</p><p>And then there were all the other Houses… He had done his best to protect the students when he was at Hogwarts. The brief moments he was allowed to remain there for more than a few hours at a time, that is to say. He had tried to make the Carrows trust him, to delegate their punishments to him. They never did. He did his best to look the other way whenever a younger student did something he knew would get them Crucio’d or worse. But there was only so much he could do.</p><p>Draco shuddered at the memories. Merlin knew he wanted to bury them as deep as possible. If he didn’t, how could he possibly face all the students, the professors? How could he face Hogwarts at all?</p><p>He scrubbed his face with his hands and let the stress and pain of the day seep through as he briefly allowed his mask to come down. He had to be strong. More than ever, he had to be brave. He would not let them win. He would not let the Dark Lord win.</p><p>But he also would not become his father. He would not use this opportunity at freedom and a new life to further any agenda. He knew Lucius longed to restore the Malfoy name, even from Azkaban, but Draco would not be the one doing it. For a fleeting moment, he wondered if he could take his mother’s name and forego being the Malfoy heir altogether. He huffed at himself. No, that was the easy way out. That would be hiding, trying to avoid facing his mistakes and the shortcomings of his blood. It would be deceit, and cowardice. No, he was a Malfoy, and he always would be; to deny it would not only be preposterous, but also foolish. He’d do better going into hiding or fleeing the country.</p><p>The sun had completely disappeared now, and the stars were shining bright above the castle, as they always had been, long before Hogwarts had been founded, and would be long after it was gone. He found the Draco constellation easily; how often had he looked up to the night sky, as a child, trying to decipher its mysteries and wisdom. How he had longed to become one with it, to take his namesake’s place amidst the stellar bodies. Even now, he still found comfort in their quiet millennial brightness.</p><p>Draco didn’t know exactly how long he stayed there, in calm contemplation of the clear starry night. He knew curfew was nearing; he wondered what would happen if he was caught out of bed by a professor or a prefect. He couldn’t really find in himself to care.</p>
