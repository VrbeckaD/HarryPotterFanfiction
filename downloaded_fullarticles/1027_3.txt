    <p> Tom Riddle has never been a nice child. Usually, he kept his distance from the others, why? He never wanted a friend, he always thought he did not need him. When he grew up in the orphanage, other children abused him, they believed he was weaker than them. Well, they were wrong. Tom Riddle was a child whom even adults were afraid of. He discovered something that was called magic and used it against his tormentors. From this memorable event, no child has ever raised his hand or voice at him. Everyone left him alone, fearing that he would hurt them. Riddle didn't have a roommate, he always lived alone. Yes, even those children who were new and did not know anything about him were aware of his bad intentions, he... made sure of that.</p><p> When he was eleven, his life changed. Some Headmaster from school for children like him explained to him that he was, in fact, a wizard. Tom always knew that he could do magic, and the news that he was admitted to the school, where everyone is magical, aroused great excitement in him. However, he didn't find any friends in his first year. It turned out that he was surrounded by a bunch of idiots. So he decided to "set himself up" in the near future. Although it was his first year at Hogwarts, everyone respected him anyway, more than once he showed others that he is not a victim who can be mistreated.</p><p>Riddle won the recognition of his home and a few helpers.</p><p> When he returned to the orphanage, he was informed by Mrs. Cole that he had a roommate. Surprised and not satisfied, he just nodded and went to the room. He came in and closed the door quietly behind him. His stuff was in the right place so he sighed with relief. He went to the bed and put the trunk beside him. He looked at the second bed straight into the massive green eyes that had taken his breath away. Opposite to him sat a small boy with a pale complexion and raven hair. On his forehead was an unusual scar in the shape of lightning. With a strange dullness, Tom noticed that his face had traces of beating. The boy himself seemed terrified of his silence.</p><p>“Hello” He greeted softly. “My name is Tom Riddle”</p><p>“Harry Potter” he whispered and glanced away, causing Riddle to feel a wave of strange anger that he could not figure out.</p>
