    <p>Harriet watched Aunt Petunia’s thin hand shake against the tap as the woman turned the water up as hot as it would go. The stream of water against the metal basin beneath the faucet was a monotone rumble, similar to the internal voice of the shell. With the water now running, Petunia called the thing known as Harriet forward, using that main name the shell knew to abide by. It didn't know much, but it did know from years of functionality that obedience generally took less effort. Motivation was not something it had a lot of, but perpetuating its own existence was ingrained somewhere deep in its non-thoughts. Aunt Petunia gestured impatiently at the steaming stream of water. The water was so hot that it sizzled and bubbled when it fell against the drain. </p><p>“Wash your hands,” said Aunt Petunia. And so, the thing called Harriet stuck its hands into the flow of water and started to scrub. The skin went bright red immediately. Maybe, if it was alive, it would be screaming now. </p><p>“Ffffreak.” Harriet almost failed to hear Aunt Petunia’s hiss over the sizzling noise coming from the sink. Aunt Petunia’s eyes never once wavered from Harriet’s face as she reached over and slowly turned off the faucet. </p><p>Aunt Petunia stood to her full height and grabbed Harriet’s shoulder. It moved jerkily as Aunt Petunia shoved it into the living room and pushed a single flat shoe into it’s calf so that it fell onto the perfectly white rug in front of the fire place. Harriet stayed on its skinless hands and scraped knees, looking down at the floor for a moment. There were blood stains on the rug, now. It turned to face upwards towards Aunt Petunia, as it needed further directions. </p><p>Aunt Petunia looked down on it from her great height and Harriet could almost make out that Aunt Petunia was communicating something. Her eyes were…dark? Or maybe it was the way her teeth were showing but her lips weren’t smiling, like Aunt Marge’s dog, Ripper. Harriet could with near certainty say that Aunt Petunia was not happy. </p><p>“Build…a…fire…witch.”</p><p>Harriet looked to the fire place. It was big, meant for a fancy display of fake electric flames trapped in glass. Where they had been was now a pile of ashes. Harriet looked at the cardboard box of wood next to the fireplace. Last year, Harriet had watched and it remembered how Uncle Vernon had built a fire. It began mimicking his actions from that evening. It took one log at a time to place in the hearth, with some room under and between them. </p><p>Each piece of wood that the shell placed in the old ash was stained with its blood. Seven pieces of wood, a nest of tinder, and now it remembered it was time for a light.</p><p>The muscles in Harriet’s arm twitched involuntarily when it flicked the lighter, over and over trying to get tiny blood-slick fingers to light the spark when both hands were shaking. Its fingers stilled when, just before it could roll the lighter again a tiny flame flickered from the air just above the filthy plastic. It was a split second too late to be a product of the lighter, even if it was in the right place. As it drew the spark to the wood, the tiny flame seemed to hesitate before rushing to catch up with its hand. The fire starter lit easily. In the fake hearth, the flame grew steadily over the first few twigs from which it would grow; the product of a fake child. </p><p>The corpse of a little girl, growing when it should be ash, used stolen fingers full with blood and splinters to take one stick at a time. It meticulously placed each twig in a spiral around some imaginary center in the forgotten coals. The body, not once warm for six years, was finally burning, indifferent to the warmth and life within the hearth that charred what remained of the skin on its arms and hands. Harriet knew, in some deep part within it, that this mortal flame could not burn it, the thing inside the body, so easily. When the last log was placed Harriet remained kneeling on knobby knees, staring into the coals with dark, blank eyes set unmoving beneath a scar that contorted and flashed as the flames leapt into the air and vanished. </p><p>And as the flame crackled with the fiercest heat this not-being would ever know, Aunt Petunia pushed the body of her dead niece into the fire.</p><p> </p><p>The fire was all that existed. Harriet could feel it in its eyes and nose, bursting through its hair.<br/>
The fire was inside it.<br/>
It was inside it inside the body the only body it had it was being  s w a l l o w e d   b y   f l a m e   it felt scared it  f e l t<br/>
The fire burned within her.</p><p> </p><p>Harriet awoke sleeping in a pile of ash.</p><p>Nothing was the same.</p><p>She wasn’t just a chunk of flesh anymore, she had something alive within her. She wasn’t used to anything, and now she was something and it was different than being nothing. Existing really was very...strange.</p><p>For one, she was pretty sure she was feeling something. For another, she was certain that she was thinking something. Stranger than any thoughts or feelings, though, was that she, as in Harriet, was having them.</p><p>She had a name. She knew her own name. She’d never known something like that before.</p><p>Then her fingers grasped a handful of feathery ash. Against her fingertips - fingertips! - the ashes crumbled and spread over her skin and left her with a sensation of overwhelming softness. Of warmth.</p><p>And as Harriet felt and learned the soft and dry warmth of ash, she, too, warmed up inside. The living thing inside her caught onto the richness of the idea of ash and grew, and Harriet felt each of her limbs twitch with an instinctual ability she now had, an inherent strength, to get up and move.</p><p>A tiny muscle at the corner of her mouth pulled upwards.</p><p>So Harriet took a deep breath -more air to burn!- and opened her eyes for the first time for the third time in her existence.</p>
