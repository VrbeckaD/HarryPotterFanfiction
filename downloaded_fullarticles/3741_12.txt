    <h1>Foxy Tale</h1><p>There has always been this fox in the forests behind the Graves mansion, since Percival was very little. He always knew it was the same, because it had this scar across it's muzzle and a ripped ear. It could either be seen drinking from the pond or lazing around in the lush greens of the garden. </p><p>Sometimes it would chase garden gnomes around or carry a Niffler in its muzzle, but never once has Percival seen it hurt any of the other creatures. When he ran outside to see it more closely, it would have vanished before he made it there. </p><p>He had told his parents about it, but they would just shake their heads and say he should let it be. When he went pouting (though he would never admit that) to his grandfather and tell him about what he had seen, the old man would laugh and tell him a story about this fox his great great grandfather once saved from a trap. </p><p>His own grandfather had often told him how the fox had been described with a scar on its muzzle and a ripped ear. Percival would look confused and unbelieving, because that would mean the fox was more than a few hundred years old!</p><p>"Yes my boy." </p><p>Would his grandfather say with an amused smile, fluffing up his hair, which he protested loudly and continue with his story. </p><p>Their ancestor helped the fox in its healing after he rescued it from the poacher trap. While he had helped it through the injuries, he would often tell it about how the garden gnomes were ruining his wife's carefully planted herbs. He had always thought the fox was listening intently, ears always in his direction when he spoke. Maybe it was just that his voice was soothing, or just to make sure it would not be surprised should their ancestor still attack. </p><p>When the fox was fully healed, it vanished into the forest, tail swishing. Their ancestor had watched with a smile and turned back into the manor. </p><p>That night though, they were startled awake because of a loud commotion outside their house. He had told his wife to stay put, took his wand and went to the window to see what was happening. What he saw was not something he had expected.</p><p>There, outside in the garden, was the red fox chasing around garden gnomes. When it caught one in its muzzle, it would run around in circles and then throw it away in a high bow. Usually the gnomes would stumble confusedly deeper into the forest. </p><p>His wife didn't have problems with the gnomes for many months and when they returned, the fox would be there waiting. It happened again and again and not only with gnomes, but with Nifflers and other creatures too. </p><p>It happened every time their ancestor had complained about them.... either to his wife or sometimes even to the fox itself, after he noticed it lounging in their garden a few times. </p><p>When he had children, he would call the little fox their guardian with a laugh and tell them to never hurt it.</p><p>The story about the fox would be told even after their ancestor had died, because it was often believed to be seen behind the house. It wouldn't always stay for long, sometimes even look sadly in the direction of the house until it vanished again. Its visits would become rarer over time, but every time a creature was causing havoc, it would return and take care of it before any creature or human could get hurt. </p><p>Percival was still a bit unbelieving, but was listening intensely anyway, because that story was so very interesting for his young mind. </p><p>
  <i>His parents never ever told him about the story after all!</i>
</p><p>And his grandfather would smile sadly and tell him that they didn't believe in it.</p><p>Percival would see the fox a lot after that, which had absolutely nothing to do with how he would just wait for it to appear so he could watch it. It certainly looked like the fox of the tale, all fluffy fur and the mentioned scars, but then again his grandfather could have made this all up from the beginning. </p><p>One time he had managed to sneak after the fox with a Niffler in its muzzle, deep into the dark forest, where the fox had sat it down and then almost looked like it was scolding the little thief. It certainly looked like they were discussing things, before the Niffler would make a rude gesture and vanish further into the forest.</p><p>The fox watched the creature go with something that looked like a head shake, before golden-greenish eyes looked right in the direction Percival was hiding in. The boy was so surprised, he stumbled backwards with a startled cry. When he looked up again the fox had vanished. He pouted and turned around, keen on getting back to the house before his parents found out about his adventure. But sadly he found out that he had no idea where he was, since he only had eyes for the fox and the Niffler on his way out here. </p><p>He was scared when he turned around and around and everything looked the same.</p><p>When he braced himself to choose a direction he would try going, he heard a noise from the right. He was surprised that when he turned, he saw the fox standing there staring at him. It made the noise again and then turned around to go a few steps in that direction, stopping and looking back when Percival wasn't following right away. Looking in the direction he had intended to go for a moment, which suddenly looked ominous, Percival shuddered and started following the fox. It was always running a few steps and than make sure Percy was still there. </p><p>That's how Percy managed to get back to the manor, to his utter relief. When he turned around to thank the fox, it had vanished again. Dismayed, Percy returned to bed.</p><p>But it had been a start to a wonderful friendship.</p><p>When Percy started going to school, he would always return with stories for the fox, who could be seen lazing around more often again, listening to the slowly growing childs tales. </p><p>The day Percy's grandfather died, had the now teen devastated in the garden, with the fox curled beside him and letting itself be patted.</p><p>Even when Percy finished school and went to auror training, he would visit the Graves manor and talk to the fox, because it had always been his closest confidant. He would keep a schedule to always visit the manor at least once a month if not more, the fox always knowing when he returned and waiting for him. That routine stayed the whole time, even when he was suddenly the director of security for MACUSA.</p><p>---</p><p>Â </p><p>But then the visits suddenly stopped and the fox would wait and wait and wait some more. One month went by without a visit of his human friend.... than another and another... </p><p>The fox would wait and still not see his friend for three months in a row. He would get worried, because he knew down in his heart, that this one has not yet perished. He always knew when one of the Graves died, since the years a nice ancestor had saved his life.</p><p>That's how he had started his journey to find his dear friend. </p><p>In the end he had turned up in New York. A tall male with reddish hair, a scar on his nose and freckles all over. Usually he avoided the populace like that. The town making him uncomfortable, but he still wanted to know what happened to his friend.</p><p>With his good nose and a little Niffler and other creatures in tow (stored away in a well used suitcase), he found someone who <i>looked</i> like his friend, but absolutely didn't <i>feel</i> OR <i>smell</i> like it. </p><p>A big chase happened around town and he managed to expose the imposter before his friends supposed co-workers. </p><p>When it was clear they had a good grip on the ugly smelling pineapple, the fox went to search for the real Percival, the Obscurial boy helping, when he had explained what had actually happened. Together with the help of a lot of creatures, they found the real Percival Graves. </p><p>Not well, but alive. </p><p>This time it was the fox that helped a Graves survive and heal.</p><p>When Percival awoke, feeling good and safe, the way he only felt when his fox was around, got the surprise of his life when a pretty young man, with a scar above his nose and a slightly damaged ear (that was mostly hidden behind red curls), threw himself at him in happiness.</p><p>Percival was still a bit dazed, but not doing anything about the hug, when he said: </p><p>"Fox?"</p><p>Pretty golden-greenish eyes looked at him, with tears in them, but a happy smile on the man's lips. </p><p>"Yes! But you can call me Newt."</p>
