    <p align="left">Daisy sat on the bow of the boat, looking out over the ocean as they traveled towards Moni. It wasn’t far and the professor said it wouldn’t be too much longer before they arrived. She pulled her coat closer around her as the brisk winter wind caused her cheeks and nose to turn red. Iris walked up and studied her a moment, taking in her pained expression.</p>
<p align="left">“How are you?” she asked softly, causing Daisy to look back at her. She sighed and looked back out at the sea.</p>
<p align="left">“Been better,” she admitted. Iris walked up and slid her arm around her shoulders.</p>
<p align="left">“I know this can’t be easy for you,” she said.</p>
<p align="left">“That’s putting it lightly,” Daisy said sarcastically.</p>
<p align="left">“We’re all fond of John, but… I’m sure he’ll pull through alright,” Iris said. “You shouldn’t beat yourself up over it.”</p>
<p align="left">“Doesn’t make me feel any better,” Daisy replied. “I can’t even imagine how upset he’ll be when he finds out about Wills.”</p>
<p align="left">“That, well I must admit that was a bit of a shock,” Iris confessed. Daisy laughed slightly.</p>
<p align="left">“You think you were shocked,” she said. “Imagine how I feel.” Iris frowned slightly.</p>
<p align="left">“But there must have been something there if you formed a bond with Wills. These things don’t just happen out of the blue,” Iris said.</p>
<p align="left">“I know. And I suppose there <em>has</em> always been something there. I’m still just trying to figure out how I ignored it for so long and what I feel about it now,” she said. “Especially when you take into consideration that I was with John for nearly two years.”</p>
<p align="left">“Maybe you should put John aside for a moment while you sort things out with Wills,” Iris suggested. Daisy laughed haggardly.</p>
<p align="left">“Easier said than done,” she replied darkly.</p>
<p align="left">“I take it the bond was not so expected, yes?” Nikos said, walking up to the mother and daughter. Both turned to look at him. He had a curious look on his face.</p>
<p align="left">“Is that common?” Daisy asked, standing and turning to face him. Nikos shrugged.</p>
<p align="left">“Usually it is expected. These things don’t form overnight. It takes time. And there must be a strong foundation there,” he said. Iris looked down at Daisy.</p>
<p align="left">“I suppose in a way, it’s been forming for years,” she said. “Wills always was pretty close with Daisy.”</p>
<p align="left">“Do you love this young man?” Nikos asked. Daisy looked to ground, silent. It was the very same question she had been asking herself ever since she felt it in her room last night. Part of her answered yes immediately. But the other part was confused. If she was truly in love with Wills, why did she feel so conflicted about it? Shouldn’t she be deliriously happy?</p>
<p align="left">“Love is not always so simple,” Nikos said with a chuckle, reading her mind. Daisy looked up at him.</p>
<p align="left">“Apparently with me, it’s decided to always be complicated,” she said, thinking back to the early days of her relationship with John. Hadn’t she fought that one as well?</p>
<p align="left">“Just know this, young Daisy, things have a way of working themselves out,” he replied. “And I suspect this one will work itself out as well. Just have faith.” Daisy nodded. She wanted to reply that his advice was annoying vague but one glance at her mother had her holding her tongue.</p>
<p align="left">“Ah, it looks as though we are here,” Nikos said, smiling. Iris and Daisy looked over, seeing they were approaching the coastline. “Prepare yourselves. I suspect we’ll be arriving shortly.” He then turned and walked away.</p>
<p align="left">“You ready for this?” Daisy asked her mother. Iris sighed and looked back over at the coast.</p>
<p align="left">“I hope so.”</p>
<p align="center">~~~</p>
<p align="left">It was oddly quiet as they neared a small bay along the coast. Despite the chill, the water was still crystal clear and a brilliant shade of blue.</p>
<p align="left">“You might want to prepare to take off your coats. The temperature is about to get a bit warm,” Nikos called out as he navigated the boat. As they reached the opening of the bay, all three Woods stiffened as they felt a pressure fall upon them. “That would be the protective barrier. It’s placed all around the village to keep others not like us out. It will pass momentarily.”</p>
<p align="left">Sure enough as they entered the bay, the pressure disappeared as the temperature rose exponentially. It was as though they had stepped from winter into the midst of summer. And now where they had originally saw a deserted beach, a dock and several buildings made of white rock appeared. There was a small group of men waiting on the dock for them while it seemed others peered out excitedly from windows. The closer they got, the more nervous Daisy got. She could feel the same nerves radiating off her mother and brother.</p>
<p align="left">“There is no need to feel so nervous. They are excited to meet you,” Nikos called out. “Though… forgive their enthusiasm. We don’t get visitors.”</p>
<p align="left">“Why is it so warm?” Jamie asked, pulling his coat off. Nikos chuckled.</p>
<p align="left">“I mentioned that some of us have special gifts. Well, one of those is control over the weather. Therefore here, it is always summer.” Daisy, Jamie and Iris looked at each other in shock.</p>
<p align="left">“You think one of us could do something like that?” Jamie asked, looking back at the professor. He shrugged.</p>
<p align="left">“We will just have to see. I do sense something in you, but I’m am not sure what it is just yet,” he said cryptically. Daisy rolled her eyes, causing Jamie to chuckled.</p>
<p align="left">“Come on, Pix. Be nice,” he whispered.</p>
<p align="left">Soon enough, he had pulled up to the dock and several men stepped forward to help tie up the boat.</p>
<p align="left">“Welcome to our village,” one called out with a bright grin on his face. He looked like a younger version of Nikos, but seemed to have an air of authority around him. “I am Argus.” He reached and offered a hand to Iris, helping her from the boat.</p>
<p align="left">“It’s very nice to meet you,” she said once both feet were on land. “I’m Iris Wood. And these are my children - Jamie and Daisy.” The two younger Woods hopped from the boat and stood shifting nervously on the dock as Argus smiled at them. Nikos hopped from the boat and walked over to the man, grinning broadly as the two hugged.</p>
<p align="left">“It is good to see you, brother,” Argus said.</p>
<p align="left">“It is good to be home,” Nikos said.</p>
<p align="left">“You look a bit older,” Argus joked.</p>
<p align="left">“Ah, but so do you, I must say,” he said. He looked around at the crowd gathered and his grin only grew as his eyes fell on a strapping young man with bright brown eyes and dark curls. He was toned, but still looked short next to Jamie. Granted most people looked short next to Jamie. “Could this be? Is this Christos? You’ve grown up!” The man in question laughed as he stepped over and hugged him, slapping him on the back. Nikos looked over at the Woods. “May I introduce my nephew, Christos. He is Argus’ son.”</p>
<p align="left">“One of many sons and daughters,” Argus said. “But he is the youngest.”</p>
<p align="left">“It is good to meet you,” Christos said, taking in all the Woods. His eyes lingered on Daisy a bit, causing Nikos to chuckle.</p>
<p align="left">“Ah, very sorry to inform you, but she has already bonded with someone else,” Nikos said. Daisy’s eyes widened as her cheeks flushed. Rather than being embarrassed, Christos laughed loudly.</p>
<p align="left">“My loss, Uncle,” he said, winking at her. “But can you blame me? Being cooped up on this island, it’s not often we get treated to outsiders - especially beautiful ones.” Jamie chuckled softly as he looked down at her.</p>
<p align="left">“Seriously, Pixie, we can’t go anywhere without you conjuring up a few suitors,” he said. Daisy glared at him.</p>
<p align="left">“Oh shut it, Jamie,” she said.</p>
<p align="left">“Now, now, there is much to do. I suspect you all may be hungry? Shall we have some food, then before we get you settled?” Nikos said. The Woods looked at him and nodded, Daisy jumping slightly when her stomach offered up a large growl. Nikos chuckled and turned to Argus.</p>
<p align="left">“Don’t worry, we have something prepared for you,” Argus said. “And quite a lot. Nikos told us that you two were professional sport players. Follow me.”</p>
<p align="left">The Woods followed him with Christos falling into step next to Jamie and Daisy. They made their way from the docks up a path that led into the village. From the beach, it looked as though the many buildings and homes were carved into the hillside. It was an enchanting place, full of light and shouts from the villagers as they went about their day. Some stopping momentarily to look at the visitors as they made their way to Argus’ house. By this time, both Daisy and Iris had lost their coats and Daisy was sending death glares to Nikos for not telling them it wouldn’t be winter here. All she had packed were pullovers and warm clothing besides the clothes she usually wore for training.</p>
<p align="left">“So tell me, what is this sport you play? Football?” Christos asked.</p>
<p align="left">“Ah, no. Quidditch,” Jamie replied. “Our father played professionally as well. He’s now the coach of the top team in the League - Puddlemere United.”</p>
<p align="left">“But not the top for long,” Daisy said, scowling up at him. Christos laughed.</p>
<p align="left">“I take it you play for a rival team, no?” he asked, looking down at the small woman.</p>
<p align="left">“Current No. 2 in the League - Appleby Arrows,” she said. Christos studied the two for a moment.</p>
<p align="left">“I am curious about this sport. I’ve never heard of it before and you two seem to be very different in build. What sport could allow such a thing?” he said.</p>
<p align="left">“You don’t have quidditch here?” Daisy asked, flabbergasted. Christo shook his head.</p>
<p align="left">“No. We play football and some other sports, of course. But we don’t know much about what is popular in the regular wizarding world. During peace, we don’t often leave the island or mingle. We may go to Aegina every now and again to get supplies that we cannot grow here or create ourselves, but we do not stay long,” he said. “We prefer it this way.” Though Jamie and Daisy could sense that Christos didn’t seem to prefer it as much by the tone of his voice.</p>
<p align="left">“Well… it’s played on broomsticks,” Jamie said. “There are seven players per team - three chasers who score, two beaters who focus mostly on defense, one keeper and one seeker. Which is why you need people with different builds. All the positions require different sets of abilities.” Christos nodded.</p>
<p align="left">“So what do you play?” he asked.</p>
<p align="left">“Keeper,” Jamie replied. “I guard the goals - there are three of them.”</p>
<p align="left">“And I’m a seeker,” Daisy said, glancing up at him.</p>
<p align="left">“What does a seeker do?” he asked. “Or rather… what is it you seek?”</p>
<p align="left">“The snitch. It’s a tiny gold ball with wings that likes to be ornery and disappear on you, it flies so fast. You need to be light and quick. Whoever catches it gains 150 points for their team,” she said.</p>
<p align="left">“So they win?” Christos asked.</p>
<p align="left">“Not always,” Jamie replied. “It depends. If the chasers score enough points with the quaffle before, the other team may still win.” Christos laughed and shook his head.</p>
<p align="left">“It seems to make no sense, this quidditch,” he said.</p>
<p align="left">“I’ve been saying that for years,” Iris said, rolling her eyes. Jamie and Daisy scowled at her.</p>
<p align="left">“You understand this game?” Christos asked.</p>
<p align="left">“Had to learn. All four of my children have followed in their father’s footsteps and play professionally,” she said.</p>
<p align="left">“Four? Where are the other two?” Christos asked.</p>
<p align="left">“At home. They were not marked, thank god,” Iris said. “Remus and Alan. They are Jamie’s identical brothers.”</p>
<p align="left">“Identical triplets,” Christos said, looking at Jamie in awe. “I’ve never seen that. We’ve had twins on the island, but never identical. And never triplets or more. So they look exactly like you?” Daisy snorted.</p>
<p align="left">“This one seems to do whatever he can to looked different,” she said, pointing at him. “But Remus and Alan play beaters on another team, so they prefer to look exactly alike so that no one can tell the difference once they are on the pitch.”</p>
<p align="left">“We were shocked by identical triplets as well. They don’t run in either of our families,” Iris said. “Though our extended family has had one set of identical twins. They’re not related by blood, though.”</p>
<p align="left">They were deep in the village, it seemed. Daisy looked around wide-eyed at the amount of people there.</p>
<p align="left">“Is everyone here like us?” she asked.</p>
<p align="left">“Yes. Though, not everyone becomes marked, but we all have some sort of gift or ability. Even if they are not marked, they can come and go from the village. Many who are not marked decide to settle elsewhere. Though never far from the island,” Christos said.</p>
<p align="left">“Do people become marked even when there is no danger?” Daisy asked.</p>
<p align="left">“There is always some danger out there in the world - so some are always becoming marked even though we may not leave to go help. But… more and more have become marked lately. We’ve had several return to the island in the past couple of years because of it,” Christos said. He glanced over at the Woods. “I suppose it is related to why you two have become marked.”</p>
<p align="left">The Woods went silent. They still didn’t know what could be coming, but it seemed even more serious than they had originally thought.</p>
<p align="left">“Don’t look so serious. We still have plenty of life to enjoy,” Christos said, smiling.</p>
<p align="left">“Ah, here we are! Come in!” Argus said, stopping in front of a large whitewashed home that sat on top of a hill. They had been walking through winding passages and streets for a time before coming up to it. The Woods stepped in behind him as he led them through it and out to a rooftop balcony with a gorgeous view of the sea. They sat at a large table while Argus spoke to a woman who quickly disappeared inside. “The food will be served shortly.” He sat down and looked at the three visitors, still grinning.</p>
<p align="left">“What about the rest of your family?” Daisy asked, looking back towards the door.</p>
<p align="left">“At the moment it is just me, my wife and Christos at home. The rest are married and on their own,” he said.</p>
<p align="left">“It’s so beautiful here,” Iris said, looking around. “Though, I admit, I wish Nikos had told us about the weather,” she said, glancing at him. “We’re not at all prepared for summer.”</p>
<p align="left">“My apologies, Iris. It must have slipped my mind,” he said.</p>
<p align="left">“It is no problem. We can find you some things that would be more suitable. I’ll have them sent to the home we have prepared for you later tonight,” Argus replied.</p>
<p align="left">“Who controls the weather?” Daisy asked bluntly. Argus chuckled.</p>
<p align="left">“There are about four of them at the moment. They work together to maintain the charms that were set long ago. And to bring the rain when it is needed for the crops,” he said. Daisy nodded. “You are wondering what sort of gifts you will have, are you not?”</p>
<p align="left">Daisy looked up at him, surprised. She knew she should be used to having her mind read because of her mother and brother, but it was a bit startling to have it done by someone else.</p>
<p align="left">“Not everyone has gifts, you must know,” Argus said, looking a bit more serious. He glanced over at Nikos. “So whether you will have them remains to be seen. Unless Nikos has seen something. But you must know that his sight… well, it’s not always specific.” Nikos chuckled.</p>
<p align="left">“I see something… just not sure what. But I believe all three of them will have something,” Nikos said. Jamie looked back and forth between the two men.</p>
<p align="left">“So what exactly are these gifts?” he asked.</p>
<p align="left">“There are many types,” Argus said. “We see them as gifts from the gods and goddesses. Some can manipulate water - a gift from Poseidon. Some can manipulate the earth - a gift from Demeter. Christos here can communicate with animals and change himself into any creature. A gift from the goddess Artemis.” The Woods looked at the young man who was grinning.</p>
<p align="left">“You mean, like an animagus?” Daisy asked. Christos looked at her, confused.</p>
<p align="left">“A what?” he asked.</p>
<p align="left">“It’s a witch or wizard with the ability to change themselves into an animal. But it’s very tricky transfiguration and can be dangerous. So they typically can only change into one animal and must register with the government,” Iris said. Christos nodded.</p>
<p align="left">“I just think of what I want to be and then I become it,” he said. “And I can communicate with them.”</p>
<p align="left">“There is also the power over death,” Nikos said. “A gift from Hades - the god of death himself. Those who possess this can bring those who have passed on back or heal the most grievous of wounds.”</p>
<p align="left">“Yes, but we have not had one of those in hundreds of years,” Argus said. Suddenly the table was full of tons of food. Daisy’s eyes grew wide. “For now, please, eat. Then we will get you settled.”</p>
<p align="center">~~~</p>
<p align="left">After a large late lunch and more talking, Christos led them down the street to another house as the sun was starting to move closer to the horizon. Granted from what Daisy could guess, they’d probably have another hour or so before dark fell.</p>
<p align="left">“Here is where you will be staying. I hope it’s to your liking and if you need anything, please let me know,” he said. He then nodded and strolled off down the street whistling. The three walked in and the lights turned in as they stepped in. The home was comfy and airy. They walked into a large open kitchen with white walls. An archway separated it from a large living room with large windows and a fireplace decorated in natural beiges and browns. At the back of the kitchen, there was a doorway to a stairway that went up to the bedrooms.</p>
<p align="left">“This is nice,” Daisy said, walking from the kitchen into the living room and back in. She looked at Jamie and then ran up the stairs, laughing gleefully. She looked at all the rooms and stopped when she found one with a view of the sea. “Found my room!” she shouted as she walked in and dropped her bag by the door. It was large, though not the largest, and had dark brown walls, though it was hardly dark in the room with floor to ceiling sliding glass windows on one side. She walked passed a desk against one wall and a queen-sized bed against the other to the windows. She slid it open and stepped onto the balcony, breathing in the sea air as she settled into a hammock.</p>
<p align="left">“Settled, are we?” Iris said from the door. Daisy looked over at her mother and smiled.</p>
<p align="left">“I suppose,” Daisy said. Iris walked over and placed her hand on Daisy’s shoulder. She then leaned over kissed the top of her head.</p>
<p align="left">“Don’t worry, darling. We’ll get it all sorted. I feel like we’ll learn what we need to,” she said as she looked out over the sea.</p>
<p align="left">“I hope so,” Daisy murmured.</p>
