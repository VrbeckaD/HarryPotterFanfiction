    <p>The legends that Muggles told contained kernels of truth, hidden magic that they dared not to believe. The tales of King Arthur told of hidden valleys and forests, like Avalon and Broceliande, hidden behind veils of magic and mist. Such hidden places still existed, and were home to wizards who chose to practice their craft and live their life away from the possibility of being discovered by those who did not practice magic. </p><p> </p><p>As the sun rose and set, it flecked the scales of mermaids with its light as they dove in and out of the depths of the cove, and painted rainbows on the glassy wings of pixies as they danced in wildflower meadows; on frosty winter nights the keening chorus of howling werewolves rose from the dales and moors, but the residents of the Arcane Vale knew not to come out on full moon nights. The moonlight white bodies of unicorns could be glimpsed between the trees of deep forests, and from the trees rang the frothing babble of magical springs and fountains where nymphs sang.</p><p>Pandora found it all terribly dull.</p><p>The fauns and satyrs whom the gardeners chased from the orchards and bosco leered and lewdly grabbed themselves, and pixies sometimes bit, leaving quite a rash. There was nothing to do except visit. The wealthiest families lived in manors, and visited often. During the summer, the boys were home from school, so things were quite interesting. Infatuations played out at balls, and provided enough heartbreak and intrigue to gossip about when the boys were installed at Hogwarts, in Scotland, once again in autumn. The families of the Arcane Vale didn’t send their daughters to school, nor were they provided with wands. They learned feminine accomplishments, potions and herbology. The verdant Vale, with its enchanted orchards, meadows, forests and springs, felt like a monotonous prison to Pandora Alcyone Black. </p><p> She, and all the girls she knew, escaped through reading sensational novels. Pandora lay under an ancient oak tree to the side of the potions garden, reading Hawksmoor by Mrs. Featherstone, the story of Arabella, a young witch who must traverse the globe escaping the bestial desire of a vampire called Sanguinetti before she can be reunited with and marry her true love, the peerless Beauregarde who writes acrostic poetry and plays the oboe.</p><p>“Hawksmoor is insipid! Read this, instead. And take this. Careful, don’t snap it,” Pandora’s cousin, Lucilla Malfoy, ordered.  </p><p>Lucy was her best friend, companion, confidante, and two years younger than Pandora. They looked like two sorceresses from an Arthurian myth, one wicked and one benevolent, though Pandora couldn't decide which was which.  Pandora was womanly and dark haired, with brown skin of a light sienna hue, whereas Lucy was a thin, silvery blonde who was tall for her age, 14. They shared one trait, gray eyes the color of a stormy sky.<br/>
Pandora rushed to put her novel away and catch the items Lucy was shoving her way, a heavy book and a wand that appeared to be made of oak.</p><p>“Lucy! What is this? We aren’t allowed wands. Where did you get those?” Pandora spluttered, as she read the title of the book: The Duelist’s Handbook.</p><p>“In the attic,” Lucy said. “I suppose they belong to some dead Malfoys.” </p><p>She emphasized her words with a shrug, which sent her long, white cashmere shawl sprawling down her slender shoulder. Lucy wore a sky blue empire waisted gown, Pandora wore a white, cotton off the shoulder gown that gave her a preview of what she would look like on her wedding day. Since she was born, perhaps before, she was betrothed to Lucy’s brother, Draco. He was off at school half the year. When he was at home, he was often in bed-he was not a robustly healthy boy. Pandora rather liked caring for Draco when he was ill, unless he was being peevish, fussy, and immature. She couldn’t imagine being his wife, the only person he turned to when he was ill, rather than his mother, Pandora’s aunt Narcissa. Helping  an adult was one thing-when you had performed your role adequately, you were released to read, practice music, pick apples, or walk to a friend’s house. No one would release her from being Draco’s wife once her new life as an adult began. </p><p> </p><p>“Wands have to choose their masters, in the shop. You can’t just use someone else’s,” Pandora said.</p><p>“If no one else is using them, you can. These don’t belong to anyone,” Lucy said.</p><p> </p><p>Dora could just imagine her Aunt Narcissa’s face if she held the wand before her properly, as if she meant to do magic with it. She’d all but sneer her disapproval, her delicate mouth becoming hard rather than its usual appealing Cupid’s bow, wrinkles appearing on her pristine brow, and her gray eyes becoming as cold as a harsh northern sea. After this pointed silence, she’d surely walk Pandora upstairs for a long talk about how ‘unbecoming’ she was behaving, and the importance of cultivating appropriate virtues. </p><p>Her aunt wanted her to be nothing short of the perfect woman, and Dora tried. She didn’t put herself forward at dinner conversation, she only answered her Uncle Lucius’s associates monosyllabically when they asked her a question, and looked down at the table while she did so; she didn’t dance with everyone who asked her at a ball, and even left early. She listened to what her aunt and uncle said was suitable and unsuitable, often earning scowls from Lucy who always managed to wander away too far, eat too much, talk too loudly, and break some rule by day’s end.</p><p> </p><p>She feared that Narcissa would say that her mother would be disappointed at her behavior. Ada Valancourt Black was not only a memorable beauty, but Narcissa described her as ‘gentle, kind, utterly faultless.’ Her only fault, it seemed, was a weak heart, taxed fatally by Pandora’s birth. </p><p>“Your father simply couldn’t live without her,” she had been told many times, as explanation for Regulus Black’s death so soon after his wife’s. </p><p>They were both young, beautiful, too delicate to weather life’s storms, like characters in novels who were constantly praying for strength or trying to imbibe it from the majesty of nature, but whose fierce, strong emotions overwhelmed their bodies despite their efforts to rally. They were always spoken of with fondness and regret by Dora’s relatives, and she never wanted to do anything that would shame the memory of such paragons for parents. </p><p> </p><p>“Hawksmoor is drivel. All that rot about marriages. Father says there’s going to be a war. We must prepare for it, don’t you see? What if the Vale is broken, and the other covens’ forces come pouring in? The men will be gone, we must be responsible for ourselves!” Lucy insisted heatedly.</p><p>“Lucy, you mustn’t be fearful. Aunt says that women have a responsibility to their families to keep life in the household routine. We must stay calm, to do that,” Pandora said.</p><p>“‘Aunt says,’” Lucy mocked. “If I wanted to know what my mother thinks…well, I suppose I’ll ask you won’t I?” </p><p> </p><p>Pandora was stung. Lucy could defy her parents as much as she wanted, and be assured of their love and forgiveness. Pandora had to conduct herself with gratitude towards the relatives that had taken her in after her father’s death. Then, there were her parents-if she disappointed them, how could she ever make it up to them? Pandora had to live at a precariously high standard of obeisance. She and Lucy were as close as sisters, but she saw now with sadness that they were not alike.</p><p> </p><p>“Here, read this page. Now, this is how to disarm someone if they try to stun you. Go on. You read it and follow it, just like a potion,” Lucy said, opening the book to a page that had step by step illustrations of the instructions.</p><p>“Lucy…” Pandora said. </p><p>She knew that Lucy wouldn’t take another refusal. She also knew for a fact that her aunt was away from the manor, visiting her friend Madam Venetia Candlesnow. It could run long if Madam Candlesnow was showing off her dressmaker’s latest creations. She had an irksome habit of dressing her daughter, Stelliana, exactly like Pandora, which necessitated that Pandora ignore Stelliana Candlesnow at all costs so that no one would think she had approved this tendency. In any case, Pandora figured they had a while before Narcissa could discover them practicing magic forbidden to women.</p><p>She held her wand the way the gentlemen in the illustration did, almost as if it were a sword.</p><p>“Your stance,” Lucy said, and Pandora widened her stance.</p><p>“Now, when I say ‘Stupefy’, you say ‘Expelliarmus’,” Lucy instructed.</p><p>“All right, then,” Pandora said, getting used to the feel of the wand in her hand. It was slender, but heavy, and hummed as if it had music within it.</p><p>She wasn’t prepared for Lucy’s shout of ‘Stupefy!’ By the time she shouted ‘Expelliarmus’, she couldn’t be sure if she had disarmed Lucy or not, because Pandora flew backwards, into the hedges.<br/>
