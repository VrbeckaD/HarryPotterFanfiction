    <p>Sirius walked to Griffindor tower after the welcome feast with James Potter, the boy who was sure to be his best friend.</p><p>He took his time on the lengthy walk, laughing at the portraits on the wall, and trying not to think about the death glares that were burning holes into his skin from his Slytherin cousins. He wouldn't let them ruin this for him. </p><p>Because nothing was better than this. <em>Hogwarts.</em> He already had an overwhelming feeling of home, a feeling that was only multiplied once he set foot in the Griffindor common room.</p><p>He loved  every single thing about it. From the peeling carpet due to years of nervously pacing 7th years, to the deep ink stains on the wooden study tables between the stair cases to the dorms. He wouldn't change anything. Everything looked <em>loved</em> and well used, and even though he wouldn't admit it, that was Sirius's favorite part. </p><p>As they made their way up to the dorms, he quickly claimed the bed by the window, excited about having a pleasant view for the first time in his life. One of the other new Griffindor boys, whose name Sirius couldn't recall, had his stuff in the next bed over nearest the door. James was across from Sirius, leaving the tiny boy, Peter, next to him nearest the bathroom. </p><p>"I'm James!" James announced while everyone began to settle in, still too excited to sleep much "And this is Sirius! Who are you lot?" He added cheerily, gesturing to Sirius.</p><p>"Peter Pettigrew..." The boy next to James squeaked nervously. </p><p>"Remus Lupin" The one next to Sirius said coolly as he pulled out a muggle record player and sat it on his bedside table. </p><p><em>"...the fuck</em> kinda name is that?" Sirius joked as he eyed the record player with interest. </p><p>"You can't <em>SIRIUS</em>ly be asking me that..." Remus replied as he turned to look at Sirius, eyebrows raised.</p><p>James barked a laugh as Sirius face split into a huge grin. Peter laughed nervously from his cross legged position on the bed, clearly not sure what was happening. </p><p>"Guys! This is it! <em>Hogwarts!"</em> James said as he threw himself onto his bed dramatically. </p><p>"Do any of you have siblings that have been?" Peter asked after a moment.</p><p>"Nope" "nah" "I'm the oldest" Remus, James and Sirius replied. </p><p>"Me either. Bit exciting innit?" Peter continued. </p><p>"I had to really make an effort to not squeal like a 5 year old with excitement in those boats" James laughed, only partly joking. </p><p>"Haha I know what you mean..." Sirius said, half listening as he unpacked some things. </p><p>"AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" Remus deadpanned yelled in the highest register he could reach as he continued to sort through his trunk lazily. </p><p>There was a split second of staring before mayhem was unleashed.</p><p><em>"GAAAAHHHHH!"</em> James joined in with enthusiasm, jumping on his bed in full force. </p><p>Sirius jumped on his trunk and beat his chest as he too screamed out, while Peter marched back and forth across the room with his hand in the air screeching the loudest of the four. </p><p><strong>BANG! BANG! BANG!</strong> "Shut the <em>FUCK UP!"</em> Someone shouted while banging on the door. </p><p>Uh oh....</p><p><strong><em>"Sorry!"</em></strong> All four boys shouted sheepishly through the walls before turning to look at one another and falling to pieces with laughter. </p><p>Sirius had no memory of laughing so hard in his life.<br/>
Cheeks red and stomach sore from laughing, Sirius turned back to his dorm mates, unable to control his grin. "I like you lot. Great mates." He said with a confident nod. </p><p>"Best mates! Best mates! Best mates!" James whisper chanted as he bounced lightly on his bed. </p><p>Peter just laughed and nodded his head enthusiastically. </p><p>"You're adequate I suppose" Remus said with a dramatic sigh and smirk as he closed his trunk with a snap. </p><p>"Fuck off, I'm amazing. We all are. And this is going to be the best year!" Sirius said as he pulled the blanket around himself. </p><p>"Yea yea...." Remus rolled his eyes "who wants to bet that he says that same thing next year" he finished with a chuckle. </p><p>"Night, all!" James said into the silence as they each closed the curtains around their beds for sleep. </p><p>"Night." They responded together.</p><p>Sirius drifted off to sleep with a smile on his face and the laughter of his new friends echoing in his ears. </p>
