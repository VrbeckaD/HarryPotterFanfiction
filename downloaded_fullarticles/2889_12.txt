    <p>Southwest of England- Cornwall- July 31 -1980- 11:45 p.m.</p>
<p>That day if had been busy in that mansion, especially since the young lady who stayed there as a guest for several months now went into labor all had started at 8:35 pm he knew it well for three damn It was hours and ten minutes that she was in labor and nothing new was known since her wife had come in to help the woman in labor, absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>If he had it in front of that bastard, it would break every one of his golden bones, and he would strip him of his blue blood until he begged and forgiveness, regretted what he had done.</p>
<p>But fate was cruel and he wasn't there.</p>
<p>Taking from that day another unequivocal reason to hate him.</p>
<p>He would have loved to have his wife as never before, perhaps that way he would lower the anger he felt at that moment, but he was sure that his father would turn it into a brochette and hold it in the nearest chimney, if it occurred to him to externalize this thought, not for nothing had he paid a fortune in the dowry of that girl but, she for her father seemed to be worth it since an immaculate blood run through her veins not for nothing was a Black. More was the third time they tried to bring to the world a child product of both and this third time being one in which Narcissa , now with six months, didn't stop traveling with inconveniences the pregnancy reason why the Healers had prohibited them to maintain sexual relations until the end of the pregnancy .</p>
<p>However, there was that little girl giving birth to a baby, that bastard and the first attempt at conception. It was unacceptable, he should have brought a child to the world, no her before he was her older brother.</p>
<p>He couldn't understand why his father wanted him to be there that night, to humiliate him, to trample him without a doubt.</p>
<p>That was unprecedented was an eighteen-year-old girl who had married the most irresponsible wizard on the face of the earth in an attack of romanticism and now as a model child brought to the world the product that his father longed for since the moment had it urged dance with one of the Black and even even better sisters, because now if everything went as surely his head elaborates at that time wouldn't only have the right to say it was related to the most ancient and noble wizarding family but was the grandfather of his heir. Increasing his infinite ego if that was possible and plunging him equally into an infinite misery</p>
<p>He didn't understand the magnetism that both produced had besmirched both their families, either with their courtship or their agreement as impure and above they were married and now they would have a child and all really forgotten the world should be upside down, if that was it had to be.</p>
<p>Then the first bell rang announcing the end of the last day of the seventh month and the door handle that led to the room where all the women of the house were gathered began to yield and with the second bell the head of a woman of about fifty years old I walk out the door. She was exhausted by the work done during the previous hours but that didn't prevent a triumphant grimace from appearing at the corner of her lips and after exhaling widely she said with a brightness of joy in her blue eyes:</p>
<p>-"Friendly for all, he has been a boy."</p>
<p>So it was that when the last bell rang Lucius could see in his father a look of pride and joy to hear that and from that moment he had no doubt that he will never receive an equal directed him, at least not on his part.</p>
