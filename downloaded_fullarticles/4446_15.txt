<p>The first thing his father told him upon bringing Granger back home was that she belonged to HIM and that Draco was to leave her alone. End of story. In the wake of their victory over Potter and his ridiculous makeshift Bumbling Army the highest ranking among the most faithful had been awarded some Amazing Fucking Prizes once the dust had settled and the world was back in order.</p>
<p>He could remember that day clearly, his father calling to him, the Dark Lord calling to him to cross the line and join the inevitable winners. Granger had caught his eye before he walked across the cobbled battlefield and looked at him with the most infuriating pity. As if he were so stupid that he didn't understand what he was doing, the choice he was making. If he’d had the freedom to do so he would have ripped her hair out and choked her with it. How could she be so blind and? Mudblood or not, she had to understand it was better to be a living coward than a dead martyr. He knew they’d all stared at him as his heels clicked towards his father, could feel their eyes on him. He knew they’d all watched him run, pulling his mother along with him. But they didn’t know she was dying. And maybe they didn’t know that he would have given every ounce of his powers to save her, or have one more day added to her life, to not have to watch her wither away. No, they didn't see any of that. They only saw a selfish coward. In fact it had been almost two years since they’d taken most of the leaders of the rebellion off in shackles but looking at Hermione now, he could tell that her feelings about him hadn’t changed a bit. Smug little bitch, fat lot of good her virtue and heroism got her. It actually never stopped being funny to him, the nosedive like downfall of the Golden Trio that ended with two of them six feet under the mud and one spreading her legs for a gang of Death Eaters.</p>
<p>Except him of course. Draco…was not in as good graces as the others and was, in fact, not counted among the prized faithful, or even considered an ally to the Death Eaters at all anymore. Persona Non Grata was a term he learned fourth year, using it often to describe muggles and mudbloods, and now it applied to him. Even walking around at home it felt like there was a cold wind in the manor, a soul crushing stench of disappointment for the Boy Who Failed. But this. Well this whole situation was a rare ray of sunshine in his shit pile of a life.</p>
<p>She’d sat beside Lucius on the three hundred year old settee worth more than her family’s home, staring at Draco’s shoes, her humiliation, he assumed, complete. He could see from six feet away that she was trembling, her fingernails chewed down to the quick. There was still dirt smeared on her shins, a smudge across her cheek. The dress they'd given her to leave the prison in was too big for her and cut too low, revealing the sides of breasts. They hadn't even given her a bra, poor little mouse! He let out a short laugh and sipped his drink.</p>
<p>“She is not your slave, or your plaything Draco,” Lucius said, looking every bit his old self in his black robes, his legs crossed at the knee as if this were a perfectly normal situation, this family sex slave orientation, something occurring every day. He sipped at his wine, swirling it in the glass for some sort of dramatic effect. “She isn’t your whipping boy.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s eyes flicked up then and Draco caught her gaze, quickly wagging his eyebrows and giving her a wink. Her face was white with fear, and probably a touch of anemia. Her hair, which she’d finally gotten control of in the last year or so was dull and frizzy, matted in the back. No day spas in Hogwart’s Prison. He was waiting for her to spit some sort of invective, but she only looked down again, folding her hands in her lap and for the first time Draco noticed the choker around her neck. A collar more than jewelry, it was a plain flat circle of dark, heavy iron with their family crest engraved on the front. It didn’t look particularly tight, but he assumed there were some entertaining charms associated with it that would keep the fucking Mudblood in line.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, father. I got my fill of pulling her pigtails at school,” he said, downing the rest of his vodka tonic. “Although, I must admit, I’d never gotten the urge to dip my quill in that particular…ink.”</p>
<p>“Draco!”</p>
<p>Lucius rested his hand on Hermione’s knee, or actually, the skin above it, his fingers brushing over the inside of her thigh, under the edge of her skirt. Her cheeks flushed red, not wanting to be groped in front of her childhood rival. But before it could go any further Draco stood and raised his empty glass.</p>
<p>“I’ll be off to my wing then. You have fun with your little fucktoy, father,” he said, pulling the sitting room door open. “I’m sure Mother would be so proud.”</p>
<p>He left the room and pulled it closed again, just in time to hear his father’s glass shatter against the wall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*****</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She was given much more freedom than she expected – all things considered. The collar was charmed to keep her within twenty yards of the Manor so she was free to roam the grounds, which, once well manicured and impeccably landscaped were beginning to fall into disrepair. She found weeds in the cutting garden, broken and low hanging branches on the trees, bushes overgrown, their shoots clawing up over the windows. Still, it was fresh air, and when she was outside, she could be alone.</p>
<p>“Is that thing heavy?” She heard Malfoy before she saw him, heard the sarcastic smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Not as heavy as failure I suspect,” she said calmly, lifting an eyebrow at the man who’d tortured her on a nearly daily basis for years.</p>
<p>The way his face fell was, well…like a five course meal. It gave her energy, a spark of life. He was as much a prisoner as she was and it showed. The Malfoy that used to walk around in thousand dollar suits and perfectly coiffed hair was now a hot mess, shuffling around the manor barefoot in ripped jeans and untucked shirts. His hair had gotten a bit longer, long enough to hang down in front of his eyes like an unkempt dog. He still wore that sullen frown though, and always long sleeves covering his forearms, although she wondered why he bothered since they all knew he bore the mark. Just like she bore hers. Everyone had their scars.</p>
<p>He recovered quickly from the jab, leaning against the trunk of an overgrown willow tree, looking away from her, out over the grounds. She noticed his pupils were dilated, the silver of his eyes barely visible. A thin line of sickly sweet smoke trailed up from his fingers.</p>
<p>“Are you smoking marijuana?” She asked, looking at the wrinkled little cigarette in his hand.</p>
<p>He picked it up to his face and examined it, his eyes widening in mock horror, eyebrows shot to his hairline as he gasped.</p>
<p>“Am I?” He took a quick drag. “Oh my gods!” he muttered through tight lips as he held the smoke before blowing it out in a stream over her head. “Still the same ol’ Granger aren’t you, darling? Can’t resist passing judgement.”</p>
<p>“I’m not judging,” her voice was filled with exasperation. “I’m just surprised. It’s a muggle pastime after all.”</p>
<p>“Right,” he said, rolling his eyes. “Us wizards have never used natural herbs to alter our behavior.”</p>
<p>Actually, she looked at the cigarette with longing. She’d never smoked weed before but she knew well enough that it would dull her senses, fray the edges, soften everything that was happening to her. In fact, she suspected it was why he was high himself. It wasn’t right that before they’d even turned twenty-one they'd seen so much death, so much violence. It wasn’t right that they’d both been tortured and imprisoned, forced into acts they’d never have chosen on their own, for the honor of people who sat back and watched.</p>
<p>Pulling her into his bed, Lucius had rested his head in her lap the night before, crying about the loss of his wife in the past year, but also the “loss” of Draco, his greatest disappointment, unable to carry out the simplest of tasks for the good of the family. Where oh where did we go wrong? He was a man who put up the coldest and strongest of fronts, but in the dark he always ended up seeking her comfort.</p>
<p>“And now he wanders…lost…unable to see the light at the end of any tunnel,” he whispered morosely, as if Draco were some sort of undead spirit haunting the manor.</p>
<p>She hadn’t dared to open her mouth, to remind him that his side had actually won, that ‘mudbloods’ and ‘blood traitors’ were all but considered animals now, and Draco’s “failure” had little consequence and maybe reminding him of that at every turn wasn’t the way to heal the past. She knew better than to speak out of turn, having been beaten nearly senseless for it on countless occasions while in prison.</p>
<p>Now she looked up to see Malfoy holding the cigarette out to her, his face blank. She wondered if he was always high, or drunk, or otherwise ‘altered’. Would she blame him?</p>
<p>“I-I shouldn’t. I’m sure your father would know. Somehow,” she said, touching her fingers to the seal on her collar.</p>
<p>He shrugged and took the joint back, taking another short hit before wandering away, leaving her alone under the willow tree. He was surprised at how quickly she shrunk back at the mention of it, of him. Lucius had only had her at the Manor for two weeks but there was no doubt she’d been quickly brought to heel. He’d had the distinct misfortune to overhear a great deal of her "training"; both the punishments and the rewards. Behind closed doors he’d heard the whip cracking, the smack of thick leather paddles against her flesh, clanking chains. More surprising, were Hermione’s reactions. She’d screamed on her first night there, loud enough that even when he went to the other side of the house to sleep he could hear her begging for mercy. That his father wouldn't soundproof the rooms or use a Silencio on her was just further evidence of his perversions. But before long, her screams began to change. She still begged for mercy, she still cried out in pain, but inevitably her nights ended with her crying out in passion, coming loudly with breathless whining and whimpers of pleasure and it always made his cheeks flare with heat, wondering what his father had done to tame her so quickly. Draco knew she’d been tortured in prison, and as much as he’d disliked her and everything she stood for from day one, no one deserved the kind of violence the Death Eaters were fond of delivering. He’d seen it first hand. At one time in his life he’d thought he’d be happy to take part in it, but apparently he hadn’t the stomach for rape and abuse and this was something he was supposed to be ashamed of. Perhaps she'd learned the valuable lesson of doing what it took to survive. She obviously had something that drew Lucius in, and she could use it to stay out of prison and out of the grave.</p>
<p>Ever since he’d introduced her in their second year, his father had always had an eye for Hermione, asking about her progress at school, whether she could keep up with the purebloods, what her subject specialties were, whether she’d come from money or poverty and of course, was she promised to anyone. As if arranged marriages were something common among non-pureblood wizards. It had all disgusted Draco as a kid, for a myriad of reasons, but she was a woman now, a softer woman with fewer edges and considerably less sass and his father’s attraction to her was, if not obvious, at least understandable. Besides, it was…nice? to have a different face around the manor. She was, at least, someone else to talk to, and someone who understood.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>“Would you mind explaining this?” Lucius slapped the morning’s paper down on his desk. “Without any smartass remarks or outrageous justifications if you will.”</p>
<p>Draco picked up the Prophet and sighed. He’d always loved being on the front page, but the quality of local reporting had really taken a dive.</p>
<p>Disgraced Malfoy Heir Spotted With Tipsy Underage BTs!</p>
<p>And in fact there he was, a photograph taken from across the room of a decidedly seedy bar, very dark and barely focused, but his hair always had given him away, and this time it had pretty little fingers tangled in it, his mouth trailing kisses down the neck of a girl in his lap. In his defense, the girls had told him they were seventeen, promised him all kinds of filthy things in exchange for free drinks. Now that he was sober, he wondered if they were plants.</p>
<p>“Just so I'm clear father, are you more upset with their age or their Blood Traitor status?” Draco said, glancing down at Hermione who was kneeling on the floor beside Lucius’ chair. “Because one of those things would make you a blazing hypocrite.”</p>
<p>He threw the folded paper on the floor at Hermione’s feet and she wondered if he’d done it on purpose for her to see. She glanced at the picture, reading the details of how he’d been “aggressively snogging” according to one witness, with a dark haired witch in the corner booth of The Wraith, the seediest bar set on a narrow street off of the revived Knockturn Alley. She’d studied enough psychology, muggle and otherwise to know that Draco was acting out. All of this was a reaction to his pain. Not only pain at his massive and public failure, but the loss of his mother as well. And he wasn't the only one doing it. She'd heard of several of her classmates on both sides of the war had all but fallen apart in the last couple of years, some turning their back on wizarding completely and living life as muggles in America. She glanced up to find him staring at her with that lopsided, lazy grin on his face, very nearly proud of what a fuck up he was. But as soon as he caught her empathetic eye, it all melted away into a frown, his face a mix of hurt and embarrassment.</p>
<p>“They set me up,” Draco said, looking back at his father, slouching down in his chair, his long legs stretched out in front of him. “I went out on Thursday to get some air, tired of listening to your little games all night.”</p>
<p>Hermione blushed the darkest shade of red he’d ever seen. Worse than the sunburn he’d gotten in Dover as a child. She still had dark purple bruises on her neck where Lucius had suckled and bitten her skin, coming dangerously close to drawing blood.</p>
<p>“They came up to me. They immediately knew who I was,” he continued, picking at pieces of lint on his pants. “I should have known it was a set up by how…excited they were to make my acquaintance. No one’s ever been that thrilled to meet such a monumental prick.”</p>
<p>Hermione could hear that although his face was stony, his eyes clear and focused, he was on the verge of falling apart, that if he were forced to come up with another word, another excuse, he would break down completely. She looked from Lucius to Draco and back again, the tension in the silence nearly making her nauseated. All she wanted to do was tug at Lucius’ pant leg and warn him, to beg him on the knees she was already on to not say whatever he was going to say. To just let it go.</p>
<p>“Well, perhaps you should have listened to your first instincts then, instead of being lead off into the corner by said prick.”</p>
<p>Hermione gasped audibly and both men looked down at her. Draco was forcing a fake smile, fake smugness, fake control. Lucius was genuinely calm.</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” Draco said standing. “Or maybe you should put a collar on me too so I’m sure to never leave the manor and embarrass you ever again.”</p>
