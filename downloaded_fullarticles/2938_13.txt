    <p>After the destruction of the headmaster's office, Harry decided it was time that he took control over his own life. He didn't believe in the prophecy, and even if he did believe in it he'd already vanquished the so called dark Lord when he was a baby. There was no reason why he should have to do it again, especially for a community that seemed to be more than happy to discredit a minor and throw innocent people in jail without a trial. No, it was one for him to leave before they finally managed to kill him.</p>
<p>It was a quiet Harry Potter that sat at the end of term ceremony and then left on the train with his friends. For a while he wondered if he should tell them of his plan of leaving the wizard world behind, and more likely England since he didn't plan on staying with his so called relatives. But he decided against it, Hermione would just tell some authority figure and Ron would end up blabbing the next time he became angry over something.</p>
<p>It was when the Order threatened his uncle that Harry knew he made the right decision. He waited until they've arrived at the house he'd grown up in and then told his aunt and uncle that he would be leaving in a week or so.</p>
<p>"The only thing you need to do is either drive me to London or give me enough money for the bus and you'll never see me again. We just need to wait a couple of days, otherwise they'll know I'm gone and will likely try and force me back. Just ignore I'm here for a week and then I'll be out of your hair forever."</p>
<p>His uncle gave a grunt.</p>
<p>"Fine, as long as you don't come back. Pet, you can take him the next time you go shopping. You've talked about needing a new dress, and Dudley needs new shoes."</p>
<p>Petunia hesitated for a moment before nodding.</p>
<p>"Good. Now I'm going to go to my room so the guards can see me."</p>
<p>"Guards?" His aunt asks.</p>
<p>"Yes, every prison needs guards and we all know that this never been my home. It's why I didn't go directly to London. If they see me here for a couple of days they'll think everything's fine. But you should probably leave for a while after dropping me of."</p>
<p>"We'll visit Marge the day after you leave," Petunia doesn't look happy when Vernon says this, but doesn't protest.</p>
<p>The rest of the week was peaceful, in the way that they ignore each other completely. Harry goes down to the kitchen when the others already has eaten and spends the rest of his time in his room, trying to make some kind of plan.</p>
<p>It was easy to hide in the back of the car so he wouldn't be noticed. He'd already released Hedwig and told her to find him later when it was safe. His trunk was left in his room since he could by a new one and he didn't need most of the things in it. Instead he just had a backpack that used to belong to Dudley. A cap over his hair and scar, just to be on the safe side he'd also used some makeup on the scar. No one looked at him twice as he walked through Leaky Cauldron and then opened the way to Diagonal Alley. Harry wasted no time as he walked quickly to Gringotts and got in line to.</p>
<p>"I would like to see someone about my account."</p>
<p>"Key," the goblin said without looking at him.</p>
<p>"I've never had it, can something else be used?"</p>
<p>The goblin finally looked up and gave him a nasty smile.</p>
<p>"Blood always works."</p>
<p>Harry just holds out his hand and lets the goblin make a small cut on one of his fingers. The goblin looks surprised at the results and gives an order to one of the guards. The guard in turn indicates that Harry should follow. They walk through a long corridor until the guard stops and knocks at a door. He more or less shoves Harry inside before closing the door.</p>
<p>"Ah, Mr. Potter you're a day early for the reading."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, what reading? And may I have your name?"</p>
<p>"The reading of Sirius Black will. Are you telling me that you've not been informed of this?" He makes a sharp gesture towards a chair. "Sit, I believe this will take some time. I am your accounts manager Mattock."</p>
<p>"Accounts? As in more than one?"</p>
<p>Mattock's looks thunderous.</p>
<p>"Are you telling me that your magic guardian hasn't told you anything?"</p>
<p>"I wasn't even aware that I had a magic guardian, let me guess it's Dumbledore with his many names?"</p>
<p>"That is correct. If you didn't know about the reading, why are you here?"</p>
<p>"I've decided to leave, and was hoping to get enough money from my valve to get away."</p>
<p>"I see," Mattock gives him a smile that's more teeth than anything else. "Would you like to claim your Lordships before you leave? It would make you an adult in the eyes of their paws and they wouldn't be able to force you back against your will."</p>
<p>At Harry's blank look he sighs.</p>
<p>"I believe that it would be best if you took an inheritance test and also let us do a medical exam."</p>
<p>"Sure, I have no problem with that," Harry agrees.</p>
<p>"Good," Mattock pulls out an empty parchment and puts it on the desk in front of him. "Just five drops on your blood on this and we'll see what titles you can claim."</p>
<p>"Five drops of blood on an empty parchment will tell you that?"</p>
<p>"It's a special parchment; it's been submerged in a special potion that reacts to blood."</p>
<p>"Oh, ok, then," Harry isn't used to people explaining things to him so he quickly takes the pin that the goblin holds out and pricks his finger.</p>
<p>When five drops has fallen the goblin snatches the parchment and mutters some kind of spell over it, before putting it down on the desk again.</p>
<p>Harry James Potter</p>
<p>James Charles Potter, father, deceased</p>
<p>Lily Potter nee Evan, mother, deceased</p>
<p>Sirius Orion Black, godfather, deceased</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Titles</p>
<p>Lord Potter</p>
<p>Lord Black</p>
<p>Heir Slytherin</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Valves</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>197</p>
<p>365</p>
<p>564</p>
<p>675</p>
<p>876</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Animagus</p>
<p>Metamorphosis</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry looked at the parchment in confusion.</p>
<p>"I can understand the first two titles, but how and why am I the heir of Slytherin?"</p>
<p>"It most likely happened when the Dark Lord Voldemort gave you that scar. When he marked you and in the process was defeated, magic made you his heir." He lets Harry think about that for a moment before continuing. "Now, if you'll follow me and I'll take you to one of our healers."</p>
<p>Harry quickly hurries after, as the goblin walks away without waiting for an answer. It doesn't take long before he's lying on a hard bed with another goblin chanting over him. She, at least he thinks it's female, has a crystal in her hand instead of a wand. But she has the same no nonsense attitude as Pomfrey, he wonders if all healers and doctors have the same attitude. And while he doesn't understand what she's saying, he can tell that she's not happy with what she's finding. It takes almost half an hour before she stops, and then she's waiving a parchment in Mattock's face while yelling something. She gets so loud that the guards outside opens the door to make sure that everything fine. Harry has no idea what's going on but tries to look as harmless as possible when the healer suddenly turns towards him.</p>
<p>"You, human, say sanctuary," he healer says with a heavily accented voice.</p>
<p>"Sanctuary?" She gives him a firm nod and slaps the parchment on Mattock's chest.</p>
<p>"Well, Lord Potter-Black, it seems like we have even more than we thought to talk about."</p>
<p>"Sorry?" He isn't certain why he's apologizing, but he's been taught that if something goes wrong it's more than likely his fault.</p>
<p>"It's not your fault. Now, I think it would be best if we went back to my office and I explained some things while we have some lunch, and in your case some potions."</p>
<p>"Oh, ok."</p>
<p>Back in the office someone had already put some soup and sandwiches on a tray. Mattock waits until Harry has finished one sandwich and was slowly eating some of the soup.</p>
<p>"Since it appears that you haven't been given any of the information you should have been given, I feel it best if I explain something first," he waits until Harry gives a nod. "All magic leave traces after it. Which in most cases is completely harmless and even helps magical children as they grow. Their cores learns to recognize family magic, stabilize it or even in some cases attunes and evolves giving the child new magical gifts. But it can also destabilize, corrupt or even splinter the core. From what our scan tells us, not only have you been neglected and abused since you were young. But also there has been no healing done from either the dark curse you were hit with as a baby not from the other dark curses and spells you've been subjected to."</p>
<p>He takes a breath and a small sip of water before continuing.</p>
<p>"Ordinary in cases when we have someone in our staff that's been hit with a dark curse we let them go through a purge, which removes the taint. But since you're so young that's impossible, your core hasn't had time yet to completely grow and stabilize. If we did a purge it could shatter and either kill you or turn you into a squib."</p>
<p>"So you can't do anything?"</p>
<p>"The goblins can't help you, but if you agree we can send you off to a temple for a cleansing. It's slower than a purge, but in this case that's a good thing since they also can correct all the other issues you have from your abuse."</p>
<p>"Well, since I came here so I could get enough money to leave England I have no problem with this. Can they keep me from being discovered by Voldemort or Dumbledore or whoever will be looking for me?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely. Since you claimed sanctuary it means that we can use all our skills to help you."</p>
<p>"Oh, thank you."</p>
<p>"Now, since we don't want the healer’s wraith on us, we will only a small fee for our help. And you will stay in a room here until you they've said it was ok for you to travel magical." When he sees Harry's confused look he explains. "All magical children, no matter what species, are seemed as something to cherish. That you've been so mistreated is a grave sin."</p>
<p>Before he can say anything else the door is opened and the healer arrives, carrying five potions. She says something to Mattock before shoving the files at Harry, gesturing that he should drink them. Which he does, grimacing slightly over the taste. Mattock's responds and the healer grumpily turn and leave.</p>
<p>"We'll go over your options more tomorrow; apparently the potions will make you tired in a while. But before I'll show you to your room I feel it would be best if you read Mr. Black's will, then you have time to figure out how you want to handle it tomorrow."</p>
<p>Harry accepts the will and quickly reads through it, even as he starts to feel tired. He's then escorted to a rather spartan room, even if it's larger than the one he's used to. Even the bed is bigger and softer than the one he left behind.</p>
