    <p>Chapter 1<br/>
I’m Sorry</p><p>Draco:</p><p> </p><p>How can you not remember me?<br/>
I know you do!<br/>
You shouldn’t be walking up that aisle, toward <em>him</em>! In that dress so beautiful and white!<br/>
I can see the shimmering upon your cheeks; from the speckles of tears glistening from your bright eyes... hiding what I know to be fear.<br/>
You should not have been roped into this!<br/>
You know he’s doing this because he’s nothing but a control freak with a jealous streak!<br/>
But he has you... he knows it, as you continue walking toward him.</p><p>  You <em>never</em> loved him! You loved me... and I know you still do, deep down... though I am here, in the crowd, forced to watch as you reach the altar, to begin the next part of this charade of love and devotion he proclaims to have; only I know that what he is doing is not love!</p><p>  I feel a slight wetness upon my cheek, when did I start crying? Was I crying?<br/>
You are so beautiful! You are warm and caring!<br/>
He doesn’t deserve you! Not after all he put you through... and I know he’s going to put you through a lot more.<br/>
I know it.  You know it.<br/>
I hear him speak.<br/>
Oh... how I wanted to get up from this seat I am stuck to and punch him in the throat!</p><p>  There was no sincerity in his tone.  No warmth, though he was a ‘good actor’... his mother was dabbing her eyes with the corner of a fancy handkerchief, a proud smile upon her blissfully unaware face.<br/>
How does she not know her youngest son was something far worse to the Dark Lord?<br/>
Perhaps I am overestimating, but what does it matter?<br/>
One does not have to be part of the Death Eaters to be nasty.</p><p>  But, all I can see was his mother seeing her youngest son, her own child, getting married to this beautiful woman, whom she will get to call her daughter-in-law...<br/>
I pity the poor woman.  If only she knew, but I cannot fault her... no more than I can fault my own mother for loving me.<br/>
For a brief moment, I see the father looking over at me.  It was only for a split second, but I saw it.<br/>
My gaze goes down, I wasn’t sure if I saw his expression correctly, but I can sense the hate he had, believing that I am to blame for what had happened... based upon a lie! A huge one!</p><p>  The shatters of your voice ringing through the chapel cause me to look back up.<br/>
You’re terrified.<br/>
I know.<br/>
It should be me up there; with you... placing that finger upon your finger, speaking the vows to you, and your vows to be in return.<br/>
When the priest asks for any who wishes for the marriage to not continue, you sure as hell bet I wanted to speak up.<br/>
I wanted to more than speak; I wanted to shout to the high heavens for this falsehood to stop! Because it was nothing but a fucked up rouse!</p><p>  Yet, I am unable.<br/>
I am gagged into silence.<br/>
He made sure of that!<br/>
I saw him flash a smug like glint toward me.<br/>
If only looks could kill.  My grey eyes were probably blaring daggers... or the killing curse... one of them.</p><p>  Many applause and well wishes as you make your way, arm linked with your new husband.  The bloke I have hated since the moment I laid eyes on him; knowing from the start that he was a bad seed... able to fool almost anyone and everyone with his so called charms... including a certain boy who survived the Dark Lord’s wrath, which saw his own downfall.</p><p>  You had come to learn the truth about me.<br/>
As did the Boy-Who-Lived... but then he... your new husband...<br/>
Where did it all go wrong?<br/>
Why was he there, at your side, instead of me?<br/>
You halfheartedly wave and force your smile... among the fresh set of tears.</p><p>  Then you see me; it startles you, for you certainly didn’t see me when you were going toward him.  That was the point; you weren’t meant to see me... until now... when it was too late.<br/>
A smirk upon his face, knowing he had won you.<br/>
Won you in the cruellest of ways imaginable!</p><p>  But for a moment, a mere moment, you pluck up this unspeaking courage and go right over to me, almost uncaring for any who sees... and knowing full well on the consequence it would truly bring as you wrap your shaking arms around my neck, and whisper;<br/>
“I know it wasn’t you, Draco! I know! I just wish...” you say to me, your beautiful, affectionate voice broken with your unmistakable softened cry.  “I will always love you!”<br/>
“And I you, Hermione,” I reply just as quietly, before he, Ronald Weasley, takes you ‘tenderly’ by the elbow and pulls you away.</p><p>  But I saw that tightened grip he had, I saw the flinching within your beautiful brown eyes... and his menacing blue... you know what is to come when you are alone with him...<br/>
Why can no-one else see?</p><p>  Because he had managed to find a way to get his way... because he couldn’t bear to be within someone else’s shadow... a footnote to history... why else would...?<br/>
Yet... there he is, ‘gently’ hauling you away from ‘the criminal’ who was forced to witness him capture you, out of blackmail... as well as jealousy.</p><p>  Jealousy that I had wasn’t the purest that I was portraying to be... that I do have a certain open-mind toward those who come in from having Muggle parentage... if they deserve it.  You and I had come off on the wrong foot... I know I was once a jerk... but... well... things have a way of changing now don’t they?</p><p>  He was jealous on how his ‘best friend’ was starting to see me in a different light... as well as a few other Slytherins; one in particular, who also started off as a complete arsehole – and he will admit to that and regret that, but he knew he was forgiven for that, many times over.</p><p>  But, <em>nnnooo</em>, Ronald Weasley couldn’t have that!<br/>
I could see the quiet anger from his sister, Ginny; she was also forced into silence...<br/>
Their parents... how are they so blind to him?<br/>
Ginny gives me the slightest of sympathetic looks, as we both witness Ronald Weasley taking you, my wonderful and dearest Hermione, into the awaiting car.<br/>
I know I saw the fear within you...<br/>
I know he is going to hurt you...<br/>
I wish I could stop it...<br/>
I wish... I wish...</p><p>  My heart was breaking; like I know yours would be, too, seeing the car pull away from the curb and...<br/>
The feel of my hands clenching into fists; oh how I wanted this whole thing to be nothing more than a bad dream.<br/>
Many people were hurting... all because of the shit that went down... and I was the one they decided to pin it on!<br/>
Yet... why was I invited to this wedding?<br/>
There had been many confused faces on this, I had seen them.<br/>
I peer back at Ginny; I could see that she will do her best to protect Hermione whenever able.</p><p>  In the meantime, I am being transported back to my home, a simple little house Severus had found for me when I chose to step away from the lifestyle I had once been accustomed to.  I was to be housebound for the next few days, being the conditions of my sentence.</p><p>  They couldn’t prove that I had done it... but they wanted someone guilty and punished... and since I was able to ‘escape’ the cells of Azkaban Prison, thanks to the help of certain helpful character witnesses, who have been doing all they could to testify in my favour... but they still wanted...</p><p>  <em><strong>I DID NOT KILL HARRY POTTER GOD DAMMIT!</strong></em></p><p>  I wanted to yell it to the roof tops!<br/>
But all I could do right now was slump into my armchair, with a spirit glass in hand with straight bourbon, not bothering about the ice.<br/>
I could only think of what he was doing to you right now, Hermione...<br/>
I am so... so sorry...</p>
