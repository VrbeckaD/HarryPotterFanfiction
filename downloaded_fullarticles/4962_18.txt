</div><p>He strolls into the playground, scanning the equipment and empty spaces for his target.</p><p>Giggles from a little hollow off to his right.</p><p>He sniffs the air—<em>sweat, arousal, adrenaline, cider</em>—rolls his eyes, grumbles, "Teenagers."</p><p>Wades deeper into the park, eyes and nose peeled.</p><p>A metal-on-metal squeak from the left.</p><p>The smell of countryside, big dog, and bloody-fuckin'-magic.</p><p>He sighs, tucks his nose into his scarf, slouches in that direction.</p><p>A scrawny someone with curly, mostly-dark hair sits on one of the swings, head tilted back to admire the orange light reflecting off the clouds, maybe?</p><p>He shrugs internally, walks up, parks his arse on the next swing.</p><p>"Lovely night, int it?" says Diarmad.</p><p>"If you're planning on catching your death." He snorts. "I <strong>can't</strong> be that lucky."</p><p>"It's not going to be the Scottish weather which kills me, I think."</p><p>He digs out his packet of fags from his jacket, shakes one free, pats his pocket.</p><p>The <strong>rest</strong> of his pockets.</p><p>"Got a light?" he asks.</p><p>"Those things'll kill you."</p><p>"<strong>You</strong> can't be that lucky."</p><p>Diarmad snorts, snaps his fingers.</p><p>The end of the fag sparks, ignites.</p><p>"Thanks." He fills his lungs, then breathes out pure slow. "Why'm I here?"</p><p>"That's rather philosophical of—"</p><p>"Save it. Why'd you want to see me?"</p><p>Diarmad pushes off, sets his swing swinging. "I've coaxed a research budget from Thomas and I'm thinking of using it on treatments for werewolves."</p><p>Another drag, then, "You think war's coming and he'll be using pups as weapons again."</p><p>"I do," sighs Diarmad. "I suspect you do, as well."</p><p>"Yea, it's in the air, alright."</p><p>Diarmad grunts, pushes his swing higher.</p><p>"I can't help you fight."</p><p>"I know."</p><p>"I won't help Them."</p><p>"I know."</p><p>"You won't be pulling Cherish into this."</p><p>"Wouldn't dream of it."</p><p>"And none of you'll be <strong>fighting</strong> here, aye?"</p><p>"I'm not <strong>nearly</strong> mad enough to anger the mighty Laird of Glasgow."</p><p>"Yea, he's a right cunt when you step on his toes." He smiles. "Messes up the polish. Pisses him off."</p><p>Diarmad snorts a laugh.</p><p>"Wouldn't be so bad if he could afford servants, but the job doesn't pay what it used to." He takes in the last of the smoke, blows it out. "'course, nothing does in this economy."</p><p>"Excellent point, Mister Paterson—"</p><p>"Not anymore. It's time for a change." He drops the end of his fag on the gravel, grinds it underfoot, picks it up, palms it. "I'll answer to 'Donald Douglas' for the next while."</p><p>"Well then, Mister Douglas, I'm pleased to meet you. Again."</p><p>"Wish I could say the same to you, Mister Fairbairn."</p><p>Diarmad pouts. "I'm not your best friend? Not even <strong>a</strong> friend?"</p><p>"Since when can your kind and mine be friends?"</p><p>"Since you trusted me with your daughter's education?"</p><p>"I trusted Gowdie and Kinnaird, not <strong>you</strong>."</p><p>"And yet Cherish told me I was her favourite teacher."</p><p>He snorts. "I told her to practice lying on you."</p><p>Diarmad digs in his heels, drags himself to a stop. "You taught your daughter to <strong>lie</strong>?"</p><p>"She's gonna be a politician of sorts someday. Figured it'd be a useful skill t'have."</p><p>Diarmad laughs.</p><p>He smiles.</p><p>"Hopefully she won't be taking office for a very, <strong>very</strong> long time. I'd miss my friend the Laird dearly."</p><p>He toes the stones. "Well, I suppose a man's gotta take what friends he can."</p><p>"Present company, for example."</p><p>"Yea, exactly like that."</p>
