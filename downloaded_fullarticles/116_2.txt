    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p align="justify">
  <span>First thing that I'll say is that I do not own My Hero Academia, it's storyline, or any of the characters. It all belongs to Horikoshi. The Only Character I own is my OCs.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Next thing is that even though this is an ABO fic some things I’m not going to be using while others will be slightly different. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>In the progressive hero society it plays a part but it’s not as serious as it could so they don’t let it dictate everything. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Male Omegas and Alpha Females are intersex.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>All females no matter their secondary are able to get pregnant. All Omegas whether they are male or female are able to get pregnant but Omegas can only get pregnant during their heats.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Omegas have heats that can happen every two to six months apart. Having a heat every two or three months occurs more with female omegas. Males tend to have heats every three to six months. Unless they have taken heat suppressants which mess with an Omegas heat cycle. Males only produce slick when in heat until they are marked and mated completing the mating bond. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Alphas have ruts once a year after they present.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Everyone has scent glands that give each person their own personal scent on their necks and wrists. Alphas tend to smell spicy or strong scents. Betas tend to have mild scents that are like rain or forest scents. Omegas have sweet scents.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Every person technically goes through two types of puberty. There is normal puberty for your primary gender except for omega females. They then have it where they present and adjust for their secondary gender. Which means that Alpha and Beta females have monthly periods but Female Omegas only have periods after heats.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>A person can present anywhere from 13-17 years old. Most people present by 15 years old. Their instincts from presenting can fully mature anywhere from 17-20 years of age depending on when they presented.</span>
</p><p dir="ltr" align="justify">
  <span>Anyone can mark anyone. Omegas can mark omegas and alphas can mark alphas. But the act of marking is very serious. To Mark a person as their mate both of them have to bite into one of the scent glands on the other. Most of the time they chose the scent glands on the neck but they can bite the glands on the wrist if they want.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Getting marked accidentally is more likely for young people who’s instincts aren’t mature. </span>
  <span>They are also more likely to be because an Omega was in heat nearby.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Marks can get removed but that is very dangerous for the person with the mark to break the bonding. And Alpha or Beta who marks an Omega gets a power boost mainly to their quirk.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>There are three common bonds that naturally occur. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Familial bonds with blood or those with extremely emotionally close to. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Friendship bonds occur and grow with people you interact with and connect through friendship with. The stronger the friendship the stronger the bond. </span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Potential mate bonds are when instincts tell us they are a potential love. Potential mate bonds can start as that or have to become that from friendship bonds depending on a person's sexuality.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Friendship bonds can turn into Familial bonds and Potential mate bonds depending on the people involved.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Fated mates are rare, even rarer than soulmates. Fated mates bonds usually start out as potential mate bonds but don’t have too. Fated mates feel a pull towards their fated mate or mates. Though most don’t realize their fated mates till their instincts push them to further their relationship either by making them want to enter a romantic relationship with them or go to the next step with them.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>Soulmates can be your fated mate but most of the time they're not. Soulmates are just a person or people who help bring out the best in you once you meet. Every person who has a soulmate has their own unique mark that they will recognize as their own once they see it on their soulmates body.</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>It is very rare but possible to have more than one soulmate and even rarer to have more than one fated mate. But the most soulmates a person can have is four. The most fated mates a person can have is two</span>
</p><p align="justify">
  <span>80% of people have quirks, 10% are quirkless, 6.5% are witches and wizards, 3% are squibs, .5% have magical blood and have quirk (means they can be a squib and have a quirk or have magic and have a quirk). 50% have soulmates. </span>
