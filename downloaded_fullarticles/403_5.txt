    <p>
  <span>Harry Potter still felt his hands tingling with adrenaline rushing through his whole body after the-thankfully- last confrontation with Voldermort. That beast had killed his parents leaving him orphan at a tender age of one.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry was luckily adopted by his godfathers Sirius Black and Remus Lupin Black instead of being sent to live with his muggle relatives as Dumbledore had suggested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry was informed when he enrolled in Hogwarts that Voldermort was out to kill him to establish his supremacy-deluded by some prophecy claiming that a boy i.e. Harry will threaten his position as an alpha among the wizarding kind. Well, Harry sure would have been happy worrying about his assignments and tests but  Voldermort set the prophecy into motion leading Harry to act as predicted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He moved towards the dimly lit corridor. The last confrontation with Voldermort had been, a bit anticlimactic as the light side had invaded the headquarter i.e. Malfoy Manor and taking the death eaters by surprise had been their stroke of genius.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry was relieved that his family was safe, Remus and Sirius had looked at him proudly hiding their worry, the Weasleys looked at him with sombre faces which soon turned smiling as Harry had faked a smile their way masking the hollow feeling in his chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He moved on the hardwood floor, his steps echoing in the otherwise silent manor. The building seemed haunted with candles illuminating only the vicinity leaving him to rely on Lumos.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> He passed several empty rooms and finally reached the ballroom door. He had felt cut apart as the mission laid upon him from his childhood had finally come to fruition. Harry wanted his solitude as he didn't feel fit for any company for which he had taken the task to survey the east side of the Manor alone, surely no one would underestimate the Saviour now after he had vanquished the dark.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As an Alpha Harry had always felt the emotions in full force. His relation with his family had always run deep- Sirius's broom training, Remus's study lessons or even the weekly dinner making-making him not ashamed to recognise when he had exhausted his mental self and needed a break. Remus and Sirius were always there whenever Harry felt like sharing his fears and insecurities but now he needed a bit of solitude to digest that he had killed an Alpha who was after his life from his birth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry moved deeper into the wing and heard grunting sounds. His hackles rose and he moved with careful steps towards the voice, his wand poised to attack. He found a bearded man with brown hair hanging lankly from his shoulders pounding against a door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>'Thought I would be left in peace but even unintentionally Voldermort's minions are after my peace.' </span>
  </em>
  <span>Harry thought as he swiftly stupified the alpha but realised that the room he was standing before had drifted open.</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>Harry stood stock still as his nostrils flared.' </span><em><span>Omega</span></em><span>. </span><em><span>Heat</span></em><span>.</span><em><span>Claim. Mate. Now!!' </span></em><span>Harry was assaulted by a</span> <span>citrusy smell which he instinctively recognised as an omega's. His alpha side was overpowering his rationality as he took a further step towards the room.</span></p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His lust evaporated as the stench of rusty blood reached his nostrils.</span>
  <em>
    <span>' Omega. Hurt. Protect. Defend. Help.' Harry's</span>
  </em>
  <span> thought coincided with his alpha side as he saw blood trailing swiftly towards a white carpet decorated in mid of the room which he had stepped in unconsciously while the alpha recognised everything by smell.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Expecto Patronum", Harry's patronus burst from his wand, looking at him expectantly." Get Madam Pomfrey here. No alphas allowed." Harry appreciated that some healers made up the fighting battalion but the ensuing smell of an omega in heat was increasing as the door was fully opened.' </span>
  <em>
    <span>Must have been here for not only their heat but even before that. Bound here?'</span>
  </em>
  <span> Harry felt disgusted by Voldermort for one more thing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He tried to enter the room further but his instincts would run into overdrive so he stepped out and cast some wards around the wing to protect the omega from any feral alpha. If his alpha purred proudly to have protected an omega he didn't pay any mind to it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>'</span>
  <em>
    <span> Why was this death eater trying to forcibly enter the omega's room? What has happened to this omega? He is bleeding but I can't do more than this.' H</span>
  </em>
  <span>arry felt worry claw at his heart for the unknown omega. He knew that the omega wasn't forcefully mated as their smell was just omega. He was intrigued by how an omega had managed to stay hidden in the confrontation that took place a few minutes back.'</span>
  <em>
    <span> God, it has been just minutes. Seems like a century. I finally did it, killed that bastard. Would that make me a killer or a saviour?'</span>
  </em>
</p><p>Harry was interrupted in his downward spiral by Madam Pomfrey's beta scent rushing towards him. "Harry!! What happened dear?" Harry turned his head towards the room and nodded grimly. Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips but moved hurriedly.</p><p>
  <span>Harry relaxed his stance and felt silly for going into an offensive stance even when Madam Pomfrey entered.'</span>
  <em>
    <span> Stupid alpha hormones.'</span>
  </em>
