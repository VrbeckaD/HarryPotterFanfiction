  <span>Prologue</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Weasley family had a secret. One they tried to keep hidden one only a handful of people knew and many of them now gone or locked up. Everyone knew that Molly Weasley had twin brothers who were younger then her and had died at the hands of Death Eaters. What most people didn't know or didn't seem to remember was that Molly also had a baby sister. Adelaide (Addie) Prewett was Years younger than Molly. By the time Addie stared school Molly was already a mother and expecting her second child.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the people who did remember the youngest Prewett sibling hardly any of them knew that she'd had a child at the tender age of sixteen. And even less knew that the father of said child was Sirius Black. Yes you could call that a secret a deep dark Weasley secret a sister who was a teen mother. A sister who had a baby by a man who was now a convicted murderer But that's not where the tale stops. No it goes deeper it goes farther. For that Child born to Sirius Black and Addie Prewett wasn't just any child, No the child born to Sirius and Addie was actually Percival Weasley. The boy most of the wizarding world believed to be the third Weasley boy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Molly Weasley had taken her sister's child into her house raising him as her own to the outside world. As her sister and Sirius completed their last two years of schooling. Oh Addie and Sirius had both been as involved in Percy's life as much as they could. During school breaks during the summer. And when they graduated Hogwarts a few months before Percy turned two there was even a discussion of Percy going to live with them. Molly had just given birth to twin boys and the Barrow was getting crowded but the war was getting closer and Addie and Sirius along with their friends were in the center of it. Not to mention that as a Black Percy would be used as a pawn. So he stayed with the Weasley's and more people died by the day taking the secret of the Weasley's and the Prewett's with them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Addie and Sirius still visited their little son as did Sirius's friends James and Lily Potter and Later their little daughter Eleanor Molly gave birth to another son and life seemed to go on. But soon the world got to dark. Voldemort was to strong and families hide or ran for their lives. Oh visit's were still given but they were shorter and farther between. Molly gave birth to a daughter in the hot sticky day's of August just a week before Percy turned five</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Soon after Percy's fifth birthday the world crumbled around the Weasley family. As In Mid-September Molly's twin Brother's lost their lives at the hands of Death Eaters and then that fateful October night happened. And everyone knows that James and Lily Died and that Eleanor. That Sirius Black gave up his best friends and went after Peter Pettigrew killing him along with a street full of Muggles but again many people forget that there was another person at the house that night. Young Addie Black fell along James Potter on the steps of Godric Hollow trying to give Lily time to save Eleanor. Three adults died that night one baby somehow survived and secrets were buried even farther in life of the Weasley's.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Percy knew his history his siblings for that's what they were even if not by blood they knew his history even young Ron and Ginny but no one talked about it. That is until the night Sirius Black broke out of Azkaban just before Percy started his seventh year.</span>
