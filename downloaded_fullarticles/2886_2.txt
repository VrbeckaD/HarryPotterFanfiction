    <p>
  <span>Remus Lupin was a creature of habit. It felt near impossible to be anything else when the moon pulled at his bones month after month, and when he found such comfort in the routines he could control. He sunk into the same worn, leather chair of the Ravenclaw common room every night with books he knew by heart, spines cracked at his favorite parts; he took the same labyrinthine trek to the Great Hall each morning to admire the sun shining over the Forbidden Forest’s treetops; he took his tea with too much cream and one sugar and refused to leave the Great Hall without having finished every drop. He supposed he could be accused of being boring, with the same little things he did each day, but he found a semblance of normal in them when his whole life felt very much abnormal. He rather liked his habits, and was hard-pressed to find something else he liked so much. They were within his control when everything else felt very much out of it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That wasn’t to say he liked </span>
  <em>
    <span>all </span>
  </em>
  <span>of his habits - Kingsley certainly complained enough about some of them - but it was part of the routine and so Remus didn’t worry about them too much. He could tolerate humming off-key while he got ready in the morning, or running his fingers over old scars when he was thinking, drawing more attention to them than he’d have liked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>One habit that he desperately wished he could shake, however, was how often he caught himself staring at Sirius Black.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It hadn’t begun on purpose. Remus was adamant on that point, but somewhere along the line he sunk deep into the habit and couldn’t let it go. Sirius Black wasn’t like anyone Remus knew, and to say he knew the boy was a far reach. They weren’t friends, let alone acquaintances, but Sirius made sure everyone at Hogwarts knew who he was, and Remus followed his trajectory involuntarily.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The boy was reckless and loud, and altogether too mischievous for anyone’s good. Trouble seemed to follow him wherever he went and he welcomed it like an old friend, like it was as good a companion to him as the two boys he spent all of his time with. He laughed easily and with frequency, and he basked in attention in a way that Remus could never do. He was the complete opposite of Remus in every way that he could see, but he couldn’t ignore him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus was in his third year when it started, when Sirius was assigned as his partner in class and Professor Flitwick tasked them with the Cheering Charm. The wizard had warned them against heavy-handedness before pairing them off, an obvious attempt at separating Housemates and friends who would otherwise clump together and goof off. Remus had been nervous, approaching Sirius where he sat at the back of the room, and envious that Kingsley was paired with Lily Evans, who would undoubtedly perform the charm perfectly.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As it turned out, Remus had cause to worry. Delight gleamed in Sirius’ eyes and before Remus could register the jabbing motion of Sirius’ wand, he was bent over with laughter, everything suddenly much funnier than it had been just seconds ago. The professor’s combed over hair, Dirk Cresswell’s too-tight robes, the obscene-looking flowers on Flitwick’s desk that reminded Remus of an anatomy lesson… he could hardly catch his breath.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was only when Professor Flitwick escorted him from the room that Remus realized what Sirius had done, and the absurdity of it made him giggle that much harder. Later, once Madam Pomfrey looked him over and administered a Calming Draught, he wondered if anyone Sirius had partnered with was destined to such a fate, or if it had been something special about him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>From that moment on, he was hyper aware of the boy in hallways and classrooms, weary of him should Remus prove an easy target for future pranks. It began as a form as self preservation, and lasted all throughout third year. It was good that he’d started keeping tabs on the Gryffindor, he told himself, as he was able to avoid many of the Ravenclaw-centric pranks the Marauders pulled. He’d even managed to avoid partnering with him in class, always trading seats or pulling whatever sympathy his teachers had for him to pair with someone else. He refused to be victim to mischief again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And then Remus went home for summer hols and mostly forgot about Sirius and the trouble he caused. He had other things to preoccupy his mind, like his father’s most recent lead on a cure for his lycanthropy (which, unsurprisingly, was a dead end), and his mother’s insistence that they plant a garden in the backyard. Two full moons in the underground cellar left him weak and hurt, anyways, so he barely left the house in the weeks that followed transformations. Thus, he was completely unprepared when he returned from the holidays only to find that Sirius was taller than last he’d seen him, his jawline more defined than he remembered, and his silver eyes absolutely captivating. Something about the way Sirius smirked at him in the Entrance Hall twisted Remus’ stomach in knots, similar yet entirely different than the anxiety he’d felt before, and alarm bells rung. He told himself it had to do with post-traumatic stress, thinking back on a fit of uncontrollable laughter, and then quickly looked away. It didn’t occur to him to feel strange about the whole thing until he caught himself staring quite absent-mindedly a few weeks later, tracing the lines of Sirius’ fingers as he tapped them against a table in class. Sirius caught his eye and smirked, and the feeling came rushing back.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That kept happening, again and again. Remus learned to hide it better, to feign innocence if Sirius ever caught him staring. He asked himself </span>
  <em>
    <span>why</span>
  </em>
  <span> on more than one occasion, but was too afraid of the honesty in an answer and so he stopped asking, only pausing long enough to wonder if it was normal for a fourteen year old boy to pay so much attention to another fourteen year old boy. He was quite sure it wasn’t, which only terrified him further.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>If Kingsley ever noticed during that year, he didn’t let on, and for that Remus was grateful.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But then fifth year passed much of the same way in that regard, Remus obviously pining but refusing to admit to it, and Kingsley dutifully playing dumb. Remus never admitted it outloud, but he knew Kingsley had an idea about his feelings. He’d caught him in the act too many times to count and never judged Remus for it, or demanded an explanation, or made him feel strange. And, Kingsley had already proven himself more than capable of keeping a secret. If Remus ever mustered up the courage to admit how he felt when he looked at Sirius Black, Kingsley would go to his grave with the secret.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus hoped that when fifth year ended, OWLs complete and granted freedom for the summer, something would change over the holiday as it had when he was fourteen. He hoped that he’d meet a cute girl and forget about the boy at school who didn’t even know his name. He hoped he’d feel normal for once, like the other boys his age, and he could return to Hogwarts with the habit broken.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But, he didn’t meet a cute girl. He couldn’t forget the boy who didn’t even know his name, and he certainly didn’t feel normal, not after a painful full moon or dreams about inky black hair and silver eyes and mischief. He returned to Kings Cross Station and searched for Sirius on Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, like he was testing himself, and hated the way his heart sped up at the sight of him. He’d failed. And then, much like that same night two years prior, Sirius caught his eye and smirked before pulling himself onto the Hogwarts Express after his friends, and Remus knew one thing to be true.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was, as Kingsley would say, absolutely fucked.</span>
