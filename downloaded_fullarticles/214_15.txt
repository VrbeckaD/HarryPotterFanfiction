  <strong>POV Gwaine</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Here I am!</p><p>Again!</p><p>But this life seems to be a vacation. No one has tried to kill me yet, no strange supernatural things have happened. Not natural disasters, genetic diseases with a craving for human flesh, no gods or ninjas. Just me, Gwaine Shepherd, a normal human high school student. Well… normal. I somehow already knew that the time to relax was over, and honestly, I was fine with that. I simply wasn’t built for a slow, normal, boring life, no I was built for adrenalin, for adventure and near-death experiences. And even the seventeen years of constant peace hadn´t toned done my war-honed instincts in the slightest. I was a warrior. I knew how dangerous letting your guard down, even for a second, could be. How fast a life could be snuffed out. As soon as I was able to walk, I trained myself. I wanted to be prepared when this life throws me the curve ball. I started running, martial arts, no matter the form, and continued my training with every kind of weapon. Still, to this day I sleep with a knife within reach, I never go out without one either. That was a given, considering what lives I had already led. The last one had left quite a mark on me…zombies, fucking hell, those buggers really were a handful. So, it´s only natural that I quickly scan every room before I enter, or exit, and that I watch out for windows and doors. I always have a plan for a quick exit, nothing escapes my notice. I keep my movements deliberate and never make much noise.  </p><p>Anyway, today was my cousin´s birthday. Everyone was making a big deal out of it, especially because my cousin, Charlotte is supposed to have this very seldom genetic defect, which makes her oh so special. And this gene is said to activate on her sixteenth birthday. Therefore, my lovely aunt was even more doting towards Charlotte than ever.</p><p>Why does my family in every damn life need to be full of strange people?</p><p>I was living with my mom, my brother, my grandma, my cousin and my aunt and our butler in this huge mansion in the city. I love my grandma Maddie, she is a bit strange, and everyone thinks she’s crazy, but that’s right up my alley. What is a bit wacky in comparison to myself? Never mind that I am suspecting, that she isn´t half as crazy as she portrays herself. She often talked about a secret organisation full of obsessed people watching out for time travellers. If you believed her, Charlotte was about to be part of this organisation, well as soon as she started to time travel. I doubted her, but only a tiny bit, because why not? Why don’t we do time traveling for this life? It´s not if I hadn´t done something like it already, back then so many years ago. It certainly would not be out of the ordinary, compared to zombies, ninjas, resurrected goddesses, half gods, basilisks, dragons, kings and wizards. I was looking forward to it. The Master of Death was ready for anything one could throw at him. And if I was ever in a pinch, the Deathly Hollows had never left me, had fused with me, were so much a part of me like my left pinkie.</p><p>Right now is was leaning on the wall in our entrance hall. I had found the perfect spot to observe everyone coming and going. Years and years of living and waiting had made me patient, had made me enjoy people watching and perfect this mastery. Honestly, it was a mystery to me why great aunt Persephone didn´t know her man was cheating on her, or why uncle Bert thought he could hide his love for crossdressing or why Clary wouldn´t just tell everyone she was in love with women. Oh the blackmail material was growing every second. Insert maniacal laughter. In this moment Gideon de Villiers entered. He was Charlotte’s lover and according to Maddie part of the shady organisation. He stopped in the entrance hall and looked around, obviously searching for the birthday girl, I decided to have some fun and detached myself form the wall. Gideon seemed to have noticed me as well, because he halted his searching and stared at me, while I made my way to him.</p><p>“Hello, it´s nice to meet you. I am Gwaine, you are here for Charlotte´s birthday I presume.” He smiled, his face turning slightly red, and shook my outstretched hand.</p><p> “Yes, I am Gideon. Nice to meet you as well, Gwaine.”</p><p> I was taller than Gideon, so he had to tilt his head up a bit to look in my eyes. Eyes that stayed the same in any life, avada-kedavra green. Thank the goddess I also was male in each live...don´t want to imagine being stuck in a woman´s body. Gideon was smaller and slimmer than me. His brown hair was pulled back in a small pony tail, a strand falling over his eyes. Without thinking much about it, I leaned closer and stroked the strand of his face and behind his ear. His face grew even redder and he seemed unable to form any kind of sentence, just staring down at his feet.</p><p>Cute!</p>
