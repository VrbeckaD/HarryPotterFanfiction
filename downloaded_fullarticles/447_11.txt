    <p align="justify">"Why do I have to be here?" Severus Snape demanded, sounding as harsh as the words he uttered. His mentor, saviour, employee, or whatever you want to call Albus Dumbledore, was looking at him with disappointed eyes. Snape scowled even harder before following in obedience, his footsteps thumping against the ground harder than he intended to.</p><p align="justify">"It is a peculiar incident, Severus," Dumbledore turned to look at the orphanage that loomed over them, "Finding out why little Ophelia was placed in an orphanage and to introduce her gently into the wizarding world."</p><p align="justify">"I still don't understand why <em>I</em> have to be here," Snape grumbled. He followed Dumbledore into the building, noting how every single part of the yard in this place was systematically trimmed in a precise manner and there were no scattered toys or soil. All the flowers were plotted perfectly and every single colour from the plants complemented one another in ways that almost seemed magical. The windows were shining clean and the curtains were drawn, Snape found it both disturbing and pleasant.</p><p align="justify">"Hm, the term, I believe, is moral support?" Dumbledore chuckled softly. They arrived at the orphanage front door and Severus felt a sense of apprehension wash over his senses. His lips pressed into a thin line, Snape allowed his gaze to sweep over the yard one last time before turning towards the door in which Dumbledore had just knocked on. It took only a manner of seconds before the door swung opened to reveal a young lady with bright red hair and dark blue eyes.</p><p align="justify">"Hello? May I be of help, gentlemen?" the lady asked, her smile bright and easy. Dumbledore gave her a soft smile, "Ah, yes. I believe we have an appointment set up with Isabelle Vance about a child named Ophelia Potter?"</p><p align="justify">Snape watched as the lady's smile dimmed ever so slightly at the mention of Potter's name. Intrigued, Snape also noticed the slightest bit of tremble in her frame that came after. The lady nodded, "Yes. Ophelia, about that special school names Hogs-something, right?"</p><p align="justify">"Indeed," Dumbledore nodded. He moved slightly, "My apologies. My name is Albus Dumbledore and this man here is a professor at the school, Severus Snape."</p><p align="justify">"Ah," the lady faltered a little bit. She smiled once more, "Please follow me."</p><p align="justify">Both of them followed after her, the door shutting behind them courtesy of Snape. He glanced around, refraining a sneer on his lips as the inside of the house was even cleaner than the outside. It was almost unclean with how freakishly clean this entire place was or maybe he was just in a complain mood today. Snape spared no second glances to the heads peeking out curiously at the door frame far to his left nor did he speak another word, even as Dumbledore was conversing casually with their guide. </p><p align="justify">Three knocks on the wooden door right down the hallways, Snape shifted his robes slightly. He turned around and spotted a little girl standing by the bookshelf, staring at him with wide eyes. Snape gave her a look before turning away, unsure whether he wanted to deal with <em>more</em> children than usual. The lady waited for a few seconds after knocking before she spoke.</p><p align="justify">"Madam Isabella? Ophelia's anonymous school representatives are here to see you," the Lady said. Oh, Snape still didn't know her name. <em>Pity</em>. He tapped his feet softly against the ground, feeling more impatient as the seconds wasted away with each waiting moment.</p><p align="justify">"Let them in, Serenity."</p><p align="justify">"Very well."</p><p align="justify">The door was pushed open and they were welcomed into an office unlike what Snape was familiar to. There was a large oak table settled in the middle of the room, shelves stuck to the walls and large couches placed right before the table. On the table, there was a name <em>Isabella R. Vance</em> written boldly in black. Snape turned his gaze to the woman occupying the seat on the other side of the table and blinked. It was a woman who looked somewhat similar to McGonagall, except with frightening blue eyes and short hair.</p><p align="justify">"Welcome," she greeted, "I'm sure you've realised by now but courtesy sakes, I am Isabella Vance. It is a pleasure to meet the anonymous sponsors of young Ophelia's further education. But I must say, we have a lot to talk about."</p><p align="justify"><em>Oh no</em>, she was one of <em>those</em> people. Snape already found this visit several times more annoying, especially with the judgemental way the lady was eyeing them. This was why he didn't like <em>visiting</em> the muggle world, for whatever reasons he may be. It was also why he was possibly the only professor who doesn't attend to muggleborn wizarding world introductions.</p><p align="justify">"Of course," Dumbledore responded for both of them once again, taking a seat on one of the couches. Snape grimaced before doing the same, careful on where he was sitting on even if the couch was spare of any speck of dust. Silence reigned the room for a while before Vance decided to speak once again.</p><p align="justify">"If you might, which one of you would be Professor Dumbledore and which would be Professor Snape?" Vance asked, eyes flickering between the two of them with something just shy of contempt glinting in her sharp gaze. Snape sneered slightly at her look before allowing Dumbledore (as always, in these sort of situation) to speak.</p><p align="justify">"I would be Albus Dumbledore and my collogue here would be Professor Severus Snape."</p><p align="justify">"And what do you teach?" Vance asked, looking at Snape. He withheld his tongue and replied as blandly as possible, "Chemistry."</p><p align="justify">"Interesting." Vance turned away, "Please tell me further on exactly what your school does and how Ophelia's name was apparently marked down for your school. Furthermore, you are not the first of schools to approach her for a scholarship and hence, I would like for you to further elaborate on exactly why your school would be a better choice compared to the others. You see, your school is almost anonymous in terms of recognition and it wouldn't do for a child of this place to go through substandard education."</p><p align="justify">Snape could feel a headache coming a mile away. Dumbledore smiled and placed the folder filled with blank papers, the one they had gotten just minutes before, and pushed them towards Vance. "Here, I'm sure these would provide you with the necessary materials."</p><p align="justify">Vance eyed him before opening the file, she seemed to stare at it in some sort of trance before blinking. She closed the file and pushed it back, "That seems to be in order. Do you have any further questions?"</p><p align="justify">"What is the girl like?" Snape asked, unable to help himself. Vance sighed, "She's perfect, for the lack of a better term. She doesn't throw tempers nor does she cause problems, she gets along swimmingly with the teachers and her grades are always perfect. Her attendances are spotless but... well, she doesn't quite interact well with other people, not even adults."</p><p align="justify">"And what do you mean by that?" Dumbledore asked softly. Vance sighed even more before replying, "Well, see, Ophelia here is a genius. But she's quiet and the other children? They don't really like genius and quiet, don't quite understand her. And of course, there is a case of Ophelia being the most returned orphan in this place. Seven families have adopted her, all of them returning her within matters of a week. They won't give a valid reason beyond 'decided that they're incapable of raising a child'. And the other children, well, they're scared of her, I suppose."</p><p align="justify">"So, she's a bully?" Snape demanded, feeling a sense of triumph for some reason.</p><p align="justify">"Oh no," Vance denied immediately, "Far from it. Ophelia would just sit there and take whatever they throw at her but..." Vance's voice lowered into a whisper, "But sometimes, I think it's no coincidence that the ones who would bully her. They face some sort of problems in a weeks' time."</p><p align="justify">"Problems?" Dumbledore's alarmed tone triggered alert in Snape himself.</p><p align="justify">"Well, two years ago there was an orphan here named Elijah Wood," Vance began her tale, her hands playing with the pen within her grasp, "Elijah Wood was twelve when he arrived, his parents passed away and he had no one to take him in. Elijah was one of the rare children who were in the orphanage not due to abandonment or such. He liked to brag about his... materialistic items and he particularly liked to pick on Ophelia."</p><p align="justify">"And?"</p><p align="justify">"Well, we weren't quite sure. In the beginning, we assumed he was pulling her pigtails. Picking on the girl he likes, he doesn't really do it to any other girls see. He focused a lot on Ophelia, making fun of her reading choices or calling her childish names. We told him off but nothing really seemed to change until one day, we had a beach trip and Ophelia was pushed into the water and got her books wet. We weren't sure but it was quite obvious that Elijah had done it... and then, a week later, Elijah Wood was found dead in his bed. He passed away in his sleep and— well Well, it was an unfortunate event."</p><p align="justify">Snape felt his blood run cold because if he was reading the underlying words right then no doubt, Vance believed Potter had <em>murdered</em> someone, someone who died without evidence of being killed. Even with all the suspicions trained on her, no one had the proof she had done it. This was not what he had expected when he thought about problems, he had perhaps thought of Potter turning the boy's hair permanently blue or maybe even dumping a bucket of water over the boy but <em>murder?</em></p><p align="justify">"My condolences. I'm afraid we must make haste and speak with Ophelia."</p><p align="justify">"Oh, yes, of course." Vance stood up, "Follow me, gentlemen."</p><p align="justify">They were led out of the room and up the stairs, right down the hall to their right. Snape remembered the route slightly, from gazing at the windows. There should be seven rooms on one side of the hall, not surprised by the amount. They stopped at the door labelled <em>12</em> in gold before Vance knocked on the door three times. "Ophelia, you have some guest who will speak with you."</p><p align="justify">"Ophelia has a guest?" someone demanded rudely. Snape turned and saw it was a boy with freckles and brown hair. "Who would want to visit <em>her</em>?"</p><p align="justify">"William," Vance said sharply, "Mind your tongue."</p><p align="justify">"But Madam! It's Ophelia, she's a <em>freak</em>," William insisted. Snape turned away, not wanting to show how the word freak brought back nasty memories at the back of his mind. Vance scowled, "We do not call other people <em>freaks</em>, William. Go back to your room, no desserts for tonight."</p><p align="justify">"...Yes, Madam."</p><p align="justify">The room door number 12 was unlocked and a girl stood there with a smile on her face. "Yes?"</p><p align="justify">"Ophelia, these two gentlemen will speak with you now. If there's anything, I'll be down in my office," Vance said. With a sharp 'Have a nice morning', Vance was gone from the hall and left to her office, assumably. Ophelia Potter stared at them before gesturing for them to enter, "Please. You may come in, don't stand there on my account."</p><p align="justify">"Don't mind if I do," Dumbledore smiled jovially before stepping in. The second Snape stepped foot in the room, he felt like a weight came crashing down on his entire frame. The air was tense because the entire room was saturated in magic, magic so thick that you're unable to identify its nature. Potter looked at them, taking a seat on the bed with a smile.</p><p align="justify">"How may I be of help?" she asked, still having an innocent smile washed over her face. Dumbledore smiled, "Hello. My name is Albus Dumbledore and we come from a very special school."</p><p align="justify">If the magic was tense just now, now it was downright suffocating; almost enough for it to feel as if Snape was choking on it. Something in the air was both magical and deadly, yet Potter kept her innocent smile and soft words. She tapped her bed twice for some reason, maybe a quirk but Snape wasn't quite sure he should brush it off. In a distance, he could've sworn he heard soft hissing noises like you would during a meeting with the Dark Lord.</p><p align="justify">"A special school?" she intoned. Dumbledore nodded, "That's right, <em>special</em>. A magic school."</p><p align="justify">Potter blinked, "Magic?"</p><p align="justify">"Have you done anything strange that you couldn't explain? Weird things that happen around you when you're happy or angry?" Dumbledore asked quietly. Potter stared at him with something in her eyes that Snape couldn't quite decipher, then she spoke and he felt his blood run cold again. "Sometimes... the snakes would come. I can speak to them, understand them, and they would whisper things to me, softly..."</p><p align="justify">"Ah," Dumbledore was still smiling despite the internal terror Snape felt, "That is a magical gift. The language of the snakes, <em>parseltongue</em>."</p><p align="justify">"Anything else?" Snape demanded. Green eyes snapped towards him, for eyes that should look identical to Lily's, this green eyes reminded him of the cold, icy dark times during the war when flashes of green would exchange on both sides with knowing consequences. Potter tapped her bed twice again and Snape felt the foreboding feeling once more.</p><p align="justify">"When I'm really angry," Potter tested her words, or so it seemed, "The lights would explode. The televisions would stop working and the electricity goes out for hours at times. They never did explain why and thought it was wiring problems but it always happens, no matter how many times they have the wiring replaced." Somehow, Snape <em>knew</em> that if Potter was truly angry, it wouldn't be as mild as electricity going out or lights exploding. Snape's eyes darted down to her hands for some odd reason, noting how she wore cotton, white gloves that were plain and that they were folded neatly on her lap.</p><p align="justify"><em>He was wrong</em>.</p><p align="justify">"But professors," Potter spoke once more, her eyes locking with Snape's. For a while there, he could feel subtle jabs against his mental barriers like a child's innocent touch at something new. Terrorised by either his own internal paranoia or an ingrained instinct born due to the war, Snape forcibly ensured his occlumency barriers were wounded tighter than ever; It wasn't much different from when he lied to the Dark Lord, and what does that say about this situation?</p><p align="justify">"You told me you came from a school of magic and yet, you've done nothing to tell me more about it?" her head tilted to the side ever so lightly and Snape could hear the air thicken as the seconds ticked by. Dumbledore took a seat on one of the chairs lined up neatly against the wall, he gestured for Snape (who really didn't want to touch <em>anything</em> in this room) to do the same. Reluctantly, he took a seat and steadily tried to ignore the prickling feeling at the back of his mind.</p><p align="justify">"Very well, Miss Potter," Dumbledore reached into his robes and pulled out a thick, yellow envelop. The familiar crest of Hogwarts and the smell inked around the very magic that surrounded the envelope served to give Snape some sort of reprieve. He watched carefully as Potter reached her cloaked fingers and accepted the letter, for some reason that felt to Snape as if they had just handed a prey on a silver platter to its predator.</p><p align="justify">Potter seemed to open the envelope slowly, her eyes skimmed the contents of the parchment really quickly (ironically, he was linking her reading methods with someone he most certainly did not want to see the connection between) before setting it down. A smile made its appearance once more onto her lips, "Fascinating. I assume there is a whole world out there about magic but I must apologise, I do not have the money to pay for this unless Hogwarts have some sort of... scholarship program?"</p><p align="justify">"I'm pleased to say that your parents left their assets for you to utilise, Ms Potter," Dumbledore informed her. Again, the suffocating magic filled the air in some sort of choking manner before it was gone as quickly as it came. Snape watched warrily as Potter seemed to <em>come to live</em>, for the lack of a better term, before him with her green eyes seemingly lighten up and her lips dropping the smile (oddly enough). Potter looked at Dumbledore, "What happened to my parents?"</p><p align="justify">Snape felt his heart constrict at her question, his mind already throwing back into the fond memories he held tightly in his heart all the while his entire conscience was drowning in guilt. His lips curled into a sneer, not wishing to show any form of weakness in front of Potter, especially right now. Dumbledore, seemingly aged a few more years, sagged in grief and told her nicely.</p><p align="justify">"First, Miss Potter, you must know that not all wizard or witch turns out good," Dumbledore began. Snape stood at the side and listened as Dumbledore told the story of a wizard, <em>the Dark Lord</em>, who went bad, as bad as he could. He could hear the sadness, guilt, and pain in Dumbledore's voice as the tale went on about how the Dark Lord rose in power. The raids that happened, the unnecessary murders which occurred, the deaths of so many families, and then finally— </p><p align="justify">"And then, the night of Halloween in 1981," Dumbledore sat back. "Voldemort (Snape had to suppress a flinch at the name) came to your parents' house. He killed your parents and then he tried to kill you but for some reason, he was unable to. Something happened that night, something that vanquished Voldemort leaving behind nothing but the wreckage of his home, the destruction of the Potter Family, and of course —  the scar on your head."</p><p align="justify">Potter stared at them, then she closed her eyes. When she opened them again, Snape didn't bother hiding the flinch he gave. Her eyes, so similar to Lily's, were cold and calculating. Snape knew enough people to see the beginning of a <em>plot</em> being developed right before his eyes and yet he wasn't quite sure what exactly the plot was. Snape truly didn't know which was worse, the idea that there was a plot going on or the fact that he wasn't quite sure if the plot was what Dumbledore would've expected it to be.</p><p align="justify">"Voldemort, he's dead, I'm assuming?" Potter demanded.</p><p align="justify">"Yes," Snape replied. Because as many theories going behind the supposed death of the Dark Lord, an entire decade of dormant activity should be enough to ensure the death of the Dark Lord. Potter snapped her eyes to him and nodded. The smile curved onto her lips once again and she stood up, "Would I have a guide? Do I have a home to return to or must I further endure staying in an orphanage?"</p><p align="justify">"Ah, regarding that. I must say, I came here with a question in mind, Miss Potter," Dumbledore smiled. Potter tilted her head slightly, waiting for the question to be asked. Dumbledore nodded to himself before the next words flooded out smoothly like water down a clean pipe. "The Dursleys, do you know them?"</p><p align="justify">The air grew tensed once again. She gave Dumbledore a suspicious look, "I do. Do <em>you</em> know them?"</p><p align="justify">"I believe I was the one who placed you in their custody. Might I be informed as to how you came under the residence of this orphanage?" Dumbledore asked. Potter stared at him before her eyes shifted towards Snape then she sneered. "When I was six, my... accidents became wild. According to the <em>Dursleys</em>, I was too <em>chaotic</em> for them to raise around the sanctuary for their beloved and angelic child. So, one morning they decided to drive me up to the orphanage and dumped me here."</p><p align="justify">She paused, staring at Dumbledore with a look on her face that Snape wasn't quite sure what to think of. "I will never return to them. You can't make me."</p><p align="justify">"Miss Potter, the Dursleys have a protection ward—" Dumbledore's words were cut off by the harsh tone of Potter. Her smile was gone, replaced by a sneer worthy of <em>something</em>. "Whatever protection ward would've failed. I have no need for it, years spend here in this Orphanage. If there are no other places for me to reside, then the orphanage will be where <em>I stay</em>."</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore jerked back. Then, he nodded. "Very well, Miss Potter. Tomorrow, Professor Snape will be taking you to Diagon Alley to grab your school supplies."</p><p align="justify">"There's no need," Potter denied. "Is there a map I could use? I would prefer to do things at my own pace."</p><p align="justify">Snape was inclined to agree, who would've thought that?</p><p align="justify">"Very well."<u></u></p>
