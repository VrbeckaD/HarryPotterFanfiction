          <div class="userstuff"><p>Lavender watched Bruce as he slept, her heart squeezing as she stared at him. He looked completely at rest while he slept - like there wasn’t a worry in the world. </p><p>However, every moment as he woke up, she could see the change in him. The stress was apparent. </p><p>Lavender knew that he was hiding something from her, but in the past few months they had been dating, she couldn’t figure out what. </p><p>He stirred in his sleep, rolling over to face her. Letting out a quiet sigh, Lavender scooted closer to him. She smiled when he reached out to wrap his arms around her when she pressed up against him.</p><p>“You okay?” he murmured quietly, letting her know that he saw her awake.</p><p>“Mhmmm,” Lavender said quietly. She looked up into his worried gaze. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“Mmmm,” he responded, pressing a kiss to the top of her head.</p><p>“Are you really?” Lavender pressed. “Because you don’t seem like yourself lately.”</p><p>Bruce opened his eyes once more. “I can’t get anything past you, can I?”</p><p>“Nope,” Lavender said, cracking a smile. “You know I’m quite the observant witch.”</p><p>“I know,” Bruce said, frowning. “Something’s been on my mind.”</p><p>“Well, what is it?” Lavender pressed. She reached up and stroked his cheek tenderly. “You can tell me anything, Bruce.”</p><p>“I don’t want to burden you with my past,” Bruce told her. </p><p>“I know you’re hiding some of yourself away from me, Bruce.” Lavender frowned. </p><p>“You don’t know the half of it,” Bruce muttered under his breath, but her wolf senses helped her hear it.</p><p>“If this relationship is going to work, you need to be open with me.”</p><p>“It’s three o’clock in the morning, Lav, can’t we have this conversation later?” Bruce suggested, nuzzling her neck.</p><p>“Why? So you can dodge my questions again?” Lavender asked.</p><p>“I’ll give you a brief version now, and I’ll explain the rest in the morning over breakfast. Is that okay with you?” Bruce looked at her and she saw just how tired he was.</p><p>“That’s fine,” Lavender said. “Bruce, it’s not that I don’t trust you, I just worry.” She kissed him lightly.  “I’m so open with you, and yet you aren’t with me… I just… I worry our relationship is one-sided, especially when I’m falling in lo-” She abruptly shut her mouth. </p><p>Bruce nuzzled her neck once more, pressing a kiss to the sensitive spot beneath her ear. “Lavender, I trust you, completely. I’ve kept secrets because I don’t want to hurt you, or scare you.”</p><p>“Bruce, I’m a werewolf, I don’t think anything could scare me away,” she interjected, raising her brows at him.</p><p>He cracked a smile before frowning. “The truth is, Lavender, that I’m a coward. I turned my back on my friends and co-workers, leaving them when they needed me. I’m hiding a side of me that I can’t control, and it scares me.” He looked dejected as he admitted the words out loud to her. </p><p>“First of all, I very much doubt your a coward,” Lavender said, looking him in the eye. “You’re a scientist, Bruce, and I know everything you do is made with intense consideration. And I can’t imagine you being out of control with anything you do, so again, I think you have a good reason for hiding a part of yourself away. But, I don’t want you to think you have to hide yourself with me.” She paused. “I’ll love and accept you no matter what, Bruce… Trust me when I say that.”</p><p>“I do now,” Bruce told her quietly. He kissed her temple. “Does that satisfy your curiosity?”</p><p>“For now,” Lavender told him. “But I want the full story in the morning.”</p><p>“Deal,” Bruce said quietly. “I’m sorry for trying to hide it from you. I know secrets aren’t good for relationships.”</p><p>“They’re not, but I trust your reasoning.” Lavender turned and kissed him on the lips gently. “Let’s get some sleep, okay?”</p><p>Bruce nodded, pulling her against him tightly. They held onto each other, both drifting back to sleep knowing that the morning would be the truth to life.</p></div>
