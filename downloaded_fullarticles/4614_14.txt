    <p>The pregnancy test clattered from Severus' hands to the floor.  Severus didn't expect to see a positive response so soon after Harry had only knotted him during sex once.</p><p>Severus didn't like to admit he was shy during sex when he had been in heat, but he certainly didn't ask for it like Harry probably wanted him to.  Not that he didn't enjoy it, but the smothering nature didn't appeal to him that much.</p><p>"Are you okay?"  Got annoying rather quickly.</p><p>It was then that Severus understood why Harry, his husband and caregiver, loved and cherished him.  Omegas were only seen for baby carriers in society, but Harry wanted Severus to be treated well all the other times.</p><p>Harry had refused to give Severus any sort of omega altering device after their binding to change who the boy was, and Severus appreciated that.  Especially when he had to sit himself down over the tile floor, leaning back against the wall as he cried.</p><p>He didn't know why he did it, but Severus just shook as he looked around the bathroom much bigger than one he'd ever gotten.  It was even all his, making him feel spoiled rotten he could even be blessed with a child.</p><p>"Severus?"  Harry knocked on Severus' bathroom door, "I made some dinner, if you're hungry.  If not, you can stay in there.  You've been in there for awhile, so I hope you get better soon."</p><p>Before Harry's footsteps got too distant away, Severus creaked open the door, getting up and coming out with the test.  "You've gotten me pregnant."  He gave a nervous smile, hoping it would be acceptable.</p><p>Severus could hear his father gagging over the idea of 'the ugliest kid I've ever seen' getting pregnant, causing hesitation in coming closer to Harry.  "It could be wrong, I mean..."</p><p>"I hope it isn't," Harry retorted quickly, coming up before Severus, and holding him close in a tight hug.  "Merlin, I love you."  He backed away, smiling and looking around, "I can't believe this!  Are you excited to have a family?  Can't believe I ever got you, and now I'm getting more!"  Harry dropped to his knees, acting like Severus showed any, "I hope it's twins.  A boy and a girl.  What do you think?  Twins are pretty mischievous, but I think we can handle it."</p><p>"Harry, please, I'm very overwhelmed right now."  Severus let Harry grab the pregnancy test, despite flinching at Harry wanting to keep it around any longer.</p><p>"Don't be.  This is going to be the greatest time of your life.  I'll make sure of it."  Harry pulled Severus' robes up, kissing up his thighs towards one of his favorite places.<br/>-<br/>Severus laid back against the bed, naked besides his underwear, relieved Harry finally disposed of the test after talking to his friends excitedly.  He didn't like Harry's friends, but he didn't really mind their presence because Severus got most of the attention.</p><p>Especially now that he was pregnant.</p><p>Harry came over in a robe, letting it mostly hang open for Severus' hungry gaze.  "I was that good at it, huh?"  Harry laughed at Severus' slightly moody expression, "I'm kidding, but really, who could've thought you'd take to a kid that well?"</p><p>"The Prince family is very easily impregnated."  Severus recalled seeing many family pictures or paintings of relatives with full bellies almost without pause.  His mother had been the odd one with only one child, but Muggle men didn't really count in an omega getting pregnant situation.</p><p>"I hope you're having a litter," Harry sighed, imagining it very clearly by the dreamy look on his face.</p><p>Severus blushed, glaring slightly when Harry laid down beside him, "Don't call it that.  It's very demeaning."  His eyes narrowed slightly, "Stop watching omega pornography.  That must be where you get it."</p><p>"Come off it, I don't do that anymore.  I have my own pregnant omega now."  Harry leaned in, brushing Severus' hair aside to check over the bites he left possessively over Severus' pale neck, to make sure they were all there.  "I love you."</p><p>"I do, too," Severus tried, embarrassed at being cuddled to Harry's strong chest.  He almost wanted to demand Harry squeeze him, then hold him down to take him harshly.</p><p>Harry scoffed, licking along Severus' ear, "Don't cheat your way out of saying you love me.  It makes me think you don't."</p><p>"Don't put me on the spot, Harry," snapped Severus, noticing Harry's anger melted when Severus crossed his arms across his chest.  "What?"</p><p>"Is it me, or are you throwing around strong hormones right now?"  Harry wondered, pulling Severus' arms out and down to his sides.  "Merlin, you smell like..."</p><p>Severus wondered what he possibly could do as a pregnant omega, gasping when Harry straddled him, pressing his hard cock against his thigh.  "Harry, would you take me?"</p><p>Harry's eyes darkened, his hands moving to hold Severus' wrists up by his head.  He leaned down to kiss Severus roughly.  "I could."  He avoided laying over Severus' stomach, but still had the dominating stance.  "I could also make you beg for it."</p><p>"I would love that," Severus spoke softly, thrusting up slightly.</p><p>"More than you love me?"  Harry teased, grinding against Severus.</p><p>"No.  I certainly love you more than that," Severus breathed, kissing Harry eagerly as their erections slid together under their fabrics.</p><p>They got into the rhythm, until Severus gave a startled gasp at a thunderbolt striking down in the sky nearby.  Harry's cock was so close to his ass, but he shrunk down into the bed.</p><p>Harry laid himself down by Severus, stroking over Severus' hair and stomach with his hands.  "It's okay, baby," Harry spoke, using his magic to darken the room by only having the candles lit.  "There.  Now it'll be more soothing."</p><p>"Harry, how can you deal with me?"  Severus mumbled into a pillow, moving to his side so Harry could more than eagerly spoon into him.</p><p>"What was that?"  Harry asked directly into Severus' ear, enjoying the shiver.</p><p>Shaking his head to symbolize he gave up wondering the question, Severus let Harry slowly drift off beside him.  </p><p>Both hands were wrapped around Severus' stomach protectively, making him blush at the testosterone Harry exerted to make Severus feel protected from even a thunderstorm that brewed.</p><p>Severus felt like an incredibly lucky omega, and was sure his future children would be safe in the house that spoiled them just as much.</p>
