    <p>The door jingled when Draco walked in.</p>
<p>Despite his expectations of being immediately mauled by a handsy Harry Potter, Draco was instead met by a small, sunny waiting room, decorated tastefully in tropical greens. To soothe, Draco supposed, but still, he was surprised by the lack of Gryffindor colours.</p>
<p>A receptionist sat neat the door, sorting through files.</p>
<p>Draco had to clear his throat to get her attention.</p>
<p>"You must be Draco Malfoy," she said glancing up at him. She knew the answer, of course, Draco could see the recognition in her eyes. Not to mention that she'd have to have been living under a rock to not know his face or name after the war. Merlin knew it had been slandered in every paper printed since then.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said anyway, indulging her clueless act. "I have an appointment at noon."</p>
<p>She nodded and handed him a form.</p>
<p>"I just need you to sign this release form and I'll let Mr. Potter know you're here."</p>
<p>Draco glanced over the release, only half taking in the words before signing it.</p>
<p>He took a seat by the windows, relishing in the early summer sun as he waited. His hip ached from the pressure but his heart was drumming up such a beat, that for once he was distracted from it.</p>
<p>He wanted to be furious with himself for the obvious nerves but the last time he'd seen Harry Potter, it had been across a sea of faces that wanted to take away his freedom and punish him for a life that he hadn't even wanted. And the time before that was amidst the wreckage of war, grief and bodies everywhere, the time before that there was fire and suffocating fear, Potter's heart pounding against his chest, and before that—</p>
<p>"Draco."</p>
<p>Draco started, heart leaping into his throat as Potter strode into the room. He was the same overwhelming presence all at once, draped in simple white healer's robes. That brazen confidence oozed off of him in the way he walked, the way he said Draco as though that was normal and to be expected. His hair was still the untidy mop of jet black, dark enough to shine like cold metal. His iris' were still so bright that it looked unnatural; like a tropical plant had climbed into his head and come into bloom behind his eyes.</p>
<p>"Sorry to make you wait," he said.</p>
<p>Draco stood. He had to swallow before he could speak.</p>
<p>Still, he didn't trust his voice and only nodded.</p>
<p>Potter's lips pursed slightly and he turned, gesturing for Draco to follow him. Draco did, relieved that Potter wasn't facing him enough to catch his limp.</p>
<p>"We'll be in this room," he said, holding it open for Draco to enter ahead of him.</p>
<p>Draco did and had to dig his heels into the tiles to stop himself from turning tail and running.</p>
<p>He was sure the dim lights and soft music were intended to calm clients, but the bed rather ruined the effect for him.</p>
<p>Was he really planning on laying down on it and letting Potter, of all people, touch him?</p>
<p>How on earth had he allowed himself to be talked into this?</p>
<p>The door clicked shut behind him and Draco's shoulders tensed even more.</p>
<p>He turned slowly to look at Potter. The other man was watching him with an infuriating calmness. As though Draco was just any new client that he didn't know previously. Someone that he'd never fought with or flew with or—</p>
<p>"So what is you reason for coming here?" Potter asked and Draco bristled.</p>
<p>"You're a healer, aren't you?" Draco sneered. "Should be obvious I didn't just come for a chat. I need healing."</p>
<p>Potter stared at him, took a slow breath and nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes," he agreed. "I am a healer and I ask all of my clients that. Like you said, I assume you came here for a reason. You have something bothering you, or something difficult to heal that your average potion or spell isn't working for? Something you feel needs a more therapeutic touch?"</p>
<p>Draco's cheeks heated as Potter spoke and he swallowed down any and all snide comments that were aching to burst from his lips.</p>
<p>He was here for a reason and he had already come this far and, truth be told, he couldn't keep on like this. The pain was too much. It was interfering with his life.</p>
<p>"Why don't you have a seat and we can talk?" Potter suggested.</p>
<p>Draco perched uneasily on the edge of the bed and waited.</p>
<p>"So what does bring you here today?" Potter asked and this time he sounded genuinely curious.</p>
<p>Draco supposed Potter must know that only something big would bring him into this particular clinic.</p>
<p>"I've been having a few chronic issues," Draco finally mustered the nerve to say, choosing not to look at Potter as he did. "Sleep deprivation, tension..."</p>
<p>He wanted to add anxiety but it already felt like he was saying too much, putting too much on display.</p>
<p>"I'd like to get off the sleep potions." And calming draughts. And pain potions.</p>
<p>Potter nodded, like that would be no problem and Draco forced himself to go on.</p>
<p>"And a few months back," he added, attempting nonchalance, "I was in an accident... I received blunt force trauma to the right side of my body. Fractured the skull, collar bone, shoulder, hip."</p>
<p>Again, he wanted to add more and also suck the words right back in at the same time. He wanted to fix everything, he did, but... why Harry Potter? Why was he the only magic therapy healer willing to take Draco? Why was he the only one not to give him the run around? More importantly, why did he have to be the only one that Draco believed would keep all of this quiet?</p>
<p>Finally, he looked at Potter, who still hadn't responded.</p>
<p>He was frowning at Draco thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"I didn't hear about that."</p>
<p>Draco shrugged.</p>
<p>"It happened at home," he said. "We managed to keep it quiet."</p>
<p>"What kind of treatment did you undergo at St. Mungo's?" Potter asked.</p>
<p>"We had a private healer come to the house," Draco admitted. "I didn't want to be seen at the hospital."</p>
<p>Potter nodded his understanding and Draco went on.</p>
<p>"He did brackium emendo for the bone that could be repaired and skelegrow for what couldn't."</p>
<p>Potter winced.</p>
<p>"Both unpleasant, but normally without side effects if they're done and used properly. I take it you still have problems with the areas?"</p>
<p>Draco nodded.</p>
<p>"A lot of pain," he admitted. And moments of fogginess, disorientation, mood swings that he had no control over whatsoever, not that he had admitted that to anyone.</p>
<p>"May I?" Potter asked approaching him.</p>
<p>Draco felt like an animal caught in a trap as Potter neared.</p>
<p>He wanted to lash out as Potter reached for him but forced every muscle in him to remain still as the other man gently touched Draco's right temple.</p>
<p>Again, Draco's heart felt caught in his throat. Potter was too close, by far. Face frowned in concentration, eyes glued to the motion of his hand as it brushed, far too gently, the strands of his hair.</p>
<p>And then Draco felt it, as gentle as Potter's touch; magic, tickling his scalp and flowing deeper, to where, Draco didn't know.</p>
<p>His eyes fell shut. A soft shiver traveled his spine.</p>
<p>"I can definitely do something about this," Potter said gently and when Draco opened his eyes, he was embarrassed to see that Potter was watching him now, square in the face.</p>
<p>Draco's defenses rose so fast that it made his ears ring.</p>
<p>"We'll see," he said coldly.</p>
<p>Potter dropped his hand from Draco's hair and stepped back, lips pursed again and eyes unreadable.</p>
<p>"Alright, I'll go get my supplies," he said. "I'll need you to undress and lay face down on the table while I'm gone."</p>
<p>Draco's face heated and he spluttered in an entirely undignified way, raising to his feet.</p>
<p>"You expect me to lay here in the buff waiting for you?" he finally demanded. "With my arse in the air?"</p>
<p>His voice sounded too high for his liking but Potter's cheeks turned alarmingly red and he shook his head frantically.</p>
<p>"No, no, you can keep your pants on of you'd like," he said.</p>
<p>"Oh, well--"</p>
<p>"And I want you under the blanket."</p>
<p>They blinked at each other a few times in awkward silence while Draco attempted to wrap his mind around this.</p>
<p>"Draco, have you ever had a massage before?" Potter asked uneasily.</p>
<p>Draco frowned. Pansy use to sit behind him in the dorms and rub his shoulders sometimes, but somehow Draco didn't think that was what Potter was referring to. For someone to work in a job that required them to rub other people's bodies all day long, well, that sounded like a muggle thing, to say the least.</p>
<p>"No, Harry," he spat, emphasizing the name. "I haven't."</p>
<p>Potter's calm, professionalism finally broke, exposing the first trace of authentic emotion since Draco's arrival.</p>
<p>"Look," he growled.</p>
<p>His voice sent a spike of familiarity straight through Draco like a familiar lance.</p>
<p>"I know we have history."</p>
<p>Draco snorted.</p>
<p>"But you came here, to my clinic and I let you in and you're not going to make me regret it or treat you badly. You sure as hell are not going to make me treat you any differently than I do any of my other patients."</p>
<p>He took a step forward threateningly and Draco wondered whether he should ask if Potter physically intimidated all of his other clients too but just managed to keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p>"Now please, get undressed and lay down, Draco."</p>
<p>Draco swallowed and after a long, tense moment, he nodded.</p>
<p>"Not a problem," he said lightly.</p>
<p>Potter nodded and swiftly turned and left.</p>
<p>For a full minute, Draco tried to calm his racing heart. Deep breaths, he had been told multiple times, would help.</p>
<p>He tried and yet again found that little bit of advice to be absolute rubbish.</p>
<p>Hands shaking, Draco unclasped his robes and then his shirt, folding both neatly and placing them on the shelf provided. His trousers fell to his feet next and he realized he'd forgotten his shoes and socks on.</p>
<p>Draco bent down and struggled to take them off as quickly as possible with the threat of Potter walking in to find his nearly naked arse waving in the air.</p>
<p>Finally he got them free and kicked the remainder of his clothes off, sticking them haphazardly next to the rest of his belongings in case Potter walked in before he was ready.</p>
<p>He got under the blanket as though he was being chased and let out a sigh of relief once he was hidden.</p>
<p>This was ridiculous.</p>
<p>Draco was never self conscious of his body normally, but the idea of Potter seeing it in all its glory was nearly enough to make him start sweating.</p>
<p>There's no way Potter was going to look at him without picking him apart, bit by bit, like he always had.</p>
<p>There was a gentle knock on the door and Draco stiffened as he heard it creak open.</p>
<p>"Are you ready?" Potter asked.</p>
<p>Draco swallowed and steeled himself for the inevitable.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, voice muffled by the head rest.</p>
<p>He heard the tell tale signs of Potter's entrance, the soft clip of his shoes against the floor coming closer and then, nothing.</p>
<p>"About earlier," Potter said from above him, sounding calm again and regretful. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have acted like there was nothing between us. If you're more comfortable with me calling you Malfoy, then that's what I'll do."</p>
<p>Draco wanted to brush the comment off, act aloof and uncaring but something about being spread under his former rival, pretty much naked, made him mumble a simple 'thank you,' instead.</p>
<p>A moment later, a warm hand landed between Draco's shoulders, nearly making him jump out of his skin.</p>
<p>"You're not breathing," Potter said softly, pressing down gently on the spot. "Try to relax."</p>
<p>He didn't wait for Draco to do as he was told before continuing.</p>
<p>His hands moved, over the blankets, pressing deeply into Draco's muscles, fingers landing, Draco guessed by some sort of spell, directly into muscles he hadn't even known were tense to begin with.</p>
<p>When his hands moved to Draco's shoulders, his body gave in to Potter's request with no input from his mind whatsoever. It was impossible to not sink into the touch. His eyes practically rolled with pleasure and Draco almost wanted Pansy here if only so she could see what a real massage looked like.</p>
<p>Slowly, the sure grip shifted, first to the balls of Draco's shoulders where the pressure was almost too much to bare on his injury. Luckily, Potter only lingered there a moment before his hands moved again, lower this time, following on each side the ridge of his spine, muscles giving under the deep pressure.</p>
<p>Draco tried not to moan, but gods, how was it that Potter, the clumsy baboon who tripped his way into most of his good fortune, knew how to touch like this? With such precision and strength and intuition. Draco was forced to remember Potter in mid air, snitch in hand and had to concede that maybe coordination was the one place that Potter didn't lack for anything.</p>
<p>And then the moment of comfort slid away, along with the sheet sliding down his body, exposing him.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" Draco squeaked.</p>
<p>He tried to sit up but Potter held him back down with a gentle palm on the flat of his bare back.</p>
<p>"I wanted to check your hips," he said. "You said one received a big impact as well?"</p>
<p>Draco couldn't speak, too choked by the sensation of Potter's breath brushing his bare skin, his hand like a spark of electricity in the small of his back before it drifted away.</p>
<p>"The right one, right?" he asked and the sheet slid a little bit lower, that soft breeze blowing across his lower back.</p>
<p>"Its fine!" Draco finally managed to choke.</p>
<p>He swallowed, felt the way Potter's hands stilled where they were carefully folding the excess fabric and forced himself to go on.</p>
<p>"It's fine, my hip is fine," he said. He was quite aware that he was babbling, unwilling and unable to control it as long as he managed to stop Potter. Now. "It's just my shoulder. Actually, no, it's just my head, my head is sore. That's the only spot you need to touch."</p>
<p>There was a pause. A long moment of stillness in which the soft flute music that had seemed like background noise was suddenly blaring.</p>
<p>Finally and without any more being said, Potter slid the sheet back up, all the way to its previous place, across Draco's shoulders. </p>
<p>Draco could hear Potter's inhale and then the slow release of breath as his hands landed on the back of his neck as though there was no interruption.</p>
<p>Draco was relieved but there was no ignoring what had happened. His discomfort was higher than it had been since setting foot in this place. He regretted being here more than he could say. He felt like a fool. He felt weak. Surely his little limp wasn't that bad. Surely the pain wasn't really keeping him up at night...</p>
<p>"Breathe, Malfoy," Potter said softly. "If it helps, concentrate on matching mine."</p>
<p>Like Hell Draco was going to breathe with Potter. How did he convince anyone that this little naked act he was pulling was actually intended to help anyone? How, when it was all so intimate and nude and... and Draco felt it again like a refreshing tickle of cold water at the nape of his neck, cooling and relaxing and almost invigorating. Like a glass of fresh water, that's what Potter's magic was like. </p>
<p>He didn't know exactly what Potter was doing back there with his magic. His hands though, were gentle but firm, smoothing circles at the nape of Draco's neck, pushing at the base of his skull. </p>
<p>Then his fingers slid straight into Draco's hair and the touch, the soothing, incredible hands and magic, combined for the first time in months to give Draco absolute, painless, pleasurable, peace.</p>
<p>He didn't want Potter to stop, not when he could feel all of the pain leaving him like poison being siphoned. </p>
<p>He had to clench his hands to stop himself from shuddering with pleasure.</p>
<p>When Potter's voice came again, Draco was pretty sure he was on the verge of an out of body experience.</p>
<p>"Malfoy," he said gently from somewhere above. "Can you roll over onto your back?"</p>
<p>When Draco didn't move, his voice came again.</p>
<p>"Er, if you're comfortable..."</p>
<p>It took Draco another minute to realize he was being asked something. Blinking, he forced his body to move, despite how comfortable and near sleep he was.</p>
<p>Reality came back only briefly once he was on his back, staring up at the ceiling. Potter came into view above him.</p>
<p>"I'll just," he started, and then Draco's eyes were covered by a towel.</p>
<p>Potter's hands were back, this time on Draco's temples and without much prompting, Draco was back in his blissful state, more than happy to forget who was soothing him so completely as he fell asleep.</p>
<p>When Draco woke, it was to the sound of Potter's voice and a chill behind his ears where hands had just been. He already missed the sensation and in that  split second of sleep fogged consciousness, he almost said it out loud. </p>
<p>"We're all done for today," Potter was saying. "Whenever you're ready, you can get dressed and wait for me in the sitting room. I'd like to have a word with you."</p>
<p>And if that wasn't like getting doused in cold water, Draco didn't know what was.</p>
<p>He blinked, under the towel, fully awake and didn't move until he heard the door close.</p>
<p>Only once he was alone did Draco pull the towel from his face, assessing himself. His head felt good. Clearer than it had in ages. He hadn't felt so well rested, he was sure, since well before the accident. Since well before the war, in fact. </p>
<p>To get so relaxed that he managed to fall asleep not only without a potion's aid, but also while Harry bloody Potter was in the same room, not to mention, touching him...</p>
<p>If it were someone else, Draco would be forced to admit that he had some skill, but seeing as this was Harry Potter, Draco chose to reserve that judgment. After all, he needed to assess the effects over time, compare them to his previous disposition, weigh other factors in the results, etc.</p>
<p>He sat up and was hit with a moment of disorientation. A deep breath fixed it but his stomach still squirmed. How did he know Potter hadn't melted something in his brain? Gods, why hadn't he demanded to see his qualifications?</p>
<p>Squirming, Draco managed to dress himself, only vaguely aware that some of his nerves may have been influenced by the fact that now he had to talk to Potter again. Face him. Have words. Find suitable responses to whatever it was Potter wanted to "have a word" with him about. He could barely think straight after all that, what made Potter think he would be up for a discussion now? It was presumptuous and rude and really, Potter should have at least warned him what he wanted to discuss.</p>
<p>The sitting room was blindingly bright after the dimmed lighting of the massage room. </p>
<p>Draco eyed the door, wondering if he could make it through before Potter appeared again.</p>
<p>"Malfoy, how are you feeling?"</p>
<p>Silently cursing, Draco turned to face Potter as he emerged from a back room. His hair was sticking up particularly high in the back as though he'd been pulling it in frustration.</p>
<p>Catching Draco's gaze, he reached up self consciously, attempting to flatten it and only managing to make it worse.</p>
<p>He cleared his throat.</p>
<p>"I wanted to talk to you about your shoulder. It seemed like you had the most pain around here?" he asked, indicating on his own shoulder.</p>
<p>Frowning, Draco reached up, feeling the area gingerly and nodding.</p>
<p>Potter nodded thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"It's muscular, I'm sure," he said. "There are some strength building exercises I can show you before you leave."</p>
<p>Surprised, all Draco could do was watch as Potter walked him through a series of simple motions and explained where they would target.</p>
<p>"Just take it slow to begin with," Potter said. "It might be a bit painful at the start but over time it should help. I'll assess the damage more next time if you're comfortable letting me..."</p>
<p>Potter's cheeks turned a fascinating red as the question dangled in the air between them.</p>
<p>"Unless you're more comfortable going somewhere else, of course..."</p>
<p>Draco didn't bother informing him that no one else would take him.</p>
<p>"I'll see you next week," he said.</p>
<p>Potter's jaw dropped a little but he closed it quickly.</p>
<p>"Right. See you."</p>
<p>He didn't exactly look happy by the news but Draco didn't expect him to.</p>
