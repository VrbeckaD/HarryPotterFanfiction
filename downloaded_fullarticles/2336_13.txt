    <p>"It's been in everything" I heard a red-headed woman, Natasha Romanoff say.</p><p>"Who's been in everything?" I asked. The people in the room turned around and Natascha pulled out a gun pointing it at my head. "Who are you?" He asked slowly.</p><p>"Christina" Steve greeted and Natasha lowered her gun. "You know her?" She asked. "Why is she here?" " 'Cause Stevie here, said he needed help," I said smirking while Steve rolled his eyes.</p><p>"So what's wrong?" I asked. "Tony build an evil robot who was in our databank," Steve said. "He's in the files he's in the Internet" A Man clutching his arm with his hand who I knew as War Machine or James Rhodes said.</p><p>"What if he decides to access something a little more.. exciting?" He asked. "Nuclear Codes," I said.</p><p>James said something about making calls to make sure they are safe. "Nukes? He said he wanted us dead." Natasha commented. "He didn't say he wants us dead.... he said extended" Steve corrected.</p><p>"He also said he killed somebody," A man with dirty blond hair and Blue eyes said. I guess he is Hawkeye. "There wasn't anyone else in the building" Agent Hill mentioned.</p><p>"Yes, there was." Tony Stark answered. He pressed on his glass-phone-thingy and some orange lights appeared in the room. They seemed like they once used to look round but were now shattered into pieces.</p><p>"This is insane," Dr. Banner said while examing the orange blur. "JARVIS was the first line of defense," Steve said.</p><p>So, this must be JARVIS I thought and I Imagined how something like this could control the whole tower. As I listened to their Conversation again, I heard Banner say "... This wasn't strategy, this was..rage"</p><p>Thor came towards us with his hammer in hand, he grabbed Tony by his throat and lifted him up. "Woah Woah Woah Woah Woah, what's going around?" Clint asked.</p><p>"Come on use your words buddy" Tony chocked out. "I have more than enough words to describe you Stark" <br/>Thor said angrily. "Thor!" Steve called out. "The Legionnaire".</p><p>Thor put Tony back down ungently. "Trial went could about a hundred miles headed north," The god told the Team. "It has the scepter, now we have to retrieve it again" he added.</p><p>"Why is Starks Roboter trying to kill us anyway?" I asked. As said person glanced at me, I saw his face. "Oh, so you are the Strange neighbor" I added recognizing his face. He looked surprised but turned to his monitor again.</p><p>Then he started laughing and Banner shook his head. "What, you think this is funny?" Thor asked. "Or the had giggle water" I mumbled under my breath.</p><p>"No, it's probably not," Tony said looking around. "This is really terrible. Is it, it is, it's so terrible" he added laughing again. Thor and Tony started arguing and I rolled my eyes looking at Steve.</p><p>Banner made a comment and Tony also started arguing with him. Damnit, they're like pre-schoolers. Then Steve started his Captain America talk how the Avengers were made to be different from S.H.I.E.L.D. but Tony interrupted him anyway.</p><p>"Do you remember when I carried a Nuke through a wormhole?" He asked. "Nope," I said seriously while Rodey (James) sarcastically responded, "No, it's never come up, no."</p><p>"So do you recall that?" Tony said loudly while Natasha rolled her eyes and Steve looked on the verge of it. Tony continued talking about the battle of New York with the final words. "... We're the Avengers. We can blast up stuff all day but that up there is a new Legion. How do you plan on fighting them?"</p><p>"Together" Steve answered.</p><p>"We'll lose" Tony replied.</p><p>"Than we'll do that together too"</p>
