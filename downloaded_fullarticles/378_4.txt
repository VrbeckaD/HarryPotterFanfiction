    <p>The world was war as her head span and she felt the string of hexes hit her from behind. Screaming in pain she crippled to the floor, her arms shook violently from the surprise of a Crucio being fired in her direction. As quick as it started it ended and she felt someone grip her arm tightly and yank her, a flash of red hair filled her vision.<br/>

"Ginny?" She moaned, reaching to rub her temple she felt strong arms envelop her and hold her close. "Ginny," she breathed hugging the girl back. Lips met hers and they embraced gently, pulling back she looked worriedly into the others eyes - seeking reassurance.<br/>

"Hermione, you need to run. Hide even. Bellatrix is looking for you, and it isn't safe for you to be out here in the open," Ginny instructed to her, gripping her shoulders and hoping to reach some sort of agreement. There was none.<br/>

"No! I belong out here, I - we promised Harry we'd help him see it through the war and I'm not braking that promise," she snapped, appalled at the very idea of abandoning the battle no matter how terrifying it may be and no matter how much pain she felt.<br/>

"Hermione!" Ginny had screamed in anguish, her appearance showing her shock of being denied her partners safety "You have to! Please, just go to the the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey is there, she'll heal you, just please - leave!"<br/>

Hermione shook her head, leave it to the Weasleys to have the most stubborn attitude there is. "Ginny *we* fight together, *we* see it through together - *we*," she stressed the last word importantly.<br/>

"But '*Mione*-" they ducked as they dodged a green curse that flew overhead "Bellatrix is looking for you! You must run, find Harry at least," Ginny looked disbelievingly at her beloved as she again shook her head.<br/>

"Gin- we're fighting together, would you abandon post if I told you to?"<br/>

Ginny scrunched her eyes as she wrapped her arms around Hermione, throwing them to the ground. Hermione held her there, wishing the war would disappear so neither she or Ginny or anyone would have to go through this bloody war.<br/>

"Well 'looky here, what this I've found?" Bellatrix's cold raspy voice shook the two girls from their embrace "The *Mudblood* and her *Weasel*," smiling wickedly she pulled her wand from her sleeve and looked evilly from Ginny to Hermione.<br/>

"I've had plans for you Hermione... Plans indeed," she said silkily, a voice that sounded as though it belonged to a seductive young woman and not the crazy monster in front of them. "Should I kill your Weasley first perhaps?" She asked sweetly, pointing her wand at the red headed girl who's face stood brave.<br/>

"Stay away from her!" Hermione yelled standing up and in front of her.<br/>

"Oh brave one aren't you? A Gryffondor if ever I've seen one," she sneered, her eyes becoming slits as she looked down on them, "it'll make my use of moíra all the much better won't it Mudblood? Wonder what you'll be then?" She hissed venomously, jabbing her wand in Hermione's direction almost forgetting about Ginny in total.<br/>

”No! You can't use that! That spell is forbidden," Hermione cried, her face filled with shock and rage "It could corrupt the whole universe if pronounced incorrectly!"<br/>

"You act as if that'll stop me!" Bellatrix boomed, her wand waving menacingly in the air.<br/>

"Hermione! What is is? What is that spell?" Ginny begged, pulling relentlessly at Hermione's sweater, one she received from Molly as a late Christmas gift.
<br/>
Hermione didn't respond as she lay entranced by Bellatrix's wand movements. "Hermione? Hermione!" She cried, shaking the frizzy haired girl whilst trying to grab her attention.<br/>



"Moíra!"<br/>



Hermione began to shake uncontrollably as she faded from her normal self to transparent.<br/>

"Hermi-" Ginny never got to finish her sentence as Hermione disappeared completely from existence.
<br/>
"Hermione! What have you done? Where is she?" Ginny screamed, seething as she pulled her wand from the floor and aimed it at Bellatrix. "Bring her back!"<br/>

Bellatrix looked up, almost seeming surprised that her spell had worked. "I can't, she's fates problem now," a smile played her lip as she watched Ginny progress and understand everything that happened.<br/>

"Y-you fucking Bitch," Ginny couldn't find to speak these words with anger as she fell to her knees in turmoil.</p>
