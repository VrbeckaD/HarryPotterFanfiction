    <p>This is the story of Remus Lupin. The story begins when he was born Lupa Lupin. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     Hope Lupin was take to St. Mungo's Hospital. Lyall insisted it would be safer and faster. The birth of their daughter, that is. </p><p>When the flying objects and all the doctors - or rather, healers and medis - running around too fast, became too much for her, Hope closed her eyes until she was settled in a room. </p><p> </p><p>When Lupa Lupin was born, Hope was in tears. The new mother was dabbling between <em>Faith, Grace, Lupa </em>or<em> Rebecca</em>. She knew instantly that her baby was a, "Lupa." </p><p>"Dear, we've talked about this. The meaning of that name - Our last name is bad as is - Wolves aren't really a good sign, Hope - " </p><p>"Lupa. Lupin." The woman demanded. And so she got. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     Lupa was showered in muggle and wizard items growing up, growing accustomed to both and seeing no wrong in doing so, of course. </p><p> Lupa was often more fascinated with wizard items because muggle items seemed so basic - it was made a game for a little while between Hope and Lyall to see which toys would entertain her more. </p><p>Lyall didn't particularly encourage Lupa to demonstrate magical powers. When it came to magic it almost seemed as if he wantwd her to be a squib. Hope, however, highly encouraged it. </p><p> "Again!" </p><p><em>Giggle</em> </p><p>"Yes! Yes! Lupa! Again!" </p><p><em>Giggle</em> </p><p>Lyall stood in the doorway of his daughter's bedroom as egg yolk slimed down his face. Hope clapped and Lupa levitated another egg and hit her father with it. </p><p> "...Why are eggs even..." <em>Sigh</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Hope Lupin bought the witch her first broom. Lyall had taken the two out to Diagon alley when Lupa was almost two and Hope slipped away, using mad stoller skills and swerved Lupa into the Broom Shop. </p><p> Lyall was not impressed as Hope found him again with long lump in the bottom of the stroller with a blanket covering it. </p><p> </p><p>Lupa learned to read when she 5. Lyall insisted she spent plenty of hours reading during the day. So, the six years between learing to read and Hogwarts, Lupa was often found sitting quietly reading. </p><p>Lyall was giving her a mini school like lesson when she out of no where giggled, then asked for a glass of water. When he returned, Lupa was wearing the tie he had taken off earlier, giggling. </p><p> </p><p> "I'm papa, dysgu dysgu dysgu!" Lupa danced around her parents bedroom as her mother laughed from the bed. She wore her fathers clothes and a pair of his dress shoes. "Mwstas! Hud! Hud!"</p><p> They were soon stopped when Lyall walked in and then scooped Lupa up and tickled her with Hope. </p><p> </p><p> When Lupa turned eleven, she had something to say. </p><p>She just didn't know how to say it until... She just said it. </p><p>"I don't <em>want</em> to be a girl!" </p><p> Lyall and Hope were frozen for a while. </p><p>Lyall was first, "What do you mean." </p><p>"I..."</p><p>"Lupa?"</p><p>"...P-please don't call me that." </p><p> </p><p>They spent the next handful of hours talking, and talking, and talking. Maybe a tiny bit of crying. </p><p>They were all so wrapped up in their disscussion that they almost didn't notice the Hogwarts owl with a letter of acceptance with a name that was then declared a deadname. </p><p> </p><p> The summer before school was tough. Remus Lupin, formerly Lupa, was supported by both muggle technology and magic. </p><p>Lyall just about fainted when Remus told him his new name. </p><p>"Are you bloody-" Lyall had to sit down. </p><p>"I thought I'd honour mum by keeping the name meaning." Remus chuckles nervously. "I know how she liked the name Rebecca and well, Remus means, as well as Lupa, w-" </p><p>"I know what it means." Lyall sulkes. </p><p>"I think it's beautiful. Thank you sweeting." Hope smiles and kisses his head. </p><p>"Oh shush you." Lyall covers his eyes. </p><p>Hope laughs. Wrapping an arm around Remus's shoulders. </p><p>"We get whatever we want, we do! Us girls gotta stick together!" Hope's smile fell mostly when she turns to Remus again, Remus felt his stomach drop at the sight, "Er...sorry about that." </p><p>Remus just hugs her. </p><p>Puberty was hard. </p><p>Remus had started menstration shortly after the pervious christmas. </p><p>Not meaning to be too graphic, but one May night, Hope and Lyall were woken up by Remus screaming. They ran to his room and he was thrashing in his sleep, crying, clutching his stomach. When the parents help calm Remus, Hope noticed Remus had bled through his clothes and onto the bed sheet. Remus cried about that, clutching Lyall with all his might. </p><p> Remus didn't have any breasts really and he hoped it would stay that way. Hope still bought him a small binder incase Remus felt like it was necessary to wear it. </p><p>He was incredibly gateful. </p><p>Lyall taught him a few helpful spells as well. Transfiguring spells and voice change spells and hair growth spells. </p><p> The spells worked fine. The muggle technology however, failed Remus a bit. He would have to wait a year to start puberty suppression, and the cost for those...</p><p> But the magic worked fine. </p><p> (Once, Remus gave himself a full grown mustache and didn't know how to fix it until Lyall got home, Hope laughed the whole day. When Lyall came home he wouldn't reverse the mustache only changing the colour of it everytime Remus asked him to fix it, then laughing how he "did it right under your nose!" then would run away.) </p><p> </p><p> As the summer came to an end, Lyall remembered before them all, that Hogwarts had Remus listed as Lupa. So he spent two days straight trying to get them to correct that. </p><p>However, they said they could only fix it on the first day of school. Lyall went on to explain, "You are wizards and witches. Just fix it." </p><p>Soon, Lyall was at the fireplace, coat on and a hand full of floo powder in his hand saying, "I'll be right back, dears." </p><p> </p><p>And during the sorting ceremony a couple weeks later, the name the hat called out was, "Lupin, Remus!"      </p>
