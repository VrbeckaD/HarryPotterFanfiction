    <p>Harry glared down at his now green-dyed, sticky, glittery hands in mild distaste. He had no idea <em> why </em> Bernadette <em> insisted </em> he make this for her while she and her other father were out school shopping for her second year, but he supposed he had no room to complain. It kept the 12-year-old quiet and preoccupied while he did his job, after all… Although, it’s a wonder how <em> Draco </em> managed to make this stuff every three weeks for her.</p><p>The fireplace grew a bit behind him, a slight change in ambiance and the sound of 2 sets of feet tapping onto the hardwood floor, signaling that his husband and daughter were home.</p><p>“But daddy, that wand was perfect for me!”</p><p>“Bernie, we’ve been through this! You <em> have </em> a wand.”</p><p>Harry snorted as he heard her stamp her foot down indignantly, turning his head to see the dark-skinned, platinum blond, green-eyed angel he knew as his daughter, pouting and crossing her arms. Her cheeks were puffy as she held air in them and her brow was furrowed in mock-anger as she glared up at Draco.</p><p>“Aw, she gets that from you dear.”</p><p>“She absolutely does not get that from me, she gets it from you. You’re the hot-headed one.” Draco jabbed a finger in his direction, narrowing his gaze at him.</p><p>Harry gasped and put his hand against his chest immediately, feigning offense, “<em> Draco Lucius Malfoy </em> !” Harry stood up, hand still on his chest and mouth agape with his chest puffed out, “I thought you were my <em> husband </em> , Draco! Me? Hot-headed? <em> Never </em> in my life-” he gestured dramatically at everything around him, then at his husband, “-would I have imagined <em> you </em> of all people would have the <em> audacity </em> to call me hot-headed!”</p><p>Draco almost rolled his eyes so hard they went into the back of his head. “I cannot believe I married an idiot…” he put his head in one of his hands, rubbing his temples as a mischievous grin spread across Harry’s face. At this point, Bernadette was glaring up at Harry, appearing to be very unamused by her father's acting.</p><p>“Papa, this isn’t funny. Daddy won’t get me the wand I want.”</p><p>Harry’s smile faded and he looked at Draco, “You took her into Ollivander's?”</p><p>“She refused to leave until we went in there. That place is practically a candy shop for her, you know that. She gets her bloody stubbornness from you.”</p><p>He knelt down in front of her, “Bernie, you have a wand already. Why would you want to go in there?”</p><p>“I know, but… something about my wand feels weird. Like- it isn't the TRUE wand for me. Yeah, it likes me and all, but...” Her voice faded and her father kissed her forehead gingerly.</p><p>“It's alright, Bernie. I understand, no need to talk about it. How about we go browse some wands for Christmas instead? That way, if you change your mind and decide to keep your old wand, we won't have to get you a new one. That's long enough of a wait to figure it out right? Now come on, sweetheart… How about you pack your things so I can drop you off at Aunt Pansy’s? Daddy and I need to be at Hogwarts by tonight so we can start preparing our lessons for you and your classmates in a couple weeks.”</p><p>She ducked her head, shuffling her feet as she kept quiet and nodded, not wanting to argue with her father about it. As much as Bernadette loved Aunt Pansy, she wanted to spend more time with her parents before school started.</p><p>“If it makes you feel any better, she told your daddy and I that you’re allowed to bring Fluffy.” He said softly.</p><p>Her eyes immediately lit up at the thought of bringing her pet with her for her stay at Pansy’s and she nodded excitedly before rushing off, a spring in her step, giggling the whole way to her room.</p><p>“I will never understand yours and Bernadette’s relationship with that damn thing.”</p><p>“Fluffy’s her best friend, Draco… And a great conversationalist.”</p><p>The blond raised his eyebrows, crossing his arms as he eyed Harry with a questioning glint in his eye. “You actually have conversations with it? What about? Politics? Boys?”</p><p>“You wouldn’t understand. It’s a Parselmouth thing.” He waved his hand in dismissal and Draco gave a disgruntled huff. Amused, Harry walked over to where Draco still stood in front of the fireplace. He placed his hands on Draco’s elbows, coming in closer, “Hey, if you could speak the language of any animal in the entire world and it just so happened to be a snake, do you really think people would understand? I mean, snakes don’t even have lips, let alone mouths like ours or voices, so it’s not like they can make ‘real words’. It’s gonna sound weird to you since you can’t do it, but if you could, you would understand.”</p><p>“Why are we having this conversation, Potter?”</p><p>“Foreplay.” He hummed, a playful smile coming on his face. Draco rolled his eyes, pushing Harry's face away, pretending to be annoyed by the man. “I just wanna snog a bit.” Harry insisted and leaned in towards Draco again, who snorted as a smile finally twitched on his lips. Harry’s lips pressed against Draco’s, which were soft and smooth, and tasted vaguely of sugar. Draco, of course, gave back the gentlest kisses he could to Harry, who was grinning all the while, not allowing Draco to give a proper kiss that wasn't against his husband's teeth. Something felt… weird.</p><p>As Harry attempted to reach up and grab his hair, Draco took a step back when he saw the mischievous look in his husband’s eye and held him back with one hand, preventing him from getting another kiss.</p><p>“Oh, come on Draco- I just wanna get some kisses in before we have to drop Bernie off.”</p><p>“Bullshit, Potter. What are you-” before he finished his sentence, he was staring at Harry’s still glittery, goopy, green dyed hands. “... You didn’t.”</p><p>“I did.” He admitted as Draco quickly looked at his elbows and gasped.</p><p>“Harry, you bastard! This was a new shirt! And then you tried to touch my <em> hair </em>with your filthy goopy hands?!”</p><p>“Whoops.”</p><p>“You’re dead to me.”</p><p>“Aw, that’s the sweetest thing you’ve said since we were 4th years.” Harry cooed.</p><p>Before he knew it, Draco had slipped off the shirt and thrown it directly at his face, “Fix this while I go get a different one, you complete imbecile.” Draco snapped, voice dripping with venom. Turning on his heel, the blond stalked off to their bedroom, clearly fuming.</p><p>Harry sighed dreamily as watched him walk off. “What a jerk. Can’t even take a joke… I love him.”</p><p>Whilst Draco retrieved his other shirt, Harry took his wand to the poorly-made slime that now ‘stained’ the sleeves and removed them. By the time he returned, he’d even folded it and placed it on a chair and was now cleaning up his slime mess on the table.</p><p>Draco softened his gaze and sighed aloud, causing Harry to look up. “Sorry, hon.”</p><p>“‘s okay, Draco. I should have known better than to do that.”</p><p>“Yeah, but I shouldn’t have been so mean about it.”</p><p>“Well, you had every right to though. You thought I ruined your new shirt.”</p><p>Draco nodded, “Yeah, that was pretty dick-ish, but still. I should have been a little… kinder.”</p><p>Harry raised his brows at the word, “Draco Malfoy? Being kinder? A land loving muggle marrying a merperson that lives in the Mariana Trench is more likely.”</p><p>Draco reached down and slipped off one of his shoes. He was about ready to throw it at him, but refrained from doing so, because as he was about to, it clicked with him that Bernadette now stood in the entryway to the living room watching the two of them, a gigantic white and cream colored serpent draped over her shoulders and a trunk sitting beside her.</p><p>“I’m ready to go to Aunt Pansy’s.”</p><p>“Great! Lemme just finish cleaning this… You’ll have to ask her to help you make some slime this time, sweets. I failed absolutely horribly when trying to recreate yours and your daddy’s masterpieces.”</p><p>She grinned brightly at that and Draco chuckled, walking over and taking her hand, “Alright, let’s get you a snack before you have to leave then, darling.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Bernadette's arrival to the school was followed by most of her other classmates. Unfortunately, some of her friends weren't returning, but that's okay. Once she got her things all unpacked, including her massive anaconda's enclosure, her and the rest of the students all headed out with her.</p><p>“Ya know, Fluffy is essentially Slytherin's mascot by now.” A brunet with thick rectangle glasses, Andreas, pointed out casually, their tone amused. “He's practically spoiled by us all and he uses literally everyone as his personal heaters.”</p><p>She laughed, “Your snake does the same!”</p><p>“Yeah, but Tigerlily stays in her terrarium, and she's only a red-tailed boa. She's not <em> nearly </em> as big as your snake and she never tries to get out.” The older student countered, raising their eyebrow and crossing their arms.</p><p>“That's what you think.” Bernadette grinned.</p><p>“The girl who talks to snakes and has more snakes than other witches and wizards for friends knows my snake better than me? Should I even be surprised?” They snorted.</p><p>“There's gonna be more than just one girl who can talk to snakes this school year. I bet she's gonna be sorted into Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw, though.”</p><p>“You mean like one of the two houses <em> I </em> should have been sorted into?” As the group of students rounded the corner she laughed at their comment.</p><p>“I still don't understand why the sorting hat put you in our house!”</p><p>“I was told I have more ambition than any Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff its ever seen, and more of a leader than I would like to think.”</p><p>“Well, the hat got the leader part right, but ambition? You have less ambition than an uncooked Christmas goose dinner.”</p><p>“You're tellin’ me.” They crossed their arms, growing slightly bitter about their sorting.</p><p>Bernadette sighed and patted Andreas's shoulder in understanding.</p><p>“So who's this new student that can talk to snakes?”</p><p>“I'm not telling. It's like- outing her pretty much, and that's not really appropriate. It's her choice to reveal she's a Parselmouth, not mine to make for her.”</p><p>“True, true…”</p><p>“What's this about Parselmouths?” A Japanese boy came up from behind the two of them, which startled Andreas and caused them to jump a little.</p><p>“Hey Alex,” Bernadette said casually. “It's nothing really just someone being sorted into another house is gonna a Parselmouth like me.”</p><p>Finally, at the Great Hall, they went inside and all sat at their respective tables, still conversing.</p><p>“That's cool.” He hummed, “At least people aren't treating it like a dark trait anymore… ever since your father started casually speaking it and using it publicly here and junk, it just sort of became… Your father’s language, ya know? Like, it’s a gift in India, a blessing really. To be able to speak the same language as snakes and junk. There it’s the best thing a kid can be born with, but here it was so taboo and wrong for people...”</p><p>“Yeah.” Bernadette frowned.</p><p>“He fixed it for you. For everyone who would come after him. People around here aren’t going to see it as a symbol of darkness anymore because of him.”</p><p>“Yeah, I get that a lot about my dad…” She looked down at her hands. As much as she loved how much people loved her father, she heard the opposite about her other dad. Most of what she heard was negativity, cruel words, profanities and people discussing whether he should be trusted or not.</p><p>Then what she heard about herself was worse. So many arguments about whether or not she would turn out a good girl or some dark wizard, especially because she'd ended up in Slytherin like Draco.</p><p>“What about my other dad?” she quickly asked, visibly tense.</p><p>“Er… he's pretty cool too… Definitely cooler than my father.”</p><p>Cool. Right… Of course… Well, better than saying he's “scum” or something else.</p><p>She relaxed a bit and took a deep breath. The sorting would begin soon, and hoped that all the attention would be directed to the new students instead of her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There’s always a special feeling when arriving at Hogwarts, especially for students. Whether it’s the first time for someone, or it’s been many years since they were last there, they all have one thing in common, and it’s the excitement that’s rolling in their bellies, the butterflies ready to burst from them as they take their first step on school grounds. It’s a wonder how all the students, regardless of year, seem absolutely awestruck upon arrival.</p><p>Greeted and led to the great hall by Harry, the older students all sat in wait to see where their new peers would all be sorted. Minerva sat at the center of the long table that stood behind the hat, which sat on the stool where students would soon be sitting.</p><p>“Stand and wait along here, please, everyone.” Harry directed, gesturing to the spot between the house tables and the high table as the students all began grouping in front of him. “Now before we start, Professor McGonagall would like to say a few words to everyone.”</p><p>As the older witch stood up and gave the regular spiel about the forest and corridor the students weren't allowed to down, which Harry didn’t listen to of course. He’d heard it billions of times and it’s not like it really mattered to him anyway; he was a member of the staff.</p><p>He absently opened the parchment in his hands and spoke once she was finished speaking.</p><p>“When I read off your name, come forward. You will sit down and I’ll place the sorting hat on your head, then you’ll be sorted into your houses.” He said, lifting the hat off the stool as he spoke the first name. “Imperia Granger.”</p><p>A freckle-faced, dark-haired girl stepped forward, flashing a nervous smile to Harry as she had a seat on the stool. Hermione’s daughter had really glowed up since he last saw her, and her canines weren’t nearly as sharp as they had initially been. Perhaps she’d helped charm her teeth to look less threatening? He glanced over to where the Arithmancy professor sat, waiting anxiously for her daughter to be sorted.</p><p>The hat made a few comments, even complimenting her on something he couldn’t quite hear, then it finally shouted, “RAVENCLAW!” and the house’s table went berserk, cheering loudly.</p><p>A bright smile popped on her face and she bounced onto her feet, cheerily rushing to the table her house sat at, where an older student pulled her close and gave her a noogie.</p><p>“Azure Swete.” Two blond haired children, who seemed almost identical, looked between each other and the girl pouted before looking forward and stalking up with her nose held high. She daintily sat down on the stool and Harry placed the hat on her head. She took a lot longer than Imperia, but after a few moments the hat shouted, “SLYTHERIN!” and a smug grin came across her face as Harry removed the hat and walked to the Slytherin table, where everyone was waiting and cheering. Out of the corner of his eye, he watched Bernadette as roll her eyes and just smile at the new member of her house.</p><p>“Cerulean Star.”</p><p>The boy who Azure had pouted at, stepped forward and had a seat on the stool. Another “SLYTHERIN” only much more quickly this time. A grin spread across his face and he jumped up to run over to where the girl sat with the other Slytherins.</p><p>“Richard Lee.”</p><p>A cinnamon haired boy with pigtails nervously stepped forward and had a seat, his head down and staring at his hands. This time there were some conflicts between which house he would be in until the hat shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!” and everyone from the table screamed, a ginger-haired 3rd year being the loudest of all with the screaming, a big grin on his face. The new student stood, curtseyed in silence to Harry what he believed may have been a thank you, before turning away and walking to the table with his head low as he tried hiding his face.</p><p>Harry frowned. He’d talk to them later.</p><p>He turned to the paper in his hands, calling out the next student.</p><p>“Phoebe Fernandez.”</p><p>A curly haired girl with bangs walked forward. Her eyes were big and curious and she sat down. Harry lowered the hat onto her head and just as it barely touched her head it screamed.</p><p>
  <em> “OCTAVAL!” </em>
</p><p>The entire hall fell silent.</p>
