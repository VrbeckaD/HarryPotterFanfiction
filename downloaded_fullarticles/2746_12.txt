    <p align="center">Chapter 1: Origin</p><p align="center">June 17, 1983</p><p align="justify">           On a little cliff side of the coast of Peurto Rico, the Potter family was taking a vacation. Their son Harry was just two years old, but he greatly enjoyed the sand and water he got to visit every day. </p><p align="justify">                The whole family was enjoying this bright sunny day on the beach. James and Lily Potter watched their son from a beach towel as Harry played in the water. </p><p align="justify">             The peace did not last for long though as the sun suddenly went down and shot of bright red sparks.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lily's Pov</p><p align="justify">            "Harry! Harry come back here!" No matter how fast I run I feel like Harry is just getting further away. My muscles are spasiming with the adrinaline I fell in my heart as I keep pushing on. I have no idea what happened to James, but that doesn't matter as long as I can get to my son first. </p><p align="justify">SCREACH!!</p><p align="justify">            There's an alarm going off in the air. It's telling everyone to go inside the dragons are here.</p><p align="justify">             Suddenly, my body slams into something small and hard as I grab him into my arms. I was finally caught up with Harry, but I can't stop. I have  to get us safe. I run to the building in the distant as I catch something gold in the corner of my eyes. I have to be quick enough. I just have to.</p><p align="justify">            Luckily its not long before me and Harry reach the little food shack on the beach. I rush us inside. My adrelinine is still pumping. I can see Harry in front of me saying saomething, but I can't hear it. It's like all the sound is gone from the universe. Everything, but the harsh breaths I breath in, shaking me to my very core. </p><p align="justify">        "Mommy, where's daddy! Mommy!" Harry's yells in my face. Finally I can hear again. It sounds like bombs are gonna on outside. Shaking the very earth we stand on.</p><p align="justify">              " Sweety, I know your scared, but I'm hear. I"ll protect you." I reasure Harry. We're alone in the dark in this shack. The only light come from red sparks in the cracks in the door.</p><p align="justify">           There's glints of gold shining from right outside. It sounds like thrre's an animal breathing deep on the other side of the door. </p><p align="justify">         Suddenly, something hard bangs against trying to get in. I put Harry behind me and finally remember my wand. Shooting every locking spell I know at the door. Every shield charm I can, but its not enough. </p><p align="justify">              The door ripps off its hinges and the biggest dragon I had ever seen enters. His scalls seem to shimmer in gold. He's menacing toward us as I shoot off spell after spell. Barely making a scratch, but I remember a spell my best friend Severus taught me. One he said works on dragons. I reach for the lastof my magic and energy screaming! "Sectumsempra!"</p><p align="justify">         "ROAR!" </p><p align="justify">         The beast yelled I was finally able to do damage as his chest started spraying blood on the ground. It's not stopping though. I can't go on my magic and energy are gone shaking me to my very core, but I won't stop protecting Harry. </p><p align="justify">          The dragons mouth opens and red flames leave it. I'm screaming from the pain and how much it hurts, but I won't move. He can't see my son.</p><p align="justify">              Thankfully, the dragon turns around from wince it come. I can finally rest. Closely my eyes I fall asleep, flames burning my skin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Harry Pov</p><p align="justify">           "MOM!!" Everytime I shout or try to make noise its like no one can hear me. I d9n't understand what's going on. Mommy won't wake up and I'm all alone. Why won't anyone help me. Water is falling down my face as my voice finally breaks and everything becomes blurry, fading into blackness.</p>
