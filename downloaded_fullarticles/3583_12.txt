    <p>Splat!</p>
<p>Harry scowled as another spitball hit the back of his ear. Today was not his day, first he'd lost 40 points for Gryffindor in potions then he'd got a detention from Flitwick for forgetting his charms homework, so now he had Hermione telling him how “he should've done it earlier than the night before” and how it was “just justice really”. And finally, to top it all off, some prat was trying to push him over the edge.<br/>Splat!</p>
<p>That was it. 7 spitballs! 7 for Christ sake! Enough was enough. Jumping up from his seat, he turned behind him, ignoring McGonagall's shocked exclamation and Ron's 'Bloody hell Harry, is it your scar?'. His emerald eyes narrowed dangerously as he scanned the faces of the pupils around him trying to look for the culprit. The table quivered beneath his back, legs bouncing on the stone floor as his frustration grew. His hair whipped around his face with a wind that wasn’t there, whilst his eyes seemed to burn a threatening emerald fire that blazed dangerously in his sockets. Harry was so annoyed he didn’t notice the look of fear on the other pupils' faces or how they moved away from him.<br/>There. A streak of blinding blond hair caught his eye and he zoned in on the only unafraid and laughing face.<br/>Malfoy.</p>
<p>Malfoy looked up levitating a spitball clearly ready to fire another one with his wand when he caught Harry's gaze. Malfoy’s eye flitted to either side of Harry and he seemed to quickly take in the small hurricane of quills and paper swirling behind Harry, the angry look on Harry’s face and quietly muttered ‘incendio’ making the ball of spit burst into flames. Harry continued to glare at him ignoring Hermione who was tugging on his sleeve urging him to stop disrupting the lesson and Harry made sure Malfoy was looking back at him before he mouthed the words 'you're dead' before sitting down with words of apology to his friends and brushing off their worried looks.<br/>“Fucking hell Harry! What the hell was that?” Ron whispered seemingly oblivious to McGonagall’s stare. “what was what?” Harry asked confused but still irritated. But before Ron could respond he was silenced by Hermione promptly telling them to shut up. </p>
<p>Draco sunk back into his chair and swallowed hard. If there was one thing you really didn't want, it was a pissed off Harry bloody Potter -fucking boy wonder! -Screaming for your blood. Draco paused, maybe he was overdoing it a bit, what's the worst that could happen? It is only Potter and they were in school and surely no matter how ticked off Potter was even he wouldn't risk an unforgivable...would he? Draco had heard the story from his mother about how Sirius Black had passed a few months ago and that the escaped prisoner and Potter were close but surely even Potter wouldn't be so stupid as to allow his emotions to get so out of hand that he ended up getting expelled. Draco's mind wandered back to those two mouthed words. He gulped and sighed sweeping a hand over his furrowed brow trying to smooth the creases he found there. Oh well, he thought glumly only two hours until lunch then I'll know for sure. Sighing he tried to remember all the attack and defensive spells Snape had taught him.  Because one thing he knew for sure was that if he was going down, he was going down swinging. And after all, he wasn't about to give up a fight with the only person who endlessly agitated him and especially not when the opportunity to break Potters perfect nose had been Potter’s own stupid idea. Nope, he grinned at the thought and prepared another spitball ignoring Pansy and Blaise’s shared eye roll.</p>

<p>"Bloody hell Harry! What in Merlin's name was that?!" Ron exclaimed as soon as they left the classroom. Hermione tutted at his loud voice but looked at Harry with the same questioning look. <br/>Harry stepped back his voice uneasy "what was what?". He took another wary step back as he saw both Ron and Hermione's jaws drop.<br/> " you mean... you? You didn't mean to?" Hermione tried to regain the ability to speak. <br/>Harry sighed and threw his hands up in exasperation "what!? Do what???"<br/>Now Hermione seemed at loss of what to say so Ron quickly filled him in on the mini-storm Harry had created, finishing it with " -mate that was some heavy wandless and you didn't even try to! Amazing mate bloody brilliant! Hermione's been trying for years and here you are and you did it without even batting an eyelid!"<br/> He broke down chortling and missed the way Hermione's eyes narrowed. She cleared her throat as if to remind Ron that she was there and continued to say-<br/>" obviously harry we need to look into it, it could be dangerous, you could hurt someone!" Suddenly both Ron and Harry sobered and stopped planning the countless pranks.<br/> "I'm sure it’s not 'Mione..." Harry tried to soothe her.<br/>"Oh! You’re sure, are you? Tell me Harry have you ever even attempted wandless? You realise it takes years of training and can kill either the caster or the victims involved, Harry you can’t just mess around with this, people can get hurt, you could end up in Azkaban, or expelled!” She sighed and paused whilst she closed her eyes, clearly deep in thought “So, what brought this on we know that you... no offence but lose control when your emotions are running high so maybe Sirius' death triggered this specific chain reaction which -"Harry's eyes glazed over and his jaw clenched at the mention of his godfather. <br/> "Oh, Harry I’m sorry I didn’t think I -" Hermione embraced Harry and Harry let one tear slide before pulling back. "its fine mione' I just need… Time.” He shrugged he hated appearing weak in front of anyone, even them, maybe especially them. He knew he was supposed to be the boy wonder, the chosen one he knew the wizarding world was watching and he couldn’t afford to let them down not like he’d let Sirius down. Shaking his head, he announced, “Anyway, let’s go I’m starving!" Harry laughed trying to lighten the mood. Hermione smiled sadly but Ron dropped the subject and eagerly joined Harry in debating which was better Treacle tart or blueberry muffins. And so, the golden trio walked laughing up to the welcoming castle that they called home.</p>
