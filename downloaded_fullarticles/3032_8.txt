    <p>Morning dawned bright and early one August day in the northern countryside of Leeds. Rousing the sleeping 12 year old from dreams of large magical castles, scarlet steam trains, and luminous blue eyes.</p><p>Howard Moon woke with a start; and for a moment he was back at Hogwarts, he was sure that those eyes had belonged to the black lake ghost Old Gregg. However, as he climbed out of bed he realized that Gregg eyes, no matter how supernatural had never glowed like that. Deciding to forget the dream for now he focused on the tapping coming from the window. </p><p>His owl Lester sat perched on the window sill tapping his beak annoyingly against the glass. Opening the window Howard took the bundle of mail and gave Lester a treat for his troubles. Looking through the bundle he found a letter from Vince, one of thousand since June, surprisingly one from Naboo, and one from Leroy. He also discovered his Hogwarts supply list for second year. Smiling, he grabbed his bathrobe and quickly bounded down the stairs. He found his parents at the breakfast table, tea and toast already set out. His father had the Daily Prophet open on the table. Howard could make out something about Auror raids along with moving pictures of witches and wizards running through the streets of what appeared to be London. Obviously the Aurors carrying out their jobs.</p><p>“Hogwarts Letter came” he announced sitting down and helping himself to breakfast before tearing into his other letters with zest. </p><p>Leroy’s letter was normal fair. Asking about Howards summer, talking about his own. It was a bit boring but it made Howard smile all the same. Leroy considered them good enough friends that he sent him a letter.</p><p>Naboo’s letter was confusing as it was vague. Something about being a mighty hawk and not venturing off the path. </p><p>Vince’s letter he was used to. The muggleborn Ravenclaw tended to ramble off on tangents about monkeys, or clouds, or clouds that looked like monkeys, and sometimes monkeys that looked like clouds. He always eventually got round to the point though. He always ended up writing that he missed Howard and wished they lived closer. Howard usually agreed with those wishes. Specially after his bid to join the muggle boy’s game of football was denied. </p><p>In the newest letter it was more of the same badly spelled meandering. Except when Vince finally got to the point it was to inform Howard that he would be going to Diagon Alley in a weeks time and demanded that Howard be there as well. Looking up at his mother he grabbed the supply list and held it out for her.    </p><p>“When can we go to Diagon Alley? Vince will be there next week” the whole question and statement sounded impossibly childish but his mother smiled as she looked over the list.</p><p>“We can go next week Howard, of course we can, but finish your breakfast please” he smiled thankfully and did as he was told.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>A week later found Howard and his mother entering the alley via the Leaky Cauldron’s back wall. After a visit to Gringotts and promising to meet his mother back there at the end of the day his mother allowed him to do his own shopping. He was a responsible 12 year old after all. Howard wasn’t sure where Vince would be amongst the dozen or more shops that lined the cobblestone street, but he had some good ideas on where to start looking. </p><p>The Ravenclaw was neither at Florean Fortescue’s ice cream parlor or at Madam Malkin’s. He wasn’t at the small out of the way joke shop or Madam Primpernelle's Beautifying Potions supply store. Howard was beginning to suspect that Vince might not be in Diagon Alley at all until he finally spotted him outside of Eeylops Owl Emporium, pressing his face into the window. From the back Vince didn’t look any different, maybe taller, but no different then the last time Howard saw him. He wasn’t sure why he thought there would be a difference, after all it had only been two months, people didn’t change all that much in such a short amount of time. His father once told him that when you don’t see a person for a long time your perception of them changes instead. Howard wasn’t sure if that was the issue or not. Maybe…after only two months, even with letters, their easy friendship had disappeared entirely? There was only one way to find out and he had never been nervous around Vince before, at least not like this.</p><p>Hoping not to scare the easily startled boy, Howard slid up beside him and nudged him in the shoulder. The gasp and then subsequent bright smile that followed made Howard grin back at the job well done.</p><p>“ ‘Oward!” exclaimed Vince throwing his arms around the taller boy. Howard tensed but managed not to tell the other off. Letting go Vince turned back to the window “can you believe they still wont get me my own owl? Its criminal I’m tellin you! Not even for my birfday!” Howard hummed, more under the disbelief that he still didn’t know the smaller boys birthday then any sort of owl refusal. He had asked once before right after they had become friends, but Vince had declined to answer, instead asking Howard the same question as a divergence. Howard had answered right away with a smug smirk, hoping to goad Vince into answering. Vince still refused, and Howard began to wonder if Vince even knew when his birthday was. It was a depressing thought and Howard had vowed to himself that when he eventually found out he would get Vince something huge. “Have you done any shopping yet?” Vince finally asked  tearing his face away from the window.           </p><p>“No, was waiting for you” Howard answered, leaving out the fact that it took him 30 minutes just to find him. “Have you been to Gringotts yet?” he asked as they turned away from the store and began walking down the street. He didn’t fancy having to return to the bank just yet, the goblins freaked him out. </p><p>“Yes, them Goblins are funky, none of them can take a joke”  </p><p>“Thats funny, they’re usually quite amiable to their own kind” Vince shot him a mock glare but then smirked.</p><p>“That’s rich coming from a giant! Besides I’m more like a vampire, you're always sayin I’m too angular”            </p><p>“A giant? I’m nothing like a giant, giants are huge and they’re not the brightest”</p><p>“Exactly, plus your tall, have you grown? It’s like talking to a tree”</p><p>“I have a bit, and did you just call me stupid?” </p><p>there was a pause where Howard could see Vince suppressing a smile.</p><p>“No” he said, laughter trying to bubble forth. Rolling his eyes Howard directed them into Flourish and Blotts prompting Vince to let out a groan. </p><p>For the next hour and a half they purchased their required textbooks for the year, a new set of robes for Howard seeing as how he indeed grew taller over the summer, and other equipment that Howard insisted they both needed. By the end Vince was complaining loudly and dragging his feet so Howard relented and got them both an ice cream. Vanilla for himself and some chocolatey nonsense for Vince.</p><p>Walking back towards Gringotts to meet Howard’s mother for dinner, the boys talked about the upcoming school year and what they were most excited for. As they passed shop after shop Vince paused and hung back to peer into a dark archway. </p><p>“Hey Howard wots in there?” he asked taking a step forward to have a closer look. </p><p>“What?” replied Howard following after Vince until he saw the old sign on the wall.</p><p> Knockturn Alley. </p><p>“Uh Vince, maybe we shouldn’t?” He had only heard about Knockturn Alley from his father and the papers, it was a place for dark wizards and witches, not 12 year old boys. </p><p>“Aw come on it looks wicked down there, can’t hurt to have a look around eh?” responded Vince stepping further into the darkness until he was completely shrouded in it. </p><p>“Yes! Yes it can hurt a lot, Vince! Viiince!” He called, reluctantly following the smaller boy in. </p><p>It was dark, foggy, and smelled strongly of damp dirt. Howard stumbled as he followed Vince through the twisting alleyway, trying to keep up with him. There weren’t many people about, which in Howard’s book was a good thing. </p><p>He soon found himself suddenly inexplicably alone. After losing sight of Vince entirely, Howard stopped walking all together. Angry and frustrated with the other boy for abandoning him he turned to go, claiming that if Vince found trouble he would have to deal with it on his own. </p><p>Problem with this plan however, was that Howard found himself lost in a matter of seconds. The dark alley was larger than he thought, and he was reluctant to ask for directions. Trying not to panic too much, he stopped and leant against a slimy brick wall outside of a shop window. </p><p>Turning slightly he caught sight of a sickly green glow coming from the window. Focusing more he realized that behind the window was a huge fish tank filled with dirty murky green water. Stepping closer he peered into the tank trying to make out what exactly was inside. For a brief moment nothing happened, not even a ripple until suddenly a wiggling mass of eels snapped against the glass. With wide insane eyes, and gnashing teeth they squirmed and thrashed about in the tank. Stepping away Howard registered the shop door banging open and footstep on the stairs. </p><p>“You lost boy?” a rough cockney accent asked. Looking up, Howard was horrified to find a tall skinny man approaching him. He had long dirty stringy blonde hair hanging around his face and a top hat adorned his head. Curiously muggle polo mints circled the hat, like some bizarre decoration. He wore a large black overcoat and carried a cane. He also had a large glass monocle at his right eye. There didn’t seem to be anything keeping it on his face. As the strange man approached, the green glow from the shop window was cast upon him, making his pale waxy face turn green for half a second.   </p><p>“No” he whimpered backing away further “not-not lost, erm...looking for my friend” </p><p>The hatted man laughed violently “well maybe he went into my shop!” he said pointing towards it with his cane “why don’t you come have a look at my maniacal menagerie of dark creatures. We got all sorts of nasties for ya”</p><p>“Um, no thank you” replied Howard backing fully into the wall opposite the man’s shop. He could make out shrunken heads in the window, it made him want to be sick. </p><p>“Wot!? You think your too good for Mr. Hitcher’s shop do ya boy?” he said waving the cane at Howard. It was millimeters from his face, and Howard had the sudden thought that the man's wand was most likely hidden in it. </p><p>“No..” his eyes squeezed shut when he felt the cane poke painfully into his shoulder “please don’t kill me, I’ve got so much to give” </p><p>“I’m not gonna kill you boy, but I might let my eels have some fun with ya. Would you like that? Having them all up inside yea where they don’t rightly belong?”  </p><p>“N-no, please.. I’m just trying to fin-” he was cut off when the man, Mr. Hitcher, grabbed his collar and dragged him towards the shop. </p><p>“Elsie we got a live one!” he called, flinging Howard into the shop. He was caught by the strong but feminine arms of a woman. She had on pale blue robes, her hair was in a tight bun, and she had a kind face. Howard gulped and tried to extract himself from her hold. She didn’t speak but didn’t let him go either. Mr. Hitcher followed after him and shut the door with a firm click. </p><p>Howard was going to die at twelve years old, his mother was going to worry and Vince would have to return to school without him.    </p><p>“You go to Hogwarts boy?” Mr Hitcher asked, tapping Howard’s shin with his cane. </p><p>“Y-yes!” he responded, trying to get away from the abuse. </p><p>“What house you in?” this question made Howard pause, what did that matter?</p><p>“...Slytherin” </p><p>Mr. Hitcher let out a booming laugh, bending backward at the force of his laughter.</p><p>“Ooh! I remember Slytherin! A right dirty house if you ask me! All the best wizards and witches are from Slytherin! I knew all the greats! Poor old Voldy! And even Salazar himself! Oohh he would go around, screaming about blood and muggle borns left and right, gave me a good laugh he did, tell me lad, what do you think about them?” Hitcher asked leering down at Howard. His monocle glinted off the candle light menacingly.</p><p>“I-I-think they were great powerful wizards sir” Howard finally answered. He didn’t know much about Salazar Slytherin besides being his houses founder. Voldemort he knew more about of course. He had been an evil man, but Howard had always heard people say he was very powerful.</p><p>A moment passed where Hitcher regarded him silently.</p><p>“Eh! Course they was!” Hitcher said ending the tense moment. Howard sighed in relief, but it was short lived as Hitcher pointed his cane at him again.”tell ya what boy, I’m not gonna feed you to my eels. I’m gonna let ya go seeing as how your in Slytherin and all, is your little friend as well?” </p><p>“Yes!” Howard answered quickly, not quite believing that he was being let go all because of his Hogwarts house. Never before had he been so grateful to be sorted that day. “W-we’re both in Slytherin! And we love it! And we love the dark lord! I-I should go find him though…”</p><p>“To right you should, can’t have two young Slytherins lost about in good ol’ Knockturn alley can we?!” Hitcher replied, turning and opening the shop door. Howard bolted out as soon as he could, running down the alley still hearing the man’s insane laughter echoing off the bricks. He stopped to catch his breath under a lantern for a moment. He screamed when something grabbed his hand but realized that it was only Vince, grinning up at him.  </p><p>“Hey Howard, where did you go! One minute you were behind me and the next you was gone!” </p><p>“What do you mean I was gone!? Your the one who disappeared on me! Why did you come down here anyway!” Howard yelled, pulling away from Vince and glaring at the smaller boy angrily. He must have looked like he really meant it because Vince stepped back and gave him the best puppy dog eyes he could muster. </p><p>“Sorry Howard, it looked cool. You okay?” he asked nervously, afraid to set off the taller boy again. </p><p>Howard sighed and nodded, finally calming down enough to think. “Yes, I think so. It's just this place is full of weirdos and villains, it's all very bad juju. We need to leave” Except they were still lost.</p><p>“Yea alright, I think it was this way” respond Vince, taking Howard’s hand again and leading him down the alley. Howard wanted to make him let go but figured it was a good way to stay together. Five minutes later they were greeted with the setting sun, Diagon Alley, and Howard’s worried mom waiting for them. It was a rather unremarkable end to the adventure through Knockturn Alley. Vince didn’t speak all the way back to the Leaky Cauldron, not even once they were inside. He didn’t until they were in Howard’s room upstairs. He and his mother would be returning home by Floo powder the next day.  </p><p>“I am sorry you know” </p><p>“I know little man, no harm done I guess” except to his mental state perhaps. “But let's try and steer clear of Knockturn please? I don’t fancy getting eels threatened on me again is all” Vince laughed but nodded in acceptance.</p><p>“Yea alright, no Knockturn Alley and no Black Lake, anywhere else we should stay clear of?” Howard was being mocked he knew but he couldn’t help adding to the list. </p><p>“No Forbidden Forest either” </p><p>“Forgot that one” </p><p>“I’ll start a list if you keep forgetting, I’ll put it next to one about why your always late to class” Vince merely grinned in amusement and shook his head.</p>
