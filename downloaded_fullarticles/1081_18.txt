    <p>     All he had ever wanted in life was the approval of someone, <em> anyone, </em> and the only hope he had was from his family.</p><p>     He wanted to see their beautiful smiles directed towards him, and hear praises escape from their lips. To be taken into their arms and held, <em>loved, </em>he knows it’s possible, he’s seen them hold Dudley in such a way. Right now, and maybe even forever, Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and cousin Dudley were his <em>entire world, </em>even if his world was a very, very small one. Nothing, nothing at all, was as important to him as they were, <em>they’re all he’s ever known</em>. Yet, no matter what he did, no matter how hard he <em>tried</em>, no matter how hard he studied, <em>or didn’t,</em> and no matter how hard he worked, all he received was hateful words and painful punishments<em>. </em>Throughout it all, and against all reason or rhyme, he still loved them, and he didn’t know <em>why</em>. It was wrong, the way they treated him, <em>he knew that</em>, and yet all he desired was their love. What was wrong with him?<br/>
     He knew it was normal in human beings, to crave family and love, but not to this extent. The pure <em>need</em> he experienced everyday wasn’t anything, anything close to or even resembling, the many books he read about psychology. It was nothing at all like the numerous families he had gazed upon at school, watching the other children be picked up by their guardians, or at markets when he accompanied Aunt Petunia to carry the bags. <em>So, why was he so different?</em> What made him like this? Was it some secret he was not privy to, if so, then what?<br/>
     Maybe, just maybe he felt like this because he wasn’t normal. If so, then this isolation, this situation,<em> was his fault.</em> At least he had a room he could go to when things got to hard, <em>his cupboard,</em> its comforting walls around him, protecting him from harm, and secure floors underneath, even if he had to share it with the spiders. He’ll never tell his family how much he loved the, <em>his, it was his</em>, cupboard. He didn’t want it taken away, just like everything else he has ever loved, <em>just like his baby blanket</em>.<br/>
     He wasn’t like them, <em>he’s a freak, </em>they’ve made sure he knows that by telling him everyday. It’s because unexplainable things happened around him, like floating plates or shrinking clothes. That’s what they told him, <em>that he’s unusual</em>, so it must be so. They wouldn’t dare lie to family, <em>right?</em> To make him even more freakish, he hadn’t even known his own name until he was five, having been told the very same day he went to primary school, was that wrong?<br/>
     A year later, when he was six years old, and a mean teacher’s hair turned blue before his very eyes, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon stopped throwing him into the cupboard after school, and instead made him do chores, like cooking and gardening. Although Dudley didn’t have to, still doesn’t in fact,  instead he plays games and watches the Telly, when he had asked why that was so, he was told he had to do them, the chores, because it was ‘working the freakishness out of him,’ before he was punished. That was the day he stopped asking questions, in fear of what would happen if he did.<br/>
     He likes working in the garden though, because he has the time to daydream of having a family, someone who will encourage his curiosity, and love him unconditionally. For that reason, every night he’s filled with utter shame, how selfish he was, <em>to wish for something he already had</em>; there were thousands of orphans who probably wished to be in his place right now<em>. </em>Yet all he wants, his only desire, his only dream, was for someone, anyone, to care for him, <em>to</em> <em>treasure me</em>, to feel concerned when he’s hurt, <em>to</em> <em>protect me, </em>and hold him when he gets scared, <em>to love me</em>. He shouldn’t be frightened of the world, <em>I’m only eleven years old, </em>shouldn’t he be in awe of it? Is it really all that wrong, to wish for just one smile, just one, directed towards me?</p><p>     Without any warning, a fist banged on the aged wooden door that enclosed him in the cupboard, causing him to flinch from his musings and jerk around to look at where the sound originated from. A clicking noise occurs as the lock on the door is opened, and the door is jerked outward, forcing a harsh light into the small, formerly dark, space. When his eyes adjust to the sudden brightness, he sees a rather tall, thin woman, with blonde hair and extremely pale blue eyes, almost resembling ice, standing in front of him. An ugly sneer is upon her face, her eyes gazing at his small huddled form in disgust.<br/>
     “Get up Freak, Breakfast needs to be on the table in exactly thirty minutes, after that’s done, you’re going to mow the lawn, front and back, perfectly even, as well as weed the garden, before the guests arrive for Dinner. I’m leaving a list of chores on the Hallway table that you’re to start when Breakfast is finished,” Her eyes quickly scan his body, glaring angrily, almost in betrayal, at the dirt on his neck, and underneath his nails. “You’ll have ten minutes to shower, in cold water, and get dressed in your guest clothes after you finish the lawn. We can’t have Mr. and Mrs. Pemberton catching sight of you when you’re like <em>this</em>.” With one final sneer, the woman, still dressed in her pale pink satin pyjamas, storms up the stairs to get ready for the day.<br/>
     He lets out a sigh; closing his eyes and slumping his shoulders briefly in exhaustion before climbing out of the cupboard, reaching back in too fold the tattered and torn-up blankets, setting them in the far right corner. On top of them he places his worn-out school bag, and his other t-shirts and trousers; most of which use to be Dudley’s until he grew out of them, before putting a dark-grey plastic sheet over it, to cover the pile from spying eyes. <em>Mrs. Pemberton, the ‘Gossip-Queen’, is coming, that means she’ll try and find some scandal to tell the other women about Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; which means that today’s Dinner will have to be as delicious and perfect as can be. Not to mention, the house has to be flawless as well.</em> He stands, letting out a quiet groan as his aching back is straightened. <em>If that’s so, I’ll make the best meal the Pembertons have ever eaten, then they’ll only have good things to say about ‘that Dursley family;’ I’ll also clean the house until it’s spotless, that’ll teach those Pembertons about spying on others. </em>He glances at the clock hanging in the hallway, checking the time. <em>There’s twenty-five minutes until Dudley’s down for breakfast, which means that Uncle Vernon will be down in fifteen minutes for a cuppa. </em>A small smiles crossed his face, causing his beautiful emerald eyes to brighten.<br/>
     <em>What should I make for Breakfast this morning?</em> <em>What could get me praised for doing good today? </em>He limps his way down the hallway, quickly grabbing the list on the small table before continuing on to the Kitchen, pausing in the doorway. <em>Dudley adores bacon, Uncle Vernon loves, well likes, eggs, and Aunt Petunia enjoys tomatoes. So I’ll make bacon, scrambled eggs, grilled tomatoes, and some toast.</em> He goes to the fridge and pulls out the bacon, and tomatoes, before going to the pantry to grab a loaf of homemade, only three days ago, bread. He begins to softly hum a lullaby he always seems to have on his mind as he prepares the food, cutting the bread and slicing the tomatoes.<br/>
     After he’s done, he begins to cook the toast in the toaster by the stove. Next to the toast, he places the tomatoes on the stove-top grill, making sure to place the tomatoes so the grill marks are even. Around 10 minutes later, with the tomatoes and toast already done and placed on the table, he quickly runs to the front door, briefly pausing to arrange his face in a neutral mask. Opening the door he walks, with a barely noticeable limp, to the end of the driveway and picks up the morning paper. Just as he was about to turn and walk inside, a voice shouts out to catch his attention.<br/>
     “Hadrian, how are you?” A teenager, around sixteen years of age, jogs up to the small boy. “I haven’t seen you in awhile, where have you been?” He pauses briefly before he continues on, not giving Hadrian the chance to answer. “Never mind, that doesn’t really matter right now. I just wanted to let you know the next study group is in three days, at the usual place and time.” He pushes his brown hair out of his face, tilting his head to the side. “It’s going to be about arithmetic's this time, we really need you to be there. You’re the genius at that kind of stuff! Anyways, I’ve got to go, I have exactly twenty minutes to finish jogging. Then, I have an thirty minutes of Yoga, because I already did an hour before this. After that I have fifty minutes to get ready before I have to go to summer school.” He grins, his brown eyes shining in excitement. “Don’t you just love following a schedule? I know I absolutely adore it! See you later Hadrian, hope you have a good day.” With a wave of his hand he begins jogging away. “Remember, Study group, three days, same place, same time!”<br/>
     Hadrian waves at the back of the jogging man, shaking his head. <em>Typical of him, hopefully I’ll be able to show up to the Study group. </em>“B-bye J-j-j… I’ll try and make it!” He then quickly walks back into the house, checking the clock for the time. <em>Three minutes until uncle Vernon is downstairs. He’ll want to relax for a minute or two before he demands a cuppa, and a plate of food. </em>Hadrian places the newspaper on the table before walking over the fridge. He pulls five eggs out, along with some bacon, before walking over to the stove to turn it back on. Around thirty seconds later, Hadrian cracks the eggs into the now hot pan, adding a bit of water to the mix, before stirring them. Without pausing in his mixing, he reaches over to the teapot and places it in the sink, turning on the water to fill it up. As the kettle was filling he turned on another burner on the stove, then places the now full pot onto the stove to boil the water. Hadrian with the eggs cooked and placed on barely any heat, just enough to keep the warm, turns to the bacon which had been cooking along with the eggs and puts them on a plate with a paper towel to soak up the grease, before going to the teapot and taking the kettle off just as it begins to whistle, just then a thump, followed by an angry bellow echoed from upstairs.<br/>
     “Freak, how dare you not finish your chores!” A slam, mostly likely the closet door, reverberated down the stairs, and into the kitchen. Shocked, and terrified, Hadrian whips his head to face in the direction of where the sound originated from, horror etched upon his delicate features. <em>What, what didn’t I finish? </em>He clenches his hands as he back away from the entrance, tears building up in his eyes as he shakes in fear. <em>The clothes, I forgot to hang them up in Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon’s bedroom after I cleaned them, they’re still hanging up in the closet by the laundry. How could I be so stupid, so useless! I’ve made them angry, I’ve disappointed them so early in the morning. I’ll never get a praise this way, you idiot! </em>The sound of thundering footsteps is heard on the stairs, and the harsh breathing of a man can be heard. <em>What do I do? Say that I forgot? No, no I don’t want to be hurt! Should I lie, should I say something not true? </em>Hadrian’s heart speeds up as a large man with greying hair comes storming around the corner. I don’t want to lie, not to Uncle Vernon, or anyone, but I don’t want to get hurt. I’m sorry Uncle Vernon, I’ll, I’ll...  make the house sparkling clean, the cleanest you’ve ever seen it,  in apology.<br/>
     “Uncle Vvv-ernon, I p-put your c-clothes in the laundry, um... armoire. They w-were a little… rumpled after th...ah laundering, and I thought the humidity mm-ight help s-s, help sss-mooth... t-th, um, thh-em out. I rememb-b...ered you had a meeting today, oon if you would get a p-p… elevation, and th-th-ought... it would help make a b-b...etter first impression.” Vernon sneers in disgust, his rage at being unable to punish Hadrian because of the logical explanation causes his face to grow an angry red in colour. “I h-have your n-newspapers on th...ah t-table, and th...ah t-tea is ready to b-b… s-s to sss-teep.”  Hadrian hunches his shoulders, as if he’s trying to fold into himself. His emerald eyes gazing up though his eyelashes, looking at his towering uncle in front of him. Did that convince him?<br/>
     “Next time you decide to do something without my approval Freak, I won’t be as lenient. Now get the food on the plates, and get my tea, then go get my suit and put it in my room,” Vernon growls in rage. “After you’re through with that, go do your chores, you’re having no breakfast or lunch today.” Hadrian’s head bows down in shame, his face flushed in embarrassment. Hadrian, you stupid, stupid fool! How dare you disappoint him!<br/>
     “Y-yes S-s...ir, I unders-s...tand.” His dainty hand rises to tug at his fringe, pulling his midnight black hair in front of his eyes.  At the same time, Hadrian quickly scurries to the small wooden cabinet to grab a cup, and opening the drawer beside it for the tea strainer. Placing the two objects by the stove, with the strainer on top of the cup, he reaches for a silver tin marked with the words “Loose Black Tea”, and taking the tea spoon within, scoops out a little bit more than one spoonful, dumping it into the strainer. After that he pours the still very hot water into the cup. Placing the kettle back on the stove, Hadrian places around four scoops of the eggs and five pieces of bacon on the plate; grabbing the hot cup of tea he carefully walks over to the table, placing the plate and cup in front of Vernon, before backing up. I hope he likes it, will he say anything, any praise, or any thanks?<br/>
     Without a word, Vernon immediately begins to devour the food on the plate, only pausing to grab some toast and grilled tomatoes, or to take a sip tea. After a few seconds he turns to Hadrian, who perks up in hope, only to wilt when he speaks. “Freak, I said to go get my suit! Not stand there like, like the mindless, stupid, idiot you are, go!” Hadrian quickly nods, backing away into the hallways behind him, clutching the chore list between his right fist, causing it to crinkle.<br/>
     <em>It’s my fault, I shouldn’t have forgotten, but I did so I didn’t get any words of gratitude. That’s okay, it’s alright. </em>He enters into the laundry room, going to the closet and draping uncle Vernon’s suit across his arm, along with two of aunt Petunia’s dresses that were in there because they had some stains across the chest and lap area. They don’t have any wrinkles though, so that should help them. Hadrian makes his way to the master bedroom, looking at the list in his hand and read:</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong> <em> <u>Today’s Chores</u> </em> </strong>

This means i’ll have thirteen points, unless I finish the three chores on today’s list, in which case I'll have twenty-one points. </em> Pausing in front of the aunt Petunia’s and uncle Vernon’s bedroom Hadrian shifts nervously from one foot to the other, before knocking on the wooden door. After a few second the door swings open, the scowling face of aunt Petunia appearing through the doorway.<br/>
     What do you want? Can’t you see I’m busy?” She crosses her arms in front of her, eyes glancing at the clothes draped over his left arm, before bringing her gaze back up, only to look at his nose after meeting his tired emerald eyes.<br/>
     “Aunt P-petunia, may I enter? I need to put Uncle Vvv-ernon’s suit away, I also have s-some of your dresses.” Hadrian tugs on his right ear, looking down as he waits for an answer.<br/>
     “Fine, hang up the clothes then finish your chores, you did get the list right you foolish boy?” Aunt Petunia huffs, stepping further back into the room.<br/>
     “Y-yes aunt P-petunia. I have th...ah list.” Hadrian replies, hurrying into the closet to put away the clothes. After putting the two dresses into their correct place, he hang up the suit in a rather empty spot on the rack, which is reserved for the suit of the day, which is what uncle Vernon will wear to work. Exiting the closet he stops in its doorway, gazing as aunt Petunia applies a deep pink lipstick. <em> How beautiful, I wish… </em>Hadrian pauses his thoughts and proceeds to shake his head, almost violently, side to side, before briskly leaving the room to finish his chores.</p><p> </p>
