    <p>So it’s completely unexpected when Harry finds himself catching the crook of Draco’s elbow and pulling him to a stop. </p><p>“<em>What</em>,” Draco snarls, whirling around. </p><p>“Nothing,” Harry says, blinking in surprise in the face of Draco’s fury. “I... Just, be careful.”</p><p>“Be careful? Be <em>careful</em>? Potter, have you forgotten that we are <em>sworn enemies</em>?”</p><p>Harry stares back at him, puzzled. “Erm,” he says slowly, “<em>Voldemort</em> is my sworn enemy.”</p><p>Draco glares at him in speechless fury for a long moment. “And what am I,” he finally snaps, “chopped liver? Not good enough even to be your sworn enemy? Well guess what, Potter, you can’t just brush six years of hatred under the carpet and pretend that it doesn’t exist! I won’t let you!” His voice rings out through the corridor, loud and commanding, and just a little bit shrill.</p><p>This was a bad idea. Harry doesn’t know what he was thinking, trying to talk to Draco like a normal human being when he clearly <em>wasn’t</em>. He glares back equally fiercely, trying to cover his disappointment with anger. “You’re mental! Why does it always have to be so <em>difficult</em> with you? You <em>know</em> Voldemort’s back. There are more important things than this. Can’t we just... move on?”</p><p>They’re face to face now, so close that he can feel Draco’s breath on his cheek every time Draco exhales. He’s surprised to find that he’s still holding onto Draco’s arm; that Draco still hasn’t pulled away. Abruptly, the anger dissipates, and Harry can feel that familiar gnaw of worry start up again in the pit of his stomach. <em>Whatever you’re up to</em>, he thinks, <em>don’t do it</em>.</p><p>“Draco,” he says, and is equally surprised as Draco when it comes out as a plea. Draco’s face shifts from anger to confusion, and for a wild second, Harry thinks he’ll give in. Draco’s eyes are silvery grey beneath those long lashes, and they dart wildly from Harry’s face to where he’s holding onto Draco. Still.</p><p>Then Draco’s shoving him back forcefully, his hands curled into fists against Harry’s robes. “Oh, why can’t you just leave me alone,” he snarls, thumping Harry on his chest. Then Draco turns and flees down the corridor, leaving Harry behind, his heart pounding, stunned.</p>
