          <div class="userstuff"><p>Now, this is a story all about how,<br/>
My life got flipped-turned upside down.<br/>
And I'd like to take a minute,<br/>
Just sit right there.<br/>
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Hogwarts.</p><p>In west-Earth born and raised,<br/>
On the playground was where I spent most of my days.<br/>
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool,<br/>
And all doing some Quidditch outside of the school.<br/>
When a couple of Voldemort Smurfs guys who were up to no good,<br/>
Started bleeding people in my neighborhood.<br/>
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared,<br/>
She said 'You're movin' with Hermoine Smurf and Ron Smurf to Hogwarts'.</p><p>I begged and pleaded with her day after day,<br/>
But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way.<br/>
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.<br/>
I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.</p><p>First class, yo this is bad,<br/>
Drinking wine out of a champagne glass.<br/>
Is this what the people of Hogwarts living like?<br/>
Hmmmmm this might be alright.</p><p>But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that,<br/>
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?<br/>
I don't think so<br/>
I'll see when I get there,<br/>
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Hogwarts.</p><p>Well, the pterodactyl landed and when I came out,<br/>
There was a dude who like a cop - there with the Harry Smurf name out.<br/>
I ain't trying to get arrested yet,<br/>
I just got here,<br/>
I used my Magic powers and  - like lightning, disappeared.</p><p>Then whistled for a cab and when it came near,<br/>
The license plate said fresh and it had Horcrux in the mirror.<br/>
If anything I could say that this cab was rare,<br/>
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, home to Hogwarts'</p><p>I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8,<br/>
And I yelled to the the dark wizard Smurf 'Yo home smell ya later'<br/>
I looked at my kingdom,<br/>
I was finally there,<br/>
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Hogwarts.</p></div>
