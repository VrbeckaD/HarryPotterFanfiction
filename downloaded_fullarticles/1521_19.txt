    <p>Albus<br/>It’s cold the day after my mother’s funeral. Frost coats the windowpanes of our house which was once a home, the chill drifting in around the cracks where Mother’s hospitality charms have long worn off. I think that’s one of the worst parts, the absence of her magic. My mother was not a woman to be trifled with, and a great witch in her own right. To see her spells shattered so easily, blown away in the dust is…frightening. <br/>Not as frightening as being back here.<br/>A hand on my shoulder makes me jerk away reflexively, far too deep in my own thoughts. That’s a bad habit. I turn around to find my beautiful, timid sister blinking up at me.<br/>Timid and weak and the reason that I’m here. I feel shocked at myself and work hard to press that thought back to the recesses of my mind, where it belongs. This is not her fault, I repeat firmly. Maybe one day I’ll believe it.<br/>“A-Albus?” Her voice is musical, soft, but it trails away too often. She gets lost somewhere between self and fear. “Are you okay?”<br/>I can’t let her see that I’m upset, let alone upset her. The feeling of ill use comes over me again, that I am now enslaved to this woman child behind me. Because of—<br/>“Albus?”<br/>I force a smile to my lips. I love Ariana, I do. “I’m okay. It’s just…” Now I sound like her, dropping my sentences into oblivion. But for all her shortcomings, Ari is intuitive. She chews on a lock of her flaxen hair, pale eyes fixed on me.<br/>“Quiet.” And I know she feels it too, the overwhelming loss of our mother, the magic that traced itself around her. Magic sings to me in a way I can’t quite describe, each person’s a unique melody. Traces, I think to myself. My mother’s proud, mournful song is gone.<br/>Her eyes fill with tears alarmingly fast, but don’t spill over. She stares at me more directly than she has since I first came home.<br/>“You…hate me.” She jabs a finger accusingly in my direction. “My fault.” The air around her grows murky, like smoke descending, and her shoulders start to quiver. Fear ignites in my gut, and I feel for the presence of my wand in my pocket.<br/>“Ariana,” I say pleadingly. “I don’t think that. I—“<br/>The door bangs open, frightening us both. My younger brother, Aberforth, strides in, freezing as he takes in the scene between the two of us. Ariana’s head snaps down, all vestiges of her rage gone as quickly as it came. She makes a timid motion toward Aberforth, who sneers at me like I am the scum of the Earth. We look so similar it’s rather like being judged by my own reflection. He holds his arms out to our sister.<br/>“Ari girl!” She leaps to him, and he swings her in his arms, the two of them making a wild circle while she giggles madly. And I’m relieved, but I’m also furious. Angry because I never did have the patience to form such a bond with Ariana. Aberforth always was better at calming her down, knowing just when to treat her like a regular person—I wince, knowing how my father would hate that term—and when to back off. Because our sister is a time bomb. <br/>Abe settles Ariana back on the ground and gently bops her on the head. Like their casual embrace, something I would never try. She merely giggles and swats back at him, once again nothing but a child. Harmless. <br/>“Why don’t you go put some tea on? I’m frozen. Maybe we can work on your collage. Picked up a copy of The Prophet on my way home.” She brightens and gives a sweet smile, turning smartly into the kitchen. Aberforth keeps his face in a mask of pleasantness until she’s out of earshot. When he rounds on me, I flinch before he even speaks.<br/>“What the hell is wrong with you,” he snarls, using language he would never have dared to if Mother were still here. “You can’t go upsetting her like that.”<br/>I try to be the patient eldest brother I’m meant to be, take a breath. “While I appreciate your concern for my life—“<br/>“It’s not your life I’m concerned about.” I draw back, wounded. Aberforth and I were never close, but I thought we liked each other well enough. And we did, until this happened. Now I rub my hand over my face like he’s hit me with a stinging jinx, trying to hide the hurt smarting there. <br/>“I never intentionally try to set her off, she’s just fragile right now.”<br/>“She’s always been fragile. Or did you forget that, spending all your summers at Hogwarts and hiding up in your room at Christmas.” His fists are clenched, a growing sign of danger. Abe never could hold his temper. Which makes the fight we’re having even more ridiculous. <br/>“That’s not fair. I was doing projects, working on things—“<br/>“On your legacy, you mean.” There it is. Underneath all the resentment, a little jealousy. Abe isn’t stupid, he just never cared for school. He’s already tried twice to get me to allow him to withdraw. My mother would roll over in her grave, which is the only reason I haven’t bowed to his increasingly aggressive demands.<br/>“Aberforth, if I made you feel like I didn’t care, I’m sorry.” And I am, a little. But mostly, I really didn’t care. I just wanted to get away from here. I would think Abe would enjoy that, knowing how trapped I am here now. Instead, he rolls his eyes and moves away from me, contempt dripping from his lanky, fifteen year old frame.<br/>“You didn’t make us feel that way, Albus. You showed us exactly how you felt.”<br/>A few weeks after Aberforth returned (most unwillingly) to Hogwarts, my life has started to fall into a dismal routine. Make sure Ariana is fed and entertained. Crunch the numbers on the increasingly depleted bank account—we are bleeding Galleons. Work halfheartedly on some research correspondence. I flip through my notes on dragon’s blood, noting my excited, cramped handwriting. I had been so energized then, when doing that project. Twelve—twelve!—uses of dragon’s blood. It was a paramount discovery. And now that people want to talk about it, I’m stuck here. I toss my quill down on the desk, giving it up for another day. <br/>I’ve got nothing but time.<br/>Ariana has mostly given me a wide berth, although she does occasionally show up with a cup of tea and a wizard’s chess set. She’s terribly intuitive, Ari. More than once I’ve entertained the thought that if what happened hadn’t happened, she would have been an excellent Legilimens. It’s not fair. Still, if I dwell too long on those thoughts, she disappears like she can hear them. So I try not to.<br/>My mother’s pygmy owl flies back and forth about three times during the week, dumping letter after letter from Aberforth. He asks after Ariana in every one, and I can feel his unbelief in my ability to take care of our sister, his most precious friend. My inquiries into his studies go unanswered, although Professor Dippet has told me he’s doing “adequately.” I’ll take what I can get. Father always encouraged us to “pick our battles.” And then he chose the wrong one.<br/>Occasionally, a handsome, exotic bird will present itself on my windowsill. These I dread even more than missives from Abe. My schoolfriends are on the traditional tour of the world, seeing incredible things. Today’s letter is from my friend Elphius, and I tear it open irritably and barely skim it before waving the giant, falcon-like bird off without a reply. It looks highly offended, but I’m getting used to inspiring that in people.<br/>The sneakoscope on my desk begins to whirl just before my intruder charms go off. I sigh heavily before heading into the den, where Ariana is reading a book. She looks placid enough, barely giving me a passing wave. Godric’s Hollow is an all-wizarding village, but very few people come around since my father was arrested. Not that they didn’t all show up the funeral, as Abe pointed out, hoping to get a glimpse of my reclusive mother. Her body, I mean.<br/>I didn’t allow it.<br/>I flick my wand, silencing the alarms and the sneakoscope. Nonverbal charms have been a great asset in this house, since magic makes Ari nervous. Better to keep it quiet.<br/>“No, dear, take your time, I have all day.” In spite of myself, I smile when I hear that voice and throw the door open wide. <br/>Bathilda Bagshot is one of the only witches in Godric’s that never stopped being friends with my family. Over the years, we all came to think of her as an auntie of sorts, her sharp tongue notwithstanding. When I was younger it offended me, but as I grew older I came to understand her sharp wit was all to see if we had any. Which we did.<br/>Better yet, she’s good with Ariana. And she knows.<br/>“Sorry, Bathilda.” I step back to allow her in, and she bustles past as if she owns the place, hanging her hat on the hook by the door, edges of her cloak snapping. Her eyes survey my disaster of a desk.<br/>“Keep it up, Albus, and you’ll have this place looking like mine.” She cackles, shifting through the papers as her long, black braid swings between her shoulders. Her house is buried in a myriad of papers. She’s a historian, always working on her next dissection of the past.  “How are you coming on the Dragon’s Blood thesis?”<br/>“Um…” I spread my arms in defeat. Bathilda fixes me with a look that’s far too knowing for my taste. <br/>“Domestic tedium getting to be a bit much for you, boy?” Her sparse brow arches as she looks me up and down. She presses her lips together, making them pale. “Listen, Albus..”<br/>“Auntie Bathilda?” Ari peers around the corner shyly, hiding herself behind her long waves of hair. Her book dangles in her fingers, probably in case she is dismissed. That hurts my heart a little and I’m thankful when Bathilda smiles at her.<br/>“Ari! What are you doing hiding from me? Come sit with Albus and I. I’ve got some news for him.” She winks conspiratorially at Ari. “Maybe he’ll be a little less mopey, eh?”<br/>She giggles behind her hands and I shift uncomfortably. I hadn’t meant to let it show that much. <br/>Ten minutes later, the three of us are seated around the kitchen table, steaming mugs of tea situated in front of us. I’m relieved when she uses a strainer. Neither of us care much for divination, particularly the waste of tea leaf reading. In fact, the more I study the less I find I even believe in true Seers.<br/>“What’s the big news, Bathilda?” I drop a cube of sugar into my cup, not really getting my hopes up. Unless she tells me that she’s found someone else to manage the household while I go back to my life, I’m not sure what could cheer me up.<br/>Bathilda smiles and the crow’s feet around her eyes deepen. Ari has the dreamy look that tells me her mind is millions of miles from this once-warm kitchen.<br/>“My great nephew is coming to visit me. Gellert. And he’s just your age, Albus. He’ll be staying for the summer, and I thought you two would get along well. He’s very bright, you see.” That part, the boy’s being bright, I don’t doubt for a second. Hard to be anything else when you share blood with Bathilda Bagshot. <br/>“Has he just finished school too?”<br/>Bathilda twirls her finger, slowly making her spoon rotate in her teacup. <br/>“He was at Durmstrang, yes.” I get the feeling that she’s not telling me something, but my ears perk up at the sound of Durmstrang. Another wizarding school, one with serious rumors hanging over its head. Dark Arts style rumors. But also, whispers that they encouraged their students to experiment, to be free thinkers. We could use some of that in Godric’s Hollow.<br/>Come to think, we could use some of that in England proper.<br/>“That’s wonderful.” I lean forward, allowing myself to feel a little excitement. “When does he get here?”<br/>“In two days’ time.” Bathilda shrugs, and I sense that avoidance again. “He’s got some things to straighten out at home first.”<br/>My foot bounces under my robes, which I’ve only taken to wearing lately out of laziness. To be true, I like the newer muggle styles, in bright colors and rich fabrics. Things I can’t afford anymore. No matter—two days, and I might have someone to talk to! <br/>“Well, I must be off, my dears. Lot’s to prepare.” She deftly places a kiss on Ari’s cheek and squeezes my hand. “I think this will be good for you, Albus.”<br/>There’s a sharp punch of longing in my chest when I respond, “I hope so.”<br/>“Mmhmm.” Bathilda points her wand at our teapot, lifting the strainer and pouring the tea leaves into the trashcan. “Now don’t look too closely, boy. You’ll see that all of our futures are full of…soggy tea leaves.” She snorts.<br/>I force out a weak chuckle. “Good old Divination.”<br/>“Watch it, Albus. Nothing is good and old until you’re my age.” Bathilda winks. “Try not to look into the void until then!”</p>
