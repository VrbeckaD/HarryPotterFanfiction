    <p>    "Is him? Is it really him?" A chubby-cheeked kid murmured loudly from the corner of the table in front of them, one of his hands wrapping tightly to a chicken leg. </p><p>    </p><p>    "You'd check your glasses, Tom! That obviously isn't him! He's black hair, not dark red!" Another kid (that apparently knew the other) snapped. They're wearing the designated pitch-black robes, if Harry hadn't noticed the blonde girl near them,<em> Hannah Abbott</em>, he wouldn't have known that those kids were from Hufflepuff.</p><p>    </p><p>    "But look at his eyes! — They're as green as it's described!" Tom, the same boy from the first time exclaimed. He kind of reminded Harry of his muggle cousin, Dudley. They gave him the same impression of <em>spoiled-also-mean-but-couldn't-kill-a-fly-even-if-they-tried-with-their-meaty-fingers</em>, something strange coming from a Hufflepuff child from Harry's view.</p><p>    </p><p>    "Tom. C'mon mate, he's a kenspeckle person! — With his glasses, his messy hair, his peely-wally complexion and (over everything) his lightning scar. — That's not him!"</p><p>    </p><p>    "But—" Tom seemed like he wanted to continue, he was cut off though.</p><p>    </p><p>    "Could you please stop talking? You're doing quite the scene." </p><p>    </p><p>    The other closed Tom's mouth as quickly as possible due to Susan Bones, she was a shy, nice and she had an almost Weasley type of red hair. Became a bit 'popular' — you could say — because of her cuteness. </p><p>    </p><p>    "Thank you."</p><p>    </p><p>    "You-you are wel-welcome, Susie." Of course, the kid flustered, — <em>Tom</em> <em>didn't seem like it though</em>, he was probably annoyed of the hand on his mouth judging by the way he was scowling at it.</p><p>    </p><p>    They didn't say anything more than a few faint comments here and there — after that. </p><p>    </p><p>    Harry was sort of used to hear people talking of him in a certain manner, despite the fact that it didn't change the way he felt about it. He didn't deny being Harry Potter, but he also wasn't shouting it at every corner of Hogwarts, but — again — he only said his identity face to face to people who he knew wouldn't do anything to him. In spite of sometimes making him feel kind of stupid, he had to be careful and use the fact that Harry Potter wasn't the most unusual name — how many were out there? There had to be at least one hundred more (and augmenting) undoubtedly. In short... his feelings about it were pretty <em>complicated</em>.</p><p>    </p><p>    After lunch, the murmurs continued — the same as in all these few weeks he'd been at Hogwarts — and he went outside of the Great Hall. He didn't notice Ron, who sneaked after him. He became a friend to him, since the time they'd met at the Hogwarts Express. He still remembered that day. He'd said farewell to his dad, then he'd gotten into the train and found himself waiting in the middle of the corridor while Ron's big brother (Bill) and Ron's big brother's girlfriend (May) had been carrying the boy's trunk — without magic.</p><p>    </p><p>    "You know you don't have to do this, right?" That was the first line he heard from his friend. His three principal characteristics called to him: short straight fiery red hair — pretty distinctive from afar and basically the opposite of Harry's dark red —, nearly washed-out blue eyes and a pale face littered with countless freckles.</p><p>    "We do, but we prefer doing it this way, also I want to see that girl Percival won't stop talking about," the girl remarked with a grin, "I want to embarrass him in revenge."</p><p>    "May is just putting up an excuse (that probably she's going to make valid soon, to be honest) — and actually, we'll miss you." Ron's brother said as they left the trunk inside the compartment.</p><p>    "Believe me you won't miss me more than I missed you before. Perce wasn't the best big brother, he was rather clueless about it, I had to take the role and it was a mess — Bill, please tell me your secret." </p><p>    "I'll tell you when you come back, alright?." It was stated like a promise, something not that weird if they thought about the chaos that was outside.</p><p>    Despite the fact that Hogwarts was the safest place, classes had been almost suspended, everyone was waiting for Harry Potter to appear, as many good people as the ones in the other side — Death Eaters (and one in specific whose name shall not be said). </p><p>    </p><p>    Regardless, after that, Ron and Harry had been left in the compartment with a pregnant silence between them. Which had ended in a not so common way — by the sound of Ron almost dropping his cassette tape and catching it mid-air with shaky hands. Harry was familiar with muggle technology, after all, he'd lived in Muggle England since he was two years old. In a curious flash, he'd asked Ron what's he listening to — "Stone Roses" he'd answered. He hadn't heard of them — and he had admitted it to the redhead — a fact that he had thought it would end the conversation.... Nonetheless, that had led to Ron spilling information about muggle music.</p><p>    It'd been quite a simple topic which had caused a domino effect in their chatter, making them quickly acquaintances and (after a few minutes) friends.</p><p>    </p><p>    Cutting briefly these memories, Harry had just noticed the fact that he was in the middle of an almost crowded hall. It seemed that while he was recalling those events, everybody had finished their feast, therefore, now everyone was going back to their business. He'd to go back to business himself too — first, he'd to rack his brain to remember the direction of the dorms, though — in an ocean of plain black robes (some of them with colourful needlework but lacking size to distinguish) it was easy to lose yourself.</p><p>    </p><p>    "You seem sad, mate. I'm not the best at comforting — but don't worry, that was clishmaclaver, completely gormless... You'd ignore them." Well, Ron had just achieved the goal of scaring the hell out of him.</p><p>    </p><p>    "<em>For the Bloody Baron</em>, Ron, you scared me!" A mix of a sigh and a chuckle left Harry's lips, besides him, his friend snorted. "Thank you though."</p><p>    </p><p>    "At least you're smiling now — that's good." He said while showing one of his own smiles and leaving his headphones (he had been wearing them) inside his robe pockets. "Also, did you hear Susan Bones?"</p><p>    </p><p>    "The shut your traps part?" Harry asked while they got on one of the many corridors, he was simply following Ron around but he was sure it was the right path.</p><p>    </p><p>    "Yeah, she's so cool... " Ron had dreamy eyes...</p><p>    </p><p>    "Oh no," Harry smirked.</p><p>    </p><p>    "What's up?" Ron's head turned to him while they went downstairs, the dim light revealing a frown of concern in his face.</p><p>    </p><p>    "Don't tell me you fancy her." He shot an accusing finger at his friend.</p><p>    </p><p>    Ron accelerated his walk through the common room and to their assigned shared bedroom until his left hand reached the knob of the door. "Oh c'mon, mate, I only said she's—"</p><p>    </p><p>    "Hello there, you're late, you <em>blood traitors</em>."</p>
