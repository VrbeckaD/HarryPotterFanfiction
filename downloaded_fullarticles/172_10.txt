  <strong> <u>Tuesday, January 7<sup>th</sup></u> </strong>
</p><p>Fourteen-year-old brother trio Alvin, Simon, and Theodore Bagdasarian have been living with their foster father David “Dave” Seville for almost a week. Alvin, a freshman, acts out. Though he doesn’t want to go back to the foster home, he also doesn’t want another family to try and separate them or give them back. Theodore, another freshman, is excited to have another family. He has high hopes for this one, although the same could be said for all of them. Simon, a sophomore, loves his brothers but trusts no one else.</p><p> </p><p>That being said, Simon is the teenager who sticks back to talk to David when they’re off to walk around town.</p><p> </p><p>“David… could we borrow your gold watch today?”</p><p> </p><p>“My gold watch?”</p><p> </p><p>The man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the watch. He looks between the object and the young man in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you have trouble keeping time?”</p><p> </p><p>Simon shrugs. “We’re the new kids again. Look, I’ll be straight with you. I’m going to the library, and the boys are going to the park. Alvin and I’ll be fine, but Theo could use it.”</p><p> </p><p>Dave nods in understanding. He hands off the watch, and Simon thanks him wordlessly. Simon adjusts his glasses as he hands the watch off to his shortest brother.</p><p> </p><p>“Here, Theo. You’re in charge of Alvin and keeping time. Remember seeing that rock fountain outside the deli?” Theo nods, with his mouth watering at the thought. “Meet me there in three hours, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay!” He grins, pocketing the watch.</p><p> </p><p>The brothers go their separate ways, each with a different mindset on their current predicament.</p><p> </p><p>Seventeen-year-old senior Maya Gallo has been interning at the Inquisitor since October. Her dream is to have her name on hard-hitting articles in magazines to be proud of. Her boss Christy, however, generally exists to make that dream impossible. Maya paces back and forth in her small, open cubicle with her phone glued to her ear. She barely started typing the latest article when she had an itch to call the man in charge of this column.</p><p> </p><p>“Bill, hi. It's Maya Gallo.”</p><p> </p><p>The man on the other line grunts. “The intern kid?”</p><p> </p><p>“You remember me. Do you really want to start tonight's news off with a story on strippers?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I do. Do you have a better idea, monthly intern girl?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, call me crazy, but it <em>is</em> MLK Day.”</p><p> </p><p>“And I’m Director of the column. Keep up with this another two or three years, and you can spout out all the shit you want.”</p><p> </p><p>Maya is offended when Bill hangs up on her. She sets the phone down and stares at the paper in front of her, reading out the pen scrawls.</p><p> </p><p>“Could this job get any worse? Who wrote this garbage? <em>East Oaks city police officials report a decrease in gang violence</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Christy steps into her cubicle, snatching the notebook from the girl’s hands. “That would be <em>my</em> garbage. And quit making it sound so clinical.” She leans over Maya and edits the words. <em>East Oaks city police officials tell me gang violence is down.</em> “There. Now I am involved in the story.”</p><p> </p><p>“Y’know, you’re right.” Maya nods. “People would <em>love</em> to see you involved in gang violence.”</p><p> </p><p>“Is that a joke at my expense?” She huffs. “It is, isn’t it? Okay, you seem to be forgetting I have been working the liaison news for more than two years. And you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Three months,” Maya mumbles, head ducking down.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever.” She rolls her eyes. “Make changes and send them to the Teleprompter. I need to give the news to the station.”</p><p> </p><p>Maya groans and mumbles to herself as Christy walks away. The teen girl cracks her knuckles and starts typing. In front of the Inquisitor building, Christy acts as the liaison for the news crews. She grips her microphone and begins reading her new copies off the Teleprompter.</p><p> </p><p>“New hope in the city's war on gangs. Police officials tell me gang violence is down since last year. They tell me they credit the decrease to the removal of the frontal lobe of my brain. In a related story, I wet myself.”</p><p> </p><p>Christy blinks after hearing herself. When the cameras turn away from her, she storms back into her offices. Maya is at her desk, having already packed a box. A look passes between them, and Maya knows she’s not coming back. A short drive later, Maya walks into her basic apartment in Lava Springs. She absently notices three young teenagers yelling at two older boys across the street.</p><p> </p><p>Seventeen-year-old senior Jesse Parcell snorts as his eighteen-year-old delinquent best friend Frank Puckett steals a golden watch from Theo.</p><p> </p><p>“… because it’s mine!” He whines. “Alviiin!”</p><p> </p><p>His ball-capped brother steps in front of the bullies and Simon places a hand on the shorter boy’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t just steal that watch from my brother!” Alvin demands. “It’s not worth much, but my brother loves that watch!”</p><p> </p><p>Frank leers at him and shoves him back easily. There are a good two feet between them height-wise, and Alvin’s voice squeaks. The younger boy topples backward, causing the three boys to fall to the ground. Jessie snags the watch from his friend, grinning at the fallen kids.</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks for the keepsake boys. Maybe I’ll melt it down for some gold bullets, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>The older boys walk away, leaving the dejected Bagdasarians on the ground.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey!” Maya’s eighteen-year-old roommate Autry Wolf calls out from the kitchen when she steps into their apartment. “I’m glad you’re home.”</p><p> </p><p>“I have big news.” Maya grins, setting down her bag and keys and plopping onto the couch next to him.</p><p> </p><p>“Me too.” Autry smiles. “You go first.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, so I got fired, but I had this job interview,”</p><p> </p><p>“No, okay. Me first. Know how I’m working back at the old high school right?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s my rival school, Autry. How could I not?”</p><p> </p><p>He rolls his eyes at her sarcasm. “Okay, so I was in the teacher’s lounge and eating my raisins. The new gym teacher walks in, Miss Shieldmeyer, and I ask her out.”</p><p> </p><p>Maya’s eyebrows rise. “She said yes?”</p><p> </p><p>Autry deflates. “That would’ve made a better story. So, you got fired again. Did you get the new one? Who’s it with?”</p><p> </p><p>“Newsweek. And, well, it’s down to me and this girl, Dee-Dee. Very affectionate. Even hugged when we left.”</p><p> </p><p>The rest of their afternoon is filled with popcorn and binging on Netflix.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong> <u>Wednesday, January 8<sup>th</sup></u> </strong>
</p><p>Early in the morning, Simon carries a magazine as he walks into Alvin’s room. He stops in front of the TV set, disrupting Alvin and their other brother from playing a video game. Simon ignores Alvin’s complaints and instead shoves the magazine in his face.</p><p> </p><p>“Look at these <em>real stories</em>, Al. Real teenagers who got bullied from around the nation. Know what they all have in common?”</p><p> </p><p>“They all got their watches stolen?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, Theo.” Simon sighs. “They all got back. They stood up to their bullies. I think it’s time we do the same.”</p><p> </p><p>Although Theo is nervous and Alvin is skeptical, they pause their game and join Simon in his room to come up with a plan. A few hours later, Maya has just gotten out of the shower when she gets a phone call. There are no more teacher workdays until school starts, so Autry is home, fixing a sandwich.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello, Maya Gallo speaking.”</p><p> </p><p>“Miss Gallo, this is Veronica Winchester from Newsweek. We’ve checked your references.”</p><p> </p><p>“… is that a good thing?” She asks after a long pause.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re going with Darileanah Cressida.”</p><p> </p><p>“You mean Dee-Dee?” Maya asks incredulously. “But… we hugged.”</p><p> </p><p>Victoria hangs up on her, and Maya groans. Keeping aware of the towel covering her body, she falls onto the couch. Autry walks over and slides over two dishes with a sandwich on each. Maya waves hers off.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t want to work for a hugger. They wrinkle your clothes.” He considers it a success that he makes her smile.</p><p> </p><p>“God, you know, you make one liason cry on the air, and all of a sudden, you've got an attitude.”</p><p> </p><p>Autry nods. “Know what? I’m just gonna throw this out there.”</p><p> </p><p>Maya looks over and cuts him off. “I am <em>not</em> going to go see my father. I haven’t seen him since the wedding. <em>Three</em> years ago.” Autry nods again. “He married the senior year homecoming queen when I was a freshman. What kind of a man does that?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ding.” Autry ticks an invisible mark in the air. “What is a rich man?”</p><p> </p><p>“Augh.” Maya groans and grabs her sandwich. “Just shoot me now.”</p><p> </p><p>In a double-decker Phildale house, a woman wearing a blue and white polka-dotted housecoat has been completing chores around the house while her thirteen-year-old eighth grader son, Brother, reads his comic books on the couch, and her twelve-year-old seventh grader daughter, Sister, competitively jumps rope down the sidewalk. She comes to the siblings’ shared room and becomes enraged.</p><p> </p><p>“Brother! I have told you and Sister time and time again to clean your room!”</p><p> </p><p>“It looks fine in there!” He shouts back without bothering to check.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine!? There are food wrappers on the dresser, clothes strewn around the bed, your birdhouse is crushed to pieces, and I can see spiders!”</p><p> </p><p>Brother is at her side in an instant. “Ah, no! My birdhouse!”</p><p> </p><p>It took him most of last semester to build the birdhouse for his technology class. He was very proud of it. His mama tsks. “Go ahead and get started cleaning. I’m going to call Sister and have her come home and help.” As she pulls a phone from her pocket, she adds, “And don’t think I don’t know that most of this mess is yours.”</p><p> </p><p>Alvin, Simon, and Theodore return to the park with a remote-control airplane. Simon grabs the remote and hides behind a low wall. While he’s five inches taller than Alvin, he’s still a short teenager. Alvin runs off toward the pond, leaving Theo alone with the plane. He pretends to fly it while it never leaves his hand. Ten minutes later, Jesse and Frank spot him. The older boys gang up on him quickly.</p><p> </p><p>“Look at that, Frankie! The little turd has another gift for us.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, it’s mine, you big bullies!” Theo protests.</p><p> </p><p>“Ooh, look who gained some backbone!” Jesse taunts again.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m warning you,” Theo claims with his voice wavering. “My fighter jet pilot doesn’t like bullies! He might attack!”</p><p> </p><p>The boys laugh it off, and Theo chucks the plane in the opposite direction. The older boys watch, and Jesse nudges Frank to chase after it. Simon grabs control of the plane and uses it to swoop toward Frank’s face but zip up in time. The plane continues in this fashion, and it begins to chase Frank. Jesse looks suspicious, but Alvin takes the divided attention and sneaks up behind him.</p><p> </p><p>Theo is watching the plane scene with a curious grin. The plane chases Frank into the pond screaming, and then it turns on Jesse. The older boy doesn’t look scared, so Simon heads to his hair like a buzzsaw. The plane’s front blade dips down and pulls out a small patch of hair. Jesse yelps in surprise.</p><p> </p><p>“Dunno who the hell is flying that thing, but you are so dead!”</p><p> </p><p>He turns to chase the plane, but he trips over Alvin. Both boys fall, but Jesse ignores the other in favor of chasing the toy. When the older boy fell, the pocket watch fell out, and Theo managed to grab it. He helps Alvin to his feet, and they walk over to where Simon is sitting on the wall, feet barely dangling.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not flying the plane anymore?” Alvin cocks his head, watching Jesse chase the plane. “Where is it?”</p><p> </p><p>Simon shrugs. “Sold it to a kid. We got the watch back, and I made ten bucks.”</p><p> </p><p>“And you sold my plane.” Alvin frowns.</p><p> </p><p>“Bigger picture, Al. Bigger picture.”</p><p> </p><p>Alvin grumbles to himself as the boys walk back home. In the Phildale house, Sister has picked up her share of the room. She’s also picked up the old wrappers, so they won’t be inviting any more spiders. Brother loudly groans as he swipes up a few old board games they never play anymore.</p><p> </p><p>“I have an idea!”</p><p> </p><p>Sister looks up from her desk where she’s setting out her coloring books. “Hire someone?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sorta.” He dials a familiar number and grins when his cousin picks up. “Hey, Freddie. Wanna make some money?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not right now, Brother. I’m actually kind of busy.”</p><p> </p><p>Brother deflates. “Doing what?”</p><p> </p><p>“I just bought a mobile plane, and I’m down at the park in Lava Springs.”</p><p> </p><p>“Lava Springs?” He sighs. “Alright… have fun.”</p><p> </p><p>“No luck?” Sister questions without looking up from her picture when the phone call ends.</p><p> </p><p>“No luck.”</p><p> </p><p>“You need better organization skills. Even your locker at school is a mess.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong> <u>Thursday, January 9<sup>th</sup></u> </strong>
</p><p>Brother has tried to fix his room, but he has too many things. He keeps causing avalanche after avalanche. His mama walks in around noon with her hands on her hips. His papa is behind her. He’s disappointed, but not upset, as he sets down five crates. His papa walks away, and his mama approaches him.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, Brother. It’s time. I need you to find some games you never play, books you never read, and the clothes you never wear. We’re going to have a yard sale.” She drops an additional box on Sister’s desk, where she’s coloring again. “Sister, find some things you don’t use too. Papa and I will do the same.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong> <u>Friday, January 10<sup>th</sup></u> </strong>
</p><p>Freshman Strawberry Shortcake Heinke wakes up energetically. After brushing her teeth in the shower, she puts on her sparkiest T-shirt and bedazzled jeans. She grabs her favorite strawberry-adorned headband and comes to a stop in the middle of the kitchen. It’s eerily quiet. Usually, her seven-year-old second-grader sister Apple would be running around, or her mom would be baking a delicious snack for later.</p><p> </p><p>“Mom? Apple?” Strawberry calls out to no avail.</p><p> </p><p>Her dog, Pupcake, wakes up and toddles over. She allows him to lick her hand as she slumps in a chair at the table.</p><p> </p><p>“Where are they, Pupcake? I can’t believe they forgot my birthday.” She glances over to her keys hanging on the wall by the fridge. “Maybe Bev remembered.”</p><p> </p><p>Strawberry feeds her dog and grabs her keys. She grabs her helmet on the way out and jumps onto her electric scooter. She’s off today at the Decoy Café, but she decides it’s the best place to start.</p><p> </p><p>Back in Lava Springs, seventeen-year-old junior Phil Lester feels like he’s ten years younger. When another hamster is born, he carefully wraps it up and hands it off to his mum Kathryn. Seven have been born so far, and Kathryn has already told him that he can’t keep any.</p><p> </p><p>“How ‘bout I just keep the runt o’ the litta?”</p><p> </p><p>“Phil,” She looks at him pointedly. “How’s that cactus from Christmas?” He blanches and looks at the ground. “My point.”</p><p> </p><p>Down in Phildale, the Bears’ yard sale is underway. It’s nearly seven in the morning, and the kids are chugging some sweet lemonade to keep awake. Brother’s classmates Zack and Cody Martin are two of the first to stop by. Zack makes a beeline to the table with the comic books, while Cody gravitates toward the IKEA furniture. Eleven-year-old sixth-grader Lulu Lassiter pleads with her mom Mona to stop at the sale, though Mona stays in the car. Seventeen-year-old seniors Buford Pugh and Jacob Rosenberg also join the sale while riding by on skateboards.</p><p> </p><p>Lulu finds a boombox and is shocked by the sound quality. She notices an opening for a microphone and walks up to the kids throwing the sale.</p><p> </p><p>“You want the boombox?” Brother asks begrudgingly. “Five dollars.”</p><p> </p><p>“Excuse me?” Sister scoffs. “That’s <em>my</em> radio. Eight dollars. Nine, if you want me to throw in the attachable microphone.”</p><p> </p><p>Lulu grins inwardly, the two acting like her and her brother. She thrusts out a ten-dollar bill. “Microphone, please. Keep the change.”</p><p> </p><p>Buford finds a helmet with an image of a basketball net on the side and calls out his friend’s attention.</p><p> </p><p>“Why do you need that? You don’t even play basketball; you play hockey!”</p><p> </p><p>Buford contemplates this, and then he grabs a powder blue spray paint can that’s a similar color to the background shade of the image. Jacob grins approvingly and grabs a black spray paint can.</p><p> </p><p>“Good idea! We can color out the backboard and add a hockey puck!”</p><p> </p><p>“Wow! That’s better than my plan to spray paint ourselves so we blend in with the picture!”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah…”</p><p> </p><p>The boys buy the items, and Buford hangs back. “Since I’m getting this one, you can sell my old one.” He hands Brother the helmet off his head and races after Jacob.</p><p> </p><p>Brother turns to Sister. “If I sell it, does the money go to him?”</p><p> </p><p>She starts to nod then stops. “I’m not sure. Who is he?”</p><p> </p><p>Brother blinks. “I don’t know.”</p><p> </p><p>They’re interrupted by another customer. Police officer Blue Backstrom is holding a crate of model airplanes.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re an aviation enthusiast, Sir?” Brother asks, grabbing the toolbox with the money inside. “You can have the whole lot for twelve dollars.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hardly.” The man scoffs, handing him a twenty-dollar bill. “I don’t understand why you kids like this crap. My son was crazy about kites. Best thing for him was when those wolf boys stole it.”</p><p> </p><p>“… if you don’t like model airplanes, why are you buying them?” He asks, handing back the change.</p><p> </p><p>“To burn the hideous things, of course.”</p><p> </p><p>Blue walks away without a second glance, but Brother is angry. In the Lava Springs park, Apple has gathered with her twenty-one-year-old sister Custard, and Strawberry’s closest friends – fourteen-year-old freshmen Sally Brown, Katara DeWhit, and Kuki Sanban. Fifteen-year-old sophomore Buster Baxter was invited to help, but he’s sleeping in.</p><p> </p><p>“So, what kind of party are we going to throw?” Sally asks. “We need to decide on something.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay.” Katara concedes. “What do we know about Strawberry?”</p><p> </p><p>“She loves to dance!” Apple smiles, twirling. “So, we need to have music.”</p><p> </p><p>“And she gardens,” Kuki adds. “So, we should throw it in the flowery part of the park.”</p><p> </p><p>“And we need to have room for soccer.” Custard cuts in.</p><p> </p><p>“I have a devious idea,” Katara admits. “Strawberry’s a great cook. What if we lured her out of the house and took some of the food already made in the house?”</p><p> </p><p>“Very sneaky.” Kuki agrees. “But how do we get her out?”</p><p> </p><p>“First,” Custard stands. “We need to make sure she’s still home. Alright. Apple, you and Sally set things up in the garden area. Kuki, go find Buster. Katara, come with me to find where Strawberry is.”</p><p> </p><p>The friends break and go their separate ways. Hours later, near noon, they get the same text message from Strawberry: ‘Hey, I was going to check in with Mom at the Berry Café. Want to come with? Lunch is on me!’</p><p> </p><p>‘Gardening’ is the excuse Apple and Sally give her, which makes the redhead more upset. ‘Shopping’ Katara writes while trying to balance some desserts the Heinkes have made in the past few days. ‘Watching a movie’ is what Custard types while keeping a low-profile watch on Strawberry standing beside her scooter outside the Decoy Café. ‘At a yard sale’ is what Strawberry reads from Kuki. The redhead pockets her phone and climbs on her scooter, setting off toward her mom’s work.</p><p> </p><p>Kuki squeals and picks out two Rainbow Monkeys. A white one is dressed in woolly clothes and a red one dressed as a detective.</p><p> </p><p>“Look! Snowday Rainbow for me, and Sooper Sleuth Rainbow for you!”</p><p> </p><p>Buster grins. “I didn’t know they made one like a detective.” He digs through Sister’s old dolls and plushies, pulling out a green Monkey dressed as a chef. “How’s this one for Strawberry?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ooh!” She gushes. “Sprinkle Kisses Baking Bonanza Rainbow Monkey! She’ll love it!”</p><p> </p><p>“Score!” A nearby voice calls out. “A Jolly Roger case. Perfect fit for my boomerang!”</p><p> </p><p>“Sokka, tell me we did not come here for your boomerang.”  A very flamboyant teenager complains.</p><p> </p><p>He’s dressed in shades of pink and purple with a fuzzy peach vest to accent the outfit. His twin brother is wearing a navy blue hoodie and purple violet sweatpants.</p><p> </p><p>“Great. You found your case.” He grumbles. “Let’s go.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hi, Sokka!” Kuki bounces over. “Who’re your friends?”</p><p> </p><p>The fifteen-year-old sophomore grins, though a flush betrays his emotions. “H-hi, Kuki. The pink one is Glanni, and the sulking one is Robbie. They go to school with me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Cool!” She smiles. “Well, we need to go. We just stopped by to find a present for Strawberry’s birthday. Bye!”</p><p> </p><p>“Bye, Kuki!”</p><p> </p><p>Fifteen-year-old sophomore Glanni Glaepur nudges Sokka with a shit-eating grin. “You got it bad for that chick.”</p><p> </p><p>Sokka blushes further. He grabs a lilac feather boa and shoves it at him before walking away. Glanni inspects the item and wraps it around his neck.</p><p> </p><p>“It goes, hmm?”</p><p> </p><p>Robbie looks up and snorts. “Goes in the trash.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why’d I ask you? Look at what you’re wearing.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s <em>January</em>. I’m not starting back my junior year as a popsicle.”</p><p> </p><p>Glanni tsks and heads toward the checkout. Robbie follows, grabbing a quantum mechanics book and a palette from Charlotte Tilbury.</p><p> </p><p>“Mama!” Sister calls out. “How much did you want for your makeup?”</p><p> </p><p>As the girl and her mom discuss what price should be paid, Robbie scoops up a handful of dried leaves from the ground. Sister turns back to her customer with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>“The makeup is fifteen dollars, and you can have the book for free.”</p><p> </p><p>Robbie hands her the leaves, now glamoured to appear as money. He claims to give her twenty, and he receives five dollars in change.</p><p> </p><p>In the park, Apple, Custard, Sally, Katara, and Kuki have everything set up. A soccer goal, ball, and cones are set up near the picnic ‘lunch’ in the garden area past the bridge and pond. Gifts are lined up on a low wall, and upbeat dance music is playing. Buster catches Strawberry on the sidewalk as she leaves the Berry Café.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Strawberry!” He runs up and surprises her with a hug. “Happy birthday!”</p><p> </p><p>She grins. “You remembered.”</p><p> </p><p>“I did better than that.”</p><p> </p><p>Buster hands over the gift bag he’s carrying, and Strawberry pulls out the chef-like Rainbow Monkey. She thanks him earnestly.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve got another surprise, but we need to travel there.”</p><p> </p><p>“I only have the one helmet.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not far.” He insists. “It’s in town. Well, it’s in the park. Trust me?”</p><p> </p><p>She smiles and takes his hand. Leaving her scooter behind, Strawberry and Buster walk the fifteen-minute distance to the park. Crossing the bridge, she hears music and wonders aloud what might be happening.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe it’s a welcome party for aliens!” He suggests excitedly. “Let’s go see!”</p><p> </p><p>She laughs but runs after him. She slows when he disappears around a large shrubbery, and she claps her hands over her face when she sees her friends.</p><p> </p><p>“Is <em>this</em> why you’ve all been busy today? This is fantastic! Thank you!”</p><p> </p><p>Katara brings out the cake that she, Apple, and Sally made. Back at the yard sale, it’s ending. The siblings start to clean up, though there’s not much remaining. All their baby belongings are gone. Most of papa’s tools and mama’s toiletries have been sold. Brother still has some old games and sports equipment, while Sister still has an array of books. Two people are browsing, and fourteen-year-old freshman Dan Howell rests his bicycle against the mailbox when he notices the <em>Origin of Symmetry</em> CD leaning against the stack of game boxes.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
  <strong> <u>Saturday, January 11<sup>th</sup></u> </strong>
</p><p>Fourteen-year-old freshman Spongebob Squarepants’s foghorn alarm clock goes off, waking him and his cat, Gary. Spongebob quickly dresses in brown pants, a white shirt, and a red tie. To prepare for the day, he attempts to lift a barbell but fails miserably. Skipping breakfast, Spongebob runs out the door, past his sixteen-year-old sophomore best friend Billy Uglio. Billy calls after him out the window and wishes him good luck. He then loses his balance and falls backward.</p><p> </p><p>Arriving outside the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob psyches himself up to answer the call of the Help Wanted sign in the window and ask for a job as a fry cook. However, his fears get the better of him and he turns to leave, only to find Billy in his way.</p><p> </p><p>“Billy? Weren’t you just…”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you gonna get a job here?”</p><p> </p><p>“I want to, Billy, but”</p><p> </p><p>“And then I can come here all the time and see you and order burgers, and you can make those burgers and then I can east burgers and then I’ll come back and”</p><p> </p><p>While Billy explains the job ideals to Spongebob, sixteen-year-old junior Squidward Tentacles is cleaning graffiti off the windows inside. Noticing the ‘Help Wanted’ sign, it clicks, and he quickly walks to the back room to talk to his boss and owner of the restaurant, Eugene H. Krabs.</p><p> </p><p>“Mr. Krabs, my idiot neighbor wants to work here. You can’t hire him.”</p><p> </p><p>“Eh? What’s the landlubber’s name?”</p><p> </p><p>Squidward shudders. “Spongebob Squarepants. Laughs like a freaking dolphin. And wears that stupid red tie to school every day.”</p><p> </p><p>The main door opens, and Mr. Krabs and Squidward reluctantly step out. Squidward crosses his arms, and Mr. Krabs puts his hands on his hips. Spongebob takes in a deep breath and confidently walks up to them.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m here to apply for the position of fry coo---ahh!” Before he can finish the statement, the young teenager trips over a loose board. He crashes into a table, flipping it and landing square on his back in front of them. “… fry cook of the Krusty Crew.”</p><p> </p><p>“How old are you, Kid?”</p><p> </p><p>“Fourteen. Ready to work, Sir!”</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Krabs looks over to Squidward and gives him a smirk. He looks back toward Spongebob and gives him a false grin.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell you what, Boy-o. You can apply for the job once you’ve gone out and bought a hydro-dynamic spatuler.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, Sir!” Spongebob salutes the man. He scrambles to his feet and runs out the door.</p><p> </p><p>Squidward looks over to Mr. Krabs as he returns to the windows. “You made it up, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Mr. Krabs nods minutely on his way to the backroom. “Sounds real, doesn’t it?”</p><p> </p><p>In a middle-class Lava Springs apartment, seventeen-year-old junior Phil Lester sits in front of his bed with a box of small, squirming fuzzy creatures in front of him. A video camera is facing him, lopsidedly balanced on a stack of random books and DVDs.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, guys!” He greets his viewers on the Internet. “So, my brother Martyn took me to the cinema yesterday. We saw <em>Open Grave</em>. There’s this man, played by Sharlto Copley who wakes up in a pit of dead bodies with no memory of who he is or how he got there.” Phil refocuses the camera, so it shows his plushy lion, named Lion, on a pile of dirty laundry.</p><p> </p><p>“So, he gets out of the pit, and he comes to this house. After he breaks in,” Phil grabs his plushy giraffe, named Daniel, and makes the giraffe hold a pencil at Lion. “Someone’s already inside with a gun. And the person inside makes him go to all these other people who don’t remember anything. And… I don’t want to reveal any more. You all should go watch it! It’s a great scary movie.</p><p> </p><p>“And, if any of you are wondering about his moving box in front of me,” He readjusts the camera, so it faces him again. “My hamster had her babies! She had <em>thirteen</em> babies. Can you believe it? Well, Kathryn wants me to find good homes for them all. We obviously can’t have any. And…” Cue black and white filter, and somber music. “Gerald the Cactus has died.” End filter and music.</p><p> </p><p>“If any of you guys want a hamster, I’m going to be setting out location meets on my social media. First things first, we need to meet the hamsters. There was one orange guy in the lot.” He pulls out the corresponding hamster. “His name is Dorito.” Phil places him back in the box after showing his audience the closeups on the hamster’s face, body, and tail. He then proceeds to introduce the other dozen hamsters.</p><p> </p><p>In the old, dilapidated Barg’N Mart in downtown Gotham, Spongebob has found the eluded hydro-dynamic spatula. He excitedly grabs it and carries it to the register.</p><p> </p><p>“That’ll be forty bucks, Pal.” A disinterested store clerk tells the young kid as he ducks from a flying bottle thrown through the window.</p><p> </p><p>“But… I only have twenty.” He frowns. “It’s really important that I have that spatula, Mister. Can’t I agree to do some work around here?”</p><p> </p><p>“Beat it, Kid. Forty bucks or no deal.”</p><p> </p><p>Before Spongebob can request something else in exchange, the door bursts open to reveal a gang. A woman with black pixie hair wearing very high heeled boots walks in first, followed quickly by a limping twenty-year-old college junior in a tailored suit. His bright blue eyes rival Spongebob’s. He holds an umbrella over the ganglord’s head. Trailing them are a twenty-two-year-old heavyset man and four other thugs. Everyone else has cleared away, aside from the man behind the register and the fourteen-year-old.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me… what’s your name, child?”</p><p> </p><p>“Leave ‘im alone, Fish.” The register man calls out, a little wavering in his voice.</p><p> </p><p>“Spongebob,” He informs her anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“Why pray tell, after everyone else scattered, are you still here?”</p><p> </p><p>He grabs the spatula from the counter. “I need this spatula, but it’s too expensive. I can only afford half.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, Mr. Mathison has that effect to scam the less fortunate. Boys?” Two of the thugs go behind the counter. One slams the man’s head into the counter while the other empties the register. Spongebob jumps when Fish speaks again. “Now, I think you’ve paid enough. Take your spatula and run along now.”</p><p> </p><p>Spongebob does as suggested. Fish snaps her fingers, and the thugs knock out the man before returning to her side. “Butch?” The heavyset man holds open the door; she nods. “Oswald?” The youngest of the gang holds the umbrella over her head; she nods again. “Let’s go, boys.”</p><p> </p><p>A couple of hours later, Spongebob gets off the city bus across the street from the Krusty Krab. Not letting a gang robbery deflect him from his current goal, he walks inside during a very busy hour. Squidward <em>and</em> Mr. Krabs are in back, making krabby patties.</p><p> </p><p>“I found the hydro-dynamic spatula, Sir!”</p><p> </p><p>He presents the device to the man, who shares a look with Squidward. Squidward rolls his eyes and nods, continuing to cook the burgers. Mr. Krabs reaches into the cabinet beside the grill and offers Spongebob a greasy, unwashed sailor hat.</p><p> </p><p>“Very good, me boy. Another wave of customers. I’ll go man the register. You boys make the food.”</p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t this great, Squidward?”</p><p> </p><p>Squidward doesn’t answer, as he’s concentrating on the patties. He tacks up the ‘secret formula’ for Spongebob to make them. After another grueling three hours, there are no more customers. There are thirty minutes left until closing, so Mr. Krabs tells his employees to clean the restaurant, and he leaves with a lot more cash in his wallet.</p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t this great, Squidward?” Spongebob asks again, twirling a mop.</p><p> </p><p>“You know that agreement we have about you not talking to me to, from, or during school unless it’s <em>absolutely</em> necessary?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yep!” He smiles toothily.</p><p> </p><p>“Same goes for work.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh.”</p><p> </p><p>Squidward grabs his work bag and removes his sailor hat. He’s almost out the door when Spongebob calls after him.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait! We’re not finished yet!”</p><p> </p><p>“I am. Clean the rest yourself, Fry Cook.”</p><p> </p>
