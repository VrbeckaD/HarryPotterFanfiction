  <strong>Chapter One: A Hearing to continue.</strong>
</p>
<hr/><p>The door opened and Harry Potter walked inside, finding a large room with an even large group of people beyond, and a lone chair sat out for him,</p><p>"Your Late" Barked the voice of Cornelius Fudge as Harry looked up he saw Fudge sitting facing the chair, "Sit"</p><p>Harry obeyed without second thought, and looked around. He saw a large crowd of elderly witches and Wizards, sitting in the very centre was Cornelius Fudge, to his left was a man that he knew had to be related to the Malfoy's, and on his right a women who looked like an overgrown toad, dressed all in pink.</p><p>"You are Harry James Potter, resident of Number 4 Private Drive?"</p><p>"Yes" Harry nodded,</p><p>"Interrogators, Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Order of Merlin First Class, Minister for Magic, Senior Undersecretary Dolores Jane Umbridge, Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magic Law Enforcement, Lord Cullen Malfoy, Special Advisor to the Minister and Rufus Scrimgeour, Head Auror" Fudge listed and Harry turned his head to see Percy scribbling down on a piece of parchment, his nose so close to the parchment, Harry wondered how the ink didn't rub off on it.</p><p>"And do you deny castin…" Fudge began before the door Behind Harry burst open and a Man stood framed in it, long black hair flowed down to his shoulders, pale skin made him have an almost ghost like appearance, however it was the eyes that drew Harry's attention, a fierce and bright ruby red, with a hint of gold in the very centre, he wore brilliant emerald robes that flowed around him, and when he walked forward they seemed to snap with magic,</p><p>As he did Harry could have sworn he saw Cullen Malfoy smirk and sit back, the man turned his eye on Harry and a small smile played about his mouth, "Mr Potter, a pleasure"</p><p>Harry turned to face Fudge who had gone very pale, "T-this d-dgoes not concern you Lord Greywalker, leave now"</p><p>"Ah but it does Minister, so for the record, Witness for the defence, Lord Carionax Vance Greywalker, and acting Legal advisor of Harry James Potter" The man smiled, he turned his head to Harry and he heard the same low hiss he recognised as Parseltounge, "<em>I am an ally and a friend</em>"</p><p>"I was not aware Mr. Potter had hired a Legal Advisor" Fudge replied,</p><p>"Well when I saw you were questioning a minor without parent, guardian or anyone to assist, I had to step in, so I shall be doing this for free" Carionax smiled, "And I have business with the Wizengamot anyway so as the muggles say two birds, one stone."</p><p>"Hem… yes as I was saying…." Fudge tried to begin again, but Carionax held up a hand,</p><p>"Cornelius, I would like a word with the five of you, Amelia, Cullen, Rufus and Umbridge if you will" Carionax smiled, and Harry watched as three nods followed before Umbridge shook her head,</p><p>"I don't think I will" Umbridge smirked, her toad like mouth showing her teeth,</p><p>Carionax seemed to stand taller at this, "Do I need to use my rank to order you Umbridge?" his voice had suddenly become colder and harder, and Harry watched as Lord Malfoy's lip twitched,</p><p>"Lord Greywalker, I will have to insist…" Umbridge scowled,</p><p>Carionax's eyes narrowed, "As chosen heir of the ancient and mostly noble house of Slytherin, and lord of the noble house of Greywalker and as under Lord of the Ancient and Noble House of Flint… along with my own office as Light Lord, I hereby order you to comply with the order I have given, if I you do not, I am authorized to hereby remove you from office and send you to Azkaban for obstruction of my investigation!" his voice now cold as ice, and Harry felt a small wave of magic wash over him.</p><p>"I of course would be more than happy to help you, Carionax, by the way, might I ask after dear Hyacinth?" Cullen Malfoy asked,</p><p>Carionax's posture changed at once, "She is well, you must come over it has been to long"</p><p>"Indeed, come Umbridge, lest you wish to feel the Dementors up close" Cullen scowled, with that the five interrogators walked out of the chamber, and with a flick of his cloak, Carionax followed.</p><p>Harry sat there for what felt like an hour, before they all returned, Carionax looking smug.</p><p>"So!" Carionax smirked, "I believe you were about to list the charges?"</p><p>"Of course" Fudge nodded, and opened his scroll again, "Harry James Potter of Number Four Private Drive, you are charged that on the 2nd August 1995, you performed underage magic in the presence of a muggle, do you deny such an event took place?"</p><p>Harry began to speak before Carionax raised a hand, a small smile on his face, "The spell that was cast was a Patronus charm yes?"</p><p>"That is what we believe yes" Amelia Bones nodded,</p><p>"Hmm, Impressive" Carionax nodded, "Patronus' are used to repel dark creatures such as Lethifolds or Dementors… Mr Potter, were either such creature in the alleyway that day, and when you answer look me in the eyes"</p><p>Harry looked up and into the red eyes, "There were two Dementors, one was about to kiss my cousin"</p><p>"Very good" Carionax smirked, turning back to the Wizengamot, "As many of you will be aware, I am an extremely proficient natural Legillimens, and unless Mr Potter has had a great deal of Occlumency training, he is telling the truth, and I swear this by the ancient Magic's and upon my house name"</p><p>Fudge opened his eyes wide and scowled, "Maybe your losing your touch"</p><p>"If I am, how would I know that Umbridge is thinking about using a blood quill when she attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, or that the blood quill was taken illegally from the Forbidden Library underneath the Ministry by you Minister Fudge?" Carionax asked, "Or that Cullen is thinking about elf wine again… and Amelia is thinking about how many extra quills she will need for the coming year… and Rufus…. Dear Merlin…. I do not want to say what is in his head"</p><p>A small chuckle escaped the Wizengamot at this and Carionax smirked, before everyone snapped back to focus, "Blood Quill you say, Carionax?"</p><p>"Indeed, she currently has it hidden behind a hideous plate of a ginger tabby cat she call…" Carionax began before his face morphed into a distasteful scowl, "Mr Tubbywinkles"</p><p>Umbridge at this point fell off her chair, and Carionax smirked again, "We will send an Auror to check on this" Amelia nodded,</p><p>"So Mr Potter, would you be so kind as to either provide us with the memory, or would you go under Veritaserum?" Carionax asked</p><p>"Either" Harry spoke, "Whichever is easier"</p><p>"Excellent" Carionax nodded, "Veritaserum it is"</p><p>"Only a qualified Potion Master can administer it, and we don't have one here" Fudge protested,</p><p>"You insult me Fudge, I have a Mastery in Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration, Potions, Ancient Runes, Care of Magical Creatures and History of Magic, currently still studying Mastery's in Astronomy, Herbology, Arithmancy and Alchemy" Carionax listed, "Thus I am a Potion Master"</p><p>"Unfortunately as you are his Legal Advisor, we cannot use you, nor anyone related to you" Amelia told him,</p><p>"Then I can summon for one, I know of three that are free today, Potion Master Severus Snape, current Potion Master of Hogwarts, Former Potion Master of Hogwarts, Horace Slughorn, or Junior Lord.. Lucius Malfoy, it is of course your choice" Carionax smiled, turning to Harry, "Which would you prefer?"</p><p>"Snape, I know he's never tried to deliberately poison me" Harry replied, and Carionax smirked,</p><p>"<em>Expecto Patronum!" </em>Carionax called and a small silver dragon appeared, before flying off, "He will be here momentarily"</p><p>With that the door opened and Harry saw Snape walk in, his hair as greasy as he remembered, and his skin still as sallow,</p><p>"I upon my licence do herby swear that this potion is pure and unedited" Snape spoke calmly, before stepping to the side, Carionax catching his arm and whispered something to him, "Oh.. and Witness for the Defense, Severus Tobias Snape"</p><p>Harry was handed a potion and was about to drink it before he saw Snape shake his head,</p><p>"I want this understood, if Mr Potter is to be given the truth potion, if asked any questions, that are not part of this hearing, I will cast a silencing charm over him, as his professor I believe that is my right" Snape spoke, and Carionax nodded,</p><p>"I Quite agree" Carionax smiled, "You may drink Mr Potter, rest assured anything you do not wish to be heard, will not be"</p><p>Harry nodded and took a quick drink before he felt it, the strange floating feeling that Harry realised was much like the Imperius Curse,</p><p>"Mr Potter, did you cast the patronus?" Fudge asked,</p><p>"Yes"</p><p>"Even tho-" Fudge began before Carionax raised a hand,</p><p>"Why?" Carionax asked,</p><p>"Because of the Dementors, there were two" Harry replied,</p><p>"So under Potion that forces the truth from Mr Potter, he has sworn to the Dementors being present in that alleyway, and as per the law, Underage Wizards are allowed to use magic in life threatening circumstances.. and Dementors are certainly life threatening" Carionax nodded, "Merlin, I'd class it as the third most dangerous creature behind the Dragon and Nundu…"</p><p>"Well that certainly clears that charge" Amelia smiled, Carionax smiled and Snape handed Harry the Antidote, he blinked several times before looking around, "Your free to go Mr Potter, with our apologise, and promise that I will investigate the presence of the Dementors"</p><p>"Thank you Madam Bones" Harry smiled</p><p>"Now you said you have business with us?" Amelia asked turning to face Carionax</p><p>"Indeed, one matter containing Mr Potter, and two that do not, I will discuss this now with you" Carionax smiled, he flicked his hand and Harry felt the chair beneath him change to one that was far more comfortable.</p><p>"Now, we should discuss the guardianship of Harry James Potter, as it seems his current residence is not safe nor has he ever been" Carionax told them, "While in the custody of Albus Dumbledore, he has been forced to face Voldemort three times, in four years, and in his second year, faced a Basilisk"</p><p>It took Harry a couple of seconds to realise Carionax had used Voldemort's name, and another to wonder how he knew all he did</p><p>"So did you" Cullen muttered and Carionax smiled,</p><p>"But I faced mine by choice, and had a Guardian with me… Harry did not, he was alone" Carionax replied, "He has also faced an Army of Dementors in his third year, a Cerberus in his first, and then the whole Tri-wizard event…"</p><p>"So what do you propose?" Fudge asked, his voice strained,</p><p>"We place him somewhere more secure, with people who will help cut the strings" Carionax replied,</p><p>"Albus will not like this" Amelia spoke clearly,</p><p>The door opened at this point and Harry turned to see Dumbledore walk through, "What wont I like?"</p><p>"Albus, pleasure, how's old age?" Carionax asked, his voice pleasant.</p><p>Dumbledore turned and seemed to survey the scene, from Snape who stood with his back to the wall, watching, Harry in the green leather chair and Carionax standing between them, "Greywalker, how lovely to see you out of retirement"</p><p>"Well when the Dark Lord is walking around, I thought I should be active as well" Carionax replied, "Unless you think to take my place as Light Lord, Albus"</p><p>"I wouldn't dream of it" Dumbledore smiled slightly,</p><p>"Good" Carionax nodded, "Amelia, as I was about to say before we were oh so rudely interrupted, I couldn't give a Hydra's Rear what Albus thinks, I aim to provide the more steady, calm and relaxing place"</p><p>"Oh, so you would take in Mr Potter?" Amelia asked,</p><p>"Indeed" Carionax nodded, "Not only am I outside of Albus' influence, but he cannot touch me, and Voldemort… well let us say that he would think of assaulting Hogwarts before he attacked Greywalker manor, I also… as you are no doubt aware I have two children, so I have experience… We also have evidence, which Lord Snape can give that Mr Potter's home life has been less than pleasant"</p><p>"I believe Mr Potter is safe there, there are blood wards" Dumbledore smiled,</p><p>"Which any competent Wizard that knows the countercharm can break" Came Cullen's voice, "I agree with Cari- Lord Greywalker, Mr Potter needs a stable safe home, and from what I have seen, Lord Greywalker can offer this, it would be my recommendation to grant this request, after all, Mr Dumbledore…"</p><p>"Headmaster Dumbledore" Dumbledore corrected,</p><p>"Of course" Cullen smirked dangerously, "<em>Headmaster</em> Dumbledore could not be bothered to turn up on time for Mr Potter's hearing"</p><p>"The time was-" Dumbledore began,</p><p>"It is unforgiveable, If I… who did not Meet Mr Potter before today, was able to be… relatively on time, but his Guardian could not be" Carionax shook his head,</p><p>"Carionax behave" Amelia smirked, "I have heard enough for now, Lord Greywalker, you will gain temporary Custody of Mr Potter for the period of one year, if at the end of this time, there is reason to remove him from your care, he will be returned to the care of his muggle relatives"</p><p>"Thank you Amelia" Carionax bowed, "Now, I will ask one other matter to you Amelia… would you look into the case of Sirius Black for me? I have searched the records, but have found no record of a trial, hearing or any logs… I would hate to think an innocent man was sent to Azkaban for 13 years"</p><p>"I will indeed" Amelia nodded,</p><p>"Now wait just one moment!" Fudge spoke loudly, "I put Black in Azkaban myself, and you know why"</p><p>"And I always told you Cornelius, that I did not believe him to be capable" Carionax replied, "And after you <em>already</em> having one innocent man in Azkaban for a couple of months, I doubt you want it to come to light your forced two men into Azkaban for no crime committed"</p><p>"What's this?" Amelia asked, "Innocent man in Azkaban, what Innocent man in Azkaban?"</p><p>"Case 2213, Chamber of Secrets and Rubeus Hagrid, Mr Hagrid was falsely accused of having opened the chamber of secrets by Thomas Marvolo Riddle, later know as Lord Voldemort… when Voldemort reopened the chamber two years ago, Minister Fudge arrested Mr Hagrid and placed him in Azkaban without evidence, or any trial" Carionax replied,</p><p>"Is this true Cornelius?" Amelia asked,</p><p>"Maybe… yes… could be seen as the truth" Fudge replied,</p><p>"This could mean Fudge that the next person in that seat is you" Carionax smirked, and Harry watched Fudge squirm, "And the final issue is on the piece of paper I handed you Amelia, Rufus, Cullen, if you would be so kind as to uphold my request, I will do all in my power to stop that which needs to be stopped, and revive, that which needs to be revived, after all, Shadows have fallen"</p><p>"What are you doing?" Dumbledore asked,</p><p>"I'm sure you'll find out Albus" Carionax smiled, "Mr Potter, if you will follow me"</p><p>Harry nodded and rose, nodding to Dumbledore who smiled at him, and he followed as Carionax walked out of the courtroom, "Now, I think… it is time for some lunch, Hungry?"</p><p>Harry blinked and turned to face him, nodding once.</p><p>"Then we should head somewhere, I'm sure you have many questions, and yes before you ask, I do aim to have you returned to Sirius Black's custody by the end of the year, and Voldemort's downfall during that year" Carionax told him, "Now, there are press upstairs, where standing side-by-side, and announce Voldemort's return"</p><p>"But won't they say anything to disprove you?" Harry asked,</p><p>"Hmm, maybe… but with what I am about to say, they will have enough news to print for weeks" Carionax smiled as they walked down the corridor, and into the lift, "Oh, and when you are staying with me, I will begin your training in defence, it seems someone wants to kill you, and you may have to face them alone, I want you to be able use some magic they won't expect"</p><p>Harry nodded and the lift opened and Carionax swept out of the lift, Harry followed a step behind, and they saw a large crowd of cameras awaiting them,</p><p>"Good Afternoon Gentlemen, Ladies. I am Carionax Greywalker, and I'm sure you know Mr Potter, I am here to make a statement, after which, you may send your questions in a letter" Carionax told them,</p><p>"Earlier today, I received a disturbing report, I have received multiple reports from spies within the Death Eaters, confirming that Dark Lord Voldemort has indeed returned" Carionax spoke, holding a hand up he silence the crowd, "I intend to find the truth, however in order to do this, I am officially announcing of an organization, which I swear to you will find the truth of these rumors, and should they prove true, we will exterminate any and all true Death Eaters and the True Dark Lord… thank you"</p><p>Before Carionax could leave, one reporter asked, "What organization is that?"</p><p>"Dawn" Carionax asked,</p>
