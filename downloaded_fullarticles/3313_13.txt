    <p>Draco knows he’s lucky, all things considered.</p><p>His father was sent through the Veil as punishment for his crimes before and during the war. Most of the other Death Eaters received the same after their trials. Even Voldemort’s body was pushed through. It was deemed the only way to be sure they would never come back to power. Draco took the Dark Mark and he knows this should have been his fate as well, but Harry spoke to the Wizengamot on his behalf and so he was given a lighter sentence: two years in Azkaban.</p><p>Except that Azkaban was still in ruins from when Bellatrix and the other Death Eaters escaped. So the Ministry took over a maximum security facility that had once been used by muggles before it was abandoned. With the dementors all banished, a new branch of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement was created to maintain the facility. So even though it’s still a prison, it’s nothing like the Azkaban of the past.</p><p>That doesn’t mean Draco enjoys his time there. Most days he just lays on his cot or the floor of his cell and stares up to the ceiling. Cliché as it may be, he marks the passage of time on the wall of his cell. “<em>What was the point of all this?” </em>Draco thinks to himself during his imprisonment. <em>“I spend 730 days locked away and then what am I to do? It’s not as though anyone will give me a job. I didn’t even finish school! No one will want to teach me, either. I’d be better off staying here forever.”</em></p><p>When he’s not dreading the future, he thinks of his mother. Harry also spoke for her and since she does not have the Dark Mark, she remains free. She doesn’t come to visit him, and Draco doesn’t know if that’s because she isn’t allowed to or because she doesn’t want to see him. He isn’t sure which one he hopes is the real reason.</p>
<hr/><p>Two years go by. Two years of abuse from the guards and “accidentally” overturned food trays (but he’s so numb to it all now; it hasn’t fazed him in a long time). Then one day his cell is opened and he’s taken back to the Ministry. He’s told that he’s scheduled to speak with Minister Shacklebolt himself.</p><p>“Mister Malfoy, do have a seat,” the Minister says as soon as he’s brought inside the office. His voice is booming but there’s a small smile on his face that seems out of place considering the circumstances. Draco sits but he doesn’t relax, even into the softness of the leather chair. Shacklebolt steps around his desk and hands Draco a garment bag, seemingly out of nowhere. “This is from your mother. She provided us with proper clothes for you.”</p><p>“Why?” Draco asks with as little incredulity in his voice as possible.</p><p>“We find it easier for some to transition back into civilian life if they are showered and have a clean change of their own clothes. So, if you’ll follow me, please, I’ll take you to where the bath is.”</p><p>Draco does as he’s told (asked?) and has never been more thankful in his life for the water pressure the Ministry maintains in their showers. He scrubs at his skin until it’s pink and nearly raw and smelling sweetly of the floral soap provided. As always, he closes his eyes when washing the inside of his left arm.</p><p>When he’s thoroughly clean, Draco leaves the seclusion of the bath and exits back into the corridor where Shacklebolt is waiting on him. “Much better! Much better,” he booms. “Come. Follow me and we’ll talk about your future.”</p><p><em>“Future? What future could I possibly have?”</em> Draco thinks to himself, though he chooses to stay silent. He finds himself yet again being directed to sit across from the Minister. This time, however, he can stand the smell of himself and feels like a human being for the first time in a long time. Maybe Shacklebolt was on to something with that whole shower thing.</p><p>“Tell me, Mister Malfoy, what do you plan to do now that you’re a free man?”</p><p>“I-I’m not sure.” He tries not to stutter but he just can’t help it. He clears his throat in hopes of sounding more confident. “But if there’s a way I can begin to make amends, then I want to do it. I’ll take any opportunity you have.”</p><p>A real smile graces Shacklebolt’s face. “That’s what I was hoping you’d say. As it turns out, I have an opening for a volunteer position at the Children’s Centre that I think would be perfect for you.”</p><p>Even being in prison hasn’t stopped Draco from hearing about the facility Potter used his immense wealth to open. His eyes widen at the prospect of working for the Savior. “All due respect, sir, but I don’t know if that’s the best idea. Potter and I have a…contentious history.”</p><p>“I know all about your feud during your school days.”</p><p>“It’s more than that! We fought on opposite sides of a war!”</p><p>“Did you though?” When Draco’s face twists up in confusion, Minister Shacklebolt laughs. “I was there at the trials. I heard the testimonies. None of them painted you out to be a war criminal.” Then he leans in conspiratorially and lowers his voice, “Just between us, the Wizengamot was split on even sending you to prison and I voted in your favor. I was not so far out of adolescence during the first war and I remember what it was like to be young and put into positions I wasn’t ready for. I understand you, Mister Malfoy. I know that you’re more than the mark on your arm.”</p><p>Draco is clenching his teeth to fight back the tears. He just isn’t prepared for the kindness being shown to him. “What would I be doing?” he asks once he’s sure he can speak without crying.</p><p>“The centre provides many services to children both wizarding and muggle that have been affected by the war. But there’s one position they can never seem to keep filled for long, and I think you’d be the perfect fit.”</p><p>“What’s the catch?”</p><p>“There is a group within the Ministry that believes you have not yet paid your dues. Community service hours would go a long way to prove to them that you have.”</p><p>“And if I refuse?”</p><p>Shacklebolt leans back in his chair and smirks. “I have a feeling you won’t, but you’re no longer under Ministry custody and therefore cannot be forced to do anything. Why don’t you go home and think on it. Your mother is looking forward to your return.”</p><p>That’s the second time he’s mentioned Narcissa. “Is she okay? She never…” he trails off, unable to finish due to his recurring fear that she’d given up on him.</p><p>“She was denied visitation rights- again, against my wishes- and it’s been hard on her. I stopped by every so often to check on her. I think having you back will help a lot.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Draco says sincerely. “I don’t think I could ever repay you for your kindness. And forgive me if I say, it’s quite unexpected.”</p><p>“Not everyone is out to get you, Mister Malfoy, remember that. And there’s no need to pay me back, just pay it forward. Pass it along. That’s what I want from you.”</p>
<hr/><p>The Manor is eerie. Draco hates it the moment he steps through the floo. He calls for his mother but gets no response, so he goes off in search of her. He eventually finds Narcissa in her sitting room. She’s on the settee by the window, staring off into the back garden. She hugs Draco when he finally gets her attention, but there’s something off about her smile as though it doesn’t quite reach across her face.</p><p>They have supper (a simple soup that Narcissa tells him is a staple of her diet now) in the sitting room to avoid going into the dining room. Then Draco retires to his rooms, just glad to be sleeping in a real bed for the first time in over two years. In the morning his mother is right back to her spot by the window. She doesn’t say much but Draco can’t really blame her. Every time he tries to start a conversation with her, he can’t think of anything useful to say. The first few days together are filled with a tense silence that he just can’t seem to break. When the centre finally contacts him about coming in to start his hours, he’s relieved.</p>
<hr/><p>Draco is nervous at first about volunteering at the Children’s Centre, especially when he finds out exactly what position the Minister hand-picked him for. But in no time at all he finds himself enjoying it. He works mostly with the older children. The ones who saw the same things he saw and overheard the conversations that he was a part of. He talks with them openly about what it was like living under the same roof as Voldemort. What it was like to have a Death Eater as a father and to be groomed as one himself. How it felt when the Dark Mark burned into his flesh. This is actually the one place that Draco feels comfortable enough to roll up his sleeves and expose his arm. He’s not sure how much he’s helping them but they always seem grateful when he arrives for another shift.</p><p>The centre is often understaffed, and that’s the exact reason that one day Draco is called in early. Lisa Turpin greets him at the front desk. Conversation is a bit awkward between them at first, as they had several years of Astronomy and Ancient Runes together at Hogwarts, but she is kind and gives him simple directions to the room where the younger children meet. Draco thanks her and then prepares himself.</p><p>He walks cautiously into the room where the children are playing and the first thing that strikes him is how <em>small</em> they are. Draco can’t help but feel personally responsible for the ones with no families. He mostly colors pictures with them or plays with toys on the floor but at least doing that he can still feel useful in some small way. It gets easier the longer he’s with them, and the next time he looks up at the clock he’s surprised by how much time has passed.</p><p>Just as he’s about to leave the playroom to get lunch, a little girl stops him. She looks up at Draco with wide, grey eyes and he’s instantly startled. He’s seen those eyes staring back at him before. How is that possible? Sure, there are only so many colors that eyes can be, but take Potter for instance. He has ‘green’ eyes- that much is indisputable- but Draco has never seen another set of green eyes look as clear and vibrant. They put to shame every crisp, tart apple hanging on the tree. Even now he can imagine the way they used to sparkle in the candlelight of the Great Hall during a feast. So saying that this girl’s eyes are grey is, in fact, a lie. What he really means is that they are the exact same molten silver as his own.</p><p>“Umm, hello, little girl,” Draco says stiltedly. This is yet another reason why he chooses to work with the older children; at least <em>they</em> can hold a conversation.</p><p>“Hi,” she responds around the fingers in her mouth.</p><p>A few strands of hair are stuck between her fingers and Draco carefully extracts them, cringing the entire time. Yet as he does, he can’t help but recognize the beautiful mix of brown and blonde so different from his own yet so familiar. “There you are. You have very lovely hair.”</p><p>“Thank you.” She finally pulls the fingers out of her mouth and Draco watches the drool carefully, wishing he had his wand so that he could cast <em>impervious</em> on her clothes and his own. “Wha’s that?” she asks, pointing to where to the Dark Mark is peeking out from the bottom of his cuff.</p><p>He tugs his sleeve down. “Just a mark. Nothing to worry about, sweetie.”</p><p>Like most children, the girl accepts Draco’s easy answer and her attention moves elsewhere. “Play with me?” she asks, already grabbing onto his hand still hanging at his side.</p><p>Draco lets himself be pulled across the room so where large bins are overflowing with toys. She drops to the ground so he follows, crossing his legs neatly and waiting for further instructions. She hands him a little stuffed horse and says, “He’s called Len.”</p><p>“That’s a lovely name,” Draco forces himself to say. And then he sees an opening to learn more about this girl and asks, “What’s yours?”</p><p>“I’m ‘Lara.”</p><p>“Laura?” Draco presumes.</p><p>She shakes her head. “‘<em>L</em>ara,” she says, putting more emphasis on the beginning this time.</p><p>“Elara?” Draco guesses again.</p><p>“Yes” she says primly, looking at him intensely with those eyes once again.</p><p>“It’s nice to meet you, Elara. I’m Draco.”</p><p>“Are you my friend now?”</p><p>How could he say no to that? “I suppose I am.”</p><p>“Yay!”</p><p>She launches herself at Draco, wrapping her little arms around his neck and holding him tightly. Draco laughs and pats her back but his laughter dies when she won’t let go. Finally he pries her off of him, but she doesn’t go far. Elara settles down on his lap with her toys. She hands Draco the horse and the two play together so long that his legs fall asleep. (It’s completely worth it to see the smile on her face.)</p><p>The trouble comes when it’s time for Draco to leave. First, Elara’s face scrunches up. And while Draco may not have much experience with children, even he knows what that means. He tries to stop the tears before they start by waving his hands and frantically shushing her. In hindsight, not the best move, but it was the first thing that came to mind. When that doesn’t work he then picks up her slight frame and rocks her back and forth. Elara wraps herself around him and holds on for dear life.</p><p>Draco tries to remove her but she just won’t budge, so next he tries reasoning with her. “Elara, sweetheart, I’ll be back again soon.”</p><p>“Tomorrow?” she asks hopefully.</p><p>He knows he shouldn’t promise things that he can’t follow through with, but after weighing his options he decides there are worse things. “I promise.”</p><p>She reluctantly loosens her grip and lets Draco lower her to the ground, though she remains holding onto his pant leg until the last possible moment when he walks through the doors.</p><p>Thankfully, Lisa is more than happy to have him return the next day so he doesn’t have to renege on his promise. He thanks her but she waves it off. “Elara hasn’t connected with someone like that in all the time she’s been here. You are welcome back whenever you want.”</p><p>“Even though I’m…”</p><p>“You’ve more than proven yourself.”</p><p>Draco isn’t so sure he believes her but he’s just glad he can be there for Elara.</p>
<hr/><p>He returns the next day and the next and for the rest of the week. Each afternoon when it is time for him to go, he has to practically peel Elara off of him but she is overjoyed each morning when he comes back. Draco is dreading Friday afternoon because he won’t be there over the weekend and he knows she’ll have a particularly strong reaction to that news.</p><p>Of all the people to come up with a solution, it’s Dennis Creevey that rescues him. Draco has seen him around the centre, often working with the younger children but also participating in the therapy group for those who lost siblings during the war. Dennis offers to take a photograph of the two of them on Friday afternoon. That way Elara will have something to hold onto over the weekend and also Draco can have a memento to take with him too.</p><p>Elara jumps up and down cheering at the very idea and then stretches her arms up so that Draco can lift her onto his hip. She smiles so big that Draco just can’t look away from her. He sees a flash and realizes that Dennis already took the photo. “I wasn’t ready,” he says, just a little perturbed.</p><p>Dennis just shakes his head and hands over two identical squares. “Trust me, you both were perfect.”</p><p>The photograph <em>is</em> perfect, Draco has to admit. “Thank you,” he says in an awed voice without looking up from it.</p><p>Elara must like it as well because she wriggles down from Draco’s side and rushes over to hug Dennis’s legs. He tells them both it was nothing, he’s all too happy to help them out.</p>
<hr/><p>That night, over a dinner that his mother simply pushes around her plate, Draco tells her about Elara. He figured Narcissa would brighten at the news but if anything she pulls further into herself. He decides to show her the picture in hopes that Elara’s joy will spread to her as well. But when he slides the photograph across the table Narcissa’s spoon drops to the floor with a clatter. She is up and out of her chair before Draco can even blink. “Mother!” he shouts after her but she doesn’t even slow down.</p><p>Draco finds her the next morning, still in her bed. She’s cold and unmoving. A note is lying on her chest. His hand is shaking so much that he’s amazed he can even read it.</p>
<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>My Dearest Draco,</p>
  <p>I can never forgive myself for what I’ve done and so I do not expect you to forgive me either. Elara is your sister. Though I did not give her a name when I gave her up, I would recognize those eyes anywhere.</p>
  <p>Know that it was not an easy thing to do, but it was the safest thing for her. The Dark Lord had just returned and I feared for all of our lives. She came while you were at school and not even your father knew. I only wish that I could have protected you as I did her. I am truly sorry for letting him claim you. I should have done a better job as your mother.</p>
  <p>If there are any gods looking over us, I shall see you again one day my sweet boy. Take care of Elara in any way you can. You’re all she has now. And please don’t blame yourself for what I’ve done.</p>
  <p>Your mother,</p>
  <p>Narcissa Black Malfoy</p>
