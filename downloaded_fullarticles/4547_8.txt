  <em>It’s those quiet, private moments where I think too much. In the shower, drifting off to sleep at night, waking with the sun in the early mornings. I think about what might have been, but will never be. It’s hard to shut down my mind in those quiet times. Peaceful moments are hard to find in this household, I should know. But still I manage to find them.</em>

  <em>As I lay here falling asleep, I remember that night with vivid clarity. It was a night that would change the course of my life forever. Ironic, I know; being Harry Potter I’ve had more than my fair share of these, yet this one cut me to the quick. I don’t know how any of us have managed to survive and move on from that night, but somehow we’ve managed to find a new course for ourselves. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Alright, you’ve got it out of me, I’ll admit, these holidays have been pretty good.”</p><p> </p><p>“Just good, Draco? Just good! They’ve been bloody brilliant and you know it. It’s been fantastic having everyone here and together again after five years.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmmm, well yes I suppose I could potentially concede that they have been more than just good. Come here,” Draco said as he pulled Harry in for a kiss.</p><p> </p><p>“Can’t believe we have to go home and back to work in a week,” Harry sighed. He leaned back against Draco on the lounge. They were enjoying the warmth from the fire in the sitting room of the Burrow, surprisingly on their own while the rest of the household was readying for bed or cleaning up from dinner. Moments of peace and quiet had been rare this Christmas with the whole Weasley bunch home, as well as a plethora of other house guests for the holidays.</p><p> </p><p>“Mmmm home to our nice king size bed and all the privacy we could hope for, I can’t say I’m not excited,” Draco said, nuzzling against Harry’s neck.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be so melodramatic, it hasn’t been that bad here.” Harry swatted Draco away. Draco sighed and leaned back and away from him. “Besides, when we go home, we have to go back to being responsible adults who have jobs to go to every day.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know why we insist on putting ourselves through the hassle of working, we don’t really need to,” Draco drawled, stretching and yawning at the same time.</p><p> </p><p>“Because what else are we going to do for the rest of our lives??”</p><p> </p><p>“I can think of something,” Draco said cheekily.</p><p> </p><p>“You are totally incorrigible tonight! Maybe tonight then – ” Harry broke off at the sounds of shouting from the hallway.</p><p> </p><p>“RON, no, stop, I haven’t finished – ”</p><p> </p><p>“Harry! Mum! Ginny! Dad! EVERYONE! Come quick I have the best news!” Ron was screaming as he burst into the sitting room. “Harry, Draco, there you are! Everyone get in here!”</p><p> </p><p>“Ron, please, what is all this shouting about for, you’ll disrupt the soup,” Mrs Weasley exclaimed as she walked into the room, a trail of ginger-haired Weasleys following behind.</p><p> </p><p>“Ron,” came Hermione’s desperate whisper, “Please don’t, I haven’t finished yet!”</p><p> </p><p>“What are you talking about Hermione, what else could there be?”</p><p> </p><p>At this stage the entire Weasley clan and their respective partners and children had made their way inside the sitting room, along with Luna and Seamus who had been staying for the last week, their one year old girl, Lavender, in tow. Neville the perpetual bachelor followed behind and Ginny entered last, Teddy trailing along behind her holding her hand.</p><p> </p><p>“So much for our quiet time,” Draco whispered in Harry’s ear, and Harry barely suppressed a snigger.</p><p> </p><p>“Ron, come back upstairs, please, I can’t, not here.” Hermione’s words drew Harry’s attention back to the commotion.</p><p> </p><p>“Nonsense, Hermione, don’t worry, no one will be all that surprised!”</p><p> </p><p>Harry felt Draco stiffen slightly. Hermione glanced in their direction and looked away quickly.</p><p> </p><p>“Mum, everyone, Hermione’s pregnant!”</p><p> </p><p>“Ron – ” but Hermione was cut off from saying anything further as she was swept up into a bear hug from Mrs. Weasley.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my goodness dear, it’s about time, I’ve been so looking forward to another addition to the Weasley clan,” Mrs Weasley exclaimed.</p><p> </p><p>“Molly, please – ”</p><p> </p><p>“Shhhh dear, it’s OK, you’re allowed to let everyone fuss,” Mrs Weasley exclaimed. There was an increase in volume as the women in the room started to gush and some of the men started to approach Ron and slap him on the back.</p><p> </p><p>Harry stood up and walked towards Ron. He felt so pleased that his two best friends were finally starting a family. They had been married for two years, it was about time. Harry was about five paces from Ron in the cramped sitting room, surrounded by exultant family members, when Hermione finally burst.</p><p> </p><p>“No! Ron, no! You didn’t let me finish!”  She started to cry. The noise in the room fell to a hush and all eyes were on Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean, Hermione?” Ron asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Ron, I’m so, so sorry,” she sobbed. “I am pregnant. Don’t make me say this here though.”</p><p> </p><p>“What are you talking about, say what?”</p><p> </p><p>“I – I can’t, Ron, please just come upstairs.” There was an awkward silence throughout the room, and Harry’s attention was fixed on the pair.  </p><p> </p><p>“No. Just say whatever it is Hermione, what’s going on?”</p><p> </p><p>She sobbed. “Ron, I’m so sorry. Please forgive me. Oh, Merlin, I can’t do this.”</p><p> </p><p>“What is it?” Ron almost screamed.</p><p> </p><p>“I... I’m not sure, I mean... there is a chance... that you’re not the... the father.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence spread throughout the room, punctuated only by Hermione’s sobbing. Ron stood frozen.</p><p> </p><p>Mrs. Weasley was the first to act, stepping into action and attempting to usher the family out of the room.</p><p> </p><p>“Mum, no. Nobody move!” Ron almost screamed. “What do you mean, I’m not the father?”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t say you definitely weren’t the father – ”  but Ron cut her off.</p><p> </p><p>“Hermione!” Ron took a deep breath. He was slowly losing his cool, and Harry could see his best friend’s face start to crack. “Who else.”</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly Hermione looked at Harry, and Ron turned to him.</p><p> </p><p>“HARRY? You’ve got to be joking Hermione,” his voice almost hysterical. Harry looked alarmed at Hermione and Ron, back to Draco briefly and raised his hands in defence.</p><p> </p><p>“Woah, woah, no way! I don’t know who mate, but it most definitely is <em>not</em> me. No way.” Harry glanced back at Draco, and saw a strange expression on his face. “I mean, come on, I don’t exactly swing that way anymore and I’m with Draco, seriously!” He walked back towards Draco, thinking to reassure his partner that nothing had happened.</p><p> </p><p>“No, it’s not Harry,” Hermione whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Harry turned back to them. “Exactly, not me.”</p><p> </p><p>Hermione locked eyes with Harry. “Harry I’m so sorry, I can’t believe I’m begging for both your’s and Ron’s forgiveness. Please, please, Merlin, forgive me. Harry, I don’t know how to say this, but – ”</p><p> </p><p>She was cut off by a strangled noise and a movement from behind Harry.</p><p> </p><p>“It was me.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s body turned to ice at hearing the voice, his heartbeat sped up, his mind hollowed of all thought and feeling, and he slowly turned to face the speaker. Draco was two paces away from him, his face contorted in pain and misery.</p><p> </p><p>“It was me,” Draco repeated.</p><p> </p><p>-</p>
