    <p>A warm wind ruffled through the trees. Moonlight bathed the world in silver light, casting dark shadows in alley ways and empty doorways. Like every cliché in every movie, an abandoned warehouse sat alone, car park cracked and walls crumbling, with gold light shining through every door, window, and random wall-hole. A man, possibly in his late 20’s, maybe early 30’s, sat in a solidary chair in the middle of the warehouse. His salt and pepper hair (whether it’s a fashion statement or the result of stress) was immaculate, as was his suit. </p><p>Someone who was no one kneeled in front of him, begging for his life. Percival Graves stared disdainfully down at the man grovelling at his feet. Probably getting spit and tears and sweat and whatever else all over his designer shoes. Typical. The man continued to beg, despite that fact that he knew it useless because this was his second chance, his final chance, to make the payment, and he failed. Graves had no mercy for him. And even if he did, he wouldn’t show it. One second of mercy, of compassion, can bring down an empire.  </p><p>“Please,” the man begged, “I- I have a w-wife and… and children…”</p><p>“I don’t ca-” Graves began, only to be interrupted.</p><p>“Take them! Please, I don’t want to die!” he cried.</p><p>Graves heard Tina’s growl coming from the back of the warehouse. This man was scum. The absolute worst.</p><p>“And why would I do that?”</p><p>“W-what?” His voice shook.</p><p>“Why would I take your wife and children?” Graves questioned, “What have they ever done to me? I don’t know what kind of a man you take me for, Mr Turnette, but I don’t kill innocents. Are you suggesting I’m a murderer, Mr Turnette?”</p><p>“I… wha-no sir, abs-absolutely not, sir. I would- I would never s-“</p><p>“Well, Mr Turnette, it sure does seem like that’s what you meant. Why else would you offer your lovely wife and innocent children to the most dangerous mob boss in New York?” It was a question, but Graves wasn’t seeking an answer.</p><p>“I-“</p><p>And with that, he stood. “Tina,” he called, seemly into empty space, “I’m finished with him. Do what you want, but please, try not to get so much blood on your clothes this time?”</p><p>“Of course, boss.” Tina replied, walking towards him from the darkest part of the warehouse.</p><p>“Always one for dramatics, aren’t you?” </p><p>Tina replied with a smile, the one that made her look like every other girl in New York. The one that made her dangerous. Graves continued to walk, reaching the rusting, metal doors, and pushed one open. Despite their appearance, they didn’t squeak, and for that Graves was eternally thankful. Puddles splashed as he made his way across the carpark and the wind pulled at his clothing, but he paid it no mind. He slipped into a non-script black car, with the darkest window tint legal, and sat in the middle back seat. He did not buckle his seatbelt.</p><p>“Where to, Mr Graves?” the driver asked without turning around.</p><p>“Home.” He replied, before putting up the screen that separated the front seat from the back. Graves did not want to talk. He just wanted his boys.</p><p>                                                                                                                                          *** </p><p>When he arrived home, Graves found his boys asleep on the couch. They were both mostly up-right, leaning heavily against each other and sharing a massive blue blanket wrapped around their shoulders. They’d tried to wait up for him. How cute. He approached the couch quietly, but to no avail. Both boys stirred and blinked sleepily the second Graves’ scent hit their noses.</p><p>Smiling softly, he lent down to where their heads rested together.</p><p>“Newt,” he whispered, “Credence. I told you not to wait up for me. I said I would be late, didn’t I?”</p><p>Both whined slightly, and Credence made grabby hands at Graves while Newt just bit his lip.</p><p>“Sorry. We missed you.” Newt replied.</p><p>His smile widened, and he bent down further to scoop both Newt and Credence up, one on each hip. The blanket fell to the floor but Graves couldn’t care less. His boys wrapped their arms around him as much as they could in their sleepy state, and nuzzled into his neck on either side. Credence turned away for a moment to yawn loudly, in turn making Newt yawn, before both settled their heads on his shoulders and promptly fell asleep. Graves made his way to the bedroom, thankful the door was cracked so he could kick it open. He laid both boys on the bed, then kicked off his shoes, slipped off his jacket, pants, and shirt, and joined them. </p><p>“Move over a bit, sweetheart.” He whispered to Credence, who was currently occupying his space in the middle of the bed so he could cuddle up to Newt. Credence whined a little, but obeyed, and Graves slipped in between them. Immediately his boys were on him, snuffling and squirming until they got themselves comfortable, both providing a warm, reassuring weight on his chest. Graves rumbled happily, making his boys purr in response, and relaxed completely. He closed his eyes and let the quiet darkness and the sweet, combined scent of Newt and Credence overwhelm him. Moments later Graves followed his boys into sleep.</p>
