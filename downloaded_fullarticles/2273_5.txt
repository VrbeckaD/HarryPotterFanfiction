    <p>Eleven-years-and-a-day-old Harry traces the words on his wrist in newfound wonder. <em>Avada Kedavra</em>.</p><p>He traces them, wonders if his Soulmate writes with magic, because surely nobody’s handwriting can be so neat? He’s put a ruler to it, once, and remembers realising the arms of the ‘K’ make a perfect right angle. All the ‘a’s look identical. And Harry is sure the words are actually — what’s the word for <em>it</em>? — italicised. Harry likes the ‘K’ so much, he changed his ‘K’ to look like it; uses a ruler to draw the arms whenever he gets the opportunity to. It’s just unfortunate that ‘K’ isn’t a common letter, and that he seldom has a sharp-edged ruler on him.</p><p>He used to say the words to himself all the time, in the darkness and quietness of his cupboard, wondering how each of the ‘a’s are pronounced, rolling his tongue around the ‘vra’, fantasising about what they <em>mean</em>.</p><p>And now, he knows. They are magic words, of course! He always thought they were strange.</p><p>He wonders briefly if all magic spells sounded so similar to <em>Abracadabra</em>, or if maybe his soulmate only says it as a mocking rendition of the muggle ‘spell’. Either way, Harry can’t wait.</p><hr/><p>Harry learns on the train that some people have more than one set of words (one on each wrist), and not everyone has a ‘reciprocated bond’. He says one set of Hermione’s words, for example, but he doesn’t have her first words on him.</p><p>He feels both great and terrible when he learns that he’s said one set of Ron’s words, too. (<em>Great and terrible</em>, that reminds him of what Ollivander said.) Well, at least neither of them have each others’ words…</p><p>This means they would be <em>his</em> best friends, right? Harry’s always wanted friends.</p><hr/><p>Somehow, everyone finds out very quickly that Harry had spoken both Ron’s and Hermione’s words, neither of them had spoken his, and that the two of them haven’t each others’ words. Might have something to do with them shouting about it in the Great Hall during lunch one day. (They were fighting, but the moment attention is drawn to Harry, they’re all best of friends again.)</p><p>This particular true rumour brings even more attention to the wristband Harry wears. Several times, he’s had to rush to class while grabbing his wrist in his other hand because Malfoy or some other Slytherin has hexed his wristband off. He only gets some semblance of peace about it when Professor McGonagall finally takes pity on him and offers to charm it for him so only he can remove it.</p><p>It doesn’t stop random people from coming up to him to say the weirdest things, or just their names (and he’s pretty sure at this point that some of them have spoken to him for the first time more than once), but at least he no longer has to worry about them actually getting his words right only because they’ve seen them.</p><hr/><p>Harry finds out what his words mean over the Christmas break.</p><p>It was just another night of aimless wanderings, after Dumbledore had moved the Mirror, when Harry found himself in the library. He thought to himself, if the first words somebody is going to say to him were a spell, he’d definitely like to know what it does beforehand. Why not, really?</p><p>A quick search with the archiving enchantment the library uses, and Harry finds his answer. He can’t help but to stare for a minute; a moment.</p><p>An eternity, really.</p><p>Because it’s a bit hard to deny the truth, when all five of the top results say the same thing.</p><p>
  <em>The Killing Curse. An Unforgivable. Green light. Only known survivor—</em>
</p><p>He flees.</p><hr/><p>Harry is not the same after.</p><p>He announces one day, during a fight with Malfoy, that he’s figured out who his soulmate is and the blonde would do well to stuff the subject back into that rubbish dump he calls a mouth.</p><p>He tells five, maybe six, of the people attempting to say the right words, that if they weren’t going to say anything half as damaging or rude as the words on his wrist, they should just scram and go introduce themselves to Crabbe. Maybe hope the idiot can match their spoken names to the alphabets on his wrist.</p><p>He gets his peace afterwards.</p><p>(He doesn’t, not really.)</p><p>His friends learn quickly to avoid the topic like the plague.</p><hr/><p>Harry screams, “Haven’t you ruined my life enough?” at Voldemort, and the man— can he even be called that?— does nothing but laugh. Seems like not only is Voldemort the other half of his soul, it’s unreciprocated. He doesn’t want the bond, anyway, but it sucks completely to know the man gets to stomp into his life, take half his soul, curse his parents to oblivion, and doesn’t have the common decency to reciprocate a soul bond.</p><p>He doesn’t tell Dumbledore.</p><p>(He figures, later, in the comforts of his bed and the Invisibility Cloak, that maybe he’d babbled at Voldemort as an infant, and Voldemort’s soulmark is nothing but baby speech.</p><p>It’s almost unheard of, after all, for someone with only one set of words to have an unreciprocated bond… Considering he’s left words on Ron and Hermione, and a few others who claim their words are ‘<em>yes</em>?’, though, he thinks he just might be— no. Voldemort has baby words and that’s that.)</p><p>He doesn’t tell anyone.</p><hr/><p>He does, however, tell Tom Riddle.</p><p>It just slips out, one day, when everything has piled up around and above Harry and he feels like he’s drowning in frustration. (Some part of him knows Tom’s handwriting is eerily familiar. Maybe that is why.) <u><em>My soulmate murdered my parents, and I have the incantation of the killing curse around my wrist.</em></u> It serves, at least, to heighten Tom’s interest in him.</p><p>Made him feel special, even if it was for something as horrible as having a megalomaniac for a soulmate.</p><p>
  <u> <em>He didn’t react to my first words to him.</em> </u>
</p><p>(Oh, Tom was <em>definitely</em> interested.)</p><hr/><p>“Tom?”</p><p>Tom tilts his head contemplatively. “Funny, I always found that strange. Huh.”</p><p>“Tom, we have to get out, there’s a—”</p><p>“I know, I know, Harry. But this is so much more fascinating, is it not? I did wonder, you know? Especially since you keep calling me ‘Tom’. Do you think you can die, now?”</p><p>“Tom, what are you on about?”</p><p>Tom grins, and that’s Harry’s first hint that something <em>really</em> isn’t right. It’s the way his dark eyes slant slightly, the way the ominous curl of his lips shows just a little too much of his incisors. The way his magic seems to flare. “Oh, jolly, I messed up, didn’t I? I mean, <em>Avada Kedavra</em>.”</p><p>(… So it turns out, Voldemort’s words aren’t ‘<em>Googoo gaa</em>.’</p><p>He should have known, from the first time he saw Tom’s name on the Diary. Even if his name doesn’t have a ‘K’.)</p><p>“Tell you what,” Tom says, all cheerful, while Harry’s fighting the Basilisk to his death. “You promise to put the Diary in a safe place — Gringotts works — and I’ll release my hold on the girl, tell little Brutus here to go home, and we can all live happily ever after.”</p><hr/><p>Harry doesn’t tell anyone about his words after that, but it becomes apparent that Professor Lupin already knows. So does Snape, by the way. And Dumbledore, and by extension, McGonagall. And the escaped serial killer that’s supposedly Voldemort’s right-hand man? He knows, too.</p><p>His boggart is Tom Riddle, with bare wrists.</p><p>(“Oh, he had words,” is all a mildly-amused Dumbledore says in response to a desperate Harry’s begs to tell him <em>anything</em> about Tom Riddle.)</p><hr/><p>When Harry asks Professor Lupin to teach him the Patronus Charm, he receives a lecture.</p><p>Summarily: “The Patronus Charm, it’s almost soul magic. No one knows how true the sayings are, but they say only those with completed soul bonds can cast it.”</p><p>As if Harry would let <em>Voldemort</em> stop him from learning the <em>Patronus Charm</em>.</p><p>He doesn’t. Despite Professor Lupin’s warnings that it might not be possible, Harry does it, through sheer determination.</p><p>And he smiles, months later, at the stag. <em>His</em> stag. A sign, he hopes, that maybe his and Voldemort’s fates aren’t so irreversibly entwined, after all.</p><p>(“<em>The Patronus Charm</em>,” Sirius Black breathes, voice filled to the brim with horror and fascination; despair and hope. “But that— it should be impossible.”)</p><hr/><p>When Harry breaks down after Moody’s first class (throughout which the man’s magical eye eyes his wrist suspiciously), Hermione reveals that she’s already guessed. He can’t be too surprised — he does have a part of her, after all. They tell Ron, in a private, silenced corner.</p><p>(By some miracle of luck, the fact that the words on Harry’s wrist are <em>Avada Kedavra</em> fails to register with Voldemort. Even though Pettigrew, and Crouch Jr., and Snape have reported it to him.)</p><hr/><p>Voldemort rises out of the cauldron, naked, and not a letter is to be seen on his wrists.</p><p>(Or anywhere else on his alabaster skin, <em>not</em> that Harry checked.)</p><p>Whatever the first words Harry says to him post-resurrection are, they’re not familiar to the man, either.</p><hr/><p>Harry writes.</p><p>He’s cutting his own hand open, over and over, but he keeps writing.</p><p><em>I must not tell lies</em>.</p><p>He carves the words into the back of his hand, stroke by agonising stroke, each line deeper than the last. The words are his, as much as the words on his wrist are; but these, he tells himself, these at least are in his own script. The lines are crooked, every ‘t’ imperfect and different from the last, but <em>his</em>.</p><p>It’s a cold comfort.</p><p>At night, he soaks his hand in Murtlap Essence. In the mornings, he bandages it up, keeps it covered until the evenings, when he writes again.</p><p><em>I must not tell lies</em>.</p><p>This scar, he thinks, he might not hide, after all. This one he has carved himself, for a truth he knows, deep in his bones (his soul), he must tell. If this is the retribution for being himself, then he will wear the scar proudly.</p><p>(His fringe covers the lightning bolt, his wristband covers the curse. When he clenches his fist, the words glisten back at him. A reminder: his life, his soul, his body — these are his and his alone.)</p><p>Harry writes.</p><hr/><p>They’re at the Ministry, and they’re running in a dark corridor. There’s a flash of a curse and a shout of pain from Ron, who falls. Another flash that barely misses Harry. He makes a split-second decision, to lure the Death Eaters away from Ron.</p><p>“Split up,” he orders, just loud enough for all of his friends to hear. “Run far. Keep their attentions off Ron.”</p><p>He enters the first room that calls to him. (A bad idea in retrospect.) Hermione squeezes in and shuts the door behind her, panting heavily.</p><p>A <em>Lumos</em> informs them that this room, according to the label on the door, is named the Room of Requirement. That’s great. Familiar names and all that.</p><p><em>I need to help my Soulmate</em>, he thinks determinedly. That’s stretching it a bit far, since Ron isn’t <em>exactly</em> his Soulmate, but—</p><p>There’s a sharp pull at his navel, like a portkey but <em>sharper</em>, and a sudden nausea, and he lands, with Hermione, in exactly the same room. “Well, that was strange.”</p><p>It’s strangely quiet outside. Might be a bait, but Harry is a Gryffindor, so he reaches for the door anyway. He stops when he hears murmurs.</p><p>(The door opens, anyway.)</p><p>A team of Unspeakables with clipboards and wands enter the room, like there isn’t a whole horde of manic Death Eaters outside, cursing the pants off anyone in their range.</p><p>“I’m the Head Unspeakable, and I see you’ve been Required,” one of them says, going straight to business. “Ben Greengrass.”</p><p>“What do you mean, we’ve been Required?” Hermione, ever the curious cat, demands. Harry can’t say he’s ungrateful. Of all the questions to ask, though.</p><p>Greengrass, on the other hand, is terribly unimpressed. “You entered a room in the Department of Mysteries without knowing its function.”</p><p>“We were under attack!” Harry protests, like he wouldn’t have done something like that under any other circumstances. “Besides, there’s a Room in Hogwarts, too, and we thought—”</p><p>One of the Unspeakables coughed. He’s amused. It’s an amused cough.</p><p>“What does this room do?” Hermione finally asks. “Did it transport us somewhere safe? We have to get back—”</p><p>The amused Unspeakable deigns to reply with, “It’s sorta like the Room of Requirement in Hogwarts except—”</p><p>“It doesn’t operate on your requirements, but rather your Soulmate’s.”</p><p>Oh. They’ve been <em>Required</em> indeed.</p><p>“<em>He’s</em> my soulmate,” Hermione says, purposefully, hoping against hope that they haven’t just been transported to God-knows-where because Harry’s Soulmate <em>Required</em> them.</p><p>Like Tom fucking Riddle has any right Requiring them anywhere.</p><p>“Don’t panic,” Greengrass says, “but we suspect you’ve been transported through time. Right now, it’s the 3rd of June, 1943.”</p><p>“Don’t panic,” Harry echoes numbly, “but I’ve been transported some 50 years back, and Fuckamort is now the same age as me.”</p><p>(<em>He can’t go back to where he used to be—</em>)</p>
