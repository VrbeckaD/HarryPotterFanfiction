    <p>Harry looked at Cedric, and asked “Together?”<br/>
The other boy nodded. They grasped the handles of the cup and felt the pull of a portkey. </p>
<p>Harry opened his eyes to a dark, eerie graveyard. He heard a voice say “Kill the spare.”<br/>
There was a flash of green light, and Harry screamed as Cedric fell to the ground. Harry watched in a daze as he was bound to a grave. He watched as Wirmtail brought back the Dark Lord. He watched as Voldemort summoned the Death Eaters to him, and boasted. Then, Voldemort turned to him.</p>
<p>“And now, I suppose you think I’m going to kill you?”</p>
<p>Harry glared at Voldemort, who laughed. </p>
<p>“Oh no, I have other plans for you. Lucius.”</p>
<p>“Yes my Lord?” Lucius said, swiftly stepping forward.</p>
<p>“Stupefy him, and bring him back to the manor.”</p>
<p>“As you wish, my Lord.”</p>
