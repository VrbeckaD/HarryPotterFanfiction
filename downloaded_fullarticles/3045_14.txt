    <p>Dear Readers,</p><p>I've thoroughly enjoyed writing Not Quite Gods. I intend to continue writing it as a chapter by chapter serial. I will say, even if you do not enjoy the adventures I've dreamed for these characters, I appreciate you taking the time to read them. In the interim, I encourage you to read the notes and expect teasers if curious about where NQG is headed next. Please be advised that there are lots of warnings and disclaimers. It is not my intent to trigger unsuspecting readers with anything I've written. It's all meant in good fun and not intended to offend or traumatize by any stretch of the imagination. If you find that you are sensitive to the subjects contained herein, please by all means, do not continue beyond this chapter. I'd prefer to remain unapologetic about the choices I've made with these characters and the adventures in which they partake. I'd also prefer to sleep soundly knowing that no one has been hurt in some way by anything I've written. Thank you again for taking the time to read and I hope to hear from you.</p><p>Kindly,<br/>

I wrote myself into a bit of a corner and couldn't brainstorm my way out for the life of me.  I've come to the decision that I am going to re-edit this first chapter of Onus to adapt a new approach.  I have in mind only a single small change and I believe it will make the plans I have for the conclusion of this story a bit more sensible.  For those who have been waiting patiently to read, and for those who have offered such kind words of encouragement, I apologize for the delay and hope to have timely new chapters on the way.  Thank you for your patience and as ever, thank you for taking the time to read.</p><p>Kindly,<br/>
