    <p align="left"><em>He squeezed Buckbeak’s sides with his heels. Harry and Hermione jumped back as the enormous wings rose once more… The hippogriff took off into the air… He and his rider became smaller and smaller as Harry gazed after them… then a cloud drifted across the moon… They were gone. (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban)</em><br/> <br/> As he flew south-west over the Forbidden Forest towards Ireland, something driving him to leave Scotland and England behind, Sirius thought about what had happened. Harry wanting to live with him without even knowing really anything about him made him think about what kind of home-life his godson had.<br/> <br/> Until now he’d kept his contacts with the magical world as limited as possible. A letter with a drop of blood to prove his identity had been his only contact with Gringotts to have a broom purchased and sent to Harry.<br/> <br/> “No, dammit,” he mutters to himself. “Harry needs me.” Shaking off the feeling that he should run far away, Sirius makes his choice and turns Buckbeak south-south-east.<br/> <br/> Several hours later as dawn was lightening the sky, Sirius aboard Buckbeak was hovering over a yard in Islington, London. “Well,” he muttered. “So far so good, wards haven’t attacked yet.” To his mount he said, “You stay up here until I’m sure it’s safe.” A nod from the intelligent animal and he swings a leg over and drops the six feet to the ground, landing in a crouch and looking warily about.<br/> <br/> When nothing untoward happens, he straightens up and walks to the rear door of the terraced house before him. “Now mother disowned me, but if I was really cast out of the family the wards should have triggered,” he mutters to himself. “Maybe Grandpa Arcturus didn’t listen to her about me even though he did listen to Uncle Cygnus about ‘Dromeda.”<br/> <br/> Taking a deep breath, he raises his right hand palm out and says, “I Sirius Orion Black the Third hereby claim the heirship of House Black. I also claim ownership of the property known as The Black Townhouse. So mote it be.” A sparkle of light and a ring with a crest on it appears on the middle finger of his hand while another flash illuminates the handle of the door. “Well I’ll be,” he chuckles.<br/> <br/> Glancing behind him at the hovering hippogriff he says, “As Heir of House Black, I give permission for the Hippogriff named Buckbeak to be present on or in Black property.” A dim flash of the ring and he calls out. “Okay Bucky, it’s safe to come down now.”<br/> <br/> The hippogriff lands lightly on the grass and walks up to behind Sirius. “Now lets see what my insane mother and her deranged house elf have done to the place.” He opens the door and walks in to cough and almost gag. “Merlin’s balls, this place reeks,” he growls.<br/> <br/> An almost silent pop and a figure half his height with long, pointed ears wearing a filthy tea-towel as a loincloth is in front of him. “Nasty blood traitor is in Mistresses home. Kreacher will throw you out.”<br/> <br/> Sirius holds up his hand so that the ring is visible to the being. “I am the recognized heir to House Black, Kreacher. I now own this place and you. You will obey my instructions to the letter, you will not inform anyone of where I am, you will not leave this house unless I specifically tell you to.”<br/> <br/> Kreacher moans, writhes as if in pain then growls out, “Kreacher must obey blood traitor master.”<br/> <br/> “Good,” Sirius smirks. “You will also not attack me or the hippogriff Buckbeak, in fact you will do everything you can to protect us both.”<br/> <br/> With a grimace, the house elf nods. “Kreacher will protect blood traitor master and his…pet.”<br/> <br/> “Now, you’ve let the house become a pig-sty…scratch that, even pigs would be disgusted with this place. You will clean the kitchen until it’s spotless then restock it. Following that clean the master suite and a bedroom on the third level. You’ll do the cleaning as quick as you can, moving any dark-magic items to the vault in the basement and eliminating any pests. Once you’re done, come find me and I’ll give you more instructions.”<br/> <br/> “Kreacher obeys,” the elf mutters then disappears.<br/> <br/> Sirius turns to the hippogriff and says, “Might want to wait in the gardens until he’s got a room cleaned for you.”<br/> <br/> Buckbeak tosses his head, turns and exits the house through the still open door. “I’m gonna need a post owl at some point,” Sirius mutters. “Might as well see what’s left of the family.” He makes his way up the back stairs to the second level and goes into what looks like it might be a sitting room…if it was in any way clean. He looks over a tapestry hanging on one wall and frowns. “They let me know that mother and father had died, why didn’t they inform me that grandfather was dead as well?” he mutters.<br/> <br/> Then he blinks and swears. “Keeping me in Azkaban wasn’t enough, was it Albus. You could have gotten me out of there at any time if you just admitted to the truth. Why are you trying to keep me in the dark?” Then he growls. “No wonder I was thinking of running to the continent or beyond, you don’t want me claiming my title or being here for Harry. Well old man, this dog isn’t falling for your tricks anymore.”<br/> <br/> He leaves the room and walks to another door at the end of the hall. Placing his hand on the knob he says, “As the Lord-apparent to the House of Black, I demand entry.” A click and when he turns the knob the door swings open. “Lets see you stop me now, Alby.”</p><p align="center">&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p align="left">In an office carved out of solid rock, a goblin sitting behind a desk glances at a parchment that appears before him. “Half again the normal fee for this? May your enemies fall before you and both our profits increase. Lord Black is dead, long live Lord Black,” he chuckles.<br/> <br/> Then he grabs blank parchment and begins to write a number of letters.</p>
