  <span>It wasn’t fair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom clutched his robes tightly, as he thought about the mocking faces of all of the purebloods while walking through one of the shadiest parts of the already shady Knockturn Alley. They had thrown him away the moment they had graduated from Hogwarts. When he was no longer above them, but now below them. They had received job offers nearly instantly after graduation, due to their name and status. Tom, however, was cast aside and denied, despite his high marks and charm. They'd rather have someone with a Pureblood name, than a no-name </span>

</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t fair.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>How dare they…How dare they look down on him! </span>
  <em>
    <span>Him</span>
  </em>
  <span>! The Heir of Slytherin! He’s better than all of </span>
  <em>
    <span>them</span>
  </em>
  <span>, those who squander their wealth over meaningless things, and those who didn’t do </span>
  <em>
    <span>####</span>
  </em>
  <span> for what they have. They didn’t need to get perfect grades, good looks, charming personality, or make the right connections. They already had what they needed to succeed in this cruel world, a </span>
  <em>
    <span>name</span>
  </em>
  <span>. And Tom didn’t have a name.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sure, he could come out as Heir of Slytherin, but people would figure out that he framed Hagrid for the opening of the Chamber of Secrets, and throw him into Azkaban (looking back, opening the Chamber was a terrible idea.) And with his current name, people would assume that he came from a filthy muggle heritage. He gritted his teeth, his eyes flashing red, startling the old hag who was about to approach him. No doubt was going to attempt to swindle him, or drug him to sell to a brothel. Wouldn’t be the first time someone had attempted that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He snarled at her, using his magic to curl the shadows around him, his immense magical presence practically suffocating her. He watched her with malicious glee as she fell to her knees, trembling in his presence. He basked in the pure, horrified fear in her eyes. </span>
  <em>
    <span>This</span>
  </em>
  <span> is where he belonged. People falling to his feet. Being scared, terrified of </span>
  <em>
    <span>him</span>
  </em>
  <span>. He was above all of them, the pathetic, weak, disgusting pests. Every single last one of them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“P-please…I have a child…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom looked at the hag, who was sobbing disgustingly. She was groveling on the floor at this point, but Tom didn’t care. It was her fault for reducing herself to such a level. She didn’t work at all like he did. Why should having a child increase her worth? The spawn would probably follow the path of its mother, knocking up or getting knocked up, and causing an unending cycle. He was annoyed at her begging, and leveled his wand at her. As she didn’t raise a wand back, he assumed she was a Squib.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No! No, please!”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Accio Heart,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> He said, coldly. The hag lurched forwards, as her heart ripped out of her chest in into Tom’s waiting hand. Somehow, it was still beating as it was still connected to the blood vessels from the gaping hole in her chest. Tom hummed as he marveled at the beating heart, ignoring the gasps and pained moans of the hag. Tom squeezed the organ slowly, before squishing it completely. He let the heart, along with it’s owner, drop to the ground with a loud thud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tom stared at the dead body, the blood dripping from his fingers falling into the blood pooling around the hag’s body. He had killed before, bunnies, birds, and humans too. He never felt anything for their deaths, as none were particularly remarkable nor were the victims memorable. They were going to die at one point sooner or later, he was simply speeding up the process. Besides, it was their own fault for not being strong enough to protect themselves.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He walked on, the street rats and homeless, who had witnessed the whole scene, scurrying away from him. Tom didn’t care, in his eyes, they were only roaches. As he passed, he heard whispers of the frightened around him, whispers he was far too used to. Tom couldn’t help but be pleased. They knew that he was far above them, he was more powerful, someone to be </span>
  <em>
    <span>feared</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With blood dripping from his hands, his eyes glowing a menacing red, and his mouth in a sadistic, evil grin, Tom looked every bit of the dark lord he aspired to become. That he </span>
  <em>
    <span>will</span>
  </em>
  <span>  become.</span>
