    <p>A strange family was walking through Kings Cross. They looked normal. The older woman had a dress on. It was simple, pink top with the skirt of the dress having purple flowers. The man had a blue shirt on and normal pants to match. Looking as a man with office job. Their boy was there too. He had a t-shirt on, simple black but the words 'Magic or not, You’re still stupid'. His friend had bought it for him. A christmas gift. Everyone in the family had black hair. The dad had black hair, normally messy but had now used so much hair products to make it look sort of okay. The boy however had really messy hair and let it be so. The mom had her hair up in an elegant hairstyle. The boy was ahead of them. The mom constantly had to tell him to get back and not jump down the steps. The dad was pushing the luggage cart with all the baggage and a white big owl. Soon they came to a stop. Between two platforms, nine and ten. <br/>“Alright then” the mom said. Her voice soft as an angel. Not too loud either since her small family was around her. “Remember to keep an eye out for the muggles and make it look natural. Try to not run.” Fleamont started to walk forward the big brick wall. Leaning to it a little before vanishing. Soon after the boy got to the wall. However he was jogging and was quickly away. On platform nine and three quarters. </p><p>The platform was full of people. Like always. The train standing still with the doors open and smoking ready to leave. Students all over saying goodbye to their parents and families. Some kids was getting on the train to find a good place to sit while others were finding friends. <br/>“Now, no trouble alright Jamie?” Euphemia said as she pushed the boy’s glasses up. <br/>“I can’t promise anything mum” the boy smiled mischievous. Making his mother sigh. <br/>“Okay, now, can you take care of yourself, the train is leaving in… How long honey?” Fleamont looked down at his wrist. <br/>“About 20 minutes.” his wife nodded. <br/>“Can you stay for 15 minutes alone?”<br/>“Oh come on mom. I will find my friends soon!” James said. His parents chuckling. <br/>“We’ll go then. We’ll see you for christmas right?” Fleamont asked. James nodded. “Good, and don’t forget to write” he said before kissing the smaller boy’s head. His mom did the same before they left. </p><p>It was five minutes later. He had already put his baggage in a compartment and his owl on the seat to show that it’s already taken. Then he had gone to the platform again. Hoping to find his friends. It was nearly impossible because of all the people. That was until…<br/>“JAMES!” James turned his head around to find who had screamed. Seeing one of his friend run to him. <br/>“Remus!” The boy stopped in front of James. He looked really tired. But somehow his green eyes always looked happy around his friends. But what mostly stood out with the boy was the scars. He had two scars. One far down his left cheek to the right ear. The other higher up on the left cheek, closer to the eye, and going over the nose, Close to touching the right eyebrow. No one knew why or where it was from and when someone asked, well he wouldn’t answer. <br/>“Are you alone?” James asked. Not seeing any of his parents. <br/>“Oh uhm… Dad has work… He didn’t follow last year either. It’s okay though! I have all my stuff” Remus still smiled softly. “Anyways, have you found a compartment yet? Are Peter or Sirius here?” Talking rather quickly. James just chuckled at it. <br/>“Nope you are the first, but I have a place to sit if no one took over it.”</p><p>It had gone five minutes. Remus had put his stuff up and sat down at the seat to the window. He had a book from one bag though. James was always confused about it though, reading was horrible. At least if it was for lessons.<br/>“New book?” James asked. <br/>“Hm?” Remus looked at the book. “Oh yeah! It’s a muggle book about a wizard.”<br/>“Muggles know about us?” James asked with a scared tone. His friend laughed and James felt offended. <br/>“No James” He chuckled. Trying to stop his laughter. “It’s what they think, they have ideas of it but they aren’t even close most of the times.” Remus continued. Finally calm enough to understand what he said. James was so confused by his friend. Sometimes he was talking really quick and sometimes he had a calm voice and sometimes it was so calm voice meaning he would explode. But in the middle of talking the door opened. A boy stood there. He wasn’t that tall, close to James height actually. The black hair a bit longer then last time they saw each other. <br/>“Sirius!” James squealed. He got up from the seat and hugged his best friend. “I’ve missed you.” Sirius smiled at him. No wonder why. Sirius’ family hated people who weren’t purebloods and not fully human. Sirius was against it. They hated him for it.<br/>“Oh believe me, I’ve missed you more” he chuckled. “They kept ignoring me, luckily owls exist.” James let go of him once he saw another one coming. A small and chubby boy with blonde hair. The last one in their friendship group. He came in as Sirius moved in too. The two put up their baggage with the other two. <br/>“Hi Pete!” <br/>“Hey guys” Peter answered. Sitting down next to James. Soon after the train started to move. “How was your summer then?”<br/>“Horrible, my ‘family’ ignored me and yelled at me for minutes every day.” Sirius said. His voice having a hint of sadness. Mostly summer was a great time since being away nearly all year could be hard. <br/>“Mine was fine, we went to France, my uncle live there you know?”<br/>“We know James” Sirius said as he leaned back. “You have said that like 100 times” he smirked. James sent him a glare. <br/>“I’ve just been to Ireland. Mom wants to travel the world, we start off small. Dad couldn’t take much off from work though so we spent most time home” Peter shrugged. “How about you Remus?”<br/>“Nothing” Remus simply answered as he opened the book. James sighed. <br/>“Come on Rem! It can’t be nothing, I mean… Summer!”<br/>“Well dad have work…” Then Remus started to read. The both black haired guys groaned. But soon they were talking about their own stuff.</p><p>The time went on and the trolley came knocking. Sirius was up on his feets directly and opened up the door. The other three soon after. <br/>“Thank merlin I was starving to death” Peter said as he looked over it all. Deciding a few candies before going in again. James looked over too. Sure he had enough money to buy lots of stuff. He decided for a few things he really liked before sitting down again. <br/>“Siri, catch this!” James said all of sudden. Throwing a Bertie bean to Sirius. Luckily Sirius caught it. Sirius didn’t hesitate before eating it. His face grinning.<br/>“Ha! It’s strawberry!” James groaned and sank down. <br/>“Alright, Pete!” James threw another one. Peter barely caught it. He never had a good reflex like James. They didn’t care though. He was really good at other things. However as soon Peter put it in his mouth he spit it out. <br/>“Ew! Vomit!” <br/>“Okay last one, Rem!” James threw one over to him. Remus didn’t pay much attention to them at first. Until he heard his nickname. <br/>“NO NO NO-” he still catched it. Frowning a little. Before taking it out to put it away. <br/>“Paper…” </p><p>It had gotten dark when the train stopped. The normal voice about leaving the baggage on the train said the normal sentence again. The four could ignore it though. They left the train and got up on one of the carriages. It was a short ride before they had to jump off and get to the castle. <br/>“Home sweet home” Sirius said with a sigh. The big castle and it’s beauty now on full display. <br/>“I agree Siri” James smiled. He got an idea and grinned. Looking at the others. “FIRST ONE TO THE CASTLE!” He yelled and started to run. Following complaints about how unfair it was before they started running too.</p><p>The sorting was a bit boring since they all were hungry. Just wanting their food. And after Dumbledore’s speech they all could start eating. Once they were full off food they got to their dorm. <br/>“I’m so tired” Remus groaned as he fell down on the bed. Having already changed in the bathroom. James was getting his pyjamas shirt on. <br/>“You’re always tired” he answered. <br/>“Well it’s been a long day” Remus yawned. <br/>“It will only be longer-” Sirius said with a teasing tone as he belly flopped onto the bed. <br/>“Shut up and sleep” Remus grumbled.</p>
