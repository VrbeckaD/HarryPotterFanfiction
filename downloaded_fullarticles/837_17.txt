    <p>Tina always comes on Tuesdays.</p><p>Credence strains for the sound of her leather shoes on the rain-slicked road. Any minute, she’ll turn into the alley with the collar of her coat turned up against the drizzle, a small, nervous smile peeking over periwinkle lapels. Tina always comes on Tuesdays. Always Tuesdays, for the last month and a half.</p><p>Minutes pass. Four o’clock comes with the clang of a far-off church bell, and Credence feels the sound like a knell inside his chest, beating at the back of his ribs. He starts folding inwards in resignation, shoulders hunched and cold knees bending. He slides his hands deep within his pockets and clenches tight, his palms throbbing around his wounds, against the sharp crescents of his nails. Maybe this is for the best, he thinks, as he watches a noisy cab break across the grey slot of light at the end of the alley. He should have known better than to hope she’d close his cuts again, that she’d come at all. In the end, consorting with people like Tina, with <em>witches</em>, goes against everything Ma ever taught him.</p><p>Then, someone comes around the corner.</p><p>For an instant, Credence thinks it’s her, it’s really her, but his hope is rewarded with a jab of betrayal. A man stands at the end of the lane. He’s hard to see from such a distance – little more than a shadow snipped into the waning light. His long, black coat flutters around his legs in the rising wind, and his eyes are lost beneath the heavy set of his black brows. A shiver rakes up the boy’s spine. The stranger looks at Credence for a long, trembling moment. Then, just when the instinct to flee sparks fire in the boy’s cold-numbed nerves, the man turns on his heel and disappears back into the New York bustle. He leaves behind a strange blue shape on the back of Credence’s lids when he blinks in surprise.</p><p>The alleys aren’t safe. These narrow cracks between the tall, brick towers – where the dirt sweeps in to settle, where the coldness convenes out of spite for the sun – these are the places where the monsters lurk. Monsters in the form of strange men in long coats. And monsters just like Credence.</p><p>Credence pulls his jacket close around his frame and chokes down the lump in his throat.</p><p>He makes the long trek home. He all but forgets about the man, but he doesn’t think he’ll ever forget about Tina Goldstein.</p><p>When Tuesday comes again, Credence decides he’ll never see her again.</p><p>He plans to hand out flyers at Allen and Grand well into evening, well past four o’clock. He offers them to passers-by with an unsteady hand, fingers freshly stained with ink. Only a young mother with a pram pays him the pleasantry of a half-hearted smile as she breezes past. The rest dash across the road with set jaws and pursed lips, determined to ignore him into nonexistence. If he doesn’t hand out all the pamphlets, Ma will write her disappointment in red stripes across his skin. Maybe he can dump the extras in the trash behind a restaurant, he thinks. Credence squints at the bistro across the way. The first hopeful blush of spring has graced New York, and the patio is peppered with young women in feathered caps, a flock of songbirds returned from winter migration. Credence scours their tiered serving trays with hungry eyes, their silver spires amounting to a royal city of dainty delights. He comes to the final table, stomach no less empty, and his fervent gaze skids off the sandwiches to a dark figure leaning against a lamppost.</p><p>And there he is.</p><p>The man from before is watching Credence from across the street.</p><p>The boy’s breath catches in his throat. His growling stomach twists as he veers his eyes to the confetti of newspaper scraps beneath his toes. Acting on instinct, Credence flattens his pamphlets against his chest, as though their godly condemnations might save him from the piercing and thoughtful gaze of the stranger. He’s unmistakable. It’s his flowing coat, it’s the hard set of his brow, but also the shiver he sends up the young man’s spine. Credence is ready to turn down the road and run the other way when he hears his name called out from behind.</p><p>“Credence! Sorry I’m late!”</p><p>Credence whips his head around to spot Tina picking her way through the crowd, a bright smile on her face and a paper bag bunched in her waving hand. Relief hits Credence so hard his eyes sting at the edges, but he bites his tongue to keep himself from crying. When she arrives, Credence has the overwhelming, ridiculous urge to disappear into the warm, woolen folds of her coat.</p><p>“I wish we could’ve talked last week,” Tina says all in a rush. With her heels and his hunch, they’re eye-to-eye. “We’ve been having a bit of an emergency. It’s kind of an ongoing international crisis, actually.” Something edges into her eyes, something almost like fear, but then she blinks it away. “My boss was keeping an eye on the situation while I was travelling. We’d actually like to ask you a few more questions about the Second Salemers, if that’s alright.” She looks over Credence’s shoulder, and when he follows her gaze, it’s to find himself staring into the face of the man from the alley.</p><p>Credence’s stomach gives a painful lurch, but now he’s sure his fear is founded. If Tina knows this man, works for this man, he’s certainly a witch. Credence has become acquainted with yet another enemy. Even more frightening than this revelation, though, is the way it excites him.</p><p>Credence flinches back and towards Tina. Unphased, the man gives a polite, unsmiling nod.</p><p>“Percival Graves,” he says.</p><p>Credence nods back in ritual respect. He can’t decide what’s more impolite – lowering his eyes or holding the man’s gaze – so he flickers between the two.</p><p>Up close, everything about Percival Graves is sleek and cold, like winter rain over dark stones. His fluid black coat melts into the smooth lines of his spotless suit, stark against the sharp lapels of his pressed, white shirt. His forehead is lined with age, and the hair behind his ears is silver. His eyes are deep and keen, like they could slice into Credence to sift through his secret thoughts. His mouth is strangely soft and pink against all his razor edges, like a primrose growing between the cracks of a cliff.</p><p>“I’m Credence Barebone,” Credence says, so quiet in the city buzz he wonders if he even hears.</p><p>“Is it alright if we ask you some more questions, Credence?”</p><p>The man’s voice is deeper than his own, but tamed to a half-hush amidst the crowd.</p><p>Credence nods again, and soon he’s setting out with the pair, giddy and sickened by his surrender to temptation.</p><p>Tina leads them around the corner and down the street, then ducks inside a crumbling carriageway. It’s long been made into a ramshackle hold for the boxes, barrels, and rotting refuse of the shops nearby. She hoists herself onto the biggest crate, and with a reassuring smile, Credence follows and sits down beside her, setting his pamphlets in between. Mr. Graves simply leans against the far wall. His dark form is almost lost against the soot of the bricks.</p><p>“Oh!” Tina chimes. “First order of business!” She unrolls the top of her paper bag and sets it in Credence’s lap. “Thought you might like some lunch.”</p><p>Credence peers inside to find a treasure trove of tiny, golden pastries, each bejewelled with strawberry jam and shining with sugar glaze. His mouth is watering, even as he tells Tina she doesn’t need to keep bringing him food. The witch deflects his plea with a wave of her hand. “I know that woman doesn’t feed you properly. Go ahead, take some.”</p><p>Credence is too hungry and too polite to keep protesting. He can’t help but smile as he plucks a fritter from the bag. Dozens of tissue-thin layers of pastry shatter around his mouth as he takes his first bite. They fall again his trousers like fluffy specks of snow.</p><p>“Don’t think I forgot about you, Director,” Tina chimes from beside him. “There’s more than enough to go around. Here, catch!”</p><p>Mr. Graves glares at his underling. He opens his mouth to reject her offer, but he’s cut short when Tina lobs a fritter at his face. He stumbles in surprise, tripping on the cobbles, but manages to catch the pastry without falling or getting a faceful of jam. He tries for a nasty scowl, but Credence catches the corners of his mouth twitching with barely-concealed humour.</p><p>“This is official business, Goldstein,” he reprimands, “not tea time.”</p><p>Tina doesn’t look cowed. In fact, she seems proud of herself for tripping her employer.</p><p>“Just be happy I got your favourite flavour, sir.”</p><p>Apparently resigned to Tina’s mischief, Mr. Graves falls into silence and starts eating his pastry. Credence can practically see him stitching the burst seam of his composure back together, closing up the flash of colour his co-worker yanked to the surface. Within a second, he’s back to being just as daunting, just as grim as before. Not a ghost of a smile to be seen.</p><p>Tina, for her part, decides it’s time to start her line of questions. Credence forces his attention away from her mysterious boss to relay the details of his family’s demonstration in Rockefeller Square, then their Sunday meeting. He brushes down the crumbs from his thighs and does his best to tell her all she wants to know. Part of him realizes he shouldn’t tell Tina about the Society. Ma would say he’s divulging information to the enemy, that he’s a traitor. And yet, despite over two decades of tutelage under Mary Lou Barebone, it’s hard to believe this witch means anyone harm. It’s hard to believe, when she’s so often eased the sting of his mother’s lashes. It’s hard to believe, when Tina says all she wants is to keep peace between regular people and those with magic.</p><p>If Credence is truly honest with himself, this strange woman named Tina Goldstein, this witch, is the only friend he’s ever known.</p><p>He tells her everything.</p><p>“These orphans…” Tina eventually says. She crumples the empty bag into her pocket. “The ones that report sightings of witchcraft in exchange for food… Have they ever found anyone and brought them to your Ma? Other children, maybe?”</p><p>Mr. Graves stands a little taller at the shift in topic, like it’s the question he’s been waiting for.</p><p>Credence thinks back, but shakes his head.</p><p>“A girl once said she saw a man disappear, but she didn’t know who it was, so Ma couldn’t bring a case to the police.”</p><p>The two witches share a meaningful look. Mr. Graves crosses the width of the carriageway to stand before Tina and Credence.</p><p>“We have reason to believe…” he says, weighing each word on his tongue before speaking it aloud, “that your sister Chastity may have been born to magical parents. Do you have any reason to suspect that Chastity may have magical abilities?”</p><p>Credence’s eyes widen in astonishment. The idea is ludicrous! Laughable, even!</p><p>“Chastity? But Chastity hates witches! She could never be one!”</p><p>At nineteen years old, her scorn runs just as blood-hot as her mother’s.</p><p>“And Modesty?” presses Mr. Graves. “Her parents were non-magical, but we’ve found that her father came from a wizarding household in Ireland before crossing to America.”</p><p>Credence quickly shakes his head, another incredulous ‘no.’</p><p>“She’s… just a little girl. She’s a <em>normal</em> little girl.”</p><p>“And you yourself, Credence…” Mr. Graves regards the young man a long moment, brows knit in thought. “Tina tells me that Mary Lou has hinted your mother was a witch. And you, like Chastity and Modesty, have no magic to speak of. It’s hardly a coincidence.”</p><p>Credence feels Mr. Graves’ words like a vicious kick to the stomach. His mother, his real mother, has been tucked away in the innermost drawer of his heart ever since he could remember – a pressed belladonna bloom, sentimentally preserved and deeply feared. It’d taken weeks to admit the truth of his heritage to Tina, and now it’s echoing round and round the carriageway, with none of the terror or reverence it deserves.</p><p>“Why does it matter?” Credence fists his hands in the fabric of his trousers and dares to look Mr. Graves in the eye, emboldened by his loss, shame and betrayal. “Why does it matter where we came from?”</p><p>For all Credence’s hands are shaking and his voice hardly crests above a whisper, Mr. Graves seems surprised by his turn from complete compliance to spiteful defiance. The witch drops the tension from his shoulders and shifts his weight into one leg – a less confrontational stance.</p><p>“Because,” says Mr. Graves, “it seems Mary Lou specifically adopts kids from families with magical roots, probably with the aim of ‘saving’ them from witchcraft. If one of her children, or even just someone drawn to her attention, has magical abilities, then we need to know about it.”</p><p>Tina wedges into the anxious exchange by laying a light hand on Credence’s arm.</p><p>“Your Ma might hurt a young witch or wizard if they come her way,” she explains. “From what you’ve told me, she hates anyone who’s different, or who opposes her beliefs. It would be our duty to bring those kids into our world, where they could learn magic and be themselves. If you come across anyone who has magical abilities, you’d be doing us and them a favour by letting us know.”</p><p>Credence feels his defensive impulse grudgingly relax and fold itself away. He nods in understanding. As uncertain as he is about these two, about their world and their ways, pointing out one of their own doesn’t seem unreasonable, especially when the alternative is giving them up to the mercy of his mother. Credence brushes his fingers over the white strips of cotton tied tight across his hand. He’s a close acquaintance with her type of mercy.</p><p>The boy only realizes what he’s doing when Tina slides her fingers down his arm to take his palm in her own.</p><p>“I should’ve noticed sooner,” she says. Her words come from behind clenched teeth, but Credence knows her anger isn’t for him. “Do you want me to help again?”</p><p>A moment later, he’s picked apart the tricky knot and gingerly unpeeled the bandage from where it’s glued itself to his wound. Tina gives a sympathetic hiss as she draws it closer into view. Since their creation a week and a half ago, the skin around the three slashes has grown swollen and red, the lesions themselves changed from rust-red to putrid yellow. Tina sighs.</p><p>“This is going to need more than a simple healing spell,” she says.</p><p>“Here, let me see.”</p><p>Credence and Tina both look up in surprise as Mr. Graves bends over the young man’s hand to take a closer look.</p><p>“Hmm…” he says, “I have just the thing…”</p><p>Mr. Graves whisks out a stoppered bottle from the inner pocket of his coat. It can’t be bigger than his thumb, and it shimmers with a thick, green liquid the precise colour of a beetle’s wing. It’s a potion, Credence realizes with a start.</p><p>The witch meets his widened eyes as he releases the stopper. It gives a faint <em>pop!</em></p><p>“When you’re in our line of business,” says Mr. Graves with a smirk, “you tend to stock up on precautions.”</p><p>Without hesitation, he takes the boy’s hand and upends the potion on top of his wound.</p><p>At first, all Credence can feel is the liquid’s faint heat, warmed by the older man’s body. That, and the rough calluses of his steady hand. Then suddenly, the emerald ooze starts to bubble and splutter. With alarm and fascination, Credence watches as the potion glows hotter and hotter, and as the bubbles fizz larger and larger, ballooning to the size of golf balls. Just when the liquid threatens to scorch his skin, the heat disappears along with the suds, vaporized in a puff of ether to reveal smooth, unmarred flesh.</p><p>Mr. Graves withdraws so Credence can examine his healed hand. He clenches and unclenches his fist in experimentation, and is relieved to find the flaring pain of before completely vanished along with the gashes. He blinks up at the man, then manages to coax his lagging tongue to stumble out a disbelieving “Thank you!”</p><p>“Don’t mention it,” is the gruff reply.</p><p>Mr. Graves casts Credence’s palm one last glance before dropping the empty bottle back in his pocket. His stare is stony and impassive. For all Credence can tell, it could just as easily be a look of sympathy as one of irritation over potion poorly spent. Eventually, the witch jerks his chin at Tina in some unspoken signal, and she hauls herself off the crate.</p><p>“Well, Credence,” she starts to say, in a voice unmistakably marking a goodbye. “Thanks for talking with us. Like I was saying, it’s tight at the office right now – all hands on deck. I won’t be able to meet with you regularly any more, but one of us will pop in from time to time to get updates, okay?”</p><p>Her words are like a second jab to the gut. He should be happy, he knows. He should feel relieved that these conniving sorcerers won’t be darkening his doorstep any time soon. It makes the tightness in his throat and its forecast of tears all the harder to bare.</p><p>“Alright,” Credence simply says, lacking any of the words to conjure what he really feels, unsure if he even wants to.</p><p>Tina seems to understand.</p><p>“See you around,” she says. With one last small, regretful smile, she turns on her heel and disappears in a swirl of dust.</p><p>She’s vanished in front of him a handful of times before, but Credence can’t help but marvel at the patch of shadow lately occupied by his friend.</p><p>Mr. Graves is slow to follow. He straightens the lines of his suit, then rocks back and forth from the toes to the heels of his leather shoes, as though there’s something he’s waiting to say. In the end, he doesn’t say anything. He just gives Credence half a nod in place of a farewell, twists quickly on the cobbles, and is eaten by the air.</p><p>When they’re gone, the carriageway feels wholly empty, like something inside the young man’s chest was spirited away along with the witches. It calls out in its emptiness as he slides from the crate and onto his feet, though he’s laboured for years to silence its song, to numb its pain. He recalls Mr. Grave’s rough kindness as he glides ink-stained fingers over the perfectly mended slashes in his skin. The space in his chest eagerly gobbles up the scrap of affection, lean and tough though it was.</p><p>Credence starts out for home, forgetting the pamphlets completely. As always, in the long days ahead, he’ll think of Tina Goldstein. And now he’ll think of Mr. Graves, too.</p>
