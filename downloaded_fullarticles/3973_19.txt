    <p>“And that’s a wrap for this weeks match! Tune in next week when the Harpies go up against the undefeated Montrose Magpies in a bid to advance toward this year’s semifinals. As always, I’m Rhys Broadmore, and this is Quidditch Nightly!”</p><p>As the program ended, an advert for Sleek Shaft’s Broom Polish came on, with their familiar jingle. “<em> On a Sleek Shaft broom, you can zoom zoom zoom!” </em> Harry leaned over to switch off the wireless, but a <em> whoosh </em> at the Floo distracted him.</p><p>“Harry! Mate!” Ron’s voice drifted up from the sitting room. Harry left his bedroom, pulling a shirt over his head as he went. “Did you hear?!” Ron was standing outside the fireplace, clearly ecstatic.</p><p>“Yeah, I was listening on the wireless, you know that.” Harry answered, just as excited. “Can you believe their winning streak? They’ve got a good chance against the Magpies.”</p><p>“I know! And if they hadn’t lost those first two games of the season, they’d be undefeated, too.”</p><p>“So would the Cannons, if they’d won <em> any </em> games this season,” Harry said, simply to get a rise out of Ron, but his friend just waved a hand dismissively.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah. It’s all about the Harpies this year!”</p><p>Ron had good reason to be excited about a team other than his beloved Cannons. It was Ginny’s first year as the captain of the Holyhead Harpies, and they were crushing the competition. Harry and Ron listened to every game, Ron at the Ministry and Harry at his flat, and afterwards they met Hermione at the pub for drinks. It was their weekly routine, and Harry really looked forward to it. It was the only social interaction he got these days. All his friends were extremely busy, and while Harry had his own responsibilities, he sometimes felt lonely when he came home to an empty house.</p><p>The pub they’d chosen that week was only a short walk from his house. Harry was pleased to find George and Luna were also waiting there with Hermione.</p><p>Rounds were bought and the game discussed, before their food arrived (”Don’t steal my chips this time Ron,” George warned, “I’m starving!) and the conversation turned to catching up on all their respective weeks. Hermione and Luna broke off into a heated discussion of rights for magical creatures who were only rumoured to exist, with Ron acting as referee, and Harry turned to George.</p><p>“How’s the new shop going?”</p><p>“Oh, it’s excellent! Really great to be back near Hogwarts. Poor McGonagall won’t know what hit her though, after the first Hogsmeade weekend. We’ve got a brand new line of Skiving Snackboxes.”</p><p>Harry laughed, fond memories returning to him. “Hogsmeade really seemed amazing back then. Getting a break from school was special. They’re lucky to have your shop now, too.”</p><p>“It’s still pretty amazing. The Three Broomsticks is the same as ever, although Rosmerta takes more time off now and leaves it to Lavender. I can personally vouch for the continued sweetness of Honeydukes. And I get to see Lee a lot, since he works up the road at the WWN.”</p><p>“That’s right, I always forget their headquarters is there.”</p><p>“There’s a lot of interesting new people there, actually. In fact - oi!” Ron had snagged one of George’s chips. He retaliated by taking a sip of his lager, before turning back to Harry. “I’ve been thinking of asking one of the station managers out.”</p><p>“Oh?” George had been single since the end of the war. It had taken him a long time to come to terms with Fred’s death.”I’m happy to hear that, mate. What’s she like?”</p><p>“She’s a firecracker,” George grinned. “Came in to get a few choice pranks for some new intern to the station. Completely professional, but knows how to joke around. Also stunning.”</p><p>“Sounds perfect for you.”</p><p>“Yeah, so…” he twirled a chip around before biting it thoughtfully. Swallowing, a determined look came over his face. “You know I hate to ask you for favours.”</p><p>“You shouldn’t. We’re family, George.”</p><p>“Exactly! So you’ll do it?”</p><p>“Sure, I’ll- wait, what is it?”</p><p>“Just, I want a reason to go talk to her again, yeah? And she’s really been trying to make a name for herself there. I know an interview with you would go a long way.”</p><p>Harry just stared at George. “An <em> interview</em>? I never give interviews anymore!” There had been several recent requests with the tenth anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts only months away.</p><p>“Which is why it’ll be so impressive!” He turned pleading eyes on Harry. “Come on, mate, I haven’t liked anyone this much in a long time.”</p><p>“Look, George…” Harry really hated to say no to him. But he also hated giving interviews. He sighed in resignation. “I’d want to know that she wasn’t going to ask any personal questions. Just stuff about the charities I’m raising for, or the pieces of Hermione’s legislation that I backed. Public stuff.”</p><p>“Of course! Daph’s part of the new wave, trying to turn the station away from just being a soapbox for the ministry. She doesn’t care about gossip.” George looked elated. “I’ll owl her and let her know you’re interested.”</p><p>“Interested is a bit of an overstatement,” Harry said, shaking his head and stealing a chip just to annoy him.</p><p>***</p><p>Hanging out with Luna always seemed to make them lose track of time, and it was nearly 1am when they finally departed. Harry Apparated outside his door and immediately tensed. He could hear muffled voices inside the flat. Slowly he opened the door, wand out, only to sigh in relief as he realised it was just the wireless in his bedroom that he’d forgotten to turn off. He made his way upstairs and the voices became clearer.</p><p>It was late enough that the WWN had switched over to talk format. Lee Jordan had his show once a week at midnight, where he played an eclectic mix of jazz music, stand up bits, and scathing Quidditch commentary. Sometimes the comedy turned a bit risqué for Harry’s taste. George had told Harry that Lee was actually banned from commentating the live matches, which wasn’t surprising, given his performance at Hogwarts.</p><p>This wasn’t Lee’s day, so it must have been one of those call in shows where people complained about politics or their love lives. Sure enough, the first sentence Harry could make out was:</p><p>“…I just want to please her, you know? She’s such a wonderful woman.”</p><p>“That’s good that you want to. It’s important to not be selfish in bed. She sounds like she’s willing to be patient with you. Learning each other’s bodies is actually one of the most fun parts of a new relationship. Just approach it as exciting, rather than petrifying.”</p><p>Harry froze. This was not some lovestruck witches advice show. Both voices were male, the first with a nervous tremor, the second with a smooth lilt. It sounded familiar to Harry, but he couldn’t place it.</p><p>“Do you have any advice for what I could do to make her, um… you know?”<br/> </p><p>“To bring her to orgasm?”</p><p>Harry choked. “Yeah, that.”</p><p>“Well, everyone is different. Some women can only achieve orgasm from clitoral stimulation, others need penetration. There are more ways to make a woman come than to open a door. Do you need <em> Alohomora </em> or <em> Bombarda</em>?” The caller laughed. “But seriously, the best way is to explore it together. Ask her to masturbate for you, if she’s comfortable with it.”</p><p>“What, like in front of me?”</p><p>“Absolutely. Pay attention to how she touches herself. And mutual masturbation can be just as satisfying as more traditional sex.”</p><p>“Huh. I always thought of that as something to do alone.”</p><p>“If it feels good by yourself, it can feel just as good with a partner.”</p><p>“That makes sense. Hey, thanks. I think this is really gonna help me.”</p><p>“You’re very welcome. Thank you for calling.”</p><p>Soft music was raised in volume for a moment, and then lowered, as a third voice with an American accent chimed in. “That’s all the time we have for tonight. Thanks for tuning in to <em> Intimacy Issues </em> on the WWN. If you have any questions for our Professor of Love-”</p><p>“-No, Robert. Absolutely not.-”</p><p>“-then call us next week. We’re here every Friday at midnight. <em> Softer Sounds of Soothing Scotland </em> is up next, to take you into the night. You’re tuned into WWN, your number one choice on the dial.”</p><p>A gentle bagpipe song began playing and Harry realised he’d been standing stock still in his bedroom for the past few minutes. What the hell was that show? How long had it been on? How were they allowed to say that on air?</p><p>He knew all those words, but he’d never heard terms for the female anatomy spoken so matter of factly, only in adolescent joking. Everyone on air had spoken so calmly, though, so he knew it wasn’t a comedy bit.</p><p>Harry was also no stranger to female pleasure. He’d dated Ginny after all, and she knew how to take what she wanted. But she’d been easily satisfied, and they’d never really been verbal during sex, and especially not outside of it. She had asked Harry if there was anything new he’d like to try in the bedroom once, but he’d blushed and stammered and was grateful when she dropped the subject. He couldn’t imagine discussing it with a perfect stranger.</p><p><br/> </p><p>***</p><p>The Harpies did indeed win against the Magpies the next week, and the mood at the pub was celebratory.</p><p>Harry had thought about asking Ron or Hermione if they’d ever heard the show from last week, but found he couldn’t bring himself to tell them why he cared. He definitely wasn’t going to say <em> orgasm </em> to Hermione.</p><p>He arrived home only a few minutes to midnight. Tentatively, Harry flicked on the wireless, turning the dial to channel 1. He told himself it was only to make sure he hadn’t been dreaming last week. It was still five minutes to midnight, and an older Weird Sisters song was playing. Harry finished getting ready for bed and climbed under the covers just as the music program came to an end.</p><p>“Hope you enjoyed that little blast from the past. I’ve had a great night, but now I’ll say goodbye as we head into the weekend. Up next, make sure the kiddies are in bed, because it’s time for <em> Intimacy Issues</em>. I’m Lucid Lou, and you’re tuned into WWN.”</p><p>So Harry hadn’t imagined it. There really was a show called that, and they really did talk about sex. The jaunty tune that Lou had played last continued for a few more seconds before fading down, and the same youngish-sounding American voice that had closed the last program returned.</p><p>“Hey everybody, it’s the weekend, which means it’s time again for <em> Intimacy Issues</em>. I’m your lowly, put upon intern Robert, and the Love Guru-</p><p>“-I <em> will </em> fire you, Robert-”</p><p>“-is here to answer your questions. Dude, think of a better name and I’ll use it.”</p><p>“You’re the intern. You do it.”</p><p>“I try!”</p><p>“Try harder.”</p><p>Robert laughed and continued. “Ok, so for those of you just tuning in, this is how it works. Call our Floo at WWN and ask us your question. We’ve got a privacy screen up, so no one sees anyone’s face. All perfectly safe, all perfectly anonymous. You can be explicit, but always be respectful.” A soft <em> whoosh </em> sounded in the background. “Looks like we’ve got our first caller! Caller, go ahead.”</p><p>After a beat came a tentative “Hello?”</p><p>“Hello,” the British voice answered. “What’s on your mind tonight?”</p><p>“Well, my boyfriend…” The girl trailed off, prompting an encouraging “go on, it’s ok” from the host.</p><p>“When we have sex, I’m always worried about getting pregnant. I just don’t trust the spells, you know? And I know there’s a potion, but it’s always made me sick. So I asked him if he’d use condoms - they’re a Muggle thing, they go on the um, penis, and catch the uh, stuff…”</p><p>“I know what they are, but thanks for explaining for any listeners who don’t.”</p><p>“Well he won’t do it!” She sounded angry. “He says they feel weird, but I know it’s because he’s Pure-blood and just doesn’t like them since they’re Muggle. And that makes me feel shitty, because I’m Muggleborn! So I told him we weren’t having sex until he gave in, so <em> he </em> said fine, he’ll just find a witch who <em> will </em> put out, and we haven’t spoken in a week!” She paused to catch her breath. “Do you think I was unreasonable?”</p><p>“Well first, I want to address what he said to you about ‘putting out.’ That was rather rude. Relationships aren’t all about sex. Have the two of you been together long?”</p><p>“Two years, but we only started having sex a few months ago.”</p><p>“Hmm. It’s possible he just said that in anger and doesn’t mean it. It doesn’t make it ok, of course, and he should apologise for it. Ask him how he would feel if you implied you only valued him for sex.”</p><p>“Yeah. I don’t think he was serious.”</p><p>“The other pressing issue here is birth control. If the potion makes you sick, it’s not an option. Can you tell me why you don’t trust contraception spells? They have been proven to be nearly 98% effective when cast competently.”</p><p>“I can’t see it, though. The only way you know it fails is if you get knocked up, and then it’s too late. You can see if a condom breaks.  And I’m used to them. I’ve known about condoms since I was a little girl.”</p><p>“Do you know what I think?” the host asked. “I think maybe you both have the same reasons. He was raised around magic, so he trusts the spell. You weren’t, so you trust Muggle condoms - which, incidentally, have about the same failure rate when used correctly.”</p><p>“I didn’t know that,” she said, surprised.</p><p>“If you both trust your casting skills, either method is equally effective. The issue here is what you are comfortable with. Have you told him your concerns that he’s prejudiced unfairly against them, and how that makes you feel about your background?”</p><p>Quietly, she answered “No.”</p><p>“That’s the first step, then. It’s something you need to discuss before moving forward. It is possible he distrusts them simply because they are Muggle, which would be unfortunate. But he might just be scared of their failure. Also, condoms do have a feeling that some men describe as strange, but they don’t dull sensation so much that sex isn’t perfectly enjoyable.”</p><p>“Have you ever used one?” There was a beat, and then a sharp bark of laughter from Robert the intern, making Harry think the two hosts had exchanged some sort of non-verbal gesture.</p><p>“Ah, no, I’ve always used spells for contraception or protection from STDs.”</p><p>“Are you Pure-blood, then?” she enquired.</p><p>Another beat. “I prefer not to get into too many details about myself. This is about answering your question after all.” Harry thought there was no way the host was Pure-blood. He was too knowledgeable about Muggle prophylactics and not enough of a prude.</p><p>“Sorry,” the caller apologised.</p><p>“It’s quite alright.”</p><p>“Anyways, I think you’re right, I should have told him I was worried about what he thought. Thanks”</p><p>“I hope it works out for you. Thank you for calling.”</p><p>A small musical interlude began playing, and Harry felt his eyes grow tired. Part of him wanted to keep listening, but another part was ashamed. It wasn’t his business whether a stranger used a condom or not. This program felt totally voyeuristic. The hosts were probably laughing at everyone as soon as the mic was off.</p><p>Determined to forget about it, Harry switched off the dial and went to bed.</p><p>***</p><p>The next week, all the Quidditch teams going to the semi-finals had a break, and Harry was watching Teddy, so pub night was out. They had a lovely day together going to the park and a small Muggle zoo. Teddy was nearing ten and well able to keep his hair from changing colour in front of the Muggles. He was still a ball of energy, though, and Harry was exhausted by the time they arrived home. After takeaway and a movie he started to fall asleep on the couch. He’d still not bothered to get a flat bigger than one bedroom - what was the point? - so he sent Teddy upstairs to sleep in his bed.</p><p>Sometime in the night, he was awoken by hushed voices.</p><p><em> Is Teddy on a Floo call</em>? he wondered groggily. A quick <em> Tempus </em> charm told him it was after midnight, so he doubted that. He fumbled around for his glasses and made his way upstairs, curious.</p><p>Through the door he could hear that same soft, posh voice that had plagued him before.</p><p>“…you enjoy the loss of control?”</p><p>“I mean, I guess. But that’s scary. What if he hurts me?” a male voice with a Scottish accent asked.</p><p>“Do you think he would do so on purpose?”</p><p>“No. But if I’ve given him permission to do whatever-”</p><p>“Listen. BDSM is not ‘permission to do whatever.’ There are roles and rules within any scene. You work out your boundaries and safe words ahead of time, and respect them.”</p><p><em> Safe words</em>?! Harry threw the door open.</p><p>“What the hell are you listening to?” It was a rhetorical question. Harry knew exactly what he was listening to. He stomped over to the wireless and flipped it off.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to!” Teddy cried out. “I couldn’t sleep, and I thought Lee might be on.” His eyes went wide - he knew he wasn’t supposed to listen to Lee’s show, either - and he shook a little. Harry immediately calmed down. He wasn’t going to be the kind of godparent who yelled.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Teddy. That stuff just isn’t appropriate.”</p><p>“Oh.” Teddy bit his lip. “Is it wrong?”</p><p>“It’s-” <em> It’s dirty</em>, he wanted to say, but he also didn’t want Teddy to think <em> all </em> sex was dirty. Merlin, he didn’t want Teddy to think about sex at all. Why did kids have to grow up?</p><p>“Sex isn’t wrong. But it’s a personal thing. I don’t know why those people like talking about it on air.” He sat down on the bed next to Teddy. “Someday when you’re older you’ll learn about all that and share it with someone special to you. In private.”</p><p>“Ok.” He looked up at Harry. “I thought you might be mad because it was about two boys.”</p><p>“Why would I be mad about <em> that</em>?”</p><p>“Well, Zoey Smith at school says it’s gross. She says they shouldn’t send queers Hogwarts letters.”</p><p>“That isn’t true. And most people don’t agree.” Teddy went to a half day school for pre-Hogwarts kids, and Harry would bet an arm that ‘Zoey Smith’ was somehow related to Zacharias, the prat.</p><p>Teddy shifted uncomfortably on the bed. “But we don’t know any, do we?”</p><p>Harry emphatically did <em> not </em> want to have the sex talk with Teddy, about boys <em> or </em> girls. But he didn’t want to let little prejudicial brats have the last word, either.</p><p>“Look, next time Zoey Smith starts talking like that, you tell her the best Headmaster Hogwarts ever had was gay.” Teddy’s eyes went round. He then deflated a little. “Yeah, but Dumbledore’s dead.”</p><p>Harry sighed. “Ted, can you keep a secret?” The boy nodded quickly. Harry only called him ‘Ted’ when he was being very serious. “Ok. Now, remember what I said about things being private. But your Uncle Harry has gone on dates with boys.”</p><p>“You’re gay?” Teddy gasped.</p><p>“No,” Harry corrected him. “I go on dates with girls, too. People don’t have to pick.”</p><p>“Wow.” Teddy was lost in his thoughts for a minute, and then yawned. Harry ruffled his hair.</p><p>“Get back to bed. I’ll make pancakes in the morning.”</p><p>“’Kay.” Teddy crawled under the covers, his hair slowly fading from the pale lavender it had affected when Harry burst into the room back to his customary blue. Harry wanted to lean in to give him a kiss, but knew he might be swatted away. Teddy thought he was too old for kisses now. So he settled for giving him a squeeze on the shoulder, and then turning out the light on his way back downstairs.</p><p>He wondered if he should tell Andromeda. On one hand, she was Teddy’s real caretaker, and she deserved to know he had been asking questions. But Harry also didn’t want to have to let her know her grandson had been listening to a radio program about bondage and domination.</p><p>Harry fumed.  If it weren’t for that blasted sex show, he wouldn’t have this problem in the first place.</p><p>***</p><p>The owl from George arrived a few days later, with a request.</p><p>
  <em> Daphne says thanks for offering to give her an interview. She thinks a preliminary meeting would be best so you feel comfortable. She’s in her office any day after 2pm at the WWN, just ask for Greengrass. You’re a true mate! Pretty sure she’ll say yes to dinner after this. </em>
</p><p>Harry shook his head. Greengrass? The Slytherin? George was barking. True, Harry couldn’t recall too much about her, other than she’d hung around with Parkinson and the other snooty girls in her house, and had been such an exceptional priss it’d earned her a nickname. But he couldn’t remember her past 5th year. Maybe she’d changed. The rest of them weren’t the same as when they were fifteen, after all. He sent an owl ahead to the station, saying Thursday was good for him.</p><p>It had been a long time since Harry set foot in Hogsmeade. The WWN building was at the end of a long winding path, set back from the shops. A strange network of large spinning dishes projected from the roof, which Harry surmised were the magical equivalent of radio equipment. There was no bell to ring on the door, just a lobby with a receptionist, a boy who barely looked out of Hogwarts and was sporting a small, orange mohawk. He glanced up at Harry and did a double take.</p><p>“I didn’t think she was serious!”</p><p>“Er, I’m here to see-”</p><p>“Yeah, you’re here to see Daphne. Blimey, when she said to stay awake at the desk today because Harry Potter was coming by, I thought she was having me on.” He gestured toward one of several doors that led to different hallways. “Go on in, she’s expecting you, I guess.”</p><p>The sign on the frosted glass read<em> News, Educational and Talk Programming</em>. Behind it were even more doors.  Harry walked past several that looked like offices, and what was obviously a recording booth. There was no one at the mic, and he wondered what was currently on the air. A few doors from the end he came to a placard that read <em>Head of NET</em> <em>Programming - Daphne Greengrass</em>. There were voices inside. Harry knocked lightly on the glass.</p><p>“Come in!” a muffled voice shouted. He opened the door and say a tiny blond woman standing with her arms akimbo, angrily facing a Floo.</p><p>“I told you that wasn’t an option!” Daphne looked positively livid. “I don’t care how many adverts they’ve bought over the years, it doesn’t exempt them from investigative reporting! WWN isn’t at anyone’s beck and call anymore, and certainly not your client’s!” The red-faced older wizard in the fire - at least, Harry assumed he was red-faced, the Floo cast everyone in a sickly shade of green - sputtered in rage.</p><p>“Now see here, Miss Greengrass, I know the Ministry has let you <em> children </em> run out of control over there, but that’s no excuse to get above your station!” It was the wrong thing to say. Daphne’s eyes narrowed, and she stalked closer to the Floo.</p><p>“If you truly think we’re only children playing at this, then your client has nothing to fear.” The angry wizard opened his mouth to throw back another retort, but she cut him off with a “Good Day!” and extinguished the Floo with her wand.</p><p>With a huff of frustration, she turned back to Harry. “Sorry you had to see that,” she said with a forced smile. “Some people think their money can get them out of anything. Thank you for coming, Mr. Potter. Please, do sit down.”</p><p>In the past, Harry had been accused of being unobservant, and it wasn’t without merit. But since getting more involved with charities and the ins and outs of fundraising he’d come to be much better at reading people. And what he gleaned from the scene he’d just witnessed was this: Daphne had invited him in on purpose. She could have told him to wait in the hall, but she wanted him to see her argument. She wanted to look in control, principled, and far from the idea of rich Pure-bloods buying their way out of trouble. All in all, it was a display calculated to impress Harry, and a very Slytherin thing to do.</p><p>Normally Harry didn’t like being manipulated, but he had to admit that he didn’t think she was presenting herself in a false light if what George had told him about her was true. So he let her have her moment and sat down as requested.</p><p>“Let’s get right to it, shall we?” Her smile turned pleasant as she took out a piece of parchment and, Harry noted with interest, a Muggle pen. “It’s the tenth anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts this year, and while I’m sure neither of us wants to dwell on the past too much, people are hoping for some sort of remembrance. An interview with you about what strides we’ve made since that time would be most appreciated.”</p><p><em> Yeah, for your ratings, </em> Harry thought, but decided to be gracious. “I won’t go into details about my personal life, but I’m happy to talk about some of the effects of the legislation Hermione has passed or the charities I support. I really don’t think it’ll be all that interesting to your listeners. They already know most of that stuff.”</p><p>“Yes, but hearing it from you will get them tuned in. So, ok, no personal details. Got it. I’ll take any questions about your family or romantic life off the table. As she’s involved in the legislation you mentioned, I may ask about Hermione Granger, in a professional capacity of course. Do you consider light questions about your hobbies or sports to be personal?”</p><p>Harry blinked. This was much easier than dealing with any reporters he’d encountered in the past. “Er, not really.”</p><p>“Excellent. Are there any products you object to on the sponsor breaks? For example, if you are vegetarian, we won’t air any spots for Hornbergs Humdinger Hams.” Harry shook his head no. “Alright then. I think that about covers the basics. This will be a live interview, so you don’t have to worry about creative edits or any Quick-Quotes Quills.” Harry didn’t miss the dig at Rita Skeeter.</p><p>“Finally, there will be no one else allowed in the studio except station personnel. I’ll be conducting the interview, but if there is anyone who works here at the station you’d like to sit in, that is acceptable.”</p><p>“Lee’s the only one I know here. We haven’t talked in a few months, but I’ve listened to his show. Could he interview me?”</p><p>She didn’t appear offended at the request, but denied it smoothly. “Lee is on holiday this month.”</p><p>“Then no, I can’t think of anyone.”</p><p>She made a couple more notes, and stood up, holding her hand out. “Thank you for coming in, Mr. Potter. I look forward to this interview.”</p><p>Harry stood as well and took her hand. She had a very firm shake. “It doesn’t sound like it’ll be too bad, Greengrass- um, Miss Gree-”</p><p>“Daphne, please,” she said, cutting off his attempt to figure out what name to use.</p><p>“Harry’s fine, then. They don’t call you Queenie, anymore?” he grinned. She rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Ugh. My sister started that.”</p><p>“I didn’t know you had a sister.” Harry hadn’t kept track of the Slytherins who weren’t in his year very well.</p><p>Daphne raised an eyebrow. “You missed her glorious run on the society pages? She’ll be so disappointed.”</p><p>“If it was in the <em> Prophet</em>, I didn’t see it. They haven’t changed one bit, as far as I know, so I don’t read it.”</p><p>“No, they haven’t,” she agreed. “In fact, the way those vultures treated Astoria was one of the reasons I’m committed to pursuing a better form of journalism.”</p><p>“If she’s anything like you, I’m sure they regretted it. You’re kind of scary.” Daphne threw her head back and laughed. “She ignored it for the most part. Couldn’t care less about her public face, that one. Usually has her nose in a book. Anyways, as soon as she stopped dating Draco they lost interest in her.”</p><p>Harry froze. “Malfoy? She was dating <em> Malfoy</em>? What’d he do to her?”</p><p>Daphne let out a disgusted sigh. “Don’t <em> tell </em> me the two of you still carry on. Do to her, indeed. He didn’t do anything, they’re still best friends. They just weren’t suited as a couple, he’s-” She cut off. “Well. That’s between you and Draco.”</p><p>“I don’t think I’ll be talking to Malfoy about his love life any time soon, thanks.”</p><p>She regarded him for a moment with amusement in her eyes, and Harry felt like there was a joke he wasn’t getting. “I’m sure.” She moved around the desk towards the door. “Well, thank you again for coming in, Harry. I’m off to lunch.” He opened the door and held it for her, feeling silly as he did, but he was closer. She locked it behind them, then turned to him suddenly.</p><p>“Most of the station will be leaving now for lunch as well, so if you want to avoid the crush feel free to continue on down through the back entrance.”</p><p>“Yeah, thanks. I think I will.”</p><p>With a jaunty little wave goodbye, she left him standing in the hallway. He could see why George liked her - she was rather pretty, and full of fire. Still, as he turned to leave, Harry couldn’t shake the feeling that somehow he’d been played.</p><p>There were still several doors left to pass on the way to the back entrance. One was another office, this time with Lee’s name on the placard, and another looked to be an equipment room. But the last door was open, revealing a small studio with several microphones, a strange tangle of wires, and two men. Their backs were turned to Harry as they examined a cork board. One was a short, skinny wizard with long, brown hair, who was levitating note cards to different positions on the board.</p><p>The other was unmistakably Draco Malfoy.</p><p>Harry made a small ‘eep!’ noise, but it was enough to be heard. Both Malfoy and his companion turned around, and Malfoy’s eyes went wide with shock. He looked very unhappy to see Harry.</p><p>“Potter? What the hell are you doing here?”</p><p>The instant he spoke, the gears in Harry’s mind whirled, and he put two and two together. <em> That voice! In a radio station! </em></p><p>“You’re the Love Professor!” he blurted out. The short wizard dissolved into laughter, and Malfoy stormed over to the door.</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about. Get out. You aren’t allowed to be back here.”</p><p>“Daphne let me in.” Belatedly, Harry realised that she must have known he would see Malfoy on his way out. She probably thought it was hilarious. She and George were perfect for each other.</p><p>The other man - boy, actually, as now that Harry could see his face he looked no older than 18 - glanced between him and Malfoy nervously. “Should I Obliviate him, Drake?”</p><p>“Robert. I know you are American, but <em> that </em> is Harry Potter. Harry. Potter.” At Robert’s blank look, Malfoy gestured towards Harry’s scar. He was beginning to feel on display.</p><p>Robert looked at his forehead and shrugged. Malfoy pinched the bridge of his nose. He looked like he had a headache coming on. “Whatever. Just never pull a wand on him. Although if you ever call me ‘Drake’ again, <em> I’ll </em> Obliviate <em> you</em>.” Robert put his hands up in a placating manner. “Yeah, sure dude.”</p><p>Malfoy turned back to Harry. “I know we aren’t friends, Potter, but I’d appreciate it if you didn’t tell anyone about this.”</p><p>“What, that you’re the perverted DJ on the night shift?”</p><p>“Perverted?!”</p><p>“Malfoy, I caught a kid with the radio on during that… stuff you talk about! He’s only 10! How is that allowed on the air?”</p><p>“It’s past the watershed! It’s not my fault you can’t keep your child in bed.”</p><p>“He’s not my - that’s not the point. How are you even qualified to know all that?” As soon has he asked, Harry went red. He didn’t actually need to know how Malfoy was qualified to talk about the decidedly sexual things he discussed on air.</p><p>Malfoy noticed his blush, and smirked. “Oh. I see.”</p><p>“See what?”</p><p>“Look. I don’t want this to be a problem. I know how you get.  Are you free tonight?”</p><p>Harry’s mouth opened, but no words came out.</p><p>“I’ll take that as a yes. I’ll meet you at the Silent Jarvey in Diagon at 8, if that’s acceptable.” Draco didn’t wait for confirmation; he stepped back and swung the door shut in Harry’s face.</p><p>For a full minute, Harry simply stood in the hallway. Eventually he remembered to shut his mouth. He thought about knocking on the door again and telling Malfoy that no, it wasn’t acceptable, under no circumstances was he going to have a drink with him, but he somehow knew that Malfoy wouldn’t take no for an answer. The thought of sitting down for a conversation with Malfoy after years of not seeing him except in passing on Diagon Alley was surreal, but his curiosity had been peaked. Was Malfoy going to try to convince Harry not to reveal his identity? And what did he mean by “I know how you get?”</p><p>There was really only one way to find out.</p><p>***</p><p>The Silent Jarvey was one of a number of new businesses that had sprung up in the years after the war, taking advantage of Ministry incentives aimed at growing the post-war economy. It was nicer inside than the Leaky Cauldron, but far from fancy. A number of booths lined the back wall, perfect for a private conversation. It wasn’t terribly busy, being a weekday, and there were only about ten people inside. Harry spotted Malfoy’s distinctive white-blond hair at one of the booths and made his way over.</p><p>Malfoy glanced up from perusing the menu. “I assume you’ve already eaten dinner. I thought I might order a small plate to accompany whatever ale this place serves. Do you have a preference?”</p><p>“Chips? I guess? I didn’t actually eat dinner, I kind of forgot. Why did you want me to meet you here?”</p><p>“I’ll get to that, Potter. Food first. The platter is rather a lot, but I suppose if you’re really hungry you can just eat most of it. What are you drinking?”</p><p>“Lager?” Harry didn’t know why he was answering everything in the form of a question. Draco tapped his wand on several parts of the menu and set it aside.</p><p>“That will all arrive in a few minutes. Sit down, you’re making me nervous.”</p><p>Harry slid into the booth across from Malfoy. “Are you going to tell me what this is all about?”</p><p>“First tell me why you were at the station today. Were you looking for me?”</p><p>“No! I had a meeting with Daphne. She’s going to interview me next week.”</p><p>Malfoy looked surprised. “Harry Potter, infamous avoider of the press, voluntarily giving an interview? I wasn’t aware you were friends with Daphne. You certainly weren’t in school.”</p><p>“I’m not. She doesn’t seem all that bad though. Maybe a little frightening, but she was fine to deal with. Not like most reporters.” Draco snorted.</p><p>“Don’t let her hear you call her a mere ‘reporter.’ That woman runs the department with an iron fist. She was never that intimidating when we were young, I don’t know where she’d been hiding it.”</p><p>“You must know her pretty well. You dated her sister.”</p><p>“Don’t believe everything you read in the <em> Prophet</em>, Potter.”</p><p>“I never read it. Daphne told me, that’s all.”</p><p>“So you <em> were </em> asking about me.”</p><p>“I wasn’t!” Harry was getting irritated. “Not everything is about you, Malfoy. I had no idea you worked there.”</p><p>“But you’ve heard my show.”</p><p>“Yeah, your <em> dirty </em> show.”</p><p>“It’s not-” Malfoy snapped, but was his retort was cut off by the arrival of their food and drinks, which floated over to the table. There was a plate of piping hot chips, a platter of several meats, cheeses, and breads, a nutty brown lager for Harry and a dark beer with a thick head for Malfoy. He took a sip, a bit of froth clinging to his top lip. They sat in silence for a few minutes as Harry dug into the platter - he really had been hungry. “Go on then,” he said eventually, gesturing at Malfoy with a chip. “You were telling me how your show isn’t dirty.”</p><p>“It <em> isn’t</em>. Sex isn’t dirty.”</p><p>“Maybe not, but how’d you gather talking about that stuff on the radio was a good idea?”</p><p>“It’s a long story.”</p><p>“Did you ask me here just to tell it to me? I don’t much care how you got into it. I just think it’s weird.”</p><p>“You say you don’t, but you obsess, Potter. I’ve seen it. You’re like a dog with a bone, and I know that if I don’t explain myself you’ll run all over creation telling your little friends how Draco Malfoy is a pervert, getting his kicks by telling lurid stories on the wireless, and it’s not like that.”</p><p>“How is it, then?”</p><p>Malfoy leaned back with a sigh, and took another sip of his beer. He seemed to be considering the best way to begin. “I did date Astoria. Daphne had a little soiree when she first got promoted at the station, 4 years back. I somehow found myself on the guest list. I didn’t really know anyone else there and I hadn’t been close to Daphne in school, so I ended up drinking in a corner. Astoria isn’t much of a social butterfly, and there were a limited amount of corners, so we spent most of the night just talking to each other and avoiding everyone else.”</p><p>“And love blossomed among the outcasts?”</p><p>Malfoy laughed sharply. “Hardly. No, we actually discussed how when we were younger, she’d been on my parent’s shortlist of candidates for betrothal.”</p><p>“Wait, an arranged marriage?” Malfoy nodded.</p><p>“Of course, the idea of contracts went out the window along with our status after the war. I joked that she’d dodged a bullet, and she said I didn’t seem all that bad. I said considering all the other options, she didn’t either. It wasn’t very romantic, but… I guess the idea of what might have been intrigued her. She asked me out to dinner, and I said yes.”</p><p>“I sort of always assumed you’d end up with Pansy,” Harry admitted.</p><p>A troubled expression fell over Malfoy’s face. “No one talks to Pansy anymore. I was worried about her, actually, but Daphne found out that she’s just gone to Amsterdam and is working over there. Something to do with fashion. Either way, she’s cut herself off from everyone here, and there’s not much to be done about it.”</p><p>“Oh.” Harry couldn’t say he was upset to hear that Pansy Parkinson was out of Britain. He’d no idea what he’d say to her if they ever saw each other again. “So why didn’t it work out with Astoria?”</p><p>“Nothing terrible happened. We’re still very good friends. We just…” Malfoy paused to nibble a piece of cheese, before continuing.  “This is part of the long story. Astoria and I became very close, emotionally, but that physical spark never really materialised. There were a lot of things I hadn’t really admitted to myself. She’s the kind of woman who likes to make sure she’s given something a proper go before giving up, though, so we decided to try some things to create that spark.”</p><p>Harry was pretty sure he knew what Malfoy was alluding to. “You mean you weren’t attracted to each other.”</p><p>“She’s very pretty, and I’m, well, me, so there was definitely a visual appreciation.” Malfoy smirked when Harry rolled his eyes. “But yes. The sex just wasn’t very good. So we tried to spice it up, went to a few clubs.”</p><p>“Like sex clubs?” Harry was becoming uncomfortable with the direction this conversation was going. “I don’t think I need to hear details, Malfoy.”</p><p>“And I’m not going to give them. Suffice it to say, we came to a number of realisations. Astoria likes being in charge, and I like men.”</p><p>He let the admission hang in the air between them.</p><p>“You’re - you’re gay?” Harry finally choked out.</p><p>“Yes,” Malfoy nodded. “Well, mostly.”</p><p>Harry was confused. “I thought that ‘gay’ was pretty clear cut.”</p><p>“It doesn’t have to be. Sexuality is a delicate, nuanced thing. And that’s what I learned from going to places where sex was discussed frankly, was practised without apology. Coming to terms with and accepting parts of myself that I had never acknowledged changed my life for the better. It was scary, at first,” he admitted. “I was like you. I didn’t think sex should be talked about in the open. I thought it was wrong.”</p><p>“I don’t think sex is wrong, Malfoy. I just think…”</p><p>“That it should be hidden, or shameful?”</p><p>“I’m not a prude!”</p><p>Malfoy eyed him shrewdly. “Maybe not. But you are frightened of confronting it with other people.”</p><p>“Is that why you ended up with a radio show about sex, then? You thought everyone should confront it?”</p><p>“Actually, it was Daphne’s idea. She wanted to pull the ‘protective big sister, kick the ex’s arse’ whole deal on me after the breakup. The press didn’t know about our private life, of course, but they weren’t particularly kind to Astoria when they found out she was my girlfriend, and I know Daphne resented me for it. So Astoria told her everything that happened to convince her that it wasn’t either of our faults. It just didn’t work out.”</p><p>“Because you’re ‘mostly’ gay.”</p><p>“Because our needs and desires in a relationship don’t line up,” he corrected. “And we never would have known that if we hadn’t owned up to those desires and spoke about them honestly. We would have either continued in an unfulfilled relationship, or we would have become angry and resentful and broken up spectacularly, and not remained friends.”</p><p>“I guess I see what you mean,” Harry said slowly. “But talking with your girlfriend is different than talking to the whole world about it.”</p><p>“Not everyone has someone to talk with. Some people don’t even know where to look for the answers to their questions, or what questions to ask in the first place. After speaking with Astoria and I, Daphne decided this just was the sort of thing for the new direction she wanted to take the WWN. She actually asked Astoria to host, but she’s a solicitor, and she’s far too busy. I’m a layabout, and I don’t need the money, so Daphne can keep me off the books and preserve anonymity.”</p><p>“So you do find something shameful about it,” Harry accused.</p><p>“Hardly,” Malfoy countered. “But to answer the questions people call me with, they need to have no preconceived notion of who I am. It’s not about me as a personality. And yes, I also acknowledge that who I am would be a detriment. I’m not exactly Britain’s most popular wizard. It would cause Daphne no end of grief if the <em> Prophet </em> found out she’d put me on air at all, let alone doing something that makes so many people uncomfortable.”</p><p>“I can only imagine.” Harry finished off his lager and snagged another chip. It really did seem like Malfoy had good intentions. And the way he described his personal feelings on sex sounded more like the self-help books Hermione had tried to give him after his break up with Ginny, rather than anything salacious.</p><p>“So basically you’re saying that being honest about sex made your life better, and you’re just trying to pass the favour along?.”</p><p>“That’s a rather simplistic way of describing it, but yes, essentially. Do you understand now?”</p><p>Harry pushed the plate of greasy chips away before he ate the entire thing. “I’m not gonna give you up, if that’s what you’re worried about. And your motives aren’t so bad. But I still think some things are better left as private.”</p><p>Malfoy laughed, and some of the tension seemed to bleed from his body. “A ringing endorsement from Harry Potter. ‘Not so bad.’ Thank you for hearing me out,” he continued with a more serious tone. “And thank you for keeping my secret.”</p><p>“I should really make you be the one to answer Teddy’s questions next time he sneaks out of bed late, in return.”</p><p>“I am sorry about that. What did he hear, if I may ask?”</p><p>“Um.” Harry went beet red.”It was something about safe words.”</p><p>“Ah. Yes, I agree that’s too advanced for a child of, what, ten is he now?”</p><p>Sometimes Harry forgot that Malfoy was Teddy’s cousin. It made sense that he would know what age Teddy was. “He’s almost ten, yeah.”</p><p>“Well, safe words aside, you should at least have a conversation with him about consent, if you haven’t already. He’ll be going to Hogwarts in the fall, and I think you know how lacking the sex education was there.”</p><p>“He’s way too young to be thinking about having sex.”</p><p>“Consent isn’t just about having sex.”</p><p>“I’m sure Andromeda will tell him what he needs to know.” Malfoy looked sceptical, but didn’t push it.</p><p>“You know,” Harry said tentatively, “he is your cousin. You can come by and meet him sometime, if you want.”</p><p>Malfoy’s eyes widened in pleased shock. “I would like that.”</p><p>“We’re having a birthday party for him at Andromeda’s this weekend, actually. You should come.”</p><p>“Can I bring Astoria?” Malfoy asked nervously. “I do appreciate the invite. Only, I’ve never met my aunt either, and I’m not sure how she’ll respond to my presence. I’d like some backup.”</p><p>“Yeah, that should be fine. Can you two not talk about any of this stuff while you’re there?”</p><p>“We do know how to hold a conversation that doesn’t revolve around fucking, yes,” he said sardonically, and Harry knew he was just trying to get a rise out of him.</p><p>“Well, good, because it’s even less appropriate for a child’s birthday party than it is on the radio.” Malfoy pursed his lips, but didn’t respond to the taunt. He tapped his wand on the menu again, and a bill appeared. Harry reached for it, but Malfoy snatched it up first.</p><p>“I invited you, it’s my treat.” He laid a few coins on the bill and tapped it again, causing it to vanish.</p><p>As they exited the pub, Malfoy turned to Harry. “You know,” he said curiously, “I thought you would have been more shocked at my admission of homosexuality than you were, considering how conservative as you seem to be.”</p><p>Finally, Harry had something that could unbalance Malfoy, who had seemed far too composed throughout their conversation. “You obviously don’t read the <em> Prophet</em>, either,” he said smugly.</p><p>“I like to avoid it. As do you, you said.”</p><p>“I don’t read it, no. But it was difficult to ignore their photographers when they stuck a camera in my face when I was on a date with Terry Boot.”</p><p>Malfoy’s speechless face was its own reward. After all these years, it was still satisfying to feel like he’d won something against Malfoy, even if it was childish.</p><p>“I’ll see you at Teddy’s party!” he said gleefully, before turning to Apparate away.</p>
