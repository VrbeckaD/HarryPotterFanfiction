    <p>The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.</p>
<p>~Roger Kint {The Usual Suspects}</p>
<p>...O.O.O….</p>
<p>The disease was spreading throughout the world of Elemente. The people were panicking. The disease was eating at their elemental powers, destroying it. The unlucky ones were already without their powers; many killed themselves, many other becoming Imaes, the bottom of the Elemente society. Imaes were those who were born from Elemental parents, but had no powers of their own. They were considered the worst of the worst.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore and his friend, Gellert Grindewald were getting desperate. They couldn't lose their elemental powers! Their powers were what set them apart. Made them special. Made them better.</p>
<p>So they set out into the world, trying to discover books that could save them from this crippling disease. Upon their many travels, they found one book, called: Summoning Divinity. It detailed that they could summon an angel that could eradicate all of their problems.</p>
<p>Albus and Gellert at the end of hope, and desperate, summoned the angel. The angel that they summoned was terrifyingly handsome. Strong cheekbones, wavy brown hair, and ice blue eyes. He tipped his fedora, smiling. "Is there anything that you need me to do?" He had asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr….?" Gellert said.</p>
<p>The angel just smiled. "Riddle, but please, call me Tom."</p>
<p>"Well, alright, Tom. Surely you've heard of the world of Elemente," Albus said.</p>
<p>"Of course I have heard of the world of Elemente! It was where I learned all of my elemental powers," Tom replied.</p>
<p>"Well, you see, there is a slight problem in the world of Elemente right now. There is a disease that is destroying people's powers, many who are susceptible to the disease have already become Imaes," Gellert said, sneering.</p>
<p>Tom smirked. "I will be able to save you from this disease, I have the ability to eradicate it completely so that it will not come back," Albus and Gellert sighed in relief. "But it will come with a price."</p>
<p>"Anything," Albus said. "Anything to save the Elemente world."</p>
<p>Tom's smile turned shark-like. "Then the disease will be no more." Tom raised his hand, and a black ball flew into it. "You see here, Albus, this is the disease that has been killing your powers. It is a parasite, latching onto an Elemental core, sucking the powers out of it. It will leave to find a new victim as soon as it has turned its host into an Imae. And this is how I will destroy it." A ball of flames erupted from Tom's hand, burning the disease to ashes. "Your payment will come in due time." And with that, Tom erupted into flames, and as they cleared, the angel was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>*oo*OO*oo*</p>
<p>Albus put his wizened hands to his face and sighed. When had things gotten this bad? Albus had thought that the worst had passed when Tom had killed Gellert. Albus thought that that had been the payment. But Tom had only smiled when he asked him.</p>
<p>Now, Tom had destroyed the entire Elemente world, taking it as his own. Albus had found out too late that Tom was not an angel; he was the Devil in disguise. In this world, or Hell to be more accurate, it was to join Tom; or Voldemort now that everyone knew he was the Devil, or die.</p>
<p>Now, there was only small resistance, one in which Albus had created, but it held very little hope. Until now. Word had spread that a great seer had just made a prophecy. Entailing Voldemort's demise.</p>
<p>Dumbledore recited it in his head.</p>
<p>Two will be born on the day summer dies,</p>
<p>One in light, and one in dark,</p>
<p>Choose the right one and the Devil shall be no more,</p>
<p>But choose wrong,</p>
<p>The consequences shall be dire.</p>
<p>In the rebel camp that Dumbledore had set up, there were two women that were expecting at the end of July, Alice Longbottom and Lily Potter. It was already confirmed that Alice would be bearing one child, and Lily would be having twins. As soon as he heard that Lily was having twins, he knew that one of them was the child that would save them all.</p>
<p>*oo*OO*oo*</p>
<p>Screams echoed off of the walls in the make-shift hospital of the rebels. Lily was going through contractions and she didn't know how she would take the pain. She felt a reassuring hand cover hers. She smiled weakly up at James.</p>
<p>"Come on now, Miss, you're almost there! Just one last push!" The mediwitch said.</p>
<p>Lily grunted and with one last push, the child was out. "Congratulations Mrs. Potter! You are now the mother of healthy baby boys! Would you like to test what their starting elemental powers are?"</p>
<p>Lily tiredly nodded a yes. The mediwitch waved her hand over the first boy. He had a small tuft of red hair and hazel brown eyes. A glow encased the boy and a fire surrounded him. The mediwitch turned to Lily and James. "A fire elemental, what would you like to name him?"</p>
<p>"Charlus, Charlus James Potter," James said.</p>
<p>The mediwitch waved her hands again over the second boy. This one had black hair and deep, soulful eyes. A glow surrounded him, and the room dropped several degrees. Ice began to coat the edges of the room. Lily could see her own breath in the air. "And ice elemental, a rather strong one at that. And what would you like to name him?" The mediwitch said, smiling. The room went back to its natural temperature as the mediwitch ended the spell.</p>
<p>"Hadrian. Harry for short. Hadrian Peverell Potter," Lily said, smiling softly.</p>
<p>*oo*OO*oo*</p>
<p>Hadrian stared out of the window forlornly as he watched Charlus set fire to a small bush; much to his father's amusement. Their mother was angry, obviously, but not in a way that would last long. Hadrian's point was proven correct as she too started to laugh.</p>
<p>Hadrian sighed, why was Charlus so important? Sure, he was destined to defeat the Dark Lord, but that didn't entail leaving Hadrian out of it. Hadrian scowled, the room turning cold, the glass frosted over. Why was Charlus so loved? And yet, Hadrian tossed into the shadows? It was not fair.</p>
<p>Hadrian leaned against the window, the cool of the glass comforting him. His anger dissipated and the room went back to its normal temperature. A knock at the door drew him out of his musings. He saw Lily say something to James, and left the backyard. He heard the door open and his mother's voice say, "Oh! Professor Dumbledore! So nice of you to visit, would you like anything to drink? Tea? Water?"</p>
<p>Hadrian heard Dumbledore laugh. "No, no. Quite alright, I don't need to drink anything. I'm here to talk about Charlus' education. And Hadrian's as well." Hadrian scowled in his room. Dumbledore had almost forgotten that he existed.</p>
<p>"I thought that they were both going to learn here? At the rebel camp?" James said, as he came in.</p>
<p>"Yes, they were originally going to learn with the Guardian Angels," Hadrian scoffed at the name, it was pathetic. "But I have decided that they both go to Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"You can't be serious Professor! Hogwarts is ruled by Voldemort! Wouldn't Charlus be in danger?" Lily said. Hadrian silently seethed. What about him?</p>
<p>"Yes, I understand your worries. But I have mastered the Disguise elemental power, so there need not be any worry. I will simply disguise Charlus. As for Hadrian, I do not think that Voldemort will pay too much attention to him." Hadrian hissed, he shot a ball of ice towards the wall, it shattered upon contact. So they didn't care if he died. All that mattered was their dear Charlus, the savior of the whole entire Elemente world.</p>
<p>"Hadrian!" He heard his mother's voice say. "Would you like to come down and eat breakfast with Professor Dumbledore?" Hadrian sneered. At least they hadn't forgotten that he even existed.</p>
<p>"Coming, mother!" Hadrian shouted down the stairs.</p>
<p>*oo*OO*oo*</p>
<p>Hadrian was giddy with excitement, today he was going to Hogwarts! Charlus attempted to sneer at Hadrian. "Well, who would've thought? You're going to Hogwarts? You're almost no better than an Imae! You're pathetic you know." Charlus said, pointing a fork at Hadrian.</p>
<p>"Well, I'd say that you are talking to a mirror, dear brother of mine," Hadrian drawled, stabbing one of his pancakes.</p>
<p>"You little..!" Charlus said, lunging at Hadrian. Hadrian waved a hand, and Charlus was stuck to the ground. His feet planted with ice. Charlus just smirked, and melted the ice with his fire. "You can't defeat me, Hadrian. Everybody knows that fire is more powerful than ice." Charlus summoned a ball of fire to prove his point.</p>
<p>"Oh really," Hadrian said, sneering. He waved his hand over the flames. Charlus looked up in shock as the flames fell out of his hands as landed on the kitchen table with a dull thunk. "I think that's debatable. Now stop staring like an idiot and actually make an attempt to eat your food."</p>
