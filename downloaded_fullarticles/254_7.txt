    <p>Hermione kicked a stone out of her way as she walked across the crowded campsite and it did nothing to lessen her frustrations. The stone was bigger than she had thought and sent a sharp pain shooting through her big toe. Hermione let out a grunt of fury and kept walking arms folded. The witch was completely oblivious to the chaos caused by the stone she had kicked. The stone had hit the back of a large burly wizard who turned to the purple-robed wizard next to him and grabbed him by the ear demanding he answer for poking him so hard in the back.</p><p>"Idiots!" Hermione snapped her temper still rising as she stamped onward.</p><p>"Um...good morning to you too Hermione," Said an offended sounding Parvati Patil who was stood with her sister outside their tent. Hermione spun around to look at her blushing.</p><p>"Oh no! not you Parvati...I was talking to myself...sorry, um...good morning..." Hermione rambled greatly embarrassed marching off again before her face got any redder.</p><p>"What's her problem you reckon?" Padma asked her sister, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>"What's always Hermione's problem?" Parvati asked smirking.</p><p>"Harry and Ron," The twins said in unison bursting into laughter as they watched Hermione disappear into the crowd.</p><p>Harry and Ron were such inconsiderate oafs sometimes. Here they all were at the Quidditch world cup and they'd already found a way to cut her out of the fun. Why did she have to get the water exactly? It was bloody Ron's fault the first bucket got knocked over not hers.</p><p>"Oh, the bloody stupid bucket!" Hermione said turning and looking back in the direction she had come from, she'd only gone and left the damn thing behind. She'd been so incensed at Rons having pushed the blame on to her for the spillage that she hadn't stopped to pick up the bucket when Mr. Weasley requested she go and fill another from the river at the other side of the camp.</p><p>"Honestly can't they just fill it with magic?" Hermione muttered under her breath moving to sit under a tree throwing herself down on the ground in something of a strop. Hermione realised that Arthur probably had filled another bucket himself and had sent Hermione on something of a fool's errand presumably so she and Ron would get out of each other's way for a moment and be able to calm down. Hermione picked up a daisy and began harshly pulling petals off it bitterly muttering to herself. </p><p>She was more annoyed at Harrys refusal to take sides than Ron's outburst in all honesty. She had been rather surprised by that, more often than not Harry came to Hermione's defense when Ron got out of order. This had been one time he hadn't however, perhaps he thought she was overreacting. Harry also had a lot on his plate what with that nightmare he'd told her about. Harry had spoken of it to Hermione and no one else so far, a further sign of his usual trust in her. He was probably still worrying about that and didn't have time to concern himself with Ron and his tomfoolery Hermione reasoned frowning as she felt bad for having been angry with the dark-haired wizard.</p><p>"Oh, Merlin I don't believe this...they're actually letting 'your' kind into the world cup? My how standards have fallen," a mocking snide voice said and Hermione felt sick as she instantly recognised Draco Malfoys voice. Looking up Hermione glared at the wizard for a moment before snorting with laughter as she found the boy to be ludicrously overdressed for the occasion. Everyone else had worn casual muggle wear for the most part but here was Malfoy in his dark suit with brown flat-cap standing out like a posh arrogant sore thumb.</p><p>"Stop that! what are you laughing at Granger!" Malfoy snapped his confident smirk disappearing off his face.</p><p>"Oh go slither off and bug someone else Malfoy," Hermione laughed and Malfoys face grew redder as the witches laughter grew louder.</p><p>"Shut it! Where's Potter and Weasley? I assume if their little mudblood pet is around they can't be far behind. They ought to be handed a fine for letting you off your leash. Wonder how Weasleys old man managed to even get tickets...probably sold his house....though way I hear it...it's more of a shack," Malfoy said changing the subject and Hermione clenched her fist, outraged. Not at the foul insult, he had casually sent her way but his mocking tone when he spoke about the Weasleys made her blood boil.</p><p>"Oh you look a little tense Granger....struck a nerve have I?" Malfoy said his confidence returning.</p><p>"I'm going to give you one chance to walk away Malfoy," Hermione said a dangerous look in her eye as she reached toward her wand which was just visible at her waist tucked into her jeans and Malfoy suddenly looked unwell and his joy faded from his face. He knew he was no match for Hermione in a duel no matter how much posturing he did about being the best duellist in Slytherin. </p><p>"Are you threatening me Granger....there's no magic allowed outside of school you know that," Malfoy said with a nervous laugh.</p><p>"Try me," Hermione said simply letting a tiny smile cross her face for a moment and drawing her hand ever closer to her wand.</p><p>"Granger...my...my father will hear about this!" Malfoy stuttered as he backed away almost tripping over his own feet as he retreated off into the crowd at great speed losing his nerve. Hermione got a little smirk of her own on her face and let her hand fall away from her wand. 'Yes run to daddy you yellow little ferret!' Hermione thought pleased at how she had handled the situation.</p><p>"Hey Hermione you alright there? What'd that scumbag want?" Seamus Finnigan said moving toward her an Irish Tri-colour draped over his shoulders.</p><p>"Oh just being a prat, as usual, I can handle him don't worry," Hermione said smiling at Seamus.</p><p>"I don't doubt it...you're some woman Hermione you know that? Bet you could beat him in a duel with one arm tied behind your back eh?...I'd have liked to see you jinx him out of the camp," Seamus said laughing. Hermione tried to keep her smugness at that comment from showing but couldn't quite manage it and Seamus laughed again.</p><p>"Here you'll be supporting Ireland tomorrow right? Now I don't want to fall out with you but I'm afraid I will be forced to never speak to you again if you turn out to be another Krum fangirl. I know he's got the abs and the chiseled jawline but have you seen the awful scowl the man has on him? Sure you couldn't be fecked lookin' at him," Seamus said laughing tossing an Ireland scarf to Hermione winking at her and then hurrying off to join some other Ireland supporters over by a vendor who was selling hot food.</p><p>"Guess I'll be Irish tomorrow then...let's see how Ronald likes that," Hermione muttered to herself dawning her new scarf and grinning feeling a lot calmer and happier than she had been earlier. </p><p>"Hermione there you are!" Ginny called moving past the crowd of Ireland supporters who appeared to be arguing over a fiddle now by the looks of things.</p><p>"You said it was enchanted to play Whiskey in the jar, this thing only does Danny Boy! I want my Galleons back! now!" said an irate dark-haired man brandishing the fiddle like a club he appeared ready to hit the wizard opposite with it any second now.</p><p>"Now, sir, please! let me just try another few charms on it and...hey you can't throw that! I'm not refunding you now," the enchanted fiddle vendor shouted as he watched one of his other fiddles fly through the air and bash into a tree right next to Hermione who jumped in surprise.</p><p>"Why don't we move along to the river? Things are getting a bit excited around here," Ginny said grinning reaching a hand down to Hermione to help her up.</p><p>"Yeah alright...did your dad send you to find me?" Hermione inquired getting up and dusting off her jeans as she followed Ginny through the tree's and away from the campsite.</p><p>"Nah I just thought I'd come and apologise on behalf of my idiot brother. He's always blaming me for things I didn't do as well, prat!" Ginny said shaking her head and Hermione snorted.</p><p>"Glad it's not just me getting the brunt of his temper all the time," Hermione chuckled.</p><p>"If he hadn't been dancing around singing about Krum like a moron the bucket would've been fine," Ginny said rolling her eyes.</p><p>"What's the big deal with this Krum anyway? I'm sure he's just like the rest of these braindead Qudditch types," Hermione muttered before recalling who she was with and biting her lip wishing to take back her words instantly.</p><p>"Hey! you know I both play and love Quidditch too right? Don't judge us all by Ron and his antics....besides isn't your best friend our house seeker? You wouldn't say he was brain dead now would you," Ginny said sounding a tad offended by Hermione's remarks.</p><p>"Well...Harry could do with some refinement himself now that you mention it..." Hermione began but trailed off as she saw Ginny rolling her eyes again.</p><p>"I just mean...oh forget it...I didn't mean anything, Ginny, there's nothing wrong with liking or playing Quidditch it's just your brother...oh he just drives me mad sometimes!" Hermione said kicking another stone a smaller one this time and with her good foot in order to avoid another sore big toe.</p><p>"Hey at least you don't have to live with him," Ginny said smirking and both witches laughed as they moved to lean against a wooden fence that ran along the river bank.</p><p>"When did I ever say Harry was my best friend by the way?" Hermione asked giving Ginny a little playful nudge as she went back to that part of the conversation.</p><p>"Well it can't be my brother so who else is there?" Ginny asked raising an eyebrow. Hermione rolled her eyes and made a gesture towards the redhead with a look that said "Hello!" etched on her face.</p><p>"What? Me?" Ginny asked genuine surprise in her voice but also mixed with a tiny bit of smugness.</p><p>"Interesting that you'd say that Hermione...you don't often hang around with me at school...not very best friend like behavior," Ginny said putting on a sad mock pout.</p><p>"Well, its tricky with you being in the year below and everything....besides you're always with that strange little Ravenclaw," Hermione sighed seeming a tad put out.</p><p>"You mean Luna? Well I'd ask you to come hang around with us but Luna...she's...well..." Ginny trailed off seeming to struggle with how she should phrase the trouble with Luna.</p><p>"She doesn't like muggle-borns?" Hermione asked frowning. Ginny got an aghast look on her face and looked like she might hit the witch and Hermione flinched.</p><p>"Merlin Hermione! Do you think I'd hang around with someone like that? Luna's not like that at all! She just...thinks you're a bit...scary," Ginny said looking away across the river as she muttered the last part her initial anger shifting to humor again as she tried to contain her laughter.</p><p>"Scary! I'm not scary! What's given her that idea?" Hermione asked scowling and crossing her arms as she leaned back against the fence.</p><p>"Well...you can be a bit forceful and bossy at times Hermione...always shouting at people in the corridors for breaking petty rules and the like," Ginny said a playful grin on her lips as the bushy-haired witch next to her appeared to get more and more irate her cheeks growing red.</p><p>"What nonsense!" Hermione said shaking her head.</p><p>"I'm not sure you'd have much fun with us...you're not really one for idle chatter and debates concerning unicorns and the like," Ginny said snorting at the perplexed look on Hermione's face.</p><p>"Unicorns?" Hermione questioned.</p><p>"Luna's latest fascination...I think she'd rather like to marry one....says a unicorn would make a far more useful life long companion than a wizard," Ginny said chuckling.</p><p>"Luna was definitely sorted into Ravenclaw...you're sure?" Hermione asked seeming to find this idea more and more far fetched the more she heard about this Luna.</p><p>"Yes and Luna's actually a really bright witty clever witch maybe even more so than yourself Hermione Granger...so get that tone out of your voice when you speak about her," Ginny said a little snappily. Hermione seemed disturbed at the thought of their being a witch at Hogwarts who was brighter than herself but decided not to pick Ginny up on that part and softened her expression instead.</p><p>"Sorry, Ginny...I'm sure Luna's lovely...I just....it's hard to hear about other people you've never really met disliking you..." Hermione sighed looking at her feet.</p><p>"Luna doesn't dislike you Hermione...she just doesn't understand you and that scares her a little. Don't worry...she'll come around...I just need to get in her ear awhile longer...I know you're really a big softie deep down Hermione Granger," Ginny said shifting closer to Hermione and bringing an arm around the girl's shoulders giving her a brief one-armed hug.</p><p>"Did I ever tell you, you're my favorite Weasley, Ginny?" Hermione said grinning as she gave Ginny a playful shove to get her to drop the sickeningly sweet smile she had on her face as the pair looked at their reflections in the still river water.</p><p>"No...but you didn't need to, your options are rather limited considering you haven't met Bill or Charlie...Percy is just...well Percy, Ron's a pig...Fred and Geroge are delightful but you dislike their utter disregard for school rules, dads half-mad, mums worse...so that leaves me.. your favorite," Ginny said smugly giving Hermione a peck on the cheek.</p><p>"Very clever smart arse," Hermione said rolling her eyes at the quick and startling accurate deduction the redhead had made. Hermione bit her lip then as she had another question to ask Ginny regarding her friendship circle at Hogwarts. It was a question that could cause trouble but it had been dancing around Hermione's head for months.</p><p>"Also... speaking of you and you're friends Ginny...whose that Slytherin I've seen you with down by the greenhouses?" Hermione asked trying to appear very casual and not all that interested while on the inside being desperate to get to the bottom of this little mystery that had been bugging her all summer.</p><p>"Have you been spying on me, Hermione?" Ginny said narrowing her eyes at the witch seeming rather shocked at the question.</p><p>"No, I have not! I just...saw you with her every time our class was heading to herbology last year..." Hermione lied hoping Ginny wouldn't realise that the witches time table the previous year had meant she was in transfiguration at the time Ginny would have been in Herbology and that she'd only discovered the pair due to her time turning activities.</p><p>"A likely story....but if you must know that will have been Daphne Greengrass...we have a little business arrangement and I think that's all I'll say about that Inspector Granger," Ginny said a small grin on her face. Hermione wanted to push for more but could tell Ginny wasn't for opening up.<br/>
'Business arrangement, what on earth could that be? Oh, I hope you haven't gotten into something you shouldn't have Ginny!' Hermione thought, frowning deeply. </p><p>Hemione didn't know much about Daphne Greengrass other than she was a pretty Slytherin who was rather very academic, a bit like herself and that was all she had. She seemed to keep away from the Slytherins who normally tormented Hermione which was a good sign but she could often be found talking with Pansy Parkinson in the corridors and that meant she didn't always keep savory company.</p><p>"So... you supporting Ireland then, Hermione?" Ginny asked eyeing Hermione's new scarf changing the subject hastily before reaching down to the ground to gather up some stones to skim across the river. Hermione was pulled out of her musing about Daphne Greengrass and quickly responded.</p><p>"Probably...just to piss off dear Ronald but also I saw Seamus earlier and he threatened to never speak to me again if I supported Bulgaria," Hermione said smiling.</p><p>"...and would that be such a bad thing? sounds like the right time to become a Krum fan honestly," Ginny said sarcastically firing off her first stone.</p><p>"You're awful Ginny Weasley...Seamus isn't that bad....sometimes....when he's not blowing stuff up," Hermione laughed as she watched wide-eyed at how far Ginny's stone went.</p><p>"Could....could you show me how to do that?" Hermione inquired picking up a stone of her own.</p><p>"Sure come here," Ginny said moving into position behind Hermione and taking a firm hold of her. Hermione let out a little surprised gasp at how commanding Ginny was, quite liking how confidently she took charge of the situation..</p><p>"Alright now curve your finger around the stone like that...yes there you go now pull back like this and make sure to twist your wrist....its all in the twist...Yes! that's the way!" Ginny cheered as Hermione managed to make her stone skim across the water three times. It fell far shorter than Ginny's had but Hermione felt pleased with herself none the less. Hermione turned her head to grin at Ginny who was still holding her the pair just held each other gaze for a moment before Ginny stepped back awkwardly almost tripping over her own feet blushing deeply.</p><p>"Sorry...Hermione I...forgot to let go," Ginny chuckled.</p><p>"Oh...don't worry... its nice to be held sometimes," Hermione said grinning shyly.</p><p>"Granger and Weasley sitting in a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G," Sang another all too familiar mocking voice that made Hermione's face fall as she spun around.</p><p>"Any chance you could go find someone else to annoy Pansy! I saw Draco earlier surprised you weren't following him around like a little lapdog as per usual" Hermione said glaring at the Slytherin who was stood on the other side of the river. Pansy just grinned and looked Hermione up and down as she leaned back against a tree folding her arms smugly.</p><p>"Its a free country Granger...I'll go where I please and Draco doesn't own me, I'm my own witch. Sorry if interrupted you and Weasleys alone time," Pansy said putting on a mock frown before cackling. Hermione just shook her head getting ready to fire back at the witch again but Ginny grabbed her arm and silenced her.</p><p>"Leave her Hermione, come on let's get back to the tent eh? I don't like that look she has in her eye...she's up to no good I can feel it...so let's get out of her way before we get dragged into some nonsense," Ginny said pleading with Hermione who looked unconvinced and like she'd rather like to argue with the Slytherin awhile longer.</p><p>"Oh don't go already Granger I haven't even gotten started on your clothes yet! I so rarely see you out of uniform ...this is something of a treat. I see your fashion sense hasn't improved any of the summer. Though I must say those jeans are very snug...just turn around for me again...or do you only flash that arse for the ginger here," Pansy said blowing Hermione a mocking kiss. Hermione went absolutely scarlet and was about to go for her wand but Ginny forcefully grabbed her and pulled her along back through the trees and back towards the camp leaving a laughing Pansy behind.</p><p>"I hate to see you go Granger...but I love to watch you leave," Pansy called loudly and Hermione let out a long groan.</p><p>"First Malfoy and now her... what I'm I exactly? Some kind of magnet for fools or something," Hermione muttered as Ginny chuckled.</p><p>"She might be a fool but she was right about one thing..." Ginny said grinning wickedly as Hermione raised a skeptical eyebrow at her.</p><p>"Those jeans are a perfect fit," Ginny said hitting a gobsmacked Hermione a quick pat on the backside before running off into the crowd before the scowling Hermione could scold her.</p><p>"You get back here this instant Ginny!" Hermione shouted chasing after the witch.</p><p>*******</p><p>"Don't run off Gabrielle stay close to me," Fleur said grabbing her younger sisters hand just in time before the girl could slip off into the crowd and explore by herself. The younger girl muttered disappointedly to herself in French and Fleur rolled her eyes.</p><p>"No, English only! Remember? we need to practice as often as we can! Do not make those sad eyes at me Gabrielle I am not mother, you can not have your way with me as easily as with her," Fleur said holding her head up proudly as Gabrielle pouted but otherwise made no further attempt to argue.</p><p>"What a terrible filthy place...who organised this? It's complete madness...when the world cup was held in France we had no over crowding...no mud and dirt...so uncivilized these English," Fleur said looking around at the muddy campsite and its occupants disapprovingly before stepping around a huge puddle bringing Gabrielle with her.</p><p>"If you hate it so much why not go back to the other side of the river with the other rich people and let me get some candy floss on my own," said Gabrielle trying to pull free from her sister's hand again.</p><p>"Behave or you'll have no candy floss at all!" Fleur said growing irritated with her sister's tone and continued attempts to break free of her grip. Gabrielle opened her mouth to argue but a dangerous glance from Fleur silenced her and she instead just glared in quiet fury. Fleur looked away to hide her grin, in truth she could not be mad at this attitude and Gabrielle merely reminded the witch of how she had been at that age.</p><p>"Come now this way," Fleur said leading her sister on through the crowd deftly navigating the muddy parts of the now well tramped mucky ground of the campsite.</p><p>"Oh look at the state of this no way we can cross this...we'll have to go around," Fleur said as herself and Gabrielle came to a stop at a large muddy and puddle laden section of the camp that was horrifying to behold to the french witch who detesed dirt and being unclean more than anything else.</p><p>"Ginny stop! my legs are tired!" Fleur heard a voice call from behind her.</p><p>"Not on your life Granger! Keep up!" a redheaded girl replied as she dodged past Fleur and her sister almost crashing into the pair but quickly maneuvering out of their path. Fleur was about to tell the boisterous redhead to watch where she was going when something crashed into her back at great speed.</p><p>"Argh!!!" Fleur shouted as she was pushed face-first into the mud.</p><p>*******</p><p>Hermione stopped and covered her mouth unable to believe what she'd just done, she felt like her heart had stopped and it became hard to breath. It had been an accident someone had stuck their foot out and tripped her sending her crashing forward into a tall silvery haired witch without any way of stopping herself.</p><p>"I'm so sorry! Are you okay? here let me help yo...arghhhhhh!" Hermione squealed as the furious muddy faced witch reached up and grabbed Hermione's outreached hand only to pull her down into the mud with her. Hermione heard laughter and caught a glimpse of a small blonde girl who had been holding the tall witches hand before Hermione had crashed into her. She was stood next to a horrified looking Ginny who was biting her lip. Hermione was about to shout at her to help when she felt herself getting pushed back down into the mud again as the silvery haired girl clambered on top of her and pinned her hands above her head leaning down right into her face nostrils flaring eyes bulging.</p><p>"Did you think it would be funny to push me? Not so funny now is it!" the witch snapped in a thick french accent and Hermione trembled beneath her trying to scramble for an apology but words wouldn't come as she was stricken silent by the fierce blue eyes of the older girl.</p><p>"Well say something!" The witch said her voice softening a little as she saw the true remorse in Hermione's eyes.</p><p>"I...I...someone tripped me it was a mistake...please I'm sorry," Hermione pleaded finding her voice at long last. Fleur sat up straddling Hermione letting go of the witches hands so she was no longer pinned and folded her arms. Hermione thought about throwing the girl off her but found she was still in too much of a state of shock to move.</p><p>"Listen she said it was an accident now please get off my friend," Ginny spoke up bravely and Fleur turned to look at her.</p><p>"Do not make demands of me, I shall rise when I'm good and ready...as for you Gabrielle another laugh out of you and its straight back to the other side of the river," Fleur snapped at the giggling small blonde next to Ginny.</p><p>"You, what's your name?" Fleur said looking back down to Hermione.</p><p>"Hermione...Hermione Granger," Hermione said trying not to let her voice crack as she spoke.</p><p>"...'ermione?" Fleur repeated softly more to herself than Hermione a small grin on her lips. </p><p>"I won't forget that name,"</p><p>Hermione felt her heart flutter, no one had ever spoken her name like that before. Hermione decided to take this as a chance to maybe laugh everything off and tried to give a nervous grin back. It proved to be a mistake, however.</p><p>"Something funny about the way I talk 'ermione Granger?" Fleur asked venom returning to her eyes.</p><p>"No not at all...its just no one's ever said my name like that before it was...well I always found my name a little antiquated...but the way you say it...it became sort of exotic sounding it was very...I liked it is all," Hermione pleaded quickly giving the full truth hoping it would stop her from being pushed back into the mud again. Fleur seemed to like that answer and her expression softened again.</p><p>"Might I know your name....please?" Hermione dared to ask as Fleur finally moved to get up and brought Hermione up with her with surprising strength for such a slender girl.</p><p>"I'm Fleur Delacour," Fleur said drawing her wand and in one swift motion she had cleansed herself of all the mud and dirt that had clung to her clothes.</p><p>"Um...Fleur could you...use that spell on me...I'm sorry but I can't do magic outside of school..." Hermione rambled hoping the witch would agree or else she'd have to walk all the way through camp looking like this until Mr. Weasley could use Scourgify on her. Fleur looked like she might say no for a second but then with an exasperated sigh and twist of her wrist, Hermione was also clean.</p><p>"So...this school of yours....its Hogwarts I take it?" Fleur asked stowing her wand away and moving back toward Gabrielle and taking her hand.</p><p>"Yes....what School do you attend..." Hermione began but was cut off as Fleur spoke over her.</p><p>"Prehaps I will see you again then...'ermione Granger," Fleur said before turning on her heel and striding off before Hermione or Ginny could say anything.</p><p>"Typical bloody French as rude as you can get! stuck up mare...wants her broom removing from her backside...hey why are you looking at me like that! This wasn't my fault!" Ginny said as she found Hermione to have crossed her arms and to be scowling at her eyes alive with icy fury.</p><p>"If you hadn't run off and made me chase you none of this would've happened," Hermione said as Ginny slumped her shoulders in defeat.</p><p>"Okay maybe I'm twenty-five to thirty percent responsible...but you said someone tripped you I heard you when that Fleur was wrestling with you in the mud," Ginny said trying to wriggle her way out of the situation.</p><p>"Sorry about that Granger...I'm ever so clumsy sometimes...but thanks for the show the sight of you and that snooty French cow rolling around in the mud was quite something," Pansy Parkinson said stepping out from the crowd smugness dripping from every inch of her face.</p><p>"You little..." Ginny moved to grab the Slytherin but she bounded off into a large group of people and Ginny lost sight of her and gave up the idea of pursuit.</p><p>"She's going to pay for this!" Hermione snapped moving over to Ginny.</p><p>"Yeah wait till school starts you nasty little serpent," Ginny said grinning evilly her mind already conjuring up numerous pranks to pay the Slytherin back with.</p><p>"Don't think you're off the hook either Ginny Weasley...you're still the one who made me run in the first place," Hermione said smiling widely at the pained look in Ginny's eye.</p><p>"I'm sorry Hermione please...you'll forgive your best friend for this mild transgression surely?" Ginny asked nudging Hermione playfully.</p><p>"We'll see...if you help me get back at Pansy...and don't mention any of this to Harry and Ron," Hermione said getting a very serious look in her eye.</p><p>"Not a single word, I promise," Ginny said taking Hermione's arm and the witches headed back towards their tent. </p><p>"Ermione," Fleurs voice sounded in Hermione's head as they walked and the witch couldn't help a small grin appearing on her lips</p>
