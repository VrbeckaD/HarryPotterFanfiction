    <p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="center">In a world where James Potter didn’t trust anyone with the life of his family and Sirius Black crucioed the Dark lord to his heart’s content, Harry James Potter grew up loved, cared for and totally annoyed by his younger siblings: Sophia and Godric -call me Rick – Potter. He is also considered the boy who lived but the phrase continues and goes like <em>The boy who lived because he is a potter and the potters are too smart to mess with.</em></p><p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="center">Sirius and Remus got their shit together in a few months after that and produced two halfblood Heirs to the Ancient and noble house of Black which resulted in the death by heart failure to Walburga Black.</p><p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="center">Regulus also just popped out of nowhere and presented the proof of the existing Horcrux that made Voldemort groan during his trial. he was pardoned due to his exceptional spy powers and offered a place in the auror program that he had refused with a disgusted expression and went onto join Quidditch. He, being an awesome little asexual that he was, refused to procreate and adopted a lot of cats just to annoy Sirius the dog and sniff out any rats that may rat them out to enemies.</p><p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="center">The Malfoy’s have still avoided the prison which even baffled the dark lord himself but nobody really listens to the noseless freaks who want to destroy the world.</p><p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="center">All in all; the world is a beautiful place to live in. James continues to be a badass Head Auror, Remus is working on Creature rights much to Fudge’s chagrin, Sirius is Lording his way through the Wizengamot and gets his way because nobody wants to mess with a man who beds a werewolf and crucio evil dark lords, Regulus is the world’s best seeker and The Weasley’s own a Bakery that the Malfoy’s despise yet buy from in secret.</p><p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="center">In this beautiful world the Heir Potter gets bored and decides that he needs to play the ultimate prank on his arch-nemesis - the Malfoy Heir - because he got shiny hair, pretty eyes and an arse to die for and <em>No Ronald and I am not obsessed with him!</em></p><p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="center">All is well… right?</p><p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="center"> </p><hr/>
<hr/><p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Paddy?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes. Pup.”</p><p align="justify">“Who is dis baby?”</p><p align="justify">“That darling is your little sister.” Sirius nodded at the bundle of Joy James and Lily was holding out for Harry to see. The boy was on his godfather’s lap as he looked at the little pink baby in his mother’s arms.</p><p align="justify">“Dad?” he raised his arms up for James who held his son in his arms, “Isn’t she cute, kiddo?”</p><p align="justify">“She wooks wike brakfas.” Sirius laughed as his godson compared his little sister to his strawberry porridge. Remus too snorted as his nephew described his goddaughter.</p><p align="justify">James looked a little scandalized before shaking his head in amusement, “All kids are like that in beginning and then they get better.”</p><p align="justify">“K” the boy nodded.</p><p align="justify">“You like her?” lily asked.</p><p align="justify">“Yeah Mommy.” Harry nodded.</p><p align="justify">“Well, that’s nice.”</p><p align="justify">“Ahan, win are we giben her back?”</p><p align="justify">Sirius howled with laughter as James just groaned and Lily held her daughter to her chest as she looked her son in absolute amusement.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify">“Hey, Dad?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, Harry.”</p><p align="justify">“What if I am not a Gryffindor?” the eleven year old looked at his dad with fear in his eyes.</p><p align="justify">“Well son, then don’t come back home,” James answers somberly. “Unless you are planning on telling me their common room password so I can slither-in there on my next guest lecture.”</p><p align="justify">“You know that you are awful at telling jokes, right?”</p><p align="justify">“I know kid.”</p><p align="justify">“I love you, dad.”</p><p align="justify">“Me too.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify">“Remus! Hurry up, Harry’s train is leaving in like 20 minutes.” Sirius screams.</p><p align="justify">“Shut up, Padfoot,” Remus shouts, irritated, “You’re the one who is still in shower.”</p><p align="justify">“Well, Duh,” the raven haired man rolled his eyes, “I am just making sure you are ready so we can leave as soon I come out.”</p><p align="justify">“You came out like 10 years ago, Papa.” Their son said from his place on the kitchen table making his twin sister laugh in delight.</p><p align="justify">Remus just looked at his children in horror but refused to comment on it. The seven year olds were the reason he smiled and felt soft, they were also the reason he wanted to hide and pull every single hair on his head out.</p><p align="justify">“You got the look,” Baby Black came in the room in his sleep gown, “It means the little ones again said something that had short circuited your brain and now you regret ever procreating with my brother.”</p><p align="justify">“I heard that.” Sirius shouted as he got dressed.</p><p align="justify">“Why aren’t you dressed, yet?” Remus glared at his brother in law.</p><p align="justify">“I am not accompanying you for seeing off that spawn of devil.” Regulus sighed as he sipped his tea.</p><p align="justify">“Uncle Reggie already said his goodbyes yesterday at the dinner,” Sierra – Sirius and Remus’ daughter – said, “He had tears in his eyes. He just doesn’t want to repeat that today in front of an audience.”</p><p align="justify">Regulus looked at his niece is trepidation before turning to look at Remus, “Why did you raise them? You could have easily put them up for adoption.”</p><p align="justify">Sirius entered the room in that moment and smacked his brother up for the comment. He kissed both his children on the forehead and then patted his nieces and nephew before finally snogging Remus.</p><p align="justify">“Ewww.” The twins exclaimed. Regulus gagged and his children meowed their disgust. “I know, lovelies. Uncle Sirius has no sense of privacy.” Regulus said as he picked up his youngest daughter and patted her head as she wrapped her tail on his wrist.</p><p align="justify">Sirius rolled his eyes as he picked a bread roll, “It’s just a kiss,” he said and then blistered as he saw Regulus put the brown feline on the table, “Put that cat down! It’s a breakfast table.”</p><p align="justify">Regulus blistered and looked at his brother with hurt in his eyes, “Did I ever ask your children to sit on the floor?”</p><p align="justify">Teddy and Sierra too looked scandalized as they stared at their Papa, “How can you ask that, Papa! Anastasia is just a baby. She’s the youngest Black.”</p><p align="justify">“You are worst than Mother, Siri.” Regulus shook his head.</p><p align="justify">Remus looked at them still on table before he shouted at them to get their coats, “The train leaves in 10!” making them all – including Anastasia and Minus Regulus - run towards the floo.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="center">***</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="justify">Lily made her way through the barrier holding the hand of her youngest son – Godric - The boy was an exact copy of her with James’ Light brown eyes. The boy ran away as soon as they crossed the barrier to hug his older brother who was leaving for Hogwarts, today. </p><p align="justify">Lily too joined the group where her husband was smirking due to some reason and their oldest son was being cuddled by his younger siblings.</p><p align="justify">“Soph, Rick, get off. You will see me at Yule.” Harry who was his father’s exact replica with Lily’s green eyes said. Sophia who was younger than Harry by two years and looked exactly like James – eyes and hair - looked at her brother with tears in her eyes, “But we will still miss you.”</p><p align="justify">Harry sighed as he looked at the crying girl and brought her in a hug, again. “Look at Rick, He isn’t saying deep sentimental crap, now is he?”</p><p align="justify">“Hey!” Lily scolded Harry.</p><p align="justify">“That ‘cus he is a baby.”</p><p align="justify">“I am six!” Rick spluttered and glared at his sister.</p><p align="justify">“Here we go,” James rolled his eyes as he went to pick the little boy up before he start something and Sophia just poked her tongue out.</p><p align="justify">Lily shook her head in amusement at her family. She loved them all to bits, especially Harry. It is not fair for a mother to have favorites and Lily was guilty of it. But after almost losing harry at age one was something that lily still had nightmares about. The thought that her son was almost killed because of some stupid prophecy and the betrayal of one of their best friend still stung her.</p><p align="justify">She and James had done everything after that day to make sure Harry was protected and kept safe from even the tiniest of hurts. For the first few months after that horrible Halloween, the couple had made Harry sleep in the same room as them. James had gotten much serious and careful at choosing his allies and had been strictly taking out all the death eaters.</p><p align="justify">The wizengamot had first tried to subdue his arrests since a lot of noble families were involved with the Dark lord but James hadn’t deterred. He used Sirius’ – who was praised for arresting the dark lord – influence for his cause. “They tried to kill my son, hurt my wife and killed a lot of my mates. After all that you want me to let it go?” was the phrase that James had often thrown at the Ministry. His extreme struggle had motivated a lot of other light families to come forth and demand justice and trials of the accused and the Ministry had no other option than giving in just to avoid a public uproar.</p><p align="justify">A lot of famous families and heirs had been prosecuted and tried for being associated with Voldemort at that time but James didn’t back off. He was a man out for blood; they had tried to kill his bambi.</p><p align="justify">The Potters were always known for their extreme fierceness when it came to their kin and the wizengamot was facing the first hand blow of it. In the past decade, James had not only made it to the position of Head Horror but also became known as one the strongest politicians and Lords out there, he still was using a proxy at his Peverell seat and Lily shuddered at the amount of fame that would greet them if James ever did claim it.</p><p align="justify">According to James, fame was never something the Potter family craved. They had the money and the power and would own the wizengamot with one little seat but the Potters were not after fame or power. They preferred their little cozy homes and liked that not alot was expected of them. It did change after James had used his own brain and influence during death eater trials but he was not going to attract more attention by revealing the Potter’s origin.</p><p align="justify">However, Lily knew, It would soon change. Since the Potters now held a seat at the wizengamot along with one of the Peverell and she knew James would give one of those seats to harry and one to Rick. The truth will be out one day, but it all depended on harry since he is the oldest and gets to decide if he’d be claiming the Potter Lordship or Peverell.</p><p align="justify">She was still thinking and watching her family where James was telling Harry that of he made it too Gryffindor, he’d be proud but if he made it Slytherin then he wants all the juicy details. Sophia was still close to her brother’s side and Rick – who had managed to wiggle out of James’ arms – was now attached to Harry’s front with his arms wound around his brother’s waist.</p><p align="justify">The blacks finally made their way out of the floo at the station making Sophia forget all about Harry and running towards her favorite – and only girl – cousin. “Sierra!”</p><p align="justify">“We’re here!” Sirius announced as he bounced his way towards the Potter, “Remus was taking too long.” He stopped in front of the group and brought Harry into a hug along with Rick. “Hello, My favorite godson and his extra limbs.”</p><p align="justify">Harry giggled and Rick too beamed at his favorite uncle.</p><p align="justify">James rolled his eyes at his best friend as he greeted Remus and the kids, “Where is Reggie?”</p><p align="justify">“He didn’t really want to cry again,” Teddy supplied with a grin. “He also was disgusted with Dad’s pda.”</p><p align="justify">“He is a prude,” James nodded as he high fived Sirius.</p><p align="justify">Lily looked at the duo and then at Remus who was looking at his husband with a scowl, “If you are done blaming me for being late then you might like to let Harry go.” Sirius mock frowned as he pushed Harry towards Remus and whispered to Rick who was still hanging by Sirius’ arm, “He is just sad since he wasted too much time in shower,” Making the little boy giggle.</p><p align="justify">Harry snorted at his godfather whose hair were still dripping and went to hug Remus who rolled his eyes at his husband’s childishness. “Make a lot of friends and if your dad gives you shit for being a Slytherin then remember that you can always come and stay with us.” Remus said to the raven haired boy.</p><p align="justify">“I might make it to Gryffindor.” Harry smiled.</p><p align="justify">Sirius snorted as he patted his godson on the back, “Yeah, well, No. Not happening.”</p><p align="justify">James laughed as Harry glared his godfather and showed him the finger much to Lily’s chagrin. The train whistled again and Remus let the boy go who was again hugged by every single one of their family. James hugged him last and kissed his son on the head as he looked him in the eye before saying, “I will be there for anything you need. Don’t shy away from writing to me every day. You’ve got your cloak and mirror, right?” when Harry nodded, he continued, “We love you the most, your mother, your uncles, you siblings, your cousins and I. You come before houses, sorting and any house or family rivalries out there. Remember that.” He hugged his boy close who nodded into his father’s shirt and then boarded the train.</p><p align="justify">Lily watched as Harry made it to his compartment as she held onto the sniffling Rick who too wanted to join his favorite sibling.</p><p align="justify">The train began moving and they all waved at the boy. The sobriety of the group was broken when Sirius shouted, “GIVE SNIVELLOUS HELL, PUP!” and James joined him in the cheer. Lily and Remus both looked around them in embarrassment and wondered for the thousandth time that what did they ever saw in these idiots.</p>
