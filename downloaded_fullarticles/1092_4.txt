    <p>Harry slipped into the Adult Language Class at the University. He pulled out his tape recorder, pen, paper, and books. He had read the first few chapters and was looking forward to learning Spanish. Harry felt a tap on his shoulder. He looked up and into the eyes of Severus Snape. They stared at each other. "I'm not going back." They said at the same time. </p><p>"What?" They stated at the same time.</p><p>"I'm not going back." Together again. </p><p>Harry held up his hand. "After class, I believe we need to speak to each other." Severus took a seat next to him. Harry liked how the new Severus Snape looked. He was dressed in muggle jeans, a black t-shirt, and a pair of black leather boots. His black hair wasn't greasy and didn't frame his face either. It was short, allowing the shortness to reveal a bit of body in the normally straight hair. Severus looked younger out of the severe clothes he wore at Hogwarts.</p><p>_________________________________________________</p><p>They carried their tea to the small outside cafe table. "I believe it would be better if I went first. I think it will answer all the questions you might have." Harry wasn't sure how much news Severus received but he was aware a lot of information didn't make the news. </p><p>"Please, go ahead." Severus took a sip of his tea and made a face. </p><p>"It's not English tea but it's at least drinkable."</p><p>"That is debatable." Severus put the cup down. </p><p>"I wasn't expecting you to be here. I had wondered where you disappeared to." Harry took another sip of his tea. "After the war was officially declared over, I thought all my problems were over. After all, he was dead. However, all it did was open a new can of worms." Harry thought for a few seconds. "The Ministry was a mess. I wanted to do my part since it seemed expected of me. I attend the first opening session of the Wizengamot after most of the major repairs to Hogwarts, the Ministry, and Diagon Alley were finished. I was a bit surprised to find Hermione Granger on the list of speakers."</p><p>"Why would she be speaking?" Severus knew the Wizenagamot didn't just allow anyone to speak in front of them during the first session. People could schedule an appearance if they presented an outline of what they wished to speak about to the Undersecretary of the Minister. Most people weren't even aware of when the sessions were scheduled but any crackpot could find out. </p><p>"I'm getting to it. Trust me, I was shocked. It also made me very angry." Harry inhaled as his magic leaked out. He regained control. "Sorry, it still makes me mad." Harry took another sip of his tea as he worked on calming his magic. "Since it was the first session after the war, they didn't do the official roll. It was more of following the tradition of opening it on the same day. Kingsley gave his opening speech, followed by the usual open procedures. Granger was the first one up. I am not sure how she managed to appear first considering there were others with better political positions. Granger stood up and started to deliver rather a long list of what needs to be done. It was done in her bossy, I'm right tone of voice that she loves to use. She wanted to start revealing ourselves to the muggles, revamping all the old laws, she wanted to revamp the power structure. She wanted to use the American system. She wanted to get rid of all the customs and traditions of the wizarding world." Severus' face registered his shock. Harry laughed. "It gets worse." </p><p>"Worse?" Severus knew Granger wasn't the most socially acceptable person but to walk into the Wizengamot and demand all that was pure Dumbledore crazy. Severus had warned Dumbledore about Granger and allowing her to believe that she was the smartest witch and not doing anything about the girl's bullying habit.</p><p>"Yes. When she started to pass out thick scrolls and stopped talking long enough, someone asked why she was speaking. She had to nerve to claim she was speaking for me as she was using my seats. She went on a bit of a rant about how we defeated You-Know-Who. How we needed to be united and rid the magical world of all the old laws and rituals that allowed such evil beings like Voldemort and Grindlewald to come into existence."</p><p>Severus raised an eyebrow. He wondered how she arrived at her conclusion. It was Harry that killed the Dark Lord. He was the spy who put his life on the line. Yes, many were part of the war but Harry was the one who walked to his death to accomplish the goal of defeating the Dark Lord, Harry was the only one who never had a choice regarding the war. Granger was just like any member of the Order or anyone who fought against Voldemort. "Interesting theory but also very wrong."</p><p>"Yes, she certainly gave a new meaning to being clueless and naive that day. I rose from my seat and demanded to know what she was talking about." Harry started laughing. "You should have seen her face when I rose. She didn't expect me to be there. She didn't even hint that she was going to be there. I had wondered what she had been busy researching but she just kept insisting it wasn't important." </p><p>"She had your seats and didn't tell you?" Severus was now a bit shocked. He didn't think Granger would do something like so underhanded. He was aware of her double standards when it came to doing things illegally but she always seemed to do them for some lost cause.</p><p>"Yes, and the mess doesn't get any better. Kingsley realized something was up and called for a recess. I was heading down to Granger when I was surrounded by Mrs. Weasley, Ron, Ginny, and Remus. They pulled me into a side room. When we were in the room and Mrs. Weasley demanded to know why I was present. I said it was my duty and filling the role my father would have filled had he still been alive. Granger went into her lecture mode and started telling me how she knew what she was doing. How she had researched all the laws. Mrs. Weasley told me I wasn't ready to sit in my seats. How I needed to remember I was a Horcrux and that if I had any power, I might become power-hungry and turn dark. Granger, Weasley, and his sister were all bobbing their heads in agreement. Mrs. Weasley proceeded to outline my life, including how I was to marry her daughter and how many children we would have. She even decided where we would be living." </p><p>Severus blinked a few times. Did he just hear what he heard? They were dictating Harry's life? "I'm unclear on how they arrived at that? The only people who knew you were a Horcrux and still alive are Granger, Weasley, you, and me. Someone has been doing a lot of talking. How did Molly find out?" Severus was still processing all the information and he didn't doubt it. He could see the behavior Harry described in the group of people that were now attempting to take charge.</p><p>"I asked and got told that Dumbledore informed her of it. Originally, he believed I wouldn't come back and he had arranged for Granger and her to control everything. I was to even marry Ginny before the final battle. The poisoned ring ruined a lot of his plans and he had to do a lot of rearranging of things." </p><p>"How? That shouldn't have been possible." </p><p>"I remained calm as I informed them that I wouldn't marry Ginny if she was the last female on the planet. I also informed them that I would be sitting in my seat and that I wasn't a Horcrux. I was a living human being. I didn't get any further as Kingsley opened the door and informed them that everyone could hear our conversation. Their faces were priceless. They looked so shocked I just didn't agree with their plans."</p><p>"I bet Rita loved that." </p><p>"Oh, she did. It made the paper for the next few days. I got hounded by the small group to follow their plan, how it was for the greater good, and it was what my parents would have wanted. I decided to visit Gringotts. The goblins arranged for me to speak to a few neutral Lords. I assigned my seats to one of them. I made sure my seats would stand with what I wanted. Stronger protection for keeping muggles unaware of us. Return of our customs and holidays which Granger sent me a nasty howler about. I also gave him my seat on the Board. Lady Longbottom and a few others are going to push for the return of all the canceled classes and holidays." </p><p>"Very good. How did you end up in Spain?" They were all policies that Severus agreed with. Those policies were the reasons he joined the Death Eaters.</p><p>"I decided I wanted to get a better education. I enrolled part-time in the muggle community college as well as doing an apprenticeship in Defense. I figured I might as well learn the native language while I was at it." Harry looked at Severus. "How did you?" </p><p>"I opened a potion shop here and I wanted to take a few night courses. Do you plan on returning to England?"</p><p>"Eventually, I think. Not for a few years. Neville, Luna, the Weasley twins, and a few others will keep me updated on everything. I just didn't want to deal with Rita's articles. Granger and Weasley are getting married. Mrs. Weasley kept pushing her daughter on me and the best part was she kept saying she was a virgin."</p><p>Severus started laughing. "A virgin?" He knew how many times he caught her in the act during her years at Hogwarts. </p><p>"I know, right." Harry laughed a bit. "I figured I need some time to get an education and just be a student without Granger and company trying to run my life." </p><p>"Why did you think I was here to bring you back?" </p><p>"I figured Mrs. Weasley put pressure on Professor McGonagall to find a way to get me to return. If anyone knew you were alive it would be Professor McGonagall even if you didn't tell her." </p><p>"I didn't. I figure she must have figured it out and that was why you were here." Severus was now going to have to send a letter to Minerva.</p><p>"I won't tell." Harry smiled.</p><p>______________________________________________________</p><p>Five years later:</p><p>Harry and Severus landed in the International Port-key area in the Ministry. They were returning to the United Kingdom to take jobs at Hogwarts that the Board offered to them since Minerva was retiring. She recommended them for the jobs. Severus was returning as the new Headmaster and Harry was the new Deputy Headmaster. They would teach a NEWT level course for their subjects. They were heading out of the Ministry when they saw Neville and several of their real friends waiting for them. After everyone finished greeting everyone. Neville started to rush them out of the Ministry. "They know you are returning today. We arranged a bit of a distraction for them." George looked around. "We don't have much time."</p><p>Harry looked at his husband. Severus had warned him that using an International Port-key that was Ministry issued would alert the pests. Neither of them wanted to take a plane. Severus had wanted to book passage on a ship but Harry got seasick, the port-key wasn't the best but they decided to risk it. Harry gave Severus an apologetic shrug. "I take it Granger has been trying to figure out who has my seats?" </p><p>"Yes. She has been at every Wizenagamot session to see if she could figure it out but since the voting is private except to the party leaders and the Minister. She has been obsessing over it. You should see the notes she has on it." Fred knew it drove his brother crazy as that was all his wife ever spoke about. Ginny had married and divorced Dean Thomas and was now married to a muggle with two kids. Mrs. Weasley was still trying to ruin the lives of those in her family. She had sent numerous letters to Harry telling him that her daughter was available, again.</p><p>They were able to get to Hogwarts safely but groaned as they saw Granger, with Mrs. Weasley and Ron, sitting outside waiting for them. "Oh, this is going to be fun." Luna smiled at them all. "They believe you are going to just fall into line." </p><p>Granger rose and stormed toward Harry, ignoring any type of greeting almost yelled "where have you been? Do you know what you abandoning our world has done?"</p><p>"Why, hello to you too." Harry looked at Granger and around to the rest of them. "Nice to see everyone." </p><p>"Where have you been?" Mrs. Weasley demanded.</p><p>"It's none of your concern. Now, if you excuse us, we have an appointment with Professor McGonagall." Harry and Severus started walking as the group followed behind a stunned Granger and her group.</p><p>____________________________________________________________________</p><p>"What do you mean Harry is the new headmaster?" Granger demanded at the Board meeting that happened the next day. Granger had been eager to jump up and demand answers since the session started.</p><p>"Harry isn't the new Headmaster. Severus Potter is the new Headmaster. Harry has accepted the new opening as the Deputy." Lady Longbottom was the head of the Board and had taken great pleasure in introducing Headmaster Potter, well, before Granger interrupted.</p><p>"What? They can't be married. Harry is to marry Ginny." </p><p>"Isn't she already married?" Someone not so quietly asked. Harry thought it might have been Neville.</p><p>"Yes." The room responded. </p><p>"Perhaps the new Headmaster can brew them some mind-clearing potions or mental stability ones." Luna suggested. "He is a renowned brewer."</p><p>Harry and Severus had seen Rita in the audience and knew the woman was going to have a field day. Harry leaned close to Severus. "I believe Rita will be very busy." </p><p>"Indeed. Granger will be visiting me when she reads about the changes I want to bring to Hogwarts." Severus had already discussed the ideas with the Board and they were in agreement. Severus was looking forward to banning Granger from Hogwarts. Life was good.</p>
