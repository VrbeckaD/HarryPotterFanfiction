    <p>"Come on Rosie, you can't back out of the Halloween Party!"</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes as my roommate Chloe sat on her bed, looking at me in shock.</p>
<p>"It's tradition to go Rose! You can't miss it especially not the last one you will ever have!"</p>
<p>“Considering I have never gone to one of these parties, I hardly think I can consider it a tradition to go,” I said, unable to hold myself back from laughing. I put my schoolbooks into my bag. “I told you that I have this essay in Arithmency. I really don’t want or need to go to this party. I’ve missed it the past six years, I would be okay missing it for a seventh.”</p>
<p>“Rose I think your essay due in two weeks can wait one night,” Chloe said. “Come on! Just ditch your school work and responsibilities for one night. They will still be there in the morning waiting for you.”</p>
<p>I was about to respond, but was cut off by our roommate Audrey, entering the room.</p>
<p>“Can you guys help me decide what to be tonight? I honestly can’t make a decision,” she said, carrying two garment bags with her.</p>
<p>“Why did you even get two costumes?” Chloe said, sitting up on her bed. “You should have just picked one and then you wouldn’t have this issue.”</p>
<p>“Well I tried that, but there was a special for buy one get one free and Rose refused to shop with me, so I got two, figuring she would wear the other one,” Audrey said, hanging the bags up.</p>
<p>“That would require actually getting her to go,” Chloe said. “She’s bailing for the library.”</p>
<p>“What?” Audrey said. She looked at me. “Rosie, tell me she’s kidding. Please tell me you are not bailing when you finally said you would go.”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “That essay is due in two weeks! If I want to follow my typical three draft process I have to start this weekend.”</p>
<p>“So start tomorrow!” Audrey said. She had a desperate look on her face. “Please, Rose, please! I already have two costumes and when I told some guys you were going to come they were super excited to get to hang out with you! Rose, this could be the first step towards you getting out there and starting to date!”</p>
<p>“I don’t need to date!” I said. “I don’t have time to date. You know that the top healing schools require the top grades and dating would distract me from that. I have you guys and my family and trust me, that is more than enough distractions. I see how much time Chloe has to spend with Al in order to maintain their relationship; I don’t have that time and even if I did, I would probably spend it maintaining my grades.”</p>
<p>“Al and I don’t spend time together to maintain our relationship,” Chloe chimed in from her bed. “We spend time together because we want to. We even study during that time. So, sorry, but your argument is invalid because you could just date someone who wanted to study as much as you do.”</p>
<p>“Thank you future Defense Wizard Council,” Audrey said, pointing to Chloe as their stood in solidarity against me. I rolled my eyes. “Rose come on. I’m not saying you actually have to hook up or date anyone tonight, but don’t use not having time as an excuse. It’s okay to want to date someone. I know my personal experiences with dating have not always been the best examples but look at Al and Chloe. Probably going to get married right out of Hogwarts. It’s all a process. I know you’re going to go to your fancy healing school and become a world class healer and protect everyone in the whole world and never take care of yourself, so what’s wrong with me wanting to make sure that you find someone to take care you? You probably won’t find your soulmate or anything tonight, but in order to find someone one day in the future, you may need to start actually socializing with the other gender.”</p>
<p>“I do socialize with the other gender,” I pointed out.</p>
<p>“Your family doesn’t count,” Chloe interjected and I threw a glare at her.</p>
<p>“I was talking about Sam,” I said, realizing that besides him, majority of my interactions with males were my family.</p>
<p>“Ah, that could be a good place to start,” Audrey said. “You know he likes you, why not just take it a little farther one day during rounds?”</p>
<p>“Because he’s Head Boy and I’m Head Girl and I would have to see him constantly afterwards and that would be awkward?” I said. “Besides I’m not attracted to him.”</p>
<p>“Okay valid,” Audrey said. “But you have start somewhere. Why not just go and try to talk to guys you are attracted to?”</p>
<p>“Why is your whole strategy of getting me to go to this Halloween party about guys?” I said. “Why not just a great night with friends? We are more than our relationships with guys you know.”</p>
<p>“Yes I do know,” Audrey said. “I am also a self-sufficient woman. But dating can be fun. It can suck, a lot, but it can also be fun. I guess my point is I want to see you happy with something besides school. And also, a lot of guys were excited to hear you were coming tonight. But if you would rather just focus on us hanging out, looking hot as hell, ignoring all the guys who fawn all over us, we can. I just, I don’t want you to get so caught up in books and studying and making the world so much of a better place that you avoid dating because you’re scared.”</p>
<p>“I am not scared of dating,” I said, under my breath. This earned me a disbelieving look from both Chloe and Audrey. “Fine, maybe I’m not thrilled with dating but still, scared is a little strong.”</p>
<p>“Scared, hesitant, frightened, you pick the adjective they all describe you Rose,” Chloe said.</p>
<p>Despite everything in me telling me that I shouldn’t say what I was about to say, I took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. “I’ll go. I might even talk to some guys. No promises though.”</p>
<p>Audrey broke out into a smile. “Yay!”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you broke down,” Chloe said. “Al is going to be so confused when he sees you there in one of the costumes Audrey picked.”</p>
<p>“Yeah I should probably tell you, you won’t like the costumes I picked,” Audrey said, her face looking guilty. “They’re not your usual style. So you can pick first. Just remember Halloween is typically when people dress this way, so you won’t’ be the only one.”</p>
<p>She unzipped both the outfits and I groaned, wondering if I had just made an awful choice in going to this party.</p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>“I can’t believe you chose these two outfits,” I said as we walked into the Room of Requirement.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you actually chose to be the Devil,” Audrey said, adjusting her halo.</p>
<p>“This outfit covered up way more than that one,” I said, pointing at Audrey’s outfit. “I was lucky this skirt went to midthigh.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately it is the patriarchy’s world Rose,” Audrey said. “The choices for women’s Halloween costumes is either sexy or mom. No in-between.”</p>
<p>“I think I would feel better in a mom costume,” I said, pulling my skirt down. “I feel like a slag.”</p>
<p>“Yeah well you look hot Rose,” Chloe said. She grabbed three shots from the bar handing one to each of us. “Take a drink and maybe you’ll start to feel more comfortable. Or at least start being less self-conscious.”</p>
<p>“I can’t drink,” I said. “I shouldn’t even be here, so I especially can’t drink. I’m Head Girl.”</p>
<p>“Sam is Head Boy and he is here and he is drinking,” Chloe said, pointing at Sam through the crowd. “Look you don’t have to if you don’t want to. But you’re here and this is a part of the experience.”</p>
<p>“You really don’t have to,” Audrey said. She downed her shot. “But it is a little fun to let loose once in a while. If you don’t want to that’s fine. If you really feel super uncomfortable in that dress and at this party you can leave. But, keep in mind that Luke Woods has been checking out since you got here and I know for a fact that you think he’s fit.”</p>
<p>I looked around and did in fact Luke Woods checking me out. He smiled at me and I gave a small smile back.</p>
<p>I glanced at my drink before looking at Chloe and Audrey.</p>
<p>“All a part of the experience?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Only if you want it to be,” Chloe said.</p>
<p>I poured the drink back into my mouth, feeling it burn down my throat. I scrunched up my face.</p>
<p>“I’m going to need another one of those before I forget what I’m wearing.”</p>
<p>“Ladies, I come bearing shots.”</p>
<p>"Al!” Chloe said, kissing him on the cheek as he approached us with a tray of shots.</p>
<p> “Hi babe,” he said, handing her a shot. “Audrey, Rose.” He frowned at me. “It’s nice to see you here, Rose but I wish I could see less of you.”</p>
<p> “Ha ha,” I said, grabbing a shot. “I’m not exactly thrilled about my outfit either.”</p>
<p> “Then why did you wear it?” Al asked.</p>
<p> “The Patriarchy, Al,” Audrey said. “The Patriarchy.”</p>
<p> “…right,” Al said, though he was clearly still confused. He gave a glance at Chloe, who just sent him a smile and wrapped her arms around him, tucking herself into him.</p>
<p> I felt a pull at my heart, seeing how safe Chloe looked and how Al held her like she was the most perfect thing in the world. As much as dating scared me, it was because the possibilities of getting what Chloe and Al have, something so wonderful and easy and perfect on the first try was near impossible.</p>
<p> And I was nothing if not a perfectionist.</p>
<p> “I um, I think I’m going to go walk around,” I said. “See if I can find Lily.”</p>
<p> “Do you want me to come with you?” Audrey asked. “I was hoping to find Louis anyway.”</p>
<p> “No, I can go on my own,” I said. “Thank you though. I’ll find you later okay?”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Audrey said. “Let me know if you leave or anything.”</p>
<p>“I will,” I said, walking away.</p>
<p>I took one last look at Al and Chloe, completely in their own world, and with the slightest bit of jealousy over what they have and turned around.</p>
<p>Where I saw the dance floor where everyone was dry humping each other. That was more of what I expected from dating. And it was something that I really wasn’t interested in.</p>
<p>I moseyed around the party for a little while, keeping my eyes out for Lily or Hugo, or anyone that I could talk with without feeling like they had other intentions. I felt eyes on me as I walked and was getting incredibly uncomfortable and was suddenly feeling desperate to hide myself. I eventually found an empty couch and, after much debate with myself, decided to sit down alone, feeling the side effects of my two shots catching up to me.</p>
<p>I had just begun to wonder if I should leave to go to bed or the library when someone joined me on the couch, nearly sitting on me in the process. I groaned internally, worrying that it was one of the invasive pairs of eyes I felt on me coming over to make a move.</p>
<p>“Ow,” I said, yanking my hand out from under their butt.</p>
<p>“Shit sorry,” he said.</p>
<p>I looked up to see Scorpius Malfoy sitting next to me.</p>
<p>Not that I ever would have admitted it to anyone, but I was grateful that it was Scorpius sitting next to me and not someone else. Although Scorpius and I weren’t friends by any means, we were always friendly towards each other; we didn’t have any of the sniping at each other that he had with my male relatives. He was always respectful towards me which is why, arguably for the first time in my life I felt more comfortable with Scorpius Malfoy than with any other boy in the room.</p>
<p>“Malfoy, you should really look before you sit down,” I said. I put my hand in his face, pretending to be dramatic. “You could have really hurt my hand with your butt.”</p>
<p>“Please, you’re just grateful that you got to touch my ass,” Scorpius said with a wink.</p>
<p>“You’re right I dream about you constantly,” I said, rolling my eyes.</p>
<p>“Well then at least my dreams about you aren’t for nothing,” he said, flashing me a smile.</p>
<p>Despite myself, I couldn’t help but feel myself flush at his comment. I awkwardly looked down at my legs, attempting to pull my skirt down since it had ridden up with I sat.</p>
<p>“How long does it take you to get drunk?” I asked randomly.</p>
<p>“What?” Scorpius said, confused.</p>
<p>“How long does it take you to get drunk?” I repeated. “Because I’ve only had two shots of firewhisky, but my head already feels light and dizzy almost? But like I’m not dizzy? My brain just feels like it’s light and spinning.”</p>
<p>Scorpius looked at me with a smile. “Well getting drunk varies for everyone. Since you’re not a drinker and you’re short, it will probably take less for you to get drunk than for me.”</p>
<p>“Hm,” I said, pondering this. “Interesting.”</p>
<p>“Is you being drunk why you’ve been so friendly during this exchange?”</p>
<p>“I’m always friendly!” I said. Scorpius raised his eyebrows at me. “At least with you. I always thought that we were very respectful and nice to each other.”</p>
<p>“We are, to a point,” Scorpius said. “You have never made an effort to actually have a conversation like this to me. Most of our conversations that have lasted this long were about school work.”</p>
<p>“Yes apparently that is an issue for me,” I said, more to myself than to him. “Audrey has informed me I spend too much time worry about school work and not enough about dating and boys.”</p>
<p>“Dating isn’t all it’s cracked up to be,” Scorpius said, taking a drink. “But is there a reason you haven’t dated anyone? Merlin knows there are plenty of willing guys?”</p>
<p>“Where are these guys?” I asked, confused. “You’re the second person to bring them up.”</p>
<p>Scorpius laughed. “So, specific reason for not dating?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I said shrugging. “I guess, in truth, I haven’t really met anyone who I found interesting enough to date.” I put my hand over my eyes, realizing what that sounded like. “Oh Merlin did I just sound like a total snob?”</p>
<p>“No, just honest,” Scorpius said. “But if that’s the case, then you’re making the right choice. Dating someone who isn’t interesting isn’t all that great.”</p>
<p>“Well apparently I’m missing out,” I said.</p>
<p>“You’re not,” Scorpius said leaning his head back on the back of the couch. “Unless you enjoy being ignored by people you fancy and getting more attention from people you don’t.”</p>
<p>I leaned my head back on the couch, mirroring him. “Who would ignore Scorpius Malfoy, especially when he fancies them? My understanding was you could have anyone you wanted in this school.”</p>
<p>Scorpius laughed. “Don’t believe everything you hear.”</p>
<p>I smiled at him, suddenly realizing how close our faces were. Despite myself, I couldn’t help but admire his face. His features were pointy and he had the signature Malfoy blonde hair that went along with his pale skin. Although I had never thought anything about how Scorpius Malfoy looked, I found myself very content to keep looking at him for the rest of the night and never leaving this couch.</p>
<p>I noticed that he too, seemed to be taking my face in going over all my features before meeting my eyes again. I suddenly got the most overwhelming urge to lean forward and close the distance between us, especially since we had this whole couch to ourselves.</p>
<p>Audrey had said it was all a part of the experience right?</p>
<p>Fortunately, or unfortunately depending on how you look at it, we were interrupted.</p>
<p>“Scorp!”</p>
<p>I looked up, seeing a tall brunette, motioning Scorpius over. As I looked at her, seeing how utterly gorgeous she was, I felt my stomach drop, wondering why I had even thought that he was flirting with me and feeling like an idiot for thinking of kissing him, when this girl wanted his attention.</p>
<p>When Scorpius didn’t immediately get up, she gave him a pointed look, causing him to sigh. I looked at him; the look on his face seemed almost annoyed that this beautiful, model like girl was calling him over.</p>
<p>“Sorry I have to take care of something,” Scorpius said, his voice sounding slightly defeated. He stood up and offered a hand out to me.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” I said, grabbing his hand and standing up as well. Once standing, I immediately dropped his hand, ignoring the emptiness I felt without it.</p>
<p>“If you drink some water it will help with the head dizziness,” Scorpius said. “It will just sober you up a little.”</p>
<p>“Oh, thank you!” I said. “Sorry for keeping you from…um…” I looked back at the beautiful girl, who was sending smirks to Scorp, which he met with a glare. “From your girl…person. I’ll see you class Monday okay?”</p>
<p>“Weasley-“</p>
<p>I left before he could finish, disliking all the feelings that I had and the disappointment I felt that he had to go. However, knowing that he was probably right about the water, I walked over to the bar.</p>
<p>“Could I get water please?” I asked the house elf there, knowing mum would lose her mind if she knew House Elves were working and also providing alcohol to underage students.</p>
<p>He handed me a water bottle. “It’s automatically refiling Miss.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much,” I said. “You are getting paid for this right?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” the house elf said. “Mr. Potter and Mr. Weasley are most generous to us house elves! We are getting payment and clothes!”</p>
<p>I smiled, thrilled that my mum’s lecturing about House Elves rights had a lasting effect with Al and Louis. I went to open the bottle when I felt a tap on my shoulder and turned around to see my fellow Head, Sam Nathanson.</p>
<p>I had to withhold the groan I wanted at the sight of him.</p>
<p>Sam wasn’t a bad guy. He was just kind of annoying. Audrey was right when she said that he had a crush on me—he had asked me out on a few occasions and even though he was always respectful of me when I said no, I always got the feeling that whenever we did anything together or he did anything for me, that he was doing so to try to get me to feel the same way about him that he felt about me. And I just didn’t. I couldn’t even find him attractive, because he was just so…normal looking. He had dark hair and dark eyes and was average height and honestly just looked like a generic white guy.</p>
<p>I tended to like a guy who looked different from people. Who stood out from the crowd a little more.</p>
<p>My mind immediately brought a certain blond with pointy features into my head, which I took to mean I needed to drink some water to sober up.</p>
<p>“Hi Sam,” I said, before taking a huge gulp of water.</p>
<p>"Hey Rose," Sam said. He looked at me up and down, taking in my costume. "Nice costume."</p>
<p>“Um,” I said, suddenly feeling very self-conscious with his eyes on me. “Thanks?”</p>
<p>His eyes kept glancing downwards and I knew he was staring at my chest. “Can I buy you a drink?”</p>
<p>“No thank you,” I said. I held up my water. “I’m trying to sober up. I’m probably going to leave soon.”</p>
<p>Sam smirked and moved closer to me. “Really? Well maybe I’ll leave soon too.”</p>
<p>I may not have had a lot of experience with boys, but I knew enough to understand what he was implying. I immediately began looking for an escape, particularly someone that I knew.</p>
<p>Or maybe one of my overprotective male cousins or brother. Because this would have been a good time for them to show up.</p>
<p>Sam moved closer to me, putting his hand on my waist. “We could always just leave together.”</p>
<p>My heart immediately started beating faster as I began to go through all the statistics of situations that start like this. I tried quickly to think of a way out of this.</p>
<p>“Um, well, Sam-“</p>
<p>“Weasley there you are!”</p>
<p>Sam and I both looked up and saw the tall brunette that had called Scorpius away appear. Up close, I was able to recognize her as Emily Goyle, one of the seventh year Slytherins. She immediately pulled me out of Sam’s grasp and into a hug.</p>
<p>“Play along,” she whispered in my ear before letting me go. “Oh good you got the water. I’ll get one too. I was wondering where you went to! I’ve barely gotten to see you all night!”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said, trying to improvise on the spot. “I tried looking for you but couldn’t find you.”</p>
<p>“Well I found you now, so we finally get to hang out!” She said. She ordered water from the bar, giving a smile to the house elf before turning to Sam and immediately meeting him with a glare. “Nathanson.”</p>
<p>“Goyle,” Sam said. “Rose and I were actually just leaving-“</p>
<p>“No you weren’t,” Goyle said. Her tone was light, but there was an edge to it that could not be missed. “Weasley promised me we would finally hang out tonight so I’m not letting her leave with you! But have a good night!”</p>
<p>“But-“</p>
<p>“Bye Nathanson!” Emily said, grabbing my hand and pulling me away.</p>
<p>Once she had dragged me away from the bar and out of Sam’s line of sight, she turned to me.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” she asked, her tone serious.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “Why did you do that back there?”</p>
<p>“Because you looked incredibly uncomfortable,” Emily said. “And scared. And I was not going to just see that and not do something. I don’t know what Nathanson is capable of but I’m not going to take a chance to find out. Also I know you don’t normally wear outfits like that, just like I don’t wear outfits like this, so I figured you might just be as uncomfortable as I am from all the outer male attention. And I wasn’t going to let a guy think your outfit meant something it didn’t.”</p>
<p>I nodded, understanding, hearing this type of rant of Audrey often.</p>
<p>“Well thank you,” I said. “I don’t think anything bad would have happened but in that off chance I appreciate it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah well if us girls don’t look out for each other who will?” Emily said. “I’m Emily Goyle. I know who you are, but I don’t think we’ve ever been properly introduced.”</p>
<p>“Rose Weasley,” I said, reaching my hand out to shake hers.</p>
<p>An awkward silence descended over us, so I took a drink of water.</p>
<p>“Sorry about pulling Scorpius earlier,” Emily said.</p>
<p>“Oh you’re fine,” I said. At the mention of Scorpius, I immediately tried to think of everything I had ever heard of her and Scorpius’s relationship. “You don’t have to apologize.”</p>
<p>“Well, it just seemed like you guys were, um, hitting it off,” she said, a sly grin on her face.</p>
<p>My face immediately flushed and I looked away from her at all the dancing bodies. “I mean, sure.”</p>
<p>“Scorp’s a really good guy,” Emily said. Although her tone was casual, as if she was just saying he was a good guy, I was having flashbacks of when Al liked Chloe and I was trying to set them up.</p>
<p>“I’m sure he is,” I said, suddenly feeling a whole different kind of uncomfortable. I was sure that Scorpius was a good guy, but the fact that my male cousins could barely stand to be in the same room as him made it near impossible to think of what him being a good guy could do with me. “You know, I actually think I am going to go.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” Emily said. “Do you want me to walk with you?”</p>
<p>“No I’ll just see if I can find one of my cousins,” I said, though I had no intention of doing that. “I have my wand anyway; I’ll just carry it so that I’m ready if I need it. Thank you so much for earlier, I’ll see you in class!”</p>
<p>“Bye,” Emily said, though I could tell she was confused as to my sudden departure.</p>
<p>I turned around, moving towards the door, keeping my eyes open for Audrey to see if maybe she would want to walk with me. Chloe I knew would be with Al, or could already be in the Gryffindor Tower with Al, so I had no expectations of seeing her anywhere.</p>
<p>I was so focused on looking for Audrey that I ran right in to somebody’s back.</p>
<p>“Oh, Merlin, I’m sorry!” I said. The person turned around and I almost had to scream at my luck.</p>
<p>“We sure seem to be accidentally hurting each other tonight don’t’ we?” Malfoy said with a sly smile.</p>
<p>“Yep,” I said, breathlessly. After everything that had happened tonight, running into Malfoy and suddenly feeling very flustered was not something I wanted.</p>
<p>“Ah, nearly empty water bottle,” Malfoy said, tapping my water with his fingers. “We won’t talk as much as we did earlier since your sober now. Probably just school.”</p>
<p>“You know I do talk about other things besides school when I’m sober,” I said, feeling defensive.</p>
<p>Scorpius shrugged. “Wouldn’t know. You always limit your conversations to just school with me.”</p>
<p>He sent me a smirk and, despite myself, I couldn’t help but smile back.</p>
<p>“Are you leaving?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said, but I found that while I wanted to leave the party, now that I found Malfoy again, I didn’t really want to leave him. “Um, would you, um, would you want to go for a walk with me?”</p>
<p>“A walk?” Scorpius asked. His brows furrowed together and I could tell he was confused as to why I would ask him to walk with me.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said, suddenly losing all bravery I had in the one second I asked him to walk with him. “Don’t worry about it, it was stupid-“</p>
<p>“Yeah, um, yeah I’ll walk with you,” Scorpius said, seeming almost flustered. “Let me just, tell Alex where I’m going.”</p>
<p>I nodded and he walked over to a guy, Alex I assumed, telling him he was leaving. His friend looked at me and got a huge smirk on his face, slapping Scorpius on the back, causing Scorpius to glare at him. Scorpius said one last thing to him, still looking annoyed by his friend’s laughter, before walking over to me.</p>
<p>“What was all that about?” I asked.</p>
<p>“He’s just being Alex,” Scorpius said. “Nothing important. Ready to go?”</p>
<p>I nodded. Scorpius let me go first, placing his hand on the small of my back, guiding me forward and keeping us together as we moved through the large crowd. Once we exited the room, his hand dropped from my back.</p>
<p>“Is your head heavy again?” Scorpius asked. I frowned at him in confusion. “You said your head was light early when you were drinking. Since your sober I was wondering if maybe your head was heavy again.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” I said, remembering my rambling about my head weight. “Yeah, my head is heavy again. At least, heavier than it was when we last talked.”</p>
<p>Scorpius nodded and we walked in silence for a little bit, both of us unsure of what to say.</p>
<p>“Sorry about early,” Scorpius said. “Emily, the girl who pulled me away, she needed me. A guy kept bugging her and she couldn’t find Alex, so I had to hang out with her until the guy backed off.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” I said. “Um Emily actually did the same for me too, so I understand.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Sam Nathanson? He was just hitting on me and as I tend to do when a guy shows interest in me I was very uncomfortable but didn’t know how to get out,” I said. “Emily came and brought me away.”</p>
<p>Scorpius nodded. “So Nathanson was hitting on you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “It’s not new. He’s fancied me for a while so I’m used to it. He was just a little more, um, persistent, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Wanker,” Scorpius said under his breath. I shot him a questioning look. “For being persistent. Glad Emily was there.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “Probably would have been fine, but I’m grateful.”</p>
<p>Another silence fell over us.</p>
<p>“So where are we going?” Scorpius asked, looking around the corridor.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I admitted, suddenly feeling very stupid for inviting a guy I barely knew and didn’t even like out for a walk in the middle of the night. “I was planning on just going back to the Gryffindor Tower but then after running into you I just felt like a walk.”</p>
<p>I really hoped that didn’t sound as desperate out loud as it did in my head. I stared down at the ground, hoping to hide my mortification.</p>
<p>Maybe I was still drunk.</p>
<p>I snuck a peek over at Scorpius and saw that he had a small smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Sometimes a walk can be nice,” he said. “The castle is different at night.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “Doing rounds are always weird to do at night. Although I refuse to do the dungeons by myself. Too creepy.”</p>
<p>“Oh come on, the dungeons are not that creepy at night,” Scorpius said, stopping in front of me and facing me. “You’re supposed to be a Gryffindor, where is all that bravery?”</p>
<p>“I have a theory that the Sorting Hat saw the red hair and heard the name Weasley and put me into Gryffindor without looking at what was really in my head,” I said, smiling at him. “I always thought I should have been in Ravenclaw.”</p>
<p>Scorpius smiled. “Well let’s go then.”</p>
<p>“Go where?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Down to the dungeons,” Scorpius said. I scoffed at him. “Come on, everyone is either at the party or asleep. It’s the perfect time. You don’t have to worry at about any mean Slytherins hiding to scare you.”</p>
<p>I laughed. “Yes that is definitely my worse fear.”</p>
<p>“Come on it would be fun. I’ll even show you the Slytherin Common Room if you want,” Scorpius said, a twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>“Interesting,” I said. "But if this is one of your tricks to get me in bed it won't work Malfoy."</p>
<p>"I would never try to get you in bed," Scorpius said. "Your father would kill me."</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but laugh at his response. He looked down at me, smiling and my stomach was once again filled with the feeling I got from looking at him earlier.</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said, hoping that maybe, just maybe, my emotions would disappear if I started talking. “We can go. But only if you take me to the Slytherin Common Room.”</p>
<p>“Promise,” Scorpius said. He held his pinky out. “Pinky promise.”</p>
<p>I joined my pinky with his, solidifying his promise.</p>
<p>“Well let’s go then.”</p>
<p>As Scorpius and I walked down to the dungeons and all around them, we talked the whole time. He told me how he first started playing Quidditch and how he was an only child but he always wanted a sibling. I told him about what having a sibling is actually like and about wanting to be a Healer since I first went to a St. Mungo’s when I was 7 and got bit by a gnome.</p>
<p>“Alright here it is,” Scorpius said, motioning to a portrait. “Cover your ears so you don’t hear the password.”</p>
<p>“Seriously?” I said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Scorpius responded. “I’m already showing you the Common Room. Merlin knows that is some sort of crime, especially since you’re a Gryffindor. We’re supposed to hate each other, remember?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said. “Fine, I’ll do it.”</p>
<p>I covered my ears and watched as Scorpius says the password before he led me into the dark Common Room.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” Scorpius said.</p>
<p>“It’s dark,” I said. “Which makes sense, since you guys are under the lake.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Scorpius said. “Gets cold down here sometimes.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure,” I said, walking towards the bookcase. “You guys have a great book selection.”</p>
<p>I felt Scorpius come up behind me, looking at the books over my head.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I don’t know how often they get read,” Scorpius said. He reached past my head and pulled a book out. “This is my favorite.”</p>
<p>He handed it down to me and I turned to face him.</p>
<p><em>“A History of Magic</em> by Bathilda Bagshot,” I said, reading the title. “A good book. So you’re a big history fan? Or was this just the one book you actually made it through?”</p>
<p>“Oh ha ha,” Scorpius said. “Although it was one of the first books about magic that I got all the way through, I just liked it. Comprehensive stories of magic throughout time. Haven’t read the newest edition that includes your parents and my dad, but considering my father’s part during that time, I may skip it.”</p>
<p>I snuck a look at him. He was looking up at the other books, his sharp jaw locked, and I could tell that his father’s past made him upset.</p>
<p>“It’s hard when your parents are a part of history huh?” I said, relaxing against the bookcase, hoping to show him I understood.</p>
<p>“At least your parents were on the right side of history,” Scorpius said, his eyes meeting mine. They were intense, clearly feeling guilt for something he wasn’t even alive for. He grabbed the book, stepping forward slightly to put it away above my head.</p>
<p>“Still tough,” I said. “Expectations to be as good as them.”</p>
<p>“That might be worse that the expectation to be completely different and better than them,” Scorpius muttered.</p>
<p>I shrugged, looking up at him. “Not worse. Just different. Hard to be your own person with their shadows huh?”</p>
<p>Scorpius looked down at me, with a concentrated look, almost as if he couldn’t believe that he found someone who actually understood him. I couldn’t believe that I had found someone outside of my family who understood. I had thought no one would be able to understand.</p>
<p>“You know I never realized you probably would have understood this problem too,” Scorpius said, a smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Right back at ya,” I said, smiling up at him.</p>
<p>His eyes scanned my face again and his eyes landed on my lips, before he cleared his throat and broke eye contact.</p>
<p>“You probably want to go back to your dorm now,” he said and I felt slightly deflated at his words. “Since you’ve officially seen the Common Room.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” I said, my smile dropping. “I guess.”</p>
<p>“I can walk you back if you want,” Scorpius said. “You know, try to be chivalrous and all.”</p>
<p>“I thought chivalry was a Gryffindor trait?” I said. “Why would a Slytherin need to be chivalrous?”</p>
<p>“It’s like you said,” Scorpius shrugged. “Sometimes I think the Sorting Hat saw the blond hair and the Malfoy name and placed me without even looking at what’s actually in my head.” Scorpius sighed. “It’s that damn shadow again.”</p>
<p>I stared at him until he met my eyes again. As soon as his eyes met mine, I felt the room shift and all my focus turn onto him and his face. The room was quiet, and the only thing I could focus on was his breathing.</p>
<p>I gulped before speaking gently. “You know I’m starting to think you’re maybe the one person to really understand what it’s like with that shadow.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Scorpius said, nodding. “I think you may be the only person I know that understands it too.”</p>
<p>“Quite the connection we have,” I said quietly, looking up at him.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he said softly, his eyes drifting down to my lips again before meeting my eyes once more.</p>
<p>His gaze was forceful and I found my heart was racing a thousand miles a minute. I was very aware of the bookcase on my back and the small distance between us; it would have been so easy to pull him down to me and sandwich myself between him and the bookcase.</p>
<p>Before my brain caught up with my body, I had reached forward on my tip toes, kissing him softly on the lips. He kissed me back, ever so softly and I felt his hands lightly touch my waist. His hands on my body sent a shock through me and I pulled away, as if realizing what I was doing, opening my eyes to look at Scorpius’s face.</p>
<p>His eyes were closed and his lips were parted, he was clearly still in shock by what had just happened, just as I was. His eyes opened and he looked at him his eyes a mixture of confusion, excitement, and I would even say want.</p>
<p>“I…” I tried to think of some excuse for my actions.</p>
<p>“Rose,” Scorpius said softly. He opened his mouth to say more, but I cut him off, suddenly overwhelmed by the way he said my name.</p>
<p>I grabbed his face with my hands and pulled him down again, attaching my lips to his. He met me enthusiastically, his arms wrapping around my waste, pulling me as close to him as possible.</p>
<p>I had never kissed someone like that, desperate, wanting, and personally hoping that it never had to end. Although I knew so many things about it was wrong, kissing Scorpius Malfoy in the Slytherin Common room was not exactly my idea of a perfect snog session, I couldn’t help but want him all the more for it. In this moment, he wasn’t Scorpius Malfoy, the boy my family detested, the boy I only talked to about school.</p>
<p>No, in that moment, he was simply Scorpius Malfoy, the one person who actually understood the pressure of living in someone’s shadow and all the issues that came from it.</p>
<p>And because of that, I only wanted more of him, to escape the shadows that casted us together. To escape the obsessive need to be as perfect as possible. To be so scared of making a mistake that I never took a risk.</p>
<p>I broke the kiss and looked up at him.</p>
<p>“Where’s your room?”</p>
<p>Scorpius looked down at me, clearly not expecting this from me. “What?”</p>
<p>“Where is your room?” I said, letting one of my hands fall from his face to his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Rose, we don’t have to-“</p>
<p>“I know,” I said. I ran my hand down from his shoulder to his hand, pulling it into mine and squeezing it, before pulling myself out of his grasp and pulling him towards the staircase, which I could only assume led to his dorm.</p>
<p>He let me lead him, giving me directions when I needed them, until I opened the door that read <em>Seventh Year Boys</em>.</p>
<p>Scorpius let go of my hand, walking over to what must have been his bed and sitting down on it. I walked over to him, inserting myself between his legs. I was about to lean in to kiss him again, but his hands caught at my waist, pushing me back.</p>
<p>“Just say stop and we will,” he whispered.</p>
<p>I kissed him, wrapping my arms around him and pulling him as close to me as possible as we fell back onto his bed.</p>
<p>I never asked him to stop. I never wanted him to.</p>
<p>So I didn’t, instead enjoying every moment of the escape from real life.</p>
