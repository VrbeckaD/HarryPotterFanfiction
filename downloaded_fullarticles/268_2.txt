    <p>Newt knows he has to tell the truth when she finally asks him about her. Even if it hurts, or risks whatever is growing between them dying out, he has to come clean with the whole story. Honesty could hurt, but he is well aware of how much worse it could be if he lied. Perhaps Tina will understand, and they can continue as they had been these last few months?</p><p>“There- there was a time I did love Leta. When we were in school, she had been my only friend and we understood one another. It’s been a long time since I felt that way. But I did love her then.” Newt admits. </p><p>Tina’s heart goes to her throat, and a familiar feeling twists in her stomach. It brings her back to saying goodbye to him at the dock in New York, asking him whether or not Leta liked to read. Though this time, the Auror is observant enough to see it in his eyes. All the memories he is recalling, of all the times he and Leta were happy. Those would never go away. No matter how long goes by or what happens between him and her.</p><p>And in some small way, she’d always have to share him with Leta Lestrange’s memory.</p><p>But she also remembers the time since parting ways all that time ago. The letters, reconciling with Newt in Paris. All the comforting and surviving in the aftermath of the massacre there, and more recently, their feelings for one another coming to light when they were finally brave enough to put them to words and speak those words to one another. Newt surely loved her; there was no doubt about it the way he looked at her. </p><p>For a moment, Newt looks at her. He is searching for some reaction, with nerves written on his face. Tina tells herself he is with her and wants to be with her now. Maybe, that was enough?</p><p>“Okay. That’s...okay.” She finally said, Some of it more for the benefit of trying to convince herself.</p>
