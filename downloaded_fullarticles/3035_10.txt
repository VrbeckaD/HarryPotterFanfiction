    <p>Gellert sees the aurors of MACUSA before they even notice there’s a dark lord walking on New York’s streets. Now, he’s not sure if they know about him or if they’re just on a routine patrol.</p>
<p>He could apparate and get rid of the problem, but he’s going to meet Vinda in a couple of hours… A spell could be effective, but he’s not sure if they’re close enough to detect it.</p>
<p>Instead of taking out his wand, Gellert gets inside the first store he finds open. Luckily, it’s early in the morning and the store is empty.</p>
<p>He watches as they walk past without looking once.</p>
<p>Of course, when he’s ready to go a… wolf starts growling at him.</p>
<p>But what’s a wolf doing in a bakery?</p>
<p>“Gregory, don’t be rude!” A lovely man with reddish curls, face covered in freckles, stroms out of the kitchen and gets in between Gellert and the wolf. “Sorry, Sir, he’s not very fond of strangers.”</p>
<p>Finally, the wolf stops baring his teeth at Gellert and sits close to its master.</p>
<p>Now, Gellert normally doesn’t give a fuck about muggles, but this one is very much interesting and… cute. And Gellert is honestly curious about the creature.</p>
<p>“So… how did you get a wolf, Mr…?”</p>
<p>“I’m Newt Scamander,” the man says, he’s constantly looking from Gellert to his wolf with concern. “But Gregory is not–he’s a very big dog.”</p>
<p>Gellert chuckles and honestly doesn’t remember the last time he did that.</p>
<p>“That’s definitely not a dog… Newton,” perhaps if all muggles were just like this one, he would’ve changed his mind about them.</p>
<p>Newton blushes to the tip of his ears and Gellert knows he shouldn’t find that so charming, but he does.</p>
<p>“You’re not going to tell anyone, are you?”</p>
<p>“I’d never do anything that could make you sad,” Gellert surprises himself by saying, but he knows that’s true.</p>
<p>Newton’s lips quirk up at that and Gellert can’t help but feel so proud of himself for earning that smile.</p>
<p>Then Newton begins to tell him about his first encounter with Gregory; apparently he was in the woods trying to find black bears (because that man doesn’t know the meaning of self-preservation) but instead he found an injured wolf that he just decided to take home.</p>
<p>Gellert can see it: in another life, he’d be an excellent wizard, taming dragons, kelpies… He’d be so powerful and he’d be his.</p>
<p>But he can’t, not like this. Because he’s just a muggle and Gellert has no time for distractions no matter how pretty they are.</p>
<p>Another man gets out of the kitchen then and Gellert has to remind himself it’s time to go.</p>
<p>“Morning, Sir. I’m Jacob Kowalski, how can I–”</p>
<p>“I need to go,” he cuts him off.</p>
<p>“Wait!” Newton’s voice stops him cold, before he walks away. “You didn’t tell me your name.”</p>
<p>He shouldn’t. There’s no point anyway since he’s not coming back.</p>
<p>“Gellert Grindelwald, but you can call me Gellert.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“We’re going to make marriage between muggles and wizards legal, once we take control,” he tells Vinda.</p>
<p>The witch narrows her eyes at him.</p>
<p>“I thought you hated the non-magique.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never said anything like that,” he did, multiple times, but he’s never going to admit it. “I don’t hate them. I cannot.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, she doesn’t say anything else and Gellert keeps telling himself this has nothing to do with Newton.</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Gellert lasts a week, just a week before he goes back to that bakery. He brings Newton a black kitten and the muggle is so happy he gives him a kiss on the cheek.</p>
<p>He needs to legalize marriage as soon as possible or at least take Newton to London.</p>
<p>Then a blonde witch walks in the bakery and recognizes him instantly. Although she’s nervous, she agrees to speak with him privately and it doesn’t take Gellert long to get her on his side.</p>
<p>After all they both want the same thing, don’t they?</p>
