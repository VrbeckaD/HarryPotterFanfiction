    <p>Harry bite his lip to keep himself from crying as he lean back again the door of his cupboard, he was just throw in after being beaten for accidentally burning the Dudley's dinner. He wants to curl up but the pain all over his body is preventing him from moving, tears flow down his cheeks as he close his eyes to try and get some sleep. He wish...he wish so badly to escape this hell before falling unconscious as the pain became too much. His magic flare up and instead of healing him like it used to, it gave him the escape he wants.</p><p>Britannia frown as he curl up on the pile of leafs he's using as a bed, he is very angry at his brothers, he doesn't understand why they hated him so much. He is just a kid and he have tried so hard to please them but it never work. "This is unfair...I don't want to be alone.." He whispered to himself as he hold back his tears and close his eyes to get some sleep when he suddenly felt a strange feeling of another person's magic forced into his body. He shot up and hide behind the nearest tree, thinking someone is casting spells on him.</p><p>He look around and when he saw that no one is around, he studied his body. His body is still the same and when he checked his magic he was shocked to feel another person's magic core curled around his. 'He-hello?' He heard in his mind and he grab his head. "Who are you? Get out of me!" Britannia yelled angrily. 'I'm sorry! I don't know how to!' The voice apologised and sound like it's on the edge of crying. Britannia frown when he heard the reply. "What's your name?" He asked. '...I don't have a name. Freaks doesn't deserve to have names..." The voice said softly, Britannia can hear the sadness in the childlike voice.</p><p>"Well your not a freak so you should have a name...hmm...how about England? Seeing as you're a part of me now you can use one of my name." He told the voice and he was surprised when he can feel the happiness from the other being in him. 'Re-really? Thank you so much!' The voice, now England said happily. "You're welcome, you may call me Britannia." 'Are you sure you don't mind being here?' England asked, hoping he won't change his mind and try to get rid of him.</p><p>Britannia can feel what England is feeling and he is pretty sure that England is the same as him, alone and longing for love. "Of course." He assured him. "You're a part of me now." He smiled when he felt how happy England is. 'Thank you! Thank you so much, Britannia!' 'No, England. Thank you.' He thought in his mind. 'Thank you for coming to me when I needed someone the most.' He was surprised to hear a reply from England. 'And thank you for letting me stay with you.' 'Sounds like we'll have to explore our connection.' Britannia thought before yawning softly. 'We'll do that tomorrow, for now let's get some sleep. Good night, England.' He thought as he lay back down on the pile of leafs. 'Good night, Britannia.' Was England's reply before sleep take over them.</p>
