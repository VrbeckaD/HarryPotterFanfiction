    <p>How about special patroni that can actually attack people because they actually have mass.... They can still do everything a normal patronus can do but are just inherently stronger... Hermione is one of these witches that has this type of patronus... They also have a mind of thier own </p><p>Say Hermione's a first year and she is getting bullied by draco ... She gets cornered and her patronus springs out of her without her doing anything and pounces on draco scaring the piss outta him and whoever is with draco at the time... Narcissa finds out and therefore bella finds out cause she wasnt caught torturing the longbottoms because she wasnt there. The black sisters take special intrest in Hermione</p>
