</p><p> I was following my normal morning routine and after breakfast I decided to go and look at the shops and see if they had anything interesting. <em>I only live a block away from them so might as well walk,</em> I think as a close and lock my front door I look up at the sky and see that it is cloudy today and decide to make this trip quick.</p><p> </p><p>~Time skip of the amazing 3 hours.~</p><p> </p><p> I sigh as I stroll down the sidewalk and check my watch <em>it’s been nearly four hours , I guess I should go home. </em>But as I go to turn around I spot a shop that looks out of place, but not because it’s new, no it looks out of place because it’s <em><u>old</u></em> it looks like someone pulled it out of Dragonheart or something, it has a wooden sign with a necklace on it.</p><p> </p><p> <em>Okay then… I guess a peek won't hurt…</em> The bell on the door jingles as I open it “hello.. Is anyone here?” I call out into the almost empty space, no reply. At first glance it looks like just another odds and ends shop but as I take a closer look I see that everything here is made with a precious metal and/or stone, and the price tags are just plane…. Weird.</p><p> </p><p> They say things like, your sight, your voices, and one even says your <em><u>your soul</u></em>, I’m about to leave but as I’m reaching for the door I spot what would look to be a circular locket when closed but it’s open on the display and it has what looks to be a broken compass and pocket watch in it.</p><p> </p><p> After a few minutes debate with myself I go and take a closer look, it looks like it’s made of rose gold, and sure enough just as weird as the others the price tag says <em><u>‘your past.’ </u></em> Against my better judgement I pick it up and take a in sharp breath as a feeling of my skin crawling washes over me, and the edge of my vision goes dull, I make to put it down fast, but before I can everything goes dark...</p><p> </p><p>
