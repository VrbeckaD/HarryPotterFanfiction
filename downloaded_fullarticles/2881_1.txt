    <p>Lucius woke, and quickly took stock of the new feeling in his chest. It was the same gnawing emptiness he'd felt since his inheritance—the one marrying Narcissa hadn't filled, at all—except now there was more <em>definition</em> to it. As if the person that was supposed to fit there had finally grown into the spot and was ready to be fitted into place in his heart.</p><p> </p><p>His mate had reached their majority.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius dug through his sluggish, early-morning brain to come up with the date: January 9, 1978.</p><p> </p><p>Severus was his mate, then. There could be no one else.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius felt elated at the realization, and quickly tamped it down. There was no reason to get <em>too</em> excited. The man could still reject him, and he knew he was a submissive, the way he reacted to Narcissa. He wouldn't survive a rejection.</p><p> </p><p>He quickly penned a letter to the teen, asking him to meet him in the Three Broomsticks during the next Hogsmeade weekend. They'd talk then, and hopefully Severus would be willing to give him a try. He needed to hold out hope for as long as he could, even if it <em>was</em> destined to be dashed.</p><p> </p><p>He rose, dressed, and spent the usual twenty minutes on his hair, making sure not a strand was out of place before tying it back with his usual black ribbon.</p><p> </p><p>Then, Lucius sighed softly, and left the room to break his fast with his wife.</p><p> </p><p>Whom he <em>still</em> hadn’t managed to ‘do his duty’ by yet. Not for lack of trying, of course. He was paying Severus for expertly-brewed aphrodisiac <em>and</em> fertility potions, but Narcissa was having a difficult time conceiving. Then again, most Pureblooded women did, being as delicate of constitution as they were, and he counted himself lucky to have gotten the sister he could tolerate best out of the three Black women. At least he didn’t have to live with <em>and fuck</em> a shrew like Bellatrix.</p><p> </p><p>He sat down at the table, Narcissa already seated at his right hand, sipping her tea as she leafed through a catalogue of expensive French couture. “Hello, Lucius. Good morning. I’m ovulating.” She said softly.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius smiled. “Good. I have the potions, we can try again after breakfast.”</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa winced. “<em>Must</em> we do this in the <em>daylight</em>?” She asked.</p><p> </p><p>“I have business to attend to, and you know our Lord usually Calls at night. If we are to do this, it must be fitted into my schedule. Besides, I'm not ugly or deformed, and neither are you. Neither of us has anything to be ashamed of, so why hide in the dark?”</p><p> </p><p>“Very well.” Narcissa said, resigned. “After breakfast it shall be.”</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>“I have discovered who my mate is.” Lucius said, one arm wrapped around Narcissa's waist as they basked in the afterglow. They may not have love, but thanks to Severus' potions they were still able to achieve satisfactory orgasms, and this was the best time to talk about important matters, when both were calm and sated.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa propped herself up on one arm to look down at him. “Oh? Who is it, then?” She asked. “I hope she's not <em>prettier</em> than me.” She pouted.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius laughed. “No, <em>he</em> is not.”</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa's eyes widened. “No <em>wonder</em> you need the potions!” She breathed. “I always thought it was something I was lacking, but if you simply aren’t attracted to women that way… It's not me.” She said happily.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius sighed. “No, Cissa, it’s not you. My mate happens to be Severus. I’m going to meet with him during his next Hogsmeade weekend.”</p><p> </p><p>“You must be happy; you'll finally be able to take the blocks off of your magic and access the full power of it.” Narcissa said.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>If</em> he accepts me; he could very well <em>reject</em> me. He's always been a bit of a wild card, we have no way of knowing if he’s even attracted to men, and more than that, I may not even be to his <em>taste</em>.” Lucius shook his head. “And I fear I would not survive a rejection. You <em>know</em> I’m a submissive.”</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa smiled and dropped a quick kiss on his lips. “Calm yourself, darling. He'll love you. How could he not? You're the best offer he's ever going to get.” She said lightly.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius hummed. “Let's hope <em>he</em> agrees.” He said.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Lucius was waiting at a table near the back of the establishment—Severus’ <em>preferred </em>table, no less—and  the teen was due to arrive any moment.</p><p> </p><p>A few other students had already arrived and were talking loudly and drinking butterbeers, and Lucius watched them as he sipped his Firewhiskey.</p><p> </p><p>Ah, to be that young and carefree again! He wished he could go back in time, but then remembered that at that age, his Father had still been alive, and he could never have been with Severus under his Father's watchful eye.</p><p> </p><p>Best not to wish for that, then.</p><p> </p><p>He saw Severus come through the door, and his heart skipped a beat at the sight of the man, pink and shivering from cold. Apparently, he <em>still</em> forgot his warming charms when out in inclement weather. He smiled fondly.</p><p> </p><p>Severus noticed him and headed over, sitting opposite his friend and gifting him with a rare smile—one that reached his coal-black eyes. “Lucius. To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit today?” He asked.</p><p> </p><p>Madam Rosemerta came over and Severus ordered a butterbeer, rightly guessing that this visit would require his full brain capacity.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius waited until Madam Rosemerta was gone and looked at Severus closely. “You're looking remarkably well today, Severus.”</p><p> </p><p>Severus flushed. It was a faint hint of pink, but to Lucius, who knew Severus well, it was noticeable. “Thank you. I have been doing well.” He responded.</p><p> </p><p>“I came to see you for one reason only. You and I have been very good friends—" Lucius paused as Madam Rosemerta brought Severus his drink and hustled away, “And I like to think we are close.” He finished.</p><p> </p><p>Severus took a sip of his drink before nodding. “We are close. I’ve always considered you the older brother I never had. As well as my closest friend these days.” He said, a faint hint of bitterness coming through.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius nodded. “Well, it may be time to rethink our current association.” He said softly.</p><p> </p><p>Severus looked up, startled, and Lucius could see the hurt shining starkly in his eyes. He quickly spoke to assuage it.</p><p> </p><p>“I do not mean to push you away, Severus. Quite the opposite, I hope my words will draw us closer still.” Lucius told him in a rush.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m afraid I don’t understand your meaning.” Severus said.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius smiled and reached across the table to take his hand, brushing his thumb over Severus’ knuckles—as demonstrative as he could be in public, since he had Narcissa waiting at home and no wish to cause a scandal. “Did you notice that after I turned seventeen I stopped using my magic as often? And that it was weaker when I <em>did</em> deign to use it?” He asked.</p><p> </p><p>Severus frowned, but nodded. “I noticed. I thought you were simply growing up, and not showing off as much.”</p><p> </p><p>Lucius smiled and shook his head. “No, I am and always will be a show-off, I’m afraid. My magic grew alarmingly, and became quite uncontrollable without a block on it.” He dropped his voice so that Severus had to strain to hear, and admitted, “I am an elemental, Severus. A powerful one.”</p><p> </p><p>Severus sucked in a breath. “Why tell <em>me</em> this? Surely you should only share that with your mate. Narcissa—”</p><p> </p><p>“Is my <em>wife</em>.” Lucius cut him off. “But not my <em>mate</em>.” He finished. “My mate came of age two weeks ago, on the ninth of January.” He said.</p><p> </p><p>Severus' eyes widened. “<em>Me</em>?” He asked.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius nodded once. “I strongly suspect so. There is no way to be <em>sure</em>, of course, until we kiss. But I know of no one else who shares your birth date, and so I am almost certain it is you.”</p><p> </p><p>Severus dropped his eyes to his butterbeer and withdrew his hand. “What of your marriage?” He asked.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius sighed. This was the part that could either make or break this whole thing. “The contract is solid. There is no way out of it. Our fathers made sure of that. But we are allowed to have lovers on the side, although hers must wait until she begets me an heir. I can have you, as a lover and mate, but it cannot be public. It would have to remain a family secret. I have discussed it with her already, and she bears neither of us ill-will. She <em>understands</em>, Severus. Please tell me you understand as well.”</p><p> </p><p>Severus was peeling the label off of his drink as he considered things, a nervous habit Lucius had learned meant he was thinking hard.</p><p> </p><p>He watched, and waited.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, Severus met his eyes again. “I understand.” He said softly. “I understand that I can only be your dirty little secret on the side.”</p><p> </p><p>Lucius’ heart broke as a sharp pang lanced through him, making him hitch in a breath. “Severus, <em>please</em>—”</p><p> </p><p>“This isn’t a rejection.” Severus said, standing. “This is me saying I need time to think about what you <em>are</em> offering, and whether I can live with it. Expect my owl by Friday next. I will see you later, Lucius. Be well.” He said, running tender fingers over the back of Lucius’ hand.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius sat there for long minutes, watching the students come and go, and wondering whether next Friday would be the beginning of his life, or the end of it.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Lucius</em>!” Narcissa barged into his room. They didn’t lock doors, usually, as each would respect the others' privacy.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius turned over in his bed, eyes seeking her out. “What?” He asked, voice raspy from disuse, except for wracking sobs from time to time.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa sighed. “You look <em>disgusting</em>.” She told him.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius sighed and turned back over. “Thank you. You can go now.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, Lucius, you are getting up, getting a shower and getting <em>dressed</em>! It's <em>Tuesday</em>, for Merlin's sake! If he had <em>rejected</em> you, you'd be <em>dead</em> by now!” Narcissa said. “So I don’t understand why you’re moping around.”</p><p> </p><p>“He doesn’t want to be my ‘dirty little secret,’ Cissa. I’m awaiting my doom like a <em>proper </em>submissive.” Lucius said mulishly.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa circled the bed and glared down at him, hands on her hips. “You still haven’t gotten me <em>pregnant</em>, Lucius, you <em>can’t </em>die yet!”</p><p> </p><p>Lucius laughed mirthlessly. “I’m afraid my inner elemental does not <em>care</em> whether you conceive or not. It cares only that its <em>mate</em> does not want it.”</p><p> </p><p>“You said yourself that he was waiting until Friday to decide. What if he decides he <em>does</em> want you and you've already wasted away by then?” She asked.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius huffed and turned his back on her again. “I’ve changed my mind. You're as much a shrew as Bella.” He muttered.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa's eyes widened and she placed her hands on her hips, glaring at the back of his head. “You're <em>obviously</em> not yourself right now, or I might take <em>offense</em> at that. Get <em>up</em>!”</p><p> </p><p>Lucius sighed. “Why should I?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because if you <em>don't</em>, I’m writing to Severus and telling him how you've spent the last two days abed!” She threatened.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius sighed. “He won’t <em>care</em>.” He muttered sullenly, even as he sat up.</p><p> </p><p>“So are you getting up, or simply rearranging yourself?” Narcissa asked.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m <em>getting up</em>, you infuriating woman!” He snapped.</p><p> </p><p>Narcissa smiled. “Good. I'll be waiting with tea in the blue parlour.” She said, then left the room.</p><p> </p><p>Lucius walked into the bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>If he wanted peace in his final days, he had no choice but to wait them out as if he wasn’t waiting to die. Narcissa would have no other way.</p>
