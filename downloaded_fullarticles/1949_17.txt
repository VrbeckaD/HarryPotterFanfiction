          <div class="userstuff"><p>When Remus saw Sirius for the first time in thirteen years, he looked almost like a dead man. Sitting in the corner of the Shrieking Shack pointing a wand--not his--at the rat that was Peter. Then Sirius saw him, and his sunken dead-man's-eyes (so different from the last time they'd spoken) met Remus's, and a bit of that old spark gently flickered back to life. Ah, thought Remus, so he was not dead yet after all.</p>
<p>When Sirius saw Remus again, all he saw was how haggard his friend looked. It made sense, Sirius thought. Him and James and Peter gone all at once, and then thirteen years more alone. Sirius thought about the full moons past, (spent alone, most likely,) since he'd been gone. The moons he'd always noticed, always watched, through the tiny barred window in his cell in Azkaban and thought of Moony. Then, Sirius just thought about how good it was to see his best friend again after so long apart.</p>
<p>Later on, Remus and Sirius sat together and spoke of the things Sirius had missed these thirteen years. <em>They can treat it now. Lycanthropy.</em> Remus had said. <em>Not cure it, of course, but make it safe at the very least.</em></p>
<p><em>Can they?</em> replied Sirius, bemused. <em>Guess you won't be needing us anymore.</em> A joke. Remus smiled. They both ignored the fact that of the 'us' being referred to, Sirius was the last one left. Left still loyal. Still alive. Sirius asked if Remus spent his full moons with anybody nowadays. Remus shook his head.</p>
<p>When the next full moon came, Remus did not spend it alone.</p>
<p>Sirius was fascinated by the altered transformations. <em>Like me,</em> he observed.</p>
<p><em>The potion tastes awful,</em> Remus replied.</p>
<p>Every so often, Sirius spoke of Azkaban. <em>I looked at the moon and thought of you.</em> he said.</p>
<p><em>So did I.</em> Remus replied.</p></div>
