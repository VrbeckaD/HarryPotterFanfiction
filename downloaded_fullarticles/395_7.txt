    <p>Harri Potter had been sent to the past. </p><p>Men and women were strolling around in a variety of plaid skirts and blouses, A-line dresses and tailored suits befitting the era of the 1940s. To be precise, 1943, as she had read in the newspaper after she had scoured the indoor stand selling them. The worker had promptly given her a baleful look, believing she wasn’t above stealing after one glance at her ragged, dirty appearance before she had mumbled under her breath, leaving in a flash of panic. </p><p>The last memory she had of being in her present time was being struck by the fatal curse. Voldemort watching in satisfaction as she had died. No bright light, not even meeting her parents, Sirius ... But she hadn't died. And had no recollection other than suddenly walking across a very Muggle London, bewildered and uneasy by the sudden turn of events. </p><p>As she continued walking aimlessly, questions floating in and out of her head in a daze, she soon noticed ruins at every turn. Buildings were almost completely in shambles surrounding her. The area seemed almost deserted save for a few souls who were wearing gas masks and holding bulletin boards. </p><p>“Hey, darling.” A women in an official uniform said after strolling up to her briskly. “Are you lost? Are you in need of help?”</p><p>Harri remained silent, afraid to say one wrong word. What would Hermione do? What does anyone do in this situation?</p><p>“Did you live here?” The woman says, her voice hushed and somber. </p><p>What else could she do but nod? The future she belonged in rather resembled what she saw around her anyway. Thoughts turning despondent, she wondered whether fifty years from now she was lying dead at Voldemort’s feet to the delight of all the Death Eaters. </p><p>“What’s your name, honey?” The woman says. </p><p>Harri feels her body trembling but her mind clears adequately enough to say, “Harri Potter.”</p>
