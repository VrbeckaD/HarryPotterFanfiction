</center>“Luce!” Sheila gasped, collapsing against Lucretia’s shoulder, tears of laughter stinging her eyes. “I can’t believe you just said that.”<p>Her best friend smirked, running an elegant finger around the rim of her glass, the smokey odor of fire whiskey cutting through the miasma of the bar. “Well it’s true. I saw them together at school, in that closet on the third floor by Dumbledore’s classroom. And I don’t care who they married, they are definitely still fucking.”</p>
<p>Sheila slid down in the booth, head finding her arms on the table as her shoulders shook. She would never tired of hearing Lucretia Black, classiest pureblood of their generation, casually say fuck. Thank Morgana for Luce, honestly, keeping her sane as the wedding drew ever closer.</p>
<p>Reminded of what started this conversation, Sheila looked up at her best friend with the smirk that had won her Lucretia’s friendship back in third year. “Let’s seat them all at the same table. Punishment for getting us detention over the hat thing.”</p>
<p>Lucretia laughed, loud and genuine as she never got to be when they drank in Diagon Alley. “You’re my favorite, Sheila Bennett. I’m going to fight the groom for you, just you wait.”</p>
<p>Grinning, Sheila opened her mouth to ask what Ignatius would think about that plan when the world suddenly lurched. The smokey haze in the bar thickened, burning the back of her throat, her ears buzzing like someone had cast a privacy charm. Everything slowed, eons between blinks, and words poured out of her throat in a crashing torrent she could hardly hear over the thundering of her heart.</p>
<p>
  <i>“Amaranthine child, you walk the edge of shadow and the brink of war; Speak and death will hear you, child of love, child of blood; Blood spilled, blood paid, blood owed; For certain death must be for the born, and certain no longer is birth for the dead; Flee no more, bleak twin, death’s child draws near; Threads rewoven, splinters gathered, what was done will be undone.”</i>
</p>
<p>The last word fell from her lips and she went limp, eyes sliding closed as darkness claimed her. </p>
<p>Something struck her, cold and burning, and she gasped, coughing on her own breath, fire whiskey dripping down her cheeks, Lucretia’s face above hers, pale and terrified.</p>
<p>“Sheila, Sheila!” </p>
<p>“I’m—I’m fine,” Sheila coughed out, flailing with her hand toward the table until she realized she was on the floor. “Help me up.”</p>
<p>Luce pulled her up, glaring fiercely at the concerned and nosey onlookers until they’d dispersed back to their own tables or the long bar. “What the fuck was that,” she hissed, shoving Sheila into the booth and sliding in next to her, hiding her from the room. “You never told me you were a seer.”</p>
<p>“I’m not,” Sheila said, too shocked to lie. “I mean. I wasn’t? I,” she shook herself, head aching like she’d been hit with a stunner and ears still buzzing strangely. “I think I had a great grandmother who was, but I've never, I don’t,” she stopped, out of words, shaking her head again as Luce stared at her with fierce grey eyes. “Did I really give a prophecy?”</p>
<p>“There’s only one way to find out,” Lucretia said, voice sharp enough to make Sheila wince before softening into something less accusatory. “Lucky for you I have a cousin in the Department of Mysteries.”</p>
<p>Sheila managed a faint smile that wasn’t returned, Luce instead leaning close, her face as sober as Sheila had ever seen it. “You can’t tell anyone what happened, not even your loving husband-to-be.” Her lips twisted. “The Blacks have a long history of using and abusing prophecies and they’re not the only ones. A real Seer isn’t safe, not from anyone, and what you said...” she trailed off as a shiver ran down Sheila’s spine.</p>
<p>“We barely survived Grindelwald, if another war is coming.” It was Lucretia’s turn to shake her head. “No one can know about this.”</p>
<p>Sheila’s stomach churned, weight settling on her shoulders at the thought of what another war would bring to their world. Surely it was just stress and fire whiskey, maybe a misfired charm from one of the other patrons giving her some strange fit. They would check at the Ministry and none of it would be real. No war, no blood, no children fighting to survive.</p>
<p>Their future was bright and she was no seer. And if she ignored Lucretia’s intent gaze and the throbbing in her skull she could almost believe it.</p>

</center>“Got another one, Fell,” Croaker said, lifting his lit wand to show his colleague the glass orb on the shelf of unattributed prophecies. It was the first in decades, only the second this century, and they both peered at the inscription with wary fascination.<p><i>S.P.T. to A.P.W.B.D.<br/>Dark Lord<br/>and ?</i> </p>
<p>“Dumbledore, eh? Wonder what he plans to do about it,” Fell muttered, frowning at the mist swirling beneath the glass as Croaker let his eyes drift to the one next to it.</p>
<p>
  <i>S.E.B. to L.D.B.<br/>?<br/>and ?<br/>(?) and ?</i>
</p>
<p>Not even the correct number of attributions was known for that one. Such a shame that the subjects of prophecies were entirely too subjective—pun definitely intended—to be determined via magical means. They were lucky they caught prophecies at all. It was no coincidence that the Unspeakables studying time were also in charge of the Prophecy room. One of their own, centuries ago, had discovered the means to identify pockets of time out of place, and what was a prophecy but the future reaching out to its past? A bubble of knowledge, shaping the course of history. If they weren’t all hogwash, self-fulfilling and entirely mutable.</p>
<p><i>That</i> was a debate guaranteed to take a few years every time it cropped up in the inter-departmental roundtables. </p>
<p>Croaker shrugged to himself, looking back at Fell. “Whatever he pleases, I’m sure. Lunch? I’m suddenly starving.”</p>
<p>Fell gave the orb one last frown, then smirked at him over her shoulder as she led the way out of the room. “You mean you’re starving for an argument, you know Rookwood’s in today and you want to ruin all our appetites with your musings on decomposition and death curses.”</p>
<p>Croaker bared his teeth. “If you have a weak stomach, you shouldn’t be an Unspeakable. Now come on, Fell, I brought meatloaf.”</p>
<p>Her laughter carried them out of the room, darkness falling on the rows and rows of glass and magic, futures shifting and straining to escape, to shape and carve the humans they foretold. </p>
<p>Those roundtable debates would have been far more contentious if the Unspeakables only knew how much intent the prophecies had, not living, no, but willful, consumed with purpose, <i>hungry</i>. </p>
<p>Hungry and restless and eager to bind themselves to the souls unlucky enough to be touched by fate, willing or not.</p>
