    <p>The tension in the kitchen of Grimmauld place could be cut with a knife. The children had just been sent upstairs, though everyone seated around the table knows they're listening at the door.</p>
<p>All of them remember being young, with a war out there just waiting for them to come of age. </p>
<p>Sirius Black sits at the head of the table, only because it's his house they're in. He's merely a figurehead, not allowed to make any decisions. Until now, he'd let it slide, but now it involved Harry, who was his responsibility, no matter his status with the law.</p>
<p>"Harry is old enough to hear what's happening," Sirius scratches the stubble on his face, "they all are."</p>
<p>"As I've already said," Molly Weasley stands behind her husband, stirring something in a giant cooking cauldron, "he's just a boy. They're all just children."</p>
<p>"Gods damn it, Molly" Sirius nearly shouts, he rises from the table and his hands slam onto the table, "the war can not be won with you lot trying to shield anyone who's capable of fighting."</p>
<p>The redheaded woman stops stirring her pot and stares daggers into the younger man, Arthur's eyes flit between the two as if he's watching broomsmen zip up and down the quidditch field. Just like at a match, he doesnt intervene.</p>
<p>"Sirius," Remus Lupin rises on Sirius' right hand side, he places a firm hand on the shorter man's shoulder, "sit down."</p>
<p>The big black dog inside Sirius can't help but obey Lupin's commanding tone.</p>
<p>Remus turns to Molly, who's still scowling down at the head of the household as if he's one of her children who needs a scolding. "He's not cross with you Molly," Remus assures her, "he's just tired of being being cooped up. Surely you can understand?"</p>
<p>"Highly unlikely," Sirius' anger is subsiding, but he'll if he won't go down without a fight, "she isn't a prisoner in her own home."</p>
<p>The rage in Molly's eyes evaporates, and they fill with pity. Nobody knows how to console a wrongly accused fugitive, so the meeting goes stagnant.</p>
<p>"May I suggest we pick this up tomorrow, " Snape rises from his chair at the end of the long table, "it's clear emotions are in the way of any progress we may make tonight." </p>
<p>The greasy haired man exits without another word. Sirius throws a crude hand gesture in his direction as the front door slams. Remus squeezes the shoulder he's still holding before he heads upstairs to supposedly send an owl to Dumbledore.</p>
<p>As Molly rounds the kids up for dinner Arthur approaches Sirius where he sits with his head hanging in his hands.</p>
<p>"None of us can possibly know how you're feeling," Arthur shuffles on his feet and doesnt make eye contact as he speaks, "but you are helping us, Sirius, your insight is helpful enough."</p>
<p>"Its just so frustrating," Sirius runs his hands through his hair, "I don't feel as if there's anything I can do."</p>
<p>"Well," Arthur smiles down at him, "we'll just have to find you a distraction then."</p>
<p>Before Sirius can ask what on earth he's talking about, the kids all file into the kitchen followed by Remus Lupin, who looks frazzled in a different way than they all appeared at the meeting of the order.</p>
<p>He doesnt have time to think on it though, as chaos always ensues when over a dozen people try to dine together.</p>
<p>--<br/>"If Voldemort's raising an army then I want to fight," Harry says, as the group briefs him after they've all stuffed themselves. Molly looks terrified, but Sirius' heart swells with pride.</p>
<p>"Remus," Arthur raises an eyebrow at the werewolf, "Although I'd love to have this debate for the twentieth time in an hour, I think it may be time for a change in subject? Don't you agree?"</p>
<p>"Remus, love, are you alright" Sirius gestures to the swea dripping off Remus' brow and his shaking hand, "you seem a bit nervous."</p>
<p>"Yeah," the lanky man uses the back of his sleeve to wipe away the sweat as he rises from his chair, "you see, padfoot, there's been something I've been meaning to ask you," he pulls Sirius too his feet, keeping their hands entwined, "I've just been waiting, you see."</p>
<p>Sirius cocks an eyebrow at his lover. Or rather, at the man who had been his lover. At school, they do been inseperable, James and Peter had threatened to charm their lips together permanently if they'd have to walk in on them snogging one more time. Since Askaban, things had changed. The love was still there, of course, it has never left, but there wasn't enough time for such trivial things when there was a war to be won. But even still, on most mornings, you could find the padfoot the dog curled up at the foot of Remus' bed in Grimmauld place.</p>
<p>"But the thing is," Remus continues, dropping to one knee, "I think we all need something good to happen right now. So what do you think, Sirius? M-marry me?" </p>
<p>Remus' hands shake as he await a response, he stays on one knee, staring up into the grey eyes and slack jaw of a completely surprised Sirius Black.</p>
<p>"Well," it's Harry who breaks the silence, "Don't leave us all hanging, are you gonna marry the man or not??"</p>
<p>Sirius breaks out of a daze and into a smile, he pulls Remus off the ground as he shakes his head in affirmation, "Of course I'll marry you, you stupid, stupid man, now calm down, breath."</p>
<p>It's true Remus hadn't realized he was holding his breath until he let's it out with a gasp. He grabs Sirius by the back of the heads and their teeth clash together through their wide smiles. </p>
<p>Harry whoops, then makes a fake gagging noise when their kids doesnt break apart.</p>
<p>"Molly," Sirius looks at the woman, who's wiping a tear from the corner of her eye with a pink handkerchief, as they all excluding Harry, who disappeared to tell the others the news, share a celebratory firewhiskey. "just because I'm distracted right now doesnt mean we won't be continuing our ealier conversations."</p>
<p>"So stubborn," she smiles at him despite their earlier bickering, "I truly don't know how Remus is going to deal with you."</p>
<p>Remus smiles at the mention of his fiance. Who is currently staring down at him from the landing halfway up the stairs. Remus has a single eyebrow raised. </p>
<p>"Looks like I'm being summoned," Sirius sets down his glass, ruffles his hair, and follows his fiance up into his bedroom. Their bedroom. </p>
<p>For the first time in as long as he can remember, Sirius Black doesnt sleep as a big black dog, but a small, black haired man, tangled in the arms of a lanky man covered head to toe with scars.</p>
