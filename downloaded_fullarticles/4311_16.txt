    <p>Dianella Lily Dursley was born on August 1<sup>st</sup>, 1978.</p><p>This was, on the whole, something of a surprise. After all, her parents, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, had married only eight months prior. They had not, in fact, ‘jumped the gun’ as the unladylike ladies and uncouth gentlemen of Harthdown Court supposed. Dianella’s birth was premature and as such she spent the first few months of her life in hospital. By the time she was released, early on the morning of November 13<sup>th</sup>, 1978, her parents had moved to a smaller, kinder neighborhood, her father had earned the third in a series of promotions that would allow him to support his growing family in the style he’d always dreamed, and her mother had reconciled with her estranged sister.</p><p>This was, in some respects, even more surprising than Dianella’s birth.</p><p>In one world, a worse world, Petunia Dursley nee Evans would spend the first three years of her marriage trying and failing to have a child. In this other world, she would experience the heartache of miscarriage, the loss of a child deeply and desperately wanted. She would birth her first and only child in June of 1981, and soon after an extended convalescence would receive notice that her younger sister, she of the charmed life, had experienced similar joy. It would be proof, yet again, that for Lily everything would always come more easily and quickly, and with less visible strife. It would be salt in a ragged wound, and it would cement the bitterness Petunia carried into a weight that would dog her for the rest of her days.</p><p>But in this world, Petunia’s marriage bore fruit swiftly, if not easily. The pregnancy was difficult and the expectant mother was prescribed bed rest scant weeks before the end of her second trimester. In this world, Petunia’s mother owled Lily and between them they set up a schedule of daily check-ins. The visits started with tight faces and terse words but over time things smoothed over. Not all wounds, poorly healed if that, were reopened in order that they might heal properly, but a reluctant sort of ceasefire was reached.</p><p>It carried through even after the difficult delivery and even harder hospital stay. Lily was a frequent visitor to little Dianella’s room, the ease of transportation she enjoyed as a witch making it simple to slip away at least twice a week for brief visits. Her regularly unscheduled appearances were enough to inoculate Vernon against the eccentricities of witches and wizards, though he could never quite bring himself to approve of it all. For the duration of his life, Vernon would regard magic with a shake of his head and a faint frown, calling it a “funny business.”</p><p>But in this world, he would say it with weary incomprehension, not spiteful derision.</p><p>By the spring of 1979, Vernon had unbent enough to accompany his wife and daughter to the wedding of his sister-in-law. The ceremony was extravagant in ways that only a magical event planner could achieve. Vernon did not approve, though he later agreed with his wife that the catering was excellent. They arrived on time and left quite early, but they came and, to Lily, that was all that mattered.</p><p>Visits between the Dursley and Potter households after the wedding were regular, if infrequent. The war was heating up and the last thing Lily Potter wanted to do was draw the attention of the Dark Lord to her sister’s small family. Reluctantly, Vernon Dursley accepted that owls were to be a part of his life for the foreseeable future and had an appropriate perch built in the shade of one of the trees in the backyard. It was by owl that Petunia communicated the news of her second pregnancy and it was by owl that Lily reciprocated with news of her own expected child. In this world, the younger woman asked advice of the elder, looking to her big sister for assistance and support, and something fractured and aching in Petunia Dursley’s heart at last began to mend.</p><p>The Prophecy changed everything in this world, as it did in that other place.</p><p>Lily sent word, explaining what she could of the danger, but instructing Petunia to only contact her in extremis. It was through this channel that Petunia informed her sister of their mother’s passing in the spring of 1980. Lily, trapped behind wards and walls, could not attend the funeral. Instead she sent a bouquet of flowers, charmed for longevity, to be planted at the gravesite. Petunia, well versed in the languages of flowers, understood the sorrow, the regret, the love and the heartache being conveyed. She stood strong, planted the flowers as instructed, and did not begrudge her sister the lack of attendance.</p><p>Petunia sent only one other missive during that year: a brief note and a picture of Dianella holding baby Dudley.</p><p>Lily responded with a charmed silver rattle and, a little over a month later, sent the third and final letter Petunia would receive from behind the wards of Godric’s Hollow. This letter contained the birth announcement of one Harry James Potter, a picture, and a baby doll – the last a birthday present for Dianella, who came so close to sharing a natal day with her cousin.</p><p>The silence from her sister wore on Petunia. Happily, she had other things to occupy her days: two beautiful children, deeply longed for and earnestly cherished. Dianella, who had the best of the Evans and Dursley genes combined in looks, while in temperament she took after her maternal grandmother: quiet, but crafty, little, but fierce. Dudley, who was as bright and boisterous as his sister was seemingly shy and retiring, was still a bit too young to be truly set. In looks, he took after the more solid Dursleys, though his coloring was all Evans. In that other world, as an only child and the sole focus of an overwhelming amount of love and attention, Dudley would have been doomed to be spoilt. In this world, the love was split, though by no means lesser. With slightly better perspective and a less grasping, desperate sort of affection, the Dursleys were indulgent parents, but not unreasonably so.</p><p>In this world, when Petunia spoke of her ‘bohemian’ sister to the fellow housewives of Privet Drive, it was with affection, not scorn. There was love there, and while it might be clouded by might-have-beens and the odd regret, it ran deep and true. This made the revelations of the morning of November 2<sup>nd</sup>, 1981, all the more devastating. Lily was dead, and James with her, little Harry left orphaned and sleeping on the doorstep.</p><p>When Dianella found Petunia weeping over a letter and a sleepy toddler, early that morning, her first thought was not worry over her mother or curiosity over the strange child. When Dianella tip-toed over to the basket and lifted the blanket, peering down at a face with heavy-lidded green eyes near-identical to her own, her very first thought was:</p><p>
  <em>So, <strong>that’s</strong> what a Horcrux looks like. The movies didn’t do it justice.</em>
