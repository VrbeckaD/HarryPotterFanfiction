  <span>Harry had been waiting on Platform 9¾ for the last thirty minutes.  He had arrived early wanting to welcome back Hermione and Ginny from completing their last year at Hogwarts.  As he combed his hands through his messy hair, a smile appeared on his face. A memory came to mind of Hermione running to him with a letter in her hand, explaining how they have all been invited back to Hogwarts to complete their education.  Not surprisingly, many students chose not to return, but that did not hinder Hermione from wanting to complete her N.E.W.T.s. As the memory faded, Harry looked around the platform. He was truly excited to see his friend once again; however, a small ache was present in his chest.  Another memory came to the forefront of his mind of the day everything had changed between him and his so called </span>
  <em>
    <span>best friend</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Do you really want to break us up after all we have been through?  Come on, Mione! You don’t need a bloody test to prove how smart we already know you are,” said Ron as the three friends sat on the floor of his bedroom.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“That’s not the point Ronald! I want my scores for the future.  I don’t want to chase dark wizards and witches for the rest of my life!” </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I don’t want to talk about this now.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“No, let's talk about it.  I’m leaving tomorrow and I don’t plan on returning until the Christmas hols, so please, say what you have to say.” </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“You’re being selfish.”  Hermione jumped up from his comment and was about to scream before Harry spoke.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Ron, that’s not fair,” said Harry.  “We know how important this is for Hermione.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“More important than us?” asked Ron, looking directly at the upset witch.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I don’t think tha-,” Hermione stepped in, interrupting Harry.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Fine, then. Yes, Ronald.  More important than you and Harry!” shouted Hermione as her eyes started to glaze over. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Ron stood and stormed out, leaving her in tears and Harry speechless.  It was only a moment later when Harry walked up to her. Hermione turned to face him wrapping her arms fully around him.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I didn’t really mean that, Harry.  I’m sorry.” </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“It’ll be alright Mione,” Harry whispered in her ear as he stroked her curls.  “I know you didn’t and he’s just upset right now; he’ll be back and you’ll be able to talk this out.”  Harry didn’t notice her sobs </span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>subsiding</span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span> until she looked up at him.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Perhaps...there’s nothing to talk about anymore.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Don't say that.  I’m sure he’ll be back to apologize for what happened.  You’re both upset right now, that’s all.” Hermione stepped away from Harry to look out the window overlooking the garden.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“It’s more than that Harry.  Over the past month I’ve been thinking about...me.  Who is Hermione Jean Granger?” She turned to face Harry with a slight smile to her lips.  “A bookworm? A sidekick? An insufferable know-it-all?” Harry returned her smile. “I think the only thing I ever had that was truly mine is probably...Crookshanks.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Harry laughed, “Yes, he’s truly yours since you’re the only one he allows to touch him.”  Hermione grinned at his remark and returned her gaze out the window. Harry walked towards her, leaning against the wall near her.  “I hope you’re aware that there is more to you than books, bossiness, and having all the answers.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I don’t believe I mentioned being bossy,” replied Hermione with a roll of her eyes.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“You are. And that’s only one of the things that make you brilliant.  You’re courageous, strong, smart, and beauti-”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Don’t Harry.  I don’t need you to list off attributes to make me feel better.  I was just pointing out that it’s time to do things for myself. Right now, that’s finding a way to restore my parent’s memories and returning to Hogwarts to complete my final year.  When that’s done I’m determined to go do whatever it is I see fit. The war took so much away from us. I’m not going to take our struggles and survival for granted. AND I’m not going to join the Auror Academy.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“You’ll always have my support and I know that being an Auror was something you didn’t want.  I also know that whatever you do, you’ll be excellent at it.” Without thinking Harry reached over to </span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>twirl</span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span> a piece of Hermione’s hair around his finger while looking into her chocolate eyes.  “I don’t expect any less from a person who jumped on a fucking dragon’s back to escape Gringotts, after a robbery, not to mention who hates flying.”  They both started to laugh, then stared at each other.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I’ll miss you, Harry,” whispered Hermione, as her hand moved over Harry’s.  He wasn’t sure what it was, but he leaned in slowly, Hermione meeting him halfway.  Then there was a knock on the bedroom door. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Come in!” shouted Harry as he sat up straight and removed his hand from Hermione’s hair.  Ginny walked into the room with a smirk on her face.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Hello, I wanted to see if you were alright, Hermione?” asked Ginny.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I’m fine Gin, thanks for asking.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“That’s good.  We all saw Ron storm out like a mad man.  Are you now convinced my brother is a total git?” Hermione smiled at the redhead.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Thanks again Gin.” Ginny gave the older witch a nod, then turned to Harry.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Harry, I was wondering if you would like to take a walk with me by the pond?  It’s a cool night, might be nice to get outside for a bit.” asked Ginny.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Um...thanks Ginny, that does sound nice...but...I would like to spend a bit more time with Hermione right now.  She leaves tomorrow morning, so I won’t be able to see her for the rest of the summer.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Oh...alright. I under-”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“It’s fine Harry.  Go enjoy a walk with Gin.  I still have a few more things to pack, so we’ll catch up before bed...or in the morning,” replied Hermione as she walked to the open door, “See you guys later.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Ginny grabbed Harry’s hand leading him down the stairs and out the front door.  He </span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>accidentally</span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span> tuned out the younger witch while thoughts of Hermione went through his head.  He wanted to kiss her. He knew their time alone on the hunt strengthened their friendship and apparently something else in him.  But she was going to kiss him back! She could have been caught up in the moment. Yeah, that’s it. Just caught up in the moment.  It didn’t mean anything. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Harry!” he turned around to face an annoyed witch with her arms crossed over her chest. “Are you paying any attention to what I was saying?”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I’m sorry Ginny.  I can’t seem to focus on anything right now,” he replied. Ginny dropped her arms and walked closer to him. She placed her hand on his cheek.  Harry stepped slightly out of the way and took her hand in his.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Ginny, ” he shook his head.  I’m not the same person I was in 6th year.  Hell, I’m not the same person I was last month.”  Harry looked up to see tears forming in the youngest Weasley's eyes, “I’m so sorry.”  Ginny took a deep breath and nodded her head in agreement. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I know a lot has happened between that time and now.  I’m not daft Harry. I lived it too.” </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I do care about you Ginny.  Just not in the way you want me to.”  Ginny laughed. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Look, I might be crying, but...for some reason, I don’t feel as bad as I thought I would.” </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Is that good?,”  Harry put his arm around Ginny to give her a squeeze. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Ginny moved away from him and held up her hands. “You still technically dumped me, Harry.  So, please keep your arms to yourself...prick.” Harry couldn’t hold the laugh that escaped his lips. “I’m going to see if Hermione needs any help.” </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“I’ll be there in a bit.” Ginny nodded and walked back to the house. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Harry sat on the ground looking at the still black water of the pond.  He didn’t even know what time it was, but when he stood to walk back to the house, there were no lights shining through the many windows.  He went up the stairs quietly only stopping for a minute by Ginny’s bedroom. It was silent and no light was coming from underneath the door.  He wished he could’ve had more time with Hermione, but it seems the chance had passed. As he walked into his room, he removed his glasses placing them next to the spot he kept his wand.  He removed the rest of his clothing then crawled under the sheets to relax within soft material pressed against his skin. As he started to drift away he felt movement against his back and realized that someone had joined him in the bed.  </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>“Hey!”  The sound of the familiar voice snapped Harry back to his current place and time.  He turned around to see Ron walking up to him in his slightly messy Auror uniform. </p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey!” he said. I thought you were stuck on reports today?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I am, but I received an owl from mum asking if you were staying over.  She’s been setting up the Burrow all day to welcome back the girls. She wanted to make sure she had enough rooms ready.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m not sure what Hermione’s plans are after the party.  We haven’t talked in a while.” His own words causing him to feel sad.  “I’m not sure where she is staying. I know her parents are not back from Australia yet and I would hate to leave her alone.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“She can take care of herself Harry.  Besides, not sure why she wouldn’t want to stay at the Burrow.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Really?” Harry asked his redheaded friend with a raised eyebrow.  A Howler on Boxing Day doesn’t ring a bell?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve changed since than Harry.  I’m aware that I overreacted that she chose to stay at school.  I am perfectly capable of controlling my temper now,” said Ron as he squared his shoulders.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right.” Harry laughed. Ron couldn’t help but laugh as well.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oi! I’m still working on it and besides I wrote her again apologized and she forgave me,” he said as he looked at the clock in the station. “I’ve got to go.  I only had an hour for lunch and I gotta get back to the office.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You’ve just got here!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I was hungry, Harry.  I stopped at the Leaky before I came down here,” replied Ron.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You can’t wait a bit longer to greet your sister and best friend?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Naw, that’s why your here mate,“ he said, as he patted Harry on his back.  “See you tonight at the party.” Harry watched as his other best friend walked away.  It had been over a year since he had last seen Hermione. Over a year.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
  <span>The buzz from the crowd alerted him that something was happening.  He could already see the dense steam from the train coming near. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>She’s home</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” he thought to himself.</span>
