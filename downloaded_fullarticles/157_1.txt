    <p>Hermione Granger loved the cold. Winter always seemed to give her a better sense of clarity. The stinging sensation that vibrated through her fingertips, combined with air biting at her nose and cheeks, kept her mind crisp and clear, similar to the sensation of splashing cold water on one’s face in the morning. In the winter months, Hermione had always felt wide awake.</p><p>Despite receiving the invitation from her parents to go home for Christmas (which had admittedly sounded lovelier by the day in the weeks leading up to holiday break, with Ron’s glaringly obnoxious attitude and the pair’s now nearly incessant bickering), but eventually opted to spend it at The Burrow. After all, Harry’s meetings with Dumbledore had begun to grow more trying over the past month, and Hermione figured he needed her support just as much as he needed Ron’s, if not more. Ron’s way of helping was to distract at all costs, and Hermione felt that that was simply not a viable option anymore.</p><p>She had, however, promised herself that she would tread lightly during the holidays. As much as she was an advocate for facing things head on, Hermione knew that a short break would likely do Harry some good. After all, not everyone’s head was as easily cleared as hers; or so she liked to think. Hermione’s thoughts had been much more clouded these days. Every time she felt she finally had everything sorted out, some new development would fly up and smack her in the face. It was absolutely infuriating, especially for someone who constantly tries to keep all her ducks in a row; at the moment, it felt as if Hermione’s ducks had been scattered chaotically across the massive expanse of the Hogwarts grounds.</p><p>This explains why, at approximately four in the morning, Hermione Granger was lying atop a camp bed which had been arranged for her in the corner of Ginny Weasley’s bedroom, completely and utterly awake. She rolled over to her right side, coming face to face with Crookshanks, who was curled up on top of a small, circular area rug that Mrs. Weasley had likely woven herself. His tail flicked lightly in recognition of her gaze, but his eyes remained shut. He would probably be back to sleep in the next minute, and Hermione studied his squished face enviously. What she wouldn’t give for a good night’s sleep…</p><p>She glanced up at Ginny, whose bed was supported by a poorly assembled, wobbly wooden frame. The legs looked as if they might fall to pieces if Ginny dared to grow any taller, but, despite this, she was sleeping deeply, her arm draped awkwardly across her face and her mouth slightly open. Being Hermione’s best female friend, Ginny should be just the person for her to unload all of her troubles on; if only those troubles didn’t have so much to do with her brother.</p><p>Hermione sat up, hooking her arms around her knees and pulling them into her chest. Breathing deeply, she closed her eyes and tried to lower her thoughts to a more acceptable volume. After about five unsuccessful minutes, she angrily brushed her hair out of her face and kicked off her blanket. Crookshanks blinked his eyes open agitatedly.</p><p>“I’m going for a walk, alright?” She whispered. He was a very intelligent cat, being half-Kneazle, so Hermione didn’t feel silly talking to him as if he were a person. His ginger ears twitched in response, and she knew that, as soon as she slipped out the door, he would take up new residence on her bed.</p><p>Although The Burrow was a building teeming with character, Hermione felt that, had she done it herself, she would have been a bit more careful with the walls. The wind often whistled through the cracks, filling certain rooms with a chill that was less than ideal for sleeping during the dead of winter. As much as Hermione enjoyed a frosty wind, she enjoyed not freezing to death in her sleep a bit more.</p><p>She crept down the stairs, longing for the embrace of a warm blanket, taking care to avoid spots which had a tendency to creak. There was a little reading nook directly underneath Ginny’s room that Hermione had taken to curling up in since they arrived on Sunday, specifically during nights like this when she couldn’t get her brain to shut off. The Weasleys had a fascinating collection of books from the wizarding world, many of which she had yet to read, and Mr. Weasley even had some of her favorite novels authored by muggles; Hermione usually only cracked those ones open when she needed an extra bit of comfort. Tonight, however, she continued on down the stairs and past the nook altogether, until she reached the main floor. However, the sound of a crackling fire stopped her in her tracks. </p><p>Her heart rapidly began to pound against her chest. With ten people staying in the house, she decided it was unlikely an intruder had set the fire on the hearth, but her hand still hovered instinctively over the wand she had slid into the pocket of her dressing gown before sneaking out. Hermione’s nerves remained, though. She had come down here to be alone, and someone’s presence was going to make that impossible. She made a quick decision and turned around gingerly, stepping her foot up onto the next stair. The plush blue armchair in the reading nook, she decided, was sounding much better now. And while this would have been perfect, Hermione had not watched where she was walking in all her anxiousness, and the wooden plank let out a loud <em> creeeeak </em>when she stepped up onto it.</p><p>“Hello??” A voice whispered from around the bend. At hearing the voice, all the nerves flooded out of Hermione’s body, and she turned back around, delicately taking the last few steps down to the sitting room where she was faced with none other than Harry Potter.</p><p>Harry was perched on the sofa that was positioned directly underneath the window, a bit of moonlight glinting off of the frames of his glasses. He looked entirely relieved to discover that it was her, and Hermione assumed he must’ve thought that she was Mrs. Weasley. Harry twiddled his wand between his fingers anxiously, and it was clear he had been deep in thought before she interrupted.</p><p>“Sorry, I can…” Hermione’s voice trailed off awkwardly gesturing weakly to the stairs.</p><p>“No, no, really, it’s fine. I could probably use the company anyway.” </p><p>She took a seat on the couch perpendicular to Harry’s, pulling the knit blanket off its arm and cuddling up underneath. In taking a moment to study his face, Hermione realized Harry looked exactly how her insides felt. The two seemed to be consistently on the same page nowadays and had grown closer this past term than ever before, Harry being the only person Hermione had truly confided in. </p><p>They sat in silence for a few minutes, before she finally piped up. “Couldn’t sleep?”</p><p>Harry sighed and studied a knick in the wood of his wand. “Something like that, yeah.” A few more awkward seconds passed before he glanced over at her, somewhat knowingly. “Is it…?”</p><p>“Amongst other things.”</p><p>“Ahh…”</p><p>More silence. The two of them were generally comfortable speaking freely about their thoughts, but for some reason it felt almost forbidden to mention any of it within the confines of The Burrow.</p><p>“He’s going to come to his senses at some point, you know.”</p><p>At that, Hermione snorted, rolling her eyes all the way to the ceiling. “That’s rich. I’ll be Minister of Magic by the time that happens. But let’s hope I’m not idiotic enough to still be waiting around by then.”</p><p>A smile crept onto Harry’s face, and, after a second, the two were laughing, hands over their mouths to keep from waking the others. Hermione buried her face in her hands, giggling and feeling utterly ridiculous. She had never spent so much time thinking about a boy, especially when their time was growing more valuable every second that the Second Wizarding War raged on. Looking at her personal issues from this angle did set things in perspective a bit.</p><p>When she looked up, however, she saw that Harry did not seem to feel the same. The smile had slowly faded from his face, and he appeared to again be utterly consumed by his thoughts.</p><p>“And you?” She asked, carefully examining his expression.</p><p>It was as if she had shaken him awake from a deep sleep. Harry jumped slightly, eyes open wide. “What? Oh… well… a little bit of everything. If I’m being honest.”</p><p>After Hermione had confided in Harry about her feelings, she had carefully pried into his, asking him about Ginny. Being naturally quite observant, she had managed to discover that Harry was harboring some strong feelings for her, a fact that no one else, especially Ginny herself, seemed to recognize. On Hogsmeade weekends, the trio was often greeted at The Three Broomsticks with a clear view of her and her boyfriend, Dean Thomas, curled up at a tiny corner table, snogging. Ron, of course, had to make a gigantic fuss over this to Hermione and Harry, feeling so disgruntled that he often missed it as Harry grew quiet, all the color draining from his face. </p><p>Hermione imagined that that was how she looked watching Ron with Lavender.</p><p>Lavender Brown was an absolutely insufferable sixth year who also happened to be in Gryffindor, much to Hermione’s displeasure. She had suffered the misfortune of sharing a dormitory with her since they both arrived at Hogwarts five years ago, and this year had been worse than any year prior. Hermione had always disliked Lavender. Her blind fascination with divination, a subject Hermione <em> strongly </em> believed to be a load of old codswallop, coupled with the fact that, after Harry returned to Hogwarts with the both the Triwizard Cup and a lifeless Cedric Diggory in his arms during their fourth year, Lavender loudly voiced her opinion that Harry was lying about Voldemort’s return. Hermione eventually lost her composure, telling Lavender to, for lack of a better phrase, keep her big fat mouth shut. There had been thick tension between the two ever since.</p><p>So one can imagine that, when Hermione witnessed Lavender grab Ron’s face in the common room after the Gryffindor quidditch team’s first win of the season, and Ron succumbed almost immediately, she was finally pushed to extremes. She no longer disliked Lavender.</p><p>She <em> loathed </em>her.</p><p>Not only that, but Hermione felt as if Ron, who went so far as to pump his fist victoriously in the air as Lavender practically sucked his face off (only egging the cheering Gryffindors on further), had committed an ultimate betrayal. As she stared at the two, her mind raced with examples of instances in which she had made her feelings for Lavender abundantly clear. <em> How could he do that with someone like her? Didn’t he think about the fact that it might bother me? And to think, I used a bloody confundus charm to help him get on the quidditch team in the first place…  </em></p><p>But it was in that moment that Hermione realized she had passed the point of ‘bothered’. Her heart was deep in the pit of her stomach, and the previously explosive noise around her suddenly sounded muffled. As the heat rose to her cheeks, she turned and pushed her way through the crowd, slipping through the Fat Lady’s portrait. When she came across an empty classroom, Hermione disappeared quietly inside, on the pretense that she was simply going to practice some charms. However, she eventually realized that she needed to come to terms with her feelings instead. </p><p>So, while she half heartedly conjured up a few, admittedly impressive, canaries using the <em> avis </em>charm, Hermione cried. She cried because Ron was a complete ass. She cried because Lavender was giggly and obnoxious and awful. But, above all, Hermione cried because of the lump in her throat and the pit in her stomach and the fact that she was somehow experiencing intense feelings for Ronald Weasley.</p><p>And she hated it.</p><p>Harry discovered Hermione later, sitting down to keep her company. He did eventually answer her question about Ginny, saying, in a low voice, that seeing her with Dean “felt like this”, gesturing to Hermione’s splotchy face and wet cheeks. At that, the tears pooling in Hermione’s eyes spilled over once more, and Harry carefully wrapped his arm around her, letting her weep quietly for a while longer. Their silence was eventually interrupted by none other than Ron and Lavender, who seemed to be looking for a private room. </p><p>But Hermione didn’t want to think about that part tonight. </p><p>“We’re quite a mess, aren’t we?” Harry said suddenly, bringing Hermione back into the present. </p><p>She smiled slightly. “We certainly look it, don’t we?”</p><p>“Well, let’s hope I can pull myself together or we’ll all be dead in the next year.” Harry replied dryly. And, as much as Hermione knew he was joking, she was not so naive to think that there was not a terrible truth to his words as well. A lot was riding on him. A lot was riding on all of them.</p><p>“Hermione?”</p><p>Her eyes flickered away from the picture of Ron, Fred, and George bobbing up and down on their brooms in the backyard (it was a particularly charming picture of Ron, with his bright smile and flushed cheeks; Mrs. Weasley had taken it three summers ago, just before they all left for the Quidditch World Cup) that they had settled on and met Harry’s. </p><p>“Will you…” His gaze dropped back to his wand nervously. “Will you just let me know if she says anything about me while we’re here? Ginny, I mean. Since you’re staying with her, and all.”</p><p>“Of course, Harry.”</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>Heavy silence filled the room.</p><p>“He’s going to come to his senses, Hermione.”</p><p>She exhaled softly, and, in a very small voice, murmured, “I hope so.”</p>
