    <p align="center">Chapter 1</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="left">It was a sweltering summer evening in the south east of England. Surrey had been particularly affected, and did Harry know it. </p><p align="left">He'd been forced into working from dawn until dusk, and with it being summer, that meant going to be locked up at 10 pm and woken at 3am. This time between work was used to sleep, clean himself when allowed, and, on occasion, eat.</p><p align="left">The exhausting work with little food left harry horrendously malnourished, with visible bones and  distinct muscle in stark contrast. </p><p align="left">After another long day of working in the gardens with no magic to help, and all the flowers pruned, weeded, tidied, with fertilizer. Not to mention the grass raked, mowed, had the grass collected to be put into the wheely bin. The list went on and on of chores. </p><p align="left">By the time Harry had done the list of chores it was nearing 11pm and he had yet to eat for 3 days and the last meal he had was a slice of stale bread and warm tap water.</p><p align="left">He lay in his bare bed without even a decent pillow, stomach screaming for food and mouth a desert. </p><p align="left">It was in this moment, close to death yet again, that He decided enough was enough. </p><p align="left">Harry had been practicing for the last few years some basic wandless magic but  never something as complicated at transfiguration. In fact it had only ever worked when he was under a huge strain to succeed. Life or death. But he supposed in that moment that tat situation was indeed life or death.</p><p align="left">He fathers all his belongings, which quite frankly amounts to near nothing besides his photo album, Hedwig's cage, and the clothes on his back.</p><p align="left">He focused hard on the items hoping to shrink them. It took four goes but Harry didn't give up. </p><p align="left">'C'mon, please work,' he thought to himself and he placed his hands over the items. On the fourth go he felt the items move away from his hands. He'd been scrunching his eyes until that point. He peeked an eye open and then the other in disbelief. It had worked. Putting the items into his pocket, he strides with renewed energy towards the door. Using his hands to guide his thoughts again, he muttered Alohamora," under his breath. </p><p align="left">There was a sliding noise and Harry was able to open the door. This was one of the best days ever. </p><p align="left">Sneaking down to the cupboard under the stairs he once more put his hands up. It opened easier than the previous door. He collected his trunk, shrank it, put it in his pocket and left. </p><p align="center">...</p><p align="left">The walk to train station was long but it gave Harry time to think. That was the last time he would go back to his relatives. If Dumbledoor sent him back he'd set their house on fire. Along with Dumbledoor's wardrobe. </p><p align="left">Harry had decided that it was time for independence from Dumbles, the Order, and whoever told him what to do. </p><p align="left">By the time he got there it was the last train, so Lady Luck must have been watching over him that night. Lady luck had, apparently anticipated this event previously, as Harry found some money he had taken from the Dursley's over the last few months, which he had forgotten he'd put in his pocket. He counted himself lucky it hadn't fallen out of one of the holes in his jeans. </p><p align="left">Once he got to London, it occurred to Harry that he had no idea what he's doing. So he walked and walked, followed whoever looked interesting to see if they were going anywhere fun. </p><p align="left">At almost 12am he saw many signs with various colours and text like "XXX" and "Bar". These caught his eye enough to entice him towards the road. </p><p align="left">As he got further down, he saw a man dressed in black leather holding a leash to another man, wearing very little clothes. Now that looked interesting. He followed them to the club. </p><p align="left">Instead of lining up for entry, Happy placed a disillusionment charm on himself and entered past the huge security guard who looked like he could kill a man with only his pinky figure and thumb.</p><p align="left">The room was dark with many light lasers going across the ceiling. To the left was a stage with a few pedestals on either side. </p><p align="left">Opposite to that was numerous booths fitted with, you guessed it, more black leather. The main area in front of the stage had a dance floor with many people wearing varying amounts of clothes, all grinding against each other or controlling the movement of another while they are used to be ground against. </p><p align="left">Harry walked through the dance floor to see a closed off but public area with many soft cushions, settees, blankets and a water fountain. There were people in there curled up, a particular couple Harry couldn't take his eyes off. A man had wrapped a woman in a blanket and was stroking her hair while she seemed to be calming down from something, but looking at someone else there who was receiving a good rubbing of moisturiser over what appeared to be whip marks. </p><p align="left">Harry moved on upstairs to what appeared to be private rooms that were locked. In one room he heard screams that were indiscernible between cries of extacy and pain. Unable to quiet his curiosity Harry opened the door to peek I side. </p><p align="left">A man was tied spread eagle, on his belly, while another man was thrusting dildo into the man lying down, while he slapped his aresw, hard on the push in. </p><p align="left">At the sight, harry felt himself start to get hard. The receiver seemed to be so into it and turned on, that Harry wondered what it would be like to be the one giving that. Giving someone utter pleasure to the point of tears. </p><p align="left">The strapped down man was crying but had no complaints, until he breathed "I'm going to come," while trying to gain friction with a strange looking bed. </p><p align="left">"No, you will be good for me, and wait until I tell you to," the other man crooked while stroking the rising welts. He stopped moving the dildo and spoke again, "you will wait, and take what I give you. Now what is your safeword?"</p><p align="left">"Cherrypie," the tied down one whispered, shoving his face down and clutched onto the wrist holds. </p><p align="left">"The other griped firm onto the mans hip and removed the dildo to be replaced with his own cock. It wasn't the clearest to see from the placement of the bed, but he does know from the grunts and moans, and the way the other man is gripping vice-like that they're both so into it, that Harry could drop the spell and still go unnoticed. </p><p align="left">Harry had to readjust himself multiple times as he peered through the doorway, just waiting for them both to finish so he could too. </p><p align="left"> When the other man's breath became strained and hitched, Harry knew it couldn't be long.</p><p align="left">" come on, Baby, cum for me," the man ordered, and almost immediately the first man gave a shout, clearly having the strongest orgasm Harry had ever seen. The other man arched back but kept thrusting, as though hr has being sucked inside out. </p><p align="left">Heavy panting was the only sound in the room then as they both came down, and Harry decided that was the point to close the door once more. </p><p align="left">Taking a moment for him to relax, harry noticed a stain had appeared on his oversized jeans. He really must have been a randy teen to cum untouched like that. But harry knew that if he had  partner, they would need to do this with him. Seeing the man control the mam strapped down, how his hands brought him pleasure and pain, how much they enjoyed it. No, Harry would not be without. It was something that felt right. He would be one who gave that extacy to someone deserving release. </p><p align="left">Harry made a vouch to himself, then and there, to learn everything he could about what it would take to be an amazing giver.</p><p align="left"> </p>
