  <em>Aesthetics credit to the very talented MrsMast</em>
</p>
<p>Hermione woke up to an unusually bright dorm room. She saw the hard sunrays reflect on the bronze surface of her window and realised that she’d slept almost past breakfast time.</p>
<p>Generally, she was the first to get ready and arrive for breakfast and her dorm mates- Pansy, Ginny, Lavender, Tracy, Daphne were all late risers. However she had given the final touches to a Transfiguration assignment, which was due right before Christmas break, hence finishing all her courseworks for the semester with three weeks to spare. </p>
<p>As it was a Hogsmeade Saturday, the other girls were up and about their day. She got ready and grabbed her beaded bag and a thick cloak to beat the November wind before heading straight to Flourish and Botts where Luna was supposed to meet her in half an hour. It had been a while since she had read any muggle literature and she intended to spend her coursework-free time fulfilling her bucketlist of unread books. She walked quickly as she was already running late.</p>
<p>On the way to the castle gates Hermione once again marveled at the school she was studying in. She was here since six years and magic still felt so novel. Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry was one of the most renowned schools in wizarding world and Hermione was proud to be a part of it.</p>
<p>Hogwarts had one of the best libraries and magic greenhouses in the world. The headmaster, Professor Dumbledore, was a known Alchemist and magic-maestro and the only person to have had a pet phoenix in the history of magic. The professors were all the best in their field and had gained years of experience before they were hired. Moreover unlike other schools, such as Durmstrang and Beauxbeatons, Hogwarts was a co-ed school. It was divided into four houses. Wizards were sorted into Gryffindor and Slytherin houses, founded by Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin respectively whereas, witches were sorted into Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff founded by Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff.</p>
<p>Following traditional systems the dorms and classes for the witches and wizards were separate, but the library and professors were common. Hogwarts presented a gender-neutral front in interschool competitions where it always sent one male and one female participant.</p>
<p>She reached Hogsmeade and found it unusually loud with chatter. There were girls in many small groups talking excitedly to each other. Assuming that they must be discussing the recent break-up between Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley, she headed towards her favorite bookstore and immediately started browsing. She was almost done when she spotted Luna and her boyfriend Neville on the entrance of the shop.</p>
<p>Luna and Hermione initially became acquaintances due to their housemate’s mutual dislike for them. However, the reasons for the said dislike stemmed from different roots. Hermione was considered a muggleborn know-it-all and altogether too nerdy-smart to hang out with, while Luna on the other hand was just too weird. This did work out in favor of the two witches, as they could not have found better friends in each other.</p>
<p>Neville was Luna’s boyfriend and had become a friend of Hermione over a period of time. Initially Hermione was wary of him, as no one really paid Luna, her very smart but somewhat weird friend, any attention. However after seeing his genuine infatuation and fierce protectiveness towards her friend she couldn’t deny that he was indeed a very decent guy.</p>
<p>Hermione went over to them with the intention to join them for the remaining hours of their Hogsmeade visit.</p>
<p>Seeing her calm facade Luna asked, “So you haven’t read the Prophet today Hermione?”</p>
<p>“No I haven’t” she said, now suspecting that to be the reason for the unusual bustle around Hogsmeade today.</p>
<p>Neville removed a copy from his satchel and handed it over.</p>
<p>Hermione was faced with the moving picture of Draco Malfoy looking back at her with his handsome features and the most charming smile she had seen on him. She was struck with the image of her long-time crush, which was capturing about one forth of the front page, for a few seconds before she blinked and read the article accompanying it.</p>

  <strong>‘Looking for an eligible bachelorette for the Malfoy heir’</strong>
</p>
<p><strong> </strong> <em>‘On a very surprising note, one of the most reputed members of the Sacred twenty-eight families of Great Britain –The Malfoys recently revealed a centuries old blood curse in their lineage. </em> <em> </em></p>
<p>
  <em>According to the ex-chairman of Malfoy Inc. Mr. Abraxas Malfoy, the curse forces the Malfoy heir to get married by the age of eighteen and conceive the next heir by the age of twenty-five. By disobeying the demands of the curse, the Malfoys would loose all their wealth.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Lucius Malfoy further explained the Prophet that the curse was placed by one of the Malfoy ancestors when their one and only son refused to get married and have children and the old couple decided to give birth to another child in order to carry on the Malfoy line, causing them a lot of embarrassment.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“About nine decades ago one of my ancestors had decided not to engage in the fear of the curse” said Mr. Malfoy, “On his 18<sup>th</sup> bday, his father got an urgent floo call from the goblins saying that their gold was rapidly disappearing from their Gringott vaults. He had to urgently contact his childhood sweetheart and her parents to arrange a wedding that evening. A portion of the manor had already turned to dust by the time the ceremony was conducted, and no one has been able to rebuild it till date”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Draco Malfoy, one of the most eligible bachelors of Europe according to the recent poll by “Witch Weekly”, is turning eighteen next June and is yet blissfully single. The Malfoys have therefore welcomed any and all witches between the age of seventeen and eighteen who would be interested to marry the Malfoy heir (regardless of their blood status) to engage in a small contest organised to determine the next Lady of the Manor.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>“There is no time to go looking for a bride” said Mrs. Narcissa Malfoy, the current Lady of the house, “We were hoping Draco would find someone he likes by the age of seventeen, just like all his grandfathers, but he has been engaged otherwise” Draco is the Seeker and Captain for his school quidditch team and is also one of the toppers of his batch at Hogwarts in academics. He has also been learning the ropes of business in the meanwhile and will join his father full time next June “We want him to have a real chance at finding someone he can love and a good daughter-in-law for the Manor at the same time. We’re organizing this contest now so that there is enough time to make preparations for the wedding and Draco can prepare for his NEWTS peacefully”</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Although the concept of conducting contests to find bride/grooms is archaic, the Ministry has allowed it this one time due to the nature of the Malfoy curse. In order to participate the girls will have to fill a form, which is a supplement to this edition of the paper. This form is also the first round of the contest and is made to ensure that any person who goes further has a good compatibility with Draco. The form will have to be owled by tomorrow (Sunday) 9pm. All further details regarding the contest are attached with the form. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>It is surprising how the Malfoys have hidden this curse since almost two centuries. However seeing that the young Malfoy heir has about 3 generations of grandparents alive does go a long way to show…</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>Hermione stopped reading and looked up to find her friends<strong> </strong></p>
<p>“This would be social suicide guys. Moreover, he would never take me for his bride”</p>
<p>“You don’t know that!” Neville exclaimed, “He doesn’t want to reject a girl based on her blood status or something stupid like that. He wants to find someone he can feel connected with. That’s the whole point of keeping the first stage anonymous. Look at the form, you don’t have to provide your name, picture or blood status”</p>
<p>Hermione resisted the urge to flip the pages to check it for herself. <em>If he dint select her nobody would know that she even applied</em></p>
<p>Neville continued, “He has to spend his life bonded to this person. He’s looking for someone who’ll love him for him Hermione, not someone who’s behind his money, fame and status. By participating you’re giving the both of you a reasonable chance for a good future. You are kind, clever and pretty and you can hold an intelligent conversation. I personally can’t think of someone better than you for him” </p>
<p>Hermione looked over at him and again felt the surge of affection for her friend who was almost like her brother now. He knew about her obsession with his friend since ages and had kept it a secret on her request. She knew he was much more closer to Draco than he was to her, and his opinion therefore mattered a lot to her.</p>
<p>“Give yourself this chance Hermione” Luna finally said “You’ve read fairy-tales, haven’t you? Cinderella, Belle, Snow White, everyone had to go through hell before they got their Prince Charmings. You have to fight to get him.”</p>
<p>“I will send the form”</p>
