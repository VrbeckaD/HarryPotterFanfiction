    <u>Chapter one</u>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Harry now felt comfortable enough to look at himself in the mirror without flinching away or being disgusted by what he saw in said mirror. Something that if Harry was being honestly with himself, he hadn't been able to do for a while now.</p>
<p>The reason he was finally able to do this now of all times, was mainly because he had, after what seemed like ages, managed to find a way to make it so that looking at his reflections wasn’t such a bad thing. At least not in his mind it wasn't.</p>
<p>Seeing as the whole reason he was able to look at his reflection without being revolted by it, was he had been able to make it so that he was no longer looking at what both Hermione and Ron had taken to calling a freak.</p>
<p>A freak, which happened to be what Harry's true appearance looked like according to them. Something Harry himself couldn’t help but agree with, seeing as no one else seemed to contradict what the two were calling him. Hell, it was a comment they called him now whenever they managed to see him.</p>
<p>In fact, it was a comment that they had started to make at him, not long after Harry had turned seventeen. Truthfully, they had started calling him that and other derogatory names the very second they had found out about his magical inheritance, or to be more specific his magical creature inheritance. Something that had happened not long after he had finished Voldemort once and for all.</p>
<p>Speaking of said magical inheritance, it had come on him completely unexpectedly and had literally torn through him once he had freed himself form the blocks as well as draining effects the horcrux that he had in him. By destroyed said horcrux once and for all.</p>
<p> However, it seemed the sudden removal of the soul piece within his scar had caused his inheritance to come earlier than anyone had expected it to. Which was another thing he was mocked on, saying the reason it had happened so earlier was because the sheer lack of control Harry had over his magic.</p>
<p>To hide these changes and hid the reason why his so-called friends had taken to calling him a freak, or at least one of the main reasons why they had become so condescending towards him, Harry decided to go with a more mundane way of hiding himself.</p>
<p>Seeing as any magical way Harry had tried hide himself with, or at least so far, was either banished away by his own magic or fade away much to quickly for Harry's liking. As it seemed despite how Harry himself might feel his own magic didn't like to be used to hide who he was. Nor did it seem to be ashamed in the least bit by what he had become.</p>
<p>Something that Harry had been confused about as his magic had never reacted the opposite of how he felt like before; leaving himself feeling slightly betrayed by his own magic. But at the same time Harry knew that because of how his magic was feeling there wasn’t much he could do when it came to magic to hide his appearance.</p>
<p>Because of this, what Harry had done was used cloth bandages, ones that were usually used in bandaging wounds our protecting a person’s hand during harsher training methods and covered as much as his skin as he possible could. Which by the time he had finished had ended up leaving only his eyes, and his now midback length hair free from said bandages.</p>
<p>And seeing as the bandages in question didn’t use any magic, his magic couldn't get rid of them. Making it so Harry could hide what he looked like once and for all. Made it so his freakish reflection wasn’t what he saw whenever Harry caught sight of his own reflection.</p>
<p>Then on top of these bandages, as even with them Harry didn’t feel like it was enough, Harry had also out on a rather heavy black hooded cloak. One that if he wanted it to, could be button completely shut; covering every inch of him when this did happen.</p>
<p> When it came to cover his eyes, the only thing the cloak in question really couldn’t cover and instead seem to be enhanced, Harry had gotten a pair of black wrap-around sunglasses; which her wore whenever he dated take even a step outside. Mostly to hide what Harry felt now were on of the most freakish parts of him; at least according to Ron his eyes where.</p>
<p>Thankfully after his magical inheritance, which Harry hadn't quite figure out what had happened yet or what exactly he had turned into for that matter, he no longer needed the glasses he had worn most of his life. Which he guessed counted as a plus, even if the changes in his eyes made them seem even brighter and eerier than they had ever been before. Not to mention made it that much harder to compare them to his mother's warm leaf green eyes; like they had been before.</p>
<p>At the moment, though Harry was outside, covered to the max and had people pretty much running to the other side of the road to avoid him. Some of the actually screaming in fear once they caught a glimpse of him as they did so.  Not that anyone knew just who it was they were running from, as Harry hadn’t been wearing his newest disguise for long.</p>
<p>Not that Harry actually minded their reactions to his knew look; or the fact they were currently running away from him because of said looks. In fact, Harry found himself not minding in the least bit as he felt it was better to be alone then to be swarmed like he had been before.</p>
<p> Because when it came to be being alone, or even feared, in Harry’s mind it meant that there was a less chance of being betrayed, and much less chance of even being touched. Something which worked out well for Harry seeing as he had recently developed an extreme touch phobia. Which when in the wizarding world often acted up frequently seeing as despite the fact he had repeatedly told, and even published, the fact he wanted to be left alone it never happened. Sometimes not even when he was dressed as he now started to call his mummy self; at least not those that figured out who he was despite his disguise.</p>
<p>This touch Phobia was something that had begun, as well as gotten worse, after Harry had spent three months in the Dark lord's tender love and care. Only to have to free himself after nearly bleeding to death several different times.  Having done so once he realized that no, no one was going to come save him from the situation he was in; despite the fact they knew where he was either. It seems in the wizarding worlds eyes he was a hero and should free himself from the situation he had been in.</p>
<p>After that, and after the Dark Lord who had kept him prisoner in the first place was finally dead, it seemed that said phobia had only worsened. Especially as after the war when people wouldn't stop touching him or in the worst-case senior attempting to drug him and force him into different contracts, such as a marriage contract.</p>
<p>Which to Harry's horror, as well as utter disgust, had happened several different times; that while he escaped from still caused some damage to him mentally. And really drilled into Harry’s head that a lot of people were really willing to do anything as long as they could have Harry under their control.  Or at least get the power he now wielded under their thumbs. Even if the attempts had gone done quite a bit as not everyone knew the disguise he know wore.</p>
<p> However, before these attempts were something that happened nearly every day, at least they did until he learned how to best avoid them. And these power grabs were something that wasn’t helped in the least bit by the fact that Harry was currently the head, and therefor lord, of four different houses; even if one was the right of conquest.</p>
<p>One such power grab, as well as attempting a drugging or potioning into submission, had been done by Ginny Weasley. Who, along with her family, really didn't take well to the fact Harry didn't get back together with her once the war was over.</p>
<p>Despite making no such promises and breaking ties with her once he caught her cheating on him after only a week of actually being together as a couple. And despite the fact combined with Hermione, her brother Ron was constantly spitting on his name and all but attacking him whenever he caught sight of Harry.</p>
<p>The reason Harry was outside at the moment, instead of holed away like he’d usually was during this time of day, was because for the last couple of months, unknown to the other wizards and witches around him, Harry had been traveling to Gringotts to find out more about his family.</p>
<p>Something he had been doing for a little over four months know; which was just a month shorter than when he had first started wearing his bandages and cloak. Not to mention, taking to being out mainly at either late at night or very early in the morning to avoid most people altogether; something unfortunately for Harry some of the wizarding world was starting to catch on to. And at the same time was unable to do at the moment as the information he wanted was only available now instead of later.</p>
<p>It was because of this research, and the fact Harry was incredible stubborn when it came to doing things, he felt was right, Harry was able to find out that he had more family then the Dursley's, Family, which the Headmaster had taken special care to hidden it from everyone else, and especially from Harry. Because if Harry had gone with his other side of family then the headmaster plans would have put into serious risk; or would have fallen apart before they could have even begun.</p>
<p>Especially because this family in question lived in Japan, and as Harry had found out after communicating with them for a while they were extremely strong spirited, kind, rich and wouldn't put up with any of the thigs Dumbledore had made Harry go through. Or at least the ones he had been able to get in contact sure as hell were like that.</p>
<p>Which in turn had immediately made Dumbledore make sure that in no way could Harry be allowed to know about them. Not wanting Harry to turn out the same way they all were, instead of the more beaten down person he had first arrived in the wizarding world as. Because Harry knew for sure if he had been raised by anyone else, especially the other side of his family, then there was no way he wouldn’t have been anything but independent.</p>
<p>To best ensure that he wasn’t, and that he was just like how the headmaster wanted him to become, Dumbledore made sure that Harry's Aunt Petunia would never think of letting the others know about Harry or tell Harry about them in turn. Knowing that if Harry knew about them earlier he would had definitely done everything in his power to make sure he went to them instead of the Dursley. Something that if they could, the Dursley’s would be all to happy to have happen as well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this was something the headmaster had made utterly sure was going to happen, through a combination of potions, spells and playing at the Dursley's greed. Greed that was paid by Harry's vaults themselves. Which in turn had meant until Harry had managed to get in charge of said vaults he had literally been paying for his own imprisonment. For all the torment he had been put through by those he had been forced to call family. And hadn’t that left a really bitter taste in his mouth when he had first found out.</p>
<p>However, seeing as Harry had come of age, and that the headmaster had died, there wasn’t anything that could keep Harry from knowing about the other side of his mother's family; not when Harry had the goblins on his side at least. And the very second Harry had found out about them, he had sent a letter out to them as a feeler of sorts. Hoping against all odds that they would want to be family as much as Harry desperately needed someone to call his family.</p>
<p>It was a feeler that much to Harry's joy, even if he didn't show it for fear of anyone else finding out about it, got immediate reactions. A reaction that ended up starting a nearly daily letter exchange; albeit a hidden one. Before moving to phone calls, from the phone Harry had personally purchased from a Japan magical store, just for that occasion.</p>
<p>In fact, over the course of the last four months Harry had gotten closer to the other side of his family. More so then he had allowed himself to get to anyone else before. Even those he had fought and had actually temporarily died for during the war.</p>
<p> Even more so now, after the war and those he had fought for, had thought had cared for him as he did them, had pretty much either all turned their back on him, or if not, that had died during said war. Leaving his since of trust, and his believe in the fact he could be loved, to be utterly ruined by said reactions.</p>
<p>It was because of this that Harry had planned to do what he was currently doing in the first place. Well, because of that as well as some other information he had recently found out from the house elves he had employed to keep him informed about what was going on.</p>
<p>After all he had been forced to learn, from the war and during his childhood, that information, or a sudden lack of information, could be really deadly. Information was worth more the gold when it came to survive in Harry’s mind. After all it was a certain lack of information that had ended up with him being captured and tortured for several months back then.</p>
<p>Which was why, as well as how, Harry had been able to find out that the Ministry was planning on doing one of two things; both of which Harry wanted nothing to do with. And was going out of his way to avoid happening to him, while keeping an ear out from anything else his house elves may tell him.</p>
<p> One they were planning on setting up a sort of marriage law that would require any British magical to marry someone of the ministry’s choice. Siting the deaths in the war and the now lack of magical blood in England being the two main cause of why they wanted to do so.</p>
<p>Or if not that, or perhaps on top of that really, they were also planning on trying to trap Harry himself in a contract that would do little more than to make Harry either a weapon or at worse a play thing for whoever was in charge of the Ministry. All in what the Ministry felt was legal, which considering the laws and how lopsided they could be really didn’t say much in Harry’s favor for said laws.</p>
<p>So, upon hearing about just what was planned for him, Harry was rather delighted, and very grateful, to go along with the plan his Aunt. Who had made said plan after Harry informed her what exactly was going on. And whom had been the main person Harry had been in contact with when it concerns the contact he had with his most recent family members.</p>
<p>A plan that, while there were parts Harry didn't quite want to deal with and pretty much was going to do his best to ignore until he no longer could. Was something he could agree with going through. Especially as he made it, so he wasn’t tied up with the plans the Ministry now seemed to have for him.</p>
<p>What this plan was, was that his Aunt wanted him to go to Japan and live with her. Now if that was it Harry would be quite happy to go along with the plan. But on top of that his Aunt wanted him to live with another four teenage boys who were living there, all of which were around his age, and all of which had been instructed to turn him into a true-blue gentleman.</p>
<p>Which when Harry considered just what his aunt's version of a gentleman was, he wanted nothing to do with it. Not that his aunt had a bad version of what a gentleman was, it was just he was rather happy in his bandages and cloaks. Even if other people often mistook him for a mummy or demonic wrath of some sort when he went out of the wizarding world. Hell, since it made others leave him along he preferred it that way.</p>
<p>But in the end the longing to see family that seemed to actual give a damn about him, not to mention the need to escape from the Ministries plans, and the fact he was promised citizenship in japan made Harry go along with the plans his new aunt had made for him.</p>
<p>Even if he wasn't planning on letting the group in boys in question turn him into a gentleman. Nor was he planning on letting anyone else change him from what he was now, as he had forced himself to change too many times before in the past to let it happen again. Something Harry was sure his aunt would understand, or at the very least find very amusing to watching the struggle. He knew he would.</p>
<p>On top of that, and as an added incentive, Harry had found out if he did go along with the plan, he would also get to see another member of his family while he was at it. His cousin, whom Harry had found out would also be along with their aunt's plan or at the very least be in a similar situation that he would be in himself. Only with he four trying to turn her into a lady instead of a gentleman like Harry was.</p>
<p>A cousin, whom from what Harry had found out about her, though said aunt, needed help like Harry himself did. Though this cousin in question was female and if Harry read between the lines correct was rather similar to Harry himself when it came to personality. At least similar to Harry in his most recent personality turn.</p>
<p>Her name was apparently Sunako, and Harry found himself rather eager to meet her, if only so the both of them could screw with all the other’s heads; something he felt she would agree with once she got to know him a bit. After all Harry had never dared comment about getting out of the war he was in, not to mention the utterly hell his life had been like growing up, unscathed after all. He did find humor in some of the darker humor his cousin was said to enjoy as well. Even if it may not be so enjoyable to the others that was going to share a home with them.</p>
<p>Seeing as even Voldemort had been disturbed by some of the thoughts he had found in Harry's head when he ventured into it; well at least before Harry had destroyed him once and for all. After all, having some Hellfire on hand sure helped when it came to destroying someone spirit. Too bad, too few people could actual use it or the war would have been over a lot sooner than it had been. But in the end Harry had been able to do just that. Now it was time for him to get away from the war and to his own freedom.</p>
<p>Though to do this first Harry had to make is so no one in the British wizarding world knew just what he was going to do, or where he was going for that matter. Which was why Harry had left at the crack of dawn earlier today. Not to mention it was around then he had decided that he needed to go to Gringotts. Where he had quickly proceeded to lock down his bank account from anyone getting into it; at least for the time being.</p>
<p>Not to mention why Harry had decided to carry everything he owned on him in a shrunken trunk; hidden beneath the folds of his cloak. A trunk that carried no only, all the books he owned, his clothes, tons of fresh bandages, and his potion kit.</p>
<p>But also had things like all of his weapons, which he had trained to use before, during and after the war. On top of this there was also the carving tools and the paint he had for his wooden carving hobby; something which Harry had taken up in second year.</p>
<p>Wood carving was something he had found out through Hagrid and found to be a very soothing hobby. A hobby which seemed to freak out a lot of the people who got a good look at his works; more so at his most recent carvings then anything else. Though why a wood carving of a thestral, or an attack werewolf would scare someone Harry really didn't see. He, himself found them to be life like and utterly beautiful with the feral air they seemed to give off.</p>
<p>Shaking his head as he thought about his carving and knowing he was getting off topic Harry instead went back to what he had been thinking about before; his latest trip to Grinngotts. As Harry knew when it came down to it, since he was attempting to escape, from nearly every part of the wizarding world for that matter, he had to get his bank accounts shut down; again at least for the moment.</p>
<p>He also knew since he was attempting to do this all in secret, he couldn't take any large amount of money out before he did so. Seeing as his he would only be completely safe, and a full Japanese citizen the moment he turned eighteen. And a large amount of money, money being drawn out in a foreign country or otherwise would only draw attention to Harry from the Ministry and anyone one else that may be watching Harry. Something he could afford to do; especially after he left the country.</p>
<p>Which meant that until he was eighteen, if Harry was found anyone within the British minister and brought fully back to England, he could still fall under the laws they were attempting to make.</p>
<p>Laws that would pretty much enslave Harry, something that he wasn't willing to risk happening; even if he knew having a lot of money would make things easier for him in the long run. This meant that having an open bank account like he had, and had just temporally closed, would only make tracking him down that much easier if he suddenly used it in another country; something Harry wasn't willing to do.</p>
<p>Though it did help that no one knew that Harry had family in japan, mostly because of what the headmaster had done to keep Harry under his thumb. Nor did they know that he could easily speak Japanese or even realize that he was even remotely interested in Japan; which meant said country would be one of the last places they would look for him. As Harry knew as far as anyone knew he could only speak English and had showed no interest an any foreign countries; which meant there was a limit number of places the assumed he would be heading.</p>
<p>Which hopefully meant that, even without the amount of money on hand that he would have liked, Harry could last an entire year without the British wizarding world find him. Though considering just how many countries he could be hiding in, once the eliminated the ones they assumed he was hiding in, should take a good deal of time.</p>
<p>Something Harry hoped was further helped by the fact that the goblins had helped hid him even more than he had been. They had, in return for several different goblin made items he had previously owned, made it all but impossible to track him down through magical means; due mainly to a warded necklace he now always had on his person.</p>
<p>Which considering the fact that the magical form of tracking was what most of the wizarding world relied on to find anything meant when it came to using anything else to help find him, they would be utterly lost doing so.</p>
<p>Not to mention with the amount he paid the goblins in question, and the rewards he promised them after his eighteenth birthday, they wouldn't be willing to do much to help anyone find him. Even if by law they had to give any money transcripts he may get to the Ministry; which would be all they would do for the moment. And that would only last until he was registered completely as a citizen in another country; which would happen once he was finally eighteen.</p>
<p>However, at the moment Harry was doing what he could to make it even more difficult to track him through muggle means as well. Seeing as he knew that there were some that knew how to track though means like that, and that they would try to pull all the stops they could to find him once the realized he had escaped from whatever they had planned for him.</p>
<p>Even if it had meant spend hours after hour zigging through planes. Even if after nearly seventy-eight hours on several different planes he was now finally making his way to his aunt's house.</p>
<p>Though even as he did this Harry couldn't help but wonder how the four teens there and his cousin was going to react to him. Especially, when considering the fact that his aunt had told him both him and his cousin, whom his aunt wanted to be turned into a proper lady, was going to arrive around the same time.</p>
