    <p>Emotions running while inside the young Harry Potter, he was on the train ride to King's Cross station. Harry’s face leaned against the window with the memories of this year flashing through his mind, seeing Cedric being killed and the revival of Voldemort  was traumatic. He felt so numb, nobody understood what he went through this year and he thought at the beginning that this year was going to be somewhat peaceful but no his name had to be place in the stupid cup. From be isolated from the whole school for people thinking that he cheated, even his best mates that he cheated. He felt so lonely without his first  friends he had made without Dudley chasing them away to talk to, it was like he was back at surrey no one wanted to hangout with the “Freak”. The voice from the intercom brought Harry out of his thoughts, they had arrived at their destination. He was dreaded going back to number four, he knew he was going to be in trouble from when the Weasleys picked him up to go to the world cup. He made sure he had his shrunken trunk in his pocket with Hedwig in her cage in his arm he made his way off the train and to the muggle side of the station.When he arrived to where Uncle Vernon usually picks him up, but instead of Vernon he found a 16 year old girl with long dark red hair wearing dark skinny jeans and a black hoodie looking at her watch.Harry’s eyes widen as he realized who she was.<br/>
“Lyra !” Harry yelled as he ran to her leaving Hedwig behind to give her a hug.<br/>
“Surprise little brother, I missed you so much” Lyra said as she tighten the hug.<br/>
“I missed you too,” Harry said as they released their hold that they had on each other.<br/>
“Go grab Hedwig, I’m going to apparate us home” Lyra said as harry quickly grabbed Hedwig and went back to Lyra who put an arm around him and with a crack they were gone.</p>
