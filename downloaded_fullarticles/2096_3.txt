    <p align="justify">"The hell is MACUSA doing!", Graves all but <em> snarls </em>, throwing the double doors open as he goes down the hallway leading to the holding cells in the basement, mood getting worse by the minute.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Tina doesn't shiver at his tone, her efforts currently focused on keeping pace with the long, hurried strides of the man. It's a close one - but this is a mission. If her boss isn’t keeping silent out of sheer indignation…</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"That boy should be in the hospital. Not locked down like some sort of goddamn <em> beast </em> with the rest of the garbage!"</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Graves never, ever raises his voice outside of a battlefield, where confusion and danger makes it necessary to lead. This is a fact his Aurors know. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">It has Tina wondering about the similitudes.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“Right behind you, sir”, she mutters, and keeps her hand close to her holster. Her calm may be shaky, but her determination is anything but  - She won’t be the one to criticize Graves, and if every lock keeps replying, unfailing, at the thrum of his magic… then it’s not as if anyone would <em> dare </em> to throw him out of the Woolworth Building.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">There had been a reason she had chosen to inform the Director what had happened to Credence Barebone while he was still supposed to be in the hospital himself. The healers hadn't deemed Graves fit to go just yet.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Her status as a hero of the Subway Incident, as the press had taken to call it, hadn't really given her much leverage when it came to Credence's destiny.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Credence Barebone had been found amidst the ruins of the New Salem's church, naked and almost done for by hypothermia and blood loss; right when a team of Aurors had been there sweeping the place for further data. He had been dragged away in chains, and put into a secure cell so warded it might as well have been indestructible. A number of healers do visit to keep him alive and check on his status, he gets fed and medically assisted with a certain degree of frequency. But he is, by all means, a prisoner. MACUSA still hasn't decided what to do with him, the debate raging on fierce, and veering closer towards a swift execution every day.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Time had gotten too close to running out. Tina hadn't been about to stand for it. </p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Maybe Director Graves is still recovering himself, physically at least, but her mentor had been the only one she could trust to help. And so, she had Apparated at the Margaret Jones Hospital for Magical Injuries that morning, with a dossier thicker than an Academy textbook for Graves to pour over.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">In all honesty, it hadn't been necessary for him to read all of it before indignation at the <em> goddamned inefficiency of everyone involved </em>reached peak levels. And then, she had told him of the Barebone boy's destiny.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Graves isn't alright. She knows this. He would have thought things through better had he been his old self, would have analyzed the situation and devised a plan. His actual reaction had been so completely unexpected to her - Still limping and wandless, with his left arm in a sling, Graves had looked <em> livid </em> when he asked her to Apparate them out of the room and inside the Woolworth Building, as soon as it was safely past visiting hours.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Wide-eyed, she wouldn’t have dared to disobey him. Coming back to sneak him out, she had found him fully dressed and with his rage intact.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Is it the unfairness of the situation? Is the terrible management of it by his own people what is setting him off, the mistreatment of a victim the last straw after they <em> fucking failed </em> to notice Graves hadn't been Graves for two entire months?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Is it misplaced guilt?</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">(Is it, heavens forbid, <em> kinship </em>?)</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">They reach Credence's holding cell. The two-way mirror in the wall shows him awake, sitting on the bed. Everything inside is white, from the floors to the sheets to his scrubs. His skin is pale and sallow, pure paper with dashes of dark colors - the black of his hair and the faint red of his lips, green and purple and the bright pink of scar tissue mottling what his scarce clothing leaves visible.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The buzz of the wards can’t be actually heard. But it’s powerful enough she feels it prickling at the base of her spine, a phonograph needle grooving through a silent vinyl.</p><p align="justify"><br/>
They see him frown, turn towards the mirror. And Credence, she’s sure, she's  <em> positive </em> he can't see them, but for a moment, Tina could swear he's aware of their presence anyway. By her side Graves stands still - taking in the damage, the bruises littering that pale body. Deliverance knew everyone in Magical Security with enough of a clearance had paraded through her unconscious boss’ hospital room to do the same -  Assessing each and every visible mark two months of torture and isolation inside his own damn closet left on him, horrified. An entire department at MACUSA was, <em> is </em>soaked in guilt they don’t know what to do about.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">And the scars left <em> in </em> him...</p><p align="justify"><br/>
Just seeing the handcuffs on Credence draws a growl out of Graves. It becomes static under her skin.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"Seraphina <em> will </em> listen", he mutters between his teeth. "I'm going to take care of this."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Nobody had noticed. Director Graves didn’t do close relationships, and Grindelwald had avoided, demoted, sent away anyone who might have.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
  <em> Locked in, powerless, humiliated... </em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"You always do, Director”, she says softly.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">He breathes in and out, almost whirring. There’s a pause, and.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">"I'm coming back here tomorrow morning", Graves exhales, not quite unexpectedly. Much calmer, too. "Make sure to debrief the kid, Goldstein. And to clear the misunderstanding. The last thing I want is him thinking I'm that son of a bitch coming back to get him."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">How many people had already mistaken one for another.</p><p align="justify"><br/>
<br/>
Whichever of the possible reasons is making Graves bristle this badly-- Instinct is instinct. She never stopped being an Auror, manipulation is an ugly word, and not at all what her intent had been. She isn't sure she knows this Graves - so impulsive, emotional in ways she had never seen. Tina would've never used the word <em> unstable </em> to describe the Director before. But together they can save Credence, and that is all she had ever wanted.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Graves clenches his jaw and turns to walk away, back straight. His perfect picture of composure is ruined by his uneven steps, the almost physical strumming of his resolve. <em>So much to do.</em></p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The exact consequences of it, well. They'd have to play them by ear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
