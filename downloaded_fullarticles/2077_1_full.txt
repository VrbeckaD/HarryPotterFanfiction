      <p>Tried really hard not to title this with a prick pun. Succeeded, but I’m not really happy about it. The first chapter is in James’s POV, and the second is in Teddy’s POV, and then it switches back to James. I just sort of wanted to write something with a modern fairytale twist, so here we go! </p><p>Rated T because there’s a LOT of swearing, and some suggestive moments I guess? Not very many. But lots of swearing.</p><p>EDIT: forgot to add that James and Isolt and Gormlaith etc are real people in the HP universe! They’re on the interwebs, I didn’t make them up. I was checking to see if there was a sleeping curse already, since I made one up, and Gormlaith Gaunt’s Curse already existed, so I played around with that instead!</p>

  <p>ONE</p>
</center>THE contents of the drawer erupted in a shower of quills, old wrappers, receipts and Quidditch Match ticket stubs. James winced, watching a roll of Spellotape run under the bed; it was possible that he'd pulled on the drawer too hard. But this was an emergency, and there was no time to waste on picking everything up just yet. Dropping the jumper he was holding on top of the dresser, James began to rummage through the mess.<p>Everybody always said that Teddy was a clean, neat person that James could do with paying more attention to. The joke was on them: James was always paying attention to Teddy, and therefore he was the only one who knew about all the secret, shameful drawers and cupboards crammed full of odds and ends. Teddy was messy in private. James has always found it endearing, before, and somewhat humanising, but it was going to be his downfall today. </p><p>“Come on, come on, where the fuck are you,” James muttered to himself frantically. “I know you're in here somewhere, there's—Ha!” </p><p>His triumphant shout rang through the empty flat. James yanked a small velvet parcel out of the debris and flipped it open on top of the dresser. Three shiny needles glinted up at him from their silky pockets, along with several spools of thread.</p><p>“I knew he had one of these somewhere. Right.” Momentarily stumped, James blinked down at the sewing kit. “Okay, how do I sew?”</p><p>The room had no response, nothing in the way of helpful suggestions. </p><p>“Fuck it, I can figure it out,” James muttered. He picked up the sewing kit and the jumper beneath it, and headed for the bathroom, where he locked the door and sat on the closed toilet lid. If Teddy came back early, James didn't want to be caught trying to fix his mistake on the bed or the living room. Hell, he didn’t want to be caught at all, ever, even if he knew deep down that Teddy wouldn’t be mad at him. Hopefully, by the time Teddy got back, all the evidence would be gone, the jumper would be stitched up, and nobody would ever have to know that James had accidentally ripped something very important to Teddy. </p><p>Of course, first he had to tackle this whole sewing business. </p><p>James had never sewn anything in his life, but he had seen Grandma and Ron do it a few times. His first row of stitches were clumsy and unravelled fairly quickly. His second row was worse. He had a feeling he was ruining the jumper further just by trying to fix it, but he couldn’t risk taking it through the dirty fireplace, and there wasn't much of an option unless he wanted to—</p><p>“Ow! Shit.” James dropped the needle that had pricked him and stuck his finger in his mouth, wincing. Copper touched his tongue, that old coin taste lingering there.</p><p>Grimacing, James took his wand from behind his ear and prodded his finger, sealing the small cut with a short command. Healing spells were tricky and took a lot of effort, a lot of practice, but a lifetime of playing Quidditch and falling off brooms meant he had gotten quite good at healing small cuts and bruises. This was nothing, even if it did hurt a bit.</p><p>James glared down at the jumper in his lap. “You're not gonna win. I know I shouldn't have worn you in the first place, but you're not going to win this. Ask anyone—I don’t go down easy!”</p><p>James then prodded himself in the head with his wand, wondering if he could heal sudden bouts of insanity, or if that was the sort of thing that required more practice. </p><p>It would be so much easier if he could use magic, but the jumper was old. It had been old when Remus Lupin first wore it, so it was even older now that his son was twenty-nine. The edges were frayed and the deep forest green colour had faded to a more docile hue, but it remained thick and comfortable. That was why James had taken it that morning, while Teddy had been at work, and worn it while he made lunch in Teddy’s chilly flat. It had been the first comfortable thing his hands touched in a haze of sleep. </p><p>And now one of the sleeves was ripped cleanly down the side, courtesy of a clumsy kitchen incident—cupboard corners were deceivingly lethal—and any magic would probably do more harm than good when the material was so old and frail and important. </p><p>The clock in the hallway ticked over to four, but James didn't hear it. He was busy stitching and re-stitching, until the sleeve looked almost exactly the way it used to. The thread was a little darker than the rest of the jumper, but it was only noticeable if you were looking for it. It would do. </p><p>When Teddy opened the door to his own flat, an hour or so later, most of James’s anxiety had faded. He lay on Teddy’s sofa with a packet of crisps, doodling all over yesterday’s newspaper. Rita Skeeter, he had discovered, looked far better with devil horns and large fangs scrawled on top of her bug-like face, but that was old news to most people. </p><p>“Evening, Auror Lupin. Catch lots of bad guys in my honour?”</p><p>“Hello, person who doesn’t live here,” Teddy said, with the beginnings of a smile as he kicked the door shut. “Why’s it in your honour?” </p><p>“Rude,” James said, absently giving Kingsley a stylish top-hat. “Anyone would think I didn't brighten up your life just by existing.”</p><p>“And we can’t have that.” Teddy shed his Auror robes by the door, hanging them up—they clung to every inch of muscle and stuck to his thighs like wallpaper paste, so James was naturally sad to see them go. He did get a good look at Teddy’s thigh-holsters though, where his wand often lived. The evening was already looking up. </p><p>“You still didn’t say why it would be in your honour?” </p><p>“Maybe I just like to think of you taking down criminals in my name,” James said. “Tackling them with your massive arms and thinking of me.” </p><p>It was a hair too close to the truth for his liking, but that was often the best way to avoid being found out, and Teddy never believed it when James flirted with him anyway. </p><p>Teddy snorted, dropping a bag of takeout on James’s lap as he moved towards the kitchen. James abandoned the newspaper immediately, to sit up and clutch the bag close to his chest. He groaned, loud and exaggeratedly, as he inhaled the scent of chicken, salty rice and sweet and sour sauce. </p><p>“Please tell me you got pancake rolls!” James ripped open the bag and crowed in delight. “You did! Fuck yes. You’re my favourite Hufflepuff, you know that?”</p><p>Teddy’s laugh floated out from the kitchen, a sound that wasn’t praised enough, in James’s humble opinion. He heard Teddy moving about from room to room while he sorted through the containers in the bag. He had a flash of unease when the bedroom door opened and shut, thinking of the jumper folded carefully in the bottom drawer of the dresser, the way he’d found it. Fiddling with the bag, James waited with bated breath. </p><p>“Oi,” Teddy said, appearing in the doorway in a pair of black joggers. James lost all the breath in his body in one fell swoop. Teddy’s top half was bare, all toned muscle and fading tan lines on show. Several pale scars lined his chest from work, and there was a small, glinting moon tattooed at the top of his stomach that caught the eye. </p><p>James let himself look for three long, beautiful seconds before tearing his eyes away. </p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>Teddy smirked knowingly at him. “If you’re gonna go through my stuff, at least put it back afterwards.” He held up the roll of Spellotape and laughed when James flipped him off. “Come on, Jamie. You’re usually better at covering your tracks.”</p><p>With a wink and another laugh, he headed back into the bedroom. Hopefully, James thought, as he pried open a container of shredded beef, to put on a shirt, because otherwise James wasn’t going to be held responsible for his actions. He was going to leap and the fall was going to be quite a long way down. </p><p>He pictured kissing Teddy on this very sofa, nothing sour about it, and then banished the thought to the back of his brain when Teddy appeared with forks, a shirt, and a sweet smile just for him. His heart flipped over at the smile. </p><p>James wanted Teddy, there was no doubt about it, but Teddy didn’t see him that way, and he wasn’t going to risk it, not yet.</p><p>A friendship, after all, was not as easily mended as a jumper.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>Morning came in all its glory, birds and sunshine and whatnot. James has been sworn at all his life, called a morning person in hateful, vicious tones, and it only ever made him stronger. He was usually one to get up early and seize the day, the first to head for the Quidditch pitch and practice before the team got there, the first to fill the kitchen with the scents of breakfast or the sounds of spitting eggs and the radio. He would sing and read and practice terribly loud spells, and he would go for morning jogs or pop over to Albus’s flat and bother him into eating something healthy for breakfast—when that didn't work, he often resorted to just bothering Albus for the fun of it, which always worked.<p>But that morning, James pulled the covers over his head and groaned. He felt like he could sleep for at least a few hours more, but he didn't remember waking up in the night. He hadn’t even gone to bed late, sinking into sleep as soon as his face hit the pillows, but it felt like he’d taken a hike while unconscious. As though he’d been sleeping but not resting. </p><p>With another groan, James dragged himself reluctantly out of bed and shuffled to the bathroom. His flat was small enough, with one other bedroom that Hugo kipped in on weekends, since it was closer to Culinary School than his parents house. It was a Thursday, so Hugo wasn’t there, but James kinda wished he was. Hugo always made the best food, and he wouldn’t have said no to one of those fancy omelettes, with bacon and mushrooms and the weird leaves on top. </p><p>Brushing his teeth seemed to take all of his effort. He dredged up a Pepper-Up potion in the bathroom cabinet and downed it, smacking his lips as pure fire rushed through him. Steam poured out of his ears,  fogging up the mirror. </p><p>“Better,” James said, grinning at his reflection when the glass cleared. He still looked a bit like shit, but nobody else would dare say that to his face. </p><p>“You look like shit,” Paul said, with an exaggerated double-take when James made his way into the locker room that morning. James flipped him off and rummaged through his bag for his gear. The exhaustion had faded by now, but he knew he looked tired. </p><p>“I’m serious,” Paul said, picking up his Beater’s bat and swinging it around. “You have a late night?”</p><p>James snorted at the suggestive look. </p><p>“I wish. I think I must have gone flying in my sleep or something.” James shrugged off his shirt and started putting on his uniform, the Appleby Arrows sigil catching the light as he straightened up the lapels proudly. Paul had a look on his face, as though he wanted to press the issue, so James quickly said, “How’s Jess?”</p><p>Paul’s face brightened as he launched into a ready-made spiel about his beautiful fiancé. The conversation took them out onto the field, where James managed to escape by hopping on his broom and zooming away, laughing at the look of dawning realisation on Paul’s face. </p><p>Practice was good. He had the Quaffle more often than not, and made several passes that got him a cheer from Fahra, the Seeker, circling up above on the hunt for the snitch. It woke him up, made him grin and tease and laugh as he zipped in and out of his teammates. There was nothing like flying to make him feel alive, nothing like the wind rushing through his hair, urging him along, to make him feel like he’d never need to sleep again. </p><p>When he dismounted his broom at the end of a three hour practice, James was pleasantly tired. His muscles were sore, but not to the point of berating him with every movement. He dodged Paul and his curious stare and went to stand beside Perkin’s, the other Beater. Perkin’s clapped him on the shoulder as Emma swept towards them, her stern face alight with pride. </p><p>“Good job everyone,” Emma said, looking at each of them in turn and tucking her hair behind her ear. “It’s really coming together this season. This is going to be our year. I can feel it!”</p><p>Emma was Team Captain for a reason; even her smallest speeches were enough to inspire them. It was hard to feel tired in the cheers that followed. James put two fingers in his mouth and whistled, loud and clear, trying not to wince when his index finger throbbed with a forgotten ache. He shook out his hand as Perkin’s shook him by the shoulder, laughing. </p><p>“Don't get too cocky,” Emma said, but she was grinning. “We still have a few weeks before the first match of the season, and I don't want to see any of you slacking. The minute we get too comfortable, complacent—that’s when things start to get rough. There’s always room for improvement, understand?” She nodded when they did. “Good, now bugger off. You all stink.”</p><p>James only let himself slump when he stepped into the shower, soaking in the hot spray. Steam filled the locker room, mingling with the raucous shouts of his teammates as they threw towels at each other and made jokey, suggestive comments. Some of them were a little more serious than others, James noted with amusement, listening to Callum talking about Alice, their other Chaser. He leaned against the shower partition and groaned as his shoulders relaxed. </p><p>“Oi, Potter!” Callum yelled. “Better not be enjoying that shower too much!”</p><p>James quirked a grin. No doubt Callum would appear at the top of the door if James didn't reply, or crawl underneath it, always one to ignore boundaries, so James tipped his head back and moaned so loudly that it echoed. </p><p>“Christ.” Callum sounded wounded, a bit dazed. A round of snickering and one helpless howl of laughter made James grin, safely behind the door. </p><p>“You asked for that, mate,” Perkin’s said. </p><p>James tuned out the talking and laughing. He had leaned more heavily against the wall over the last few minutes, he noticed, but for the life of him, he couldn’t be bothered to stand up straight. It was hard enough to keep his eyes open. </p><p>Someone banged on the door, and James jerked upright. </p><p>“Hurry up, Potter! Some of us have lives to get back to!”</p><p>James sighed, grabbing the soap. He washed quickly, but it still took longer than usual, and the shower felt cold by the time he’d finished. He warmed it again with a spell before sliding a towel around his waist, letting someone else take the cubicle. He didn't even register who, too busy trying to put his clothes on without opening his eyes more than a millimetre.</p><p>“Try getting some sleep tonight, Potter,” Paul said, surprising him at the door. He grinned before James could protest, and said, “It’s sad, seeing you look even more like shit than usual. Just makes me feel like dressing extra ugly tomorrow, so you don't feel too self-conscious, y’know?”</p><p>James gave him a pointed look up and down, lingering on his clog-like shoes. “Is that possible? I think you’ve already hit as low as you can go.”</p><p>That got him a playful shove and another smart remark. They clapped hands as they left, and James grabbed his broom before heading to the Apparation point, dragging his feet. He had plans to meet Albus and Scorpius for lunch, and it was tempting to cancel and spend all day sleeping on the sofa instead, but he was sure Albus would kill him if he missed it. Then he’d start feeling all self-conscious and insecure about whether James loved him or not, and he’d snap at every human in his path, and James would have to put him in a headlock and loudly list off all the reasons why he wanted to spend time with him. </p><p>Skipping would arguably end up being more effort than it was worth, but James was still tempted. Instead, he Apparated straight from the Quidditch Pitch to the Leaky Cauldron an hour early, so as not to be lured in by the soft, comfortable cushions of his sofa.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>James jerked away from the hand poking him in the ribs. He blinked blearily up at Teddy, whose face loomed above, soft with amusement and a touch of concern.<p>“Alright there, Jamie?” </p><p>James nodded, releasing a yawn that cracked his jaw as he sat upright. It was difficult to move, considering he was swamped in a mound of pillows and hand-knitted throws, all in varying shades of earthy brown and green and gentle mulberry. Grunting, James began to excavate his way out while Teddy watched on, clearly enjoying his pain. </p><p>“Molly sent me to get you, she says dinner’s ready.” Teddy raised an eyebrow as a cushion went flying. “Did you mean to fall asleep?”</p><p>“Grandma’s sofa is the best place to take a nap,” James explained, as he kicked away the last throw. It wasn’t quite an answer; the truth was he had sat down for a minute, and didn’t even remember closing his eyes. But the truth was uncomfortable the longer he thought about it, and Teddy would worry. </p><p>“You’ve been doing too many hours,” Teddy said, but the concern was gone now, replaced solely with amusement. “Too much work and no play makes James a tired boy.”</p><p>Teddy held out a hand for James to take, which he did, something in his chest righting as he clung to the warm, calloused palm. Teddy had strong hands. They were hands that flung protective spells at work, hands that comforted victims and strangers, hands that soothed aches and held people up when they felt weak. They were strong hands, capable of fighting and dealing deadly blows, capable of protecting those who needed it. They were also some of the gentlest, most careful hands James had ever known, capable of such sweet touches. He held on for as long as he dared, long enough for Teddy to look down at him with an inscrutable stare. </p><p>“You sure everything’s okay?”</p><p>James shrugged, letting go of Teddy’s hand. “Yeah, it’s just like you said. Lots of hours. We’ve got our first match of the season in a few weeks, and I want to be on top of my game.”</p><p>“I’ve never seen you be anything but brilliant,” Teddy said, as they headed for the kitchen, where the rest of the family were already halfway through the usual seating squabbles. </p><p>The words sent a warm rush through James. He grinned up Teddy, running a hand through his hair to straighten out the bed-head and trying to stifle the blush that threatened to rise in his face and neck. </p><p>“Thanks, Teddy.” Then he cleared his throat and stormed into the room, voice loud as he announced, “Teddy’s sitting by me! He’s saying nice things about how amazing I am, unlike you arseholes, so he gets to sit by me.”</p><p>Teddy sighed. James liked to believe that he was done out of affection. </p><p>“Shocker,” Rose said, with an eye roll that James ignored. She obligingly moved one space down to make room for them in the middle. When everyone was seated and the squabble had moved on to who had too many potatoes, Teddy pinched James in the thigh, presumably for being a little shit, and James offered a charming grin in return. </p><p>“Sorry, Teddy,” Albus said across the table, with a slight smirk. “If we’d known this was your fate, we would have saved you a seat away from him.”</p><p>“But then where would Scorpius sit?” James asked, mock-innocently, taking the gravy boat that floated his way. “Oh! That’s right! In your lap, like he’s doing right now even though there’s loads of free seats.”</p><p>Albus and he exchanged a few choice gestures while Scorpius sidled a little more to the left, still with a rather pleased smile at having been anywhere near Albus’s lap at all. Teddy pinched James’s thigh again and then kept his hand there for an absurdly long time, during which James forgot how to breathe. The gravy boat upended when Lucy lunged at Louis over the table, and Grandma Molly banned four of them from having any dessert, only to cave by the time the spoons and cake came out. </p><p>All in all, it was very ordinary meal at the the Burrow. Or it would have been, if James hadn’t had to fight to stay awake the whole time.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes stank of eggs. This wasn’t unusual, but it wasn’t an Open day, so it was a bit out of the realm of ordinary. And it was really bloody disgusting to boot. James pushed open the door with his nose pinched pointedly between thumb and forefinger, and almost rammed straight into Uncle George.<p>“Alright James?” George said, grinning around the clothespin holding his nostrils shut. “Want one?” </p><p>James took the offered clothespin and clamped it in place. His voice came out all funny when he asked, “Christ, what did you do this time?” </p><p>George pointed to the aisle closest, which was thick and dark with hazy smoke. “Someone mixed Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder with one of those new Eggsploding Firecrackers. I'm waiting to see if it's going to blow up before I do something about the smell.”</p><p>“Does Angelina know you're just… watching the chaos?” But James found himself grinning, already anticipating the answer, and grinned even harder when George shook his head, proving him right. “Alright, well, you called me here, so where'd you want me? As long as it's far away from the egg smell, I'm all yours.”</p><p>“Freddie's in the back, sorting through the stock, so you can help him.” </p><p>James only deemed it safe to remove the clothespin when the door to the stockroom closed behind him, and even then there was a faint tinge to the air. He spotted Freddie digging through a box near the desk, surrounded by shelves of rumpled stock, and he picked up the nearest thing to lob at his back. It just so happened to be a Slapping Sock.</p><p>“Oi!” Freddie snapped, whirling around with a hand on the back of his neck. His face brightened at the sight of James, and then sunk back into a glower. “Oh, it’s you.”</p><p>The Slapping Sock fell to the floor with a flop, having done its job.</p><p>“Don't sound so excited.” James strolled closer, noting the red mark on the back of Freddie’s neck from the sock when he turned his back. </p><p>“I won’t.” </p><p>“What crawled up your arse and died?” </p><p>Freddie rolled his eyes, shifting through the box. “Nothing.”</p><p>James frowned at him. They'd always been close, him and Freddie. Freddie was the first person he'd told about his crush on Teddy, the first person to tell him that it was ‘probably fine, mate, and nobody's gonna care. Al’s banging a Malfoy, so it could be worse.’ James had punched him in the arm for that, but it had still been nice to hear. </p><p>It wasn't the same closeness that James felt for his siblings, or for Teddy, but out of all his cousins, Freddie was the one that made him feel the most relaxed. They'd had plenty of arguments over the years, but usually James knew exactly what he'd done, because he'd done it on purpose.</p><p>This time, James was clueless, and to his horror, Freddie actually looked <em>hurt</em> underneath the dark expression. </p><p>“Freddie,” James said, getting a hand on his shoulder to wheel him around. “Seriously, mate, what is it? What did I do?” </p><p>“It's what you didn't do,” Freddie scoffed, but he looked slightly less mad. “You were supposed to come to lunch last week, and then out for drinks the other night, and I was going to introduce you to Lauren.”</p><p>“Shit,” James said, blinking at him. “Shit, I didn't—”</p><p>“Turn up?” Freddie cut in acidly, wrenching out of James’s hold. “Yeah, I know. I looked like a right twat. What, did you have a hot date, or just forget that you had other friends?”</p><p>“I fell asleep.” James cringed as the words hit the silent room. “Not—fuck, that sounds horrible. It’s not like I just laid down and decided not to bother. I meant to go, I did. I'm so sorry, Freddie.”</p><p>“You fell asleep,” Freddie repeated dubiously. When James grimaced and nodded, he blinked rapidly, clearly surprised. “What, all three times? James, what the fuck is going on with you lately?”</p><p>“I don't know,” James said, an uneasy feeling gathering in his stomach. </p><p>This wasn't the first time. He had missed a few pub nights with Albus and Scorpius, and slept right through dinner with his parents. Both had resulted in passive-aggressive letters steeped in reproval and concern. </p><p>It was getting hard to make it through practice without his head dropping. Lily had come round for company the other night while she worked on a deadline for the Quibbler, and James had snored on the sofa the entire time. She'd left a post-it note on his head, telling him to take care of himself, and to Floo her when he'd decided to stop being so boring. </p><p>James didn’t know what was going on, but he knew it probably wasn’t good. He just didn’t know what to do about it. It was Match season, so it was likely to do with that, but it still made him uneasy. </p><p>James sighed, reaching up to run a hand through his hair. “Shit, I'm sorry mate. How about I make it up to you? We could go to that Italian place near mine, and I could meet Lauren then. I'll pay.” </p><p>Freddie eyed him for a minute. James wondered what he was thinking, if he was noticing the dark circles under his eyes, the lack of colour in his cheeks. Part of him, a very small part that James was doing a good job of ignoring, actually wanted Freddie to notice. It was weird; he'd been sleeping more and more lately, but it didn't look like it, and it sure as hell didn't feel like it. He didn't think he'd ever been this tired in his life, and it was showing. </p><p>Finally, Freddie snorted, moving back to the box. “You're damn right you're paying. I'm ordering the most expensive alcohol they've got and I'm going to drink the whole bottle, and you're paying.”</p><p>“Good impression on your girlfriend, I'm sure,” James teased, but he still felt a little curl of anxiety at the way Freddie’s shoulders were set. “Are we good?”</p><p>“We will be, if you sort yourself out.” Freddie elbowed him, then waved his wand. The Slapping Sock whacked James across the arse before he had a chance to breathe, and Freddie collapsed against the desk in a fit of laughter as James leapt forward, yelping. </p><p>“Okay, now we’re good.” Freddie wiped his eyes and headed for the door, grabbing James by the collar and throwing him a cheeky grin. “C’mon, I wanna see if the egg powder’s knocked Dad out yet.” </p><p>James let himself by pulled along, a delighted grin pulling at his mouth. “You mixed it, didn't you?” </p><p>“‘Course I did, Jamsie-boy, ‘course I did.”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>James blinked awake, taken aback by the dark room that greeted him. He could have sworn that it wasn't that late a minute ago, but the windows were still uncovered, and not a hint of sunlight met his curious gaze. A lamp was on in the corner, and he could hear the quiet buzz of a wireless somewhere else in the flat.<p>It was then, in the soft dark, that he noticed a sound underneath his left ear. He'd thought he was lying on the sofa, where he'd been sat with Teddy, playing Scrabble and drinking terrible, homemade cocktails, but—</p><p>“Jamie?” </p><p>—That was a heartbeat. Under his ear, he could feel a heartbeat, and the cushions beneath him weren't as soft as usual. James swallowed, the sound like a gunshot in the quiet, and lifted his head to find Teddy looking down at him. Teddy smirked a little, just the corner of his mouth tipped up, but in the lazy light it was too gentle to be anything but fond. </p><p>“Hi,” James said, mouth dry. </p><p>Teddy chuckled, and it rumbled through a James like thunder in a cave, shaking the walls of his heart. They were lying on the sofa, entwined, with James practically blanketing Teddy. One of those strong, careful hands reached up and brushed away some of James’s hair, where it had fallen in his eyes. The other hand was on James’s lower back, he realised with a breathless thrill, resting against his t-shirt. </p><p>“Hi yourself. Finally awake, huh, sweets?” </p><p>James’s heart did some sort of complicated gymnastics routine in his chest. He tried not to sigh too audibly. He loved those little names that Teddy doled out sparingly, and he kept them clutched close, but that didn't mean he had to turn into some sort of swooning mess. </p><p>“Yeah, but it doesn't feel like it. I feel like I could sleep for a thousand years more.” James rubbed at one eye, still sprawled all over Teddy. He wasn't moving one second before he was told to. “How long did I sleep for?” </p><p>“About three hours,” Teddy said, and God, he had one of those voices that suited any moment. Commanding and firm one minute, teasing and cocky the next; rough with sleep and still gentle for it, now. </p><p>James groaned, dropping back to hide his face in Teddy’s shirt. “You could have moved me. Don't you have cramp from lying here this long?”</p><p>“You fell asleep on my shoulder first.” Teddy made a little amused sound. “Lily was right, you do drool a lot. I mean, I already knew that from finding you in my bed for the last however many years, but still, it's nice to confirm.” </p><p>James kicked lazily at Teddy’s shin with his socked feet, but couldn't find the energy to do more than that. Teddy kept on chuckling, wrapping his arm more tightly around his back as they slipped further down the sofa. </p><p>“I moved you after a while, and had a nap too, so no cramps. You lost Scrabble, by the way.”</p><p>James scowled into Teddy’s shirt. “I never lose Scrabble. If I was asleep, you could have just gone through the bag and got whatever tiles you wanted, so any words after I fell asleep don't count.”</p><p>“Anyone who falls asleep during a game automatically forfeits a game.”</p><p>“That's not a rule.”</p><p>“It is.”</p><p>James grunted, kicking Teddy again, already halfway back to sleep. “It's not in the official rule book.” </p><p>“It is.” Teddy laughed as he held James closer, tighter, and James let himself sigh as Teddy smoothed a hand up his back. “I put it in there while you were snoring.” </p><p>James gave a little helpless laugh, shaking his head without lifting it. “Nerd. Wanna move?” </p><p>“Go to sleep, Jamie. I'm good here.”</p><p>James wasn't about to argue with that. He was good there too. He was good anywhere that Teddy was, especially when Teddy had his arms around him, especially when his heartbeat was the only thing James could hear.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>*</p>
</center>James gripped the handle of his broom so tightly that his knuckles turned white. Every blink was purposeful, deliberate, a specific closing of the eyes. It had to be, because if he didn't think carefully about each blink, there was no telling when he would open his eyes again.<p>“C’mon Potter, chin up.” Paul slapped him on the back as he brushed by. “We've got a game to win.” </p><p>James blinked again. He'd taken a Pepper-Up Potion last night, but the rule against performance potions and sports held fast, so he'd gone without any that morning. Not that it would have done much; the potion had grown less and less effective the more he used it, and he'd used it a lot over the last three weeks. </p><p>“Some of your family’s in the stands,” Paul announced, seemingly unaware of James’s struggle, or perhaps just giving James a chance to collect himself. “I saw your moody brother and your blue-haired boy talking earlier, and your parents are here too.”</p><p>James shook himself, straightening up. “Teddy’s not my blue-haired boy.” </p><p>“Well, he isn’t anybody else’s, is he?”</p><p>It took effort to focus on Paul, but when he did, he was surprised to notice the relief on Paul’s face. </p><p>“There you are. Thought you were gonna throw up for a minute there, mate. Are you sure you're alright to play? You don't look so hot.”</p><p>“We both know that's not true,” James muttered, but his heart wasn't in it. He allowed himself another blink, and then set his shoulders back. “Are we the last ones out?” </p><p>“Yeah.” Paul looked unsure, lingering at the door. “I told the team I'd wait for you, though they weren't keen on leaving. James, nobody would mind if—”</p><p>“We better get a move on then,” James said, striding past Paul, broom held tightly at his side. He managed a cheery grin as he slipped through the door. “Can't leave my adoring masses waiting, can I?” </p><p>“Cocky shit,” Paul grumbled, but James could hear the fondness there, and the relief too. </p><p>Outside, the crowds were roaring. The pitch glimmered green, and there were sparks in the sky. It was cold, but not wet, so conditions were good, but privately James hoped it would grow colder, or start to rain, if only to wake him up a bit. James steeled himself and joined the line of his teammates, receiving several back slaps and a few murmured greetings. He ignored the looks of concern. </p><p>Out on the pitch, the Falcon’s climbed onto their brooms, and the crowd roared even louder. </p><p>James took to the sky when the whistle blew, grinning as his name was announced almost immediately by the Commentator. He weaved through the other players and kept his eye on the Quaffle, jumping from hand to hand. He didn't blink. Callum caught the Quaffle. He didn't blink. The Quaffle soared towards him. He didn't blink. The Quaffle—</p><p>“And Potter misses the catch! Gobbler takes the Quaffle, who passes to Aldering, who passes to—”</p><p>James grit his teeth. He'd blinked for what felt like a second, but it must have been for longer than that. James flattened himself against the broom and sped past Callum’s confused face, following Alice’s lead. She was a good Chaser, good at thinking up plays, and James really had to blink, but he couldn't, not when the other team was about to score—</p><p>“And that's 10-0 to the Falmouth Falcons!” </p><p>James wobbled on his broom. Fuck, he'd blinked. Alice swooped over, mouthing something, but James shook his head and she sped away again. The Quaffle was on the move, and he followed it well enough; he even managed to duck a Bludger before Paul had to get involved, but James couldn't actually get anywhere near the Quaffle. </p><p>“James!” Callum shouted, soaring around him. “Play Three!” </p><p>They usually decided that without talking, but James was glad someone had decided to tell him verbally. It was unlikely he’d have been able to pick up any cues. He blinked, and Callum was across the pitch.</p><p>“Potter’s one of the youngest to rise through the ranks of popular Quidditch Teams in such a short time, but he doesn't seem to be doing so well this game. That's another play he's missed, and a pass—oh! And a foul! That's a foul by Appleby Arrows Chaser, James Potter!”</p><p>James dragged his eyes open to find one of the Falcon’s swearing at him. Their brooms were tangled, the bristles roughly shoved together. James could only guess that he'd rammed into the other guy, but for the life of him he couldn't remember it happening. His heart dropped, his stomach churning; this was dangerous. He shouldn’t be up in the air like this, not with other people around that could get hurt. </p><p>“Sorry, fuck, sorry,” James said, wrenching his broom away. He didn't feel bad, or sick, but he just couldn't keep his eyes open. The ref zoomed towards them, blowing the whistle as the Falcon Chaser kept on yelling. </p><p>“Penalty to the Falmouth Falcons! Taken by Aldering, and yes, he's scored! That's 40-10 to the Falmouth Falcons.”</p><p>Time felt like treacle. James sucked in a breath, angling his broom towards the outside of the pitch, where he’d hopefully do less damage. When had they scored? When had the other team scored again? Fuck, his brain felt like it was full of fog. </p><p>Gritting his teeth, James held on tight to his broom. He could see, almost impossibly, a flicker of blue in the crowd that he knew to be Teddy. His parents were there too, and Albus, watching this train wreck, and James didn't know what to do. His dad was there, and Teddy was there, and they were probably worried because even <em>James</em> was worried in a way he’d been trying not to focus on lately. </p><p>“And is that a—yes, that's Appleby Arrows Captain, Emma Clearwater, calling for a time out. Wonder if they'll call in for a Reserve Chaser, since something seems to be up with Potter, or maybe his broom.”</p><p>James jerked, then angled his broom for the pitch automatically. His team was already there, gathered near the posts, and as he drew closer he could see Emma’s pissed off expression grow clearer. </p><p>The word ‘sorry’ made it halfway out of James’s mouth, but before he reached the ground, he made a mistake that he couldn't quite apologise for. </p><p>James blinked. Even as the world went dark and a soft, dreamless sleep cocooned him, James knew that this blink was going to last for a long time.</p>
