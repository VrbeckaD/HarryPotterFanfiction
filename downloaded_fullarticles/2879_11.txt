          <div class="userstuff"><p>“You can do this, Steve,” I say to myself, clutching my satchel as I make my way to the partially open door.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I’m on my hands and knees in the doorway of Professor Grey’s office, and gentle hands are helping to pull me up. Damn my clumsiness. I have to steel myself to glance up. Blimey, he’s so young...</p>
<p>“Mister Barnes...” he extends a long-fingered hand to me once I’m on my feet. “Are you all right? Would you like to sit?”</p>
<p>He’s so young, and so attractive. Tall, dressed in fine grey robes, unruly bronze hair and intense, bright green eyes that regard me shrewdly. I feel even more embarrassed in my worn school robes, a little short now though I’ve barely grown since first year.</p>
<p>“Errr... actually,” it takes a moment for me to find my voice, and I think my mouth has fallen open in astonishment. This guy can’t be over 30. I extend my hand to him in a daze, and we shake. As our fingers touch I feel a strange current go through me, like a disillusionment charm but warm. I withdraw my hand hastily, and I can feel myself blinking rapidly, matching my heart rate.</p>
<p>“Mister Barnes is, um, indisposed, so he sent me. I hope you don't mind, professor.”</p>
<p>“And you are...?” His voice is warm, possibly amused, but it’s difficult to tell from his impassive expression. He looks mildly interested, but above all, polite.</p>
<p>“Steve Rogers. I’m in Hufflepuff with Bucky... er, James... er, Mister Barnes.”</p></div>
