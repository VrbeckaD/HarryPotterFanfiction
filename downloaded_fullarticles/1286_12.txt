  <strong>Chapter 1</strong>
</p><p align="center">
  <strong>SECTUMSEMPRA</strong>
</p><p align="center"><strong> <em>*</em> </strong> <strong> <em>Sectumsempra</em> </strong> <em> is a very dark curse that derives from the Latin words </em></p><p align="center">
  <em>‘sectum’ – ‘cut’ and ‘sempra’ – ‘forever’ and causes a cut that will not heal ever.</em>
</p><p>"Malfoy." </p><p>His whisper is barely audible, as though he doesn't want me to hear - not really - as though he's afraid I might wake and open my eyes.</p><p>In vain he frets; he can't wake me. I'm not asleep to begin with. I'm not going to open my eyes either. I want him to leave, and now he's going to, as he always does. I know it's not his first visit here. It's not even the second. It's the fourth.</p><p>When for the first time I realised he was standing by my bed, for one wild moment I thought he came to finish me off. The mere thought was ridiculous. I'd never feared Potter before, and yet... I'd never imagined he was capable of gutting anyone, leaving them to die in a pool of their own blood. </p><p>Until he did just that. </p><p>To me. </p><p>And proved me wrong, slashing me open from neck to hip with a single whip of his wand.</p><p>With my eyes closed, I felt his presence looming over me. I was too weak to even squeal, the tiniest movement was agony. My chest was burning, my neck, my stomach, my lower belly. Although Snape had patched me up, it would take time to heal. That vile thing Potter threw at me was eating at my skin from the inside. </p><p>Nothing happened. He did nothing, said nothing, just stood there. There was a heavy sigh, and another, and a long silence, until I realised he didn't come to kill me. It seemed he wanted to talk. Whatever in hell could Potter and I possibly talk about? I didn’t understand until it finally dawned on me that he came to apologise. To right the wrongs and all that shit.</p><p>It made me sick. And furious.</p><p>He could stuff his apologies up his righteous arse. I kept my eyes closed.</p><p>I don't know how long he stood there, but while pretending to be asleep, I passed out for real. When I woke up, Potter was gone.</p><p>He came again. </p><p>The next day, as soon as I glimpsed his mop of hair at the door, I closed my eyes.</p><p>It was pretty much the same as the day before: he approached, he stood, he sighed, he said nothing and eventually left. </p><p>The same yesterday, only he lingered longer and sat in a chair by the bed, creaking its back, shuffling his feet.</p><p>Where the fuck was Pomfrey every time he came? I suspected she was aware of his visits, allowing the hero to do the fucking <em>right thing</em>. Damn him.</p><p>Pomfrey says I'm almost healed and will be out of here soon enough. Can't wait.</p><p><em>Can't wait</em> to be spared of Potter's presence. He wouldn't stalk me around once I got back to my dorm, would he? </p><p>I have a task to complete, besides. </p><p>
  <em>Fuck</em>
</p><p>I don't want to do this. I don't. I am failing, I already have. Snape offered help; maybe it's not too late to take it? He'd made an Unbreakable Vow, he said. He's bound to help anyway. Whether I refuse or accept, it makes no difference. </p><p>Oh, what a relief that would be to pass this task to someone else. To Snape. He is strong and always knows what to do. Unlike me, he is not a coward. I am weak and tired. So tired. I would stay in bed forever so that I wouldn't have to do anything, and maybe eventually the Dark Lord would forget about me. Snape would probably accomplish it for me. He would. He’d made a Vow, he said.</p><p>"Malfoy."</p><p>Fuck, he's still here.</p><p>The chair creaks. Keeping my breath even, I don't move in the hope that my face doesn't betray me. I feel his stare. It's weird: my skin itches - my cheeks, my eyelids, my forehead - his gaze lingers, roaming over my face.</p><p>"Malfoy."</p><p>He touches my shoulder, and I nearly jump out of my skin. What the fuck does he think he is doing?</p><p><em>"What?"</em> I open my eyes to stare right into Potter's glasses.</p><p align="center">**</p><p><em>"What?"</em> His eyes suddenly snap open.</p><p>I flinch and snatch my hand away. <em>I didn't...</em> I didn't expect that. Everything I intended to say evaporates as I stare into his pale eyes. Dark circles around them make Malfoy look ill. His face is so gaunt, why had no one noticed that he’s lost so much weight?</p><p>"What, Potter?"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>"Came here to finish me off?"</p><p>"No." My face is burning. "No, I..." I look away. I didn't know it would be so hard to meet his eyes.</p><p>"No?" He slowly sits up in the bed.</p><p>I lean against the back of the chair and force myself to look at him. The front of his pyjama top gapes open, revealing bandages over his collarbone and shoulder. His chest is bound tight, too, as well as his stomach that I can glimpse where the fabric parts. I flinch and look up, afraid to see the scars, the image of his bleeding face vivid in my mind. There are none, not a single one; his face is as smooth and pale as ever.</p><p>"Admiring your work?" He sneers. "I'll show you." His hands reach up to the buttons.</p><p>Dread coils in my stomach. "No... <em>don't</em>... I... I didn't..."</p><p>"You didn't? But you <em>did..."</em></p><p>"I'm sorry, Malfoy, I never meant to do that."</p><p>He cringes. "Do what?"</p><p>"Do... a... <em>thing</em> like that."</p><p>"Then <em>what</em> did you mean?"</p><p>I shake my head, hell if I know what I meant.</p><p>"To humiliate me, hurt me, cause me pain?" he continues. </p><p>"Yes, maybe..." I force out, <em>"that</em> and... other things... maybe... but never <em>this.</em> And never to kill you."</p><p>"Then why the fuck did you use the spell?"</p><p>"I didn't <em>know</em> what it did."</p><p>He rolls his eyes. "Of course you didn't."</p><p>"It's true, I..."</p><p>"I don't <em>care,</em> Potter. I don't care what your purpose was. You did it."</p><p>"I wanted to apologise."</p><p>"I don't accept your apology. Fuck off." Malfoy winces and slides carefully down to lie on his back.</p><p>"Malfoy..."</p><p>"Get out, or I'll tell Pomfrey you're disturbing my sleep." He closes his eyes and says no more.</p><p>I have nothing left to do but leave.</p><p align="center">**</p><p>I am sure Potter won't come again. Good riddance. </p><p>I'm sitting on the windowsill, staring at my reflection against the night in the dark, glass surface.</p><p>Snape came today. Again. With his talk and his offer.</p><p>He'd made a Vow, he said. It had almost killed him when Potter slashed me open in the bathroom. He almost didn't have any time left, he said. If he hadn't found me, we would both be dead.</p><p>He insisted that I confided in him with the task the Dark Lord had given me.</p><p>"At least I would know what I have to deal with. One misstep, Draco, the tiniest stupidity on your part, and we are both dead."</p><p>It still might be a trap. I don’t think I can trust him. What if the Dark Lord himself has set it all up?</p><p>I refused. "I didn't <em>make</em> you swear the vow.”</p><p>He left.</p><p>Sometimes I wonder what it means to be Snape. I don't understand. He is here, he is there, he is everywhere. Always determined, never afraid. What the hell is he even doing? Which master does he serve, if any?</p><p>"I serve the cause." He grimaced when I asked him last night. What the hell did he mean? I didn't ask, he wouldn't tell me.</p><p>It's cold, and I shift on the windowsill and wince, disturbing my bandages. My wounds have gotten better, but any wrong movement still hurts. I should probably fetch the quilt. I can't summon it from here, Pomfrey took my wand away.</p><p>"You don't need it here, Mr. Malfoy, you shouldn't waste your energy until you are healed. Whatever magic you need, you may ask me." </p><p>
  <em>Bugger.</em>
</p><p>Putting my weight on my arms, I slide carefully off the windowsill. <em>Fuck.</em> Streaks of pain sting through my chest. What's the point of this exercise, anyway? What harm would there be if I just summoned the thing across the room with my wand? Carefully I limp towards the bed, every step of my right foot tugging at the strings of pain up my abdomen. Well, I'm not sure I'd want to make it the entire way back to the window. I think I'm just going to climb into bed and be done with it.</p><p>"Here, Malfoy." He grabs me by the arm, making me yelp. "Lean on me."</p><p align="center">**</p><p>I expect to find Malfoy in his bed, but no. He is moving across the room. I mean, how long does it take to cross this room from the window to the bed? I've never thought of it, not really. Not long, I suppose. But Malfoy is <em>moving.</em></p><p>His face set, he limps slowly, favouring his right side, wincing each time his right foot touches the floor. </p><p><em>My doing.</em> How did I even come to that?</p><p>In his oversized striped pyjamas, he looks so skinny and frail. He <em>is</em> skinny and frail, I've just never thought of it until now. The bright moonlight from the window makes his hair glow silver. Like a ghost. It's unsettling.</p><p>Malfoy stumbles and growls, and I move before I know it.</p><p>"Here, Malfoy." I grab his arm. He jerks and whines. <em>Damn,</em> I've probably caused him pain. "Lean on me." </p><p>"Fuck, Potter, get off me!" He wiggles his shoulder to shrug me off and hisses. "I <em>said</em> get off me! You are hurting me."</p><p>I drop his arm and step back. "Sorry... I was just... trying to help."</p><p>"I don't need your help." He limps to the bed and grips the headboard, carefully angling his body to lower himself down. <em>"Fuck,"</em> he lets out through the gritted teeth as soon as he is finally seated. "What do you want?"</p><p>"I just-" I begin.</p><p>"No, not <em>that</em> again." Malfoy cringes. "Spare me. Go away."</p><p>"Malfoy, I'm so sorry, I..."</p><p>"Shut up, Potter. I don't want to know, I <em>don’t.</em> I feel shitty as it is. Just leave."</p><p>His unwashed hair is a mess, sticking up at one side where he slept on it. His sharp collarbone stands out in the gap of the collar of his pyjama top, the other one is bandaged. He looks underfed, miserable and ill. <em>In pain</em>, guilt whispers in my mind.</p><p>"No, listen-" I step forward. </p><p>"Potter, I'm sick of you and your apologies. I'm calling Pomfrey." He reaches out to touch a tiny bell on his bedside table.</p><p>I grip his wrist, he cringes. </p><p>"Sorry." I drop his hand. "I'm not here to apologise. I wanted to help."</p><p>"Snape has helped me just fine. Go away." He rubs at his wrist.</p><p>"No... I mean, with that thing that troubles you," I say carefully. "In the bathroom... you told Myrtle that-"</p><p>Malfoy's eyes go wide. <em>"No!</em> I won't talk about it. Least of all with you."</p><p>"No, listen... I figured you must do something and have failed so far, and I thought-"</p><p>"I said <em>no,</em> Potter!" His face is livid. "You can't help me. No one can."</p><p>"Dumbledore," I say. "Dumbledore can. He can do <em>anything."</em></p><p>"No." Malfoy shakes his head. "No." He lies down and covers his head with a blanket.</p><p>"Malfoy..."</p><p><em>"I said no! </em>Go away."</p><p align="center">**</p><p>It's been a week since Pomfrey released me. Good as new.</p><p>It seems no one knows what actually happened, or Potter's role in it. It leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. If it were the other way around, no doubt by now the entire school would know that I'd nearly killed their wretched <em>Hero.</em></p><p>Anyway, fuck him. I hope Potter will at least leave me alone.</p><p>"Malfoy." </p><p>No such luck.</p><p>I turn towards the sound of his voice. Potter steps out from behind a tree. I turn away, looking over the lake. The fucker has found me <em>here:</em> in the twilight, on the deserted bench by the lake. And just when I’d begun to think he’d stopped stalking me.</p><p>He approaches to sit beside me.</p><p>I shuffle away. "What do you want?"</p><p>"My offer still stands."</p><p>"Bugger you and your offer. Do I have to spell it out?"</p><p>Without a word, Potter gets up and walks away.</p><p>Good.</p><p>I turn to the lake. It is already dark. Black skies, black waters. Stars divided between the two. Two moons, shining twice as bright. Beautiful. Lonely.</p><p>I'm so lonely.</p><p>I want Mother here, want to put my head on her lap and feel safe again. Want to tell her everything, unload this burden and breathe. If she only knew, she would be horrified; she still wouldn't be able to help me. I miss her. I remember Father's face the day he returned from Azkaban. He went there strong and proud and emerged a ruin of a man. Whatever horrors he may have done at the Dark Lord's command, he is my father, and if I fail... I can't fail. I don't have the right.</p><p>A sob escapes me, and another one, my eyes prickling hot. My face suddenly damp, I wipe at it with the back of my hand, and my palm, and my fingers, again and again. I press my fingertips into my eyelids until colourful circles bloom before my eyes: yellow and red and orange.</p><p>A rustle behind me makes me jump; startled, I turn. Potter. He stuffs something in his pocket. I spring on my feet with my wand drawn. He steps forward and draws his. Slowly, we circle each other, the bench between us.</p><p>"What the fuck, Potter? Still spying on me?"</p><p>He angles closer.</p><p>"Stay where you are, or I'll tear you bloody." Hatred coils hot in my guts.</p><p>Why the fuck is he always <em>there?</em> When I'm at my weakest. When I am at my worst. When I am snivelling, cowering, weeping; when I'm beaten, defeated, <em>a failure.</em> The moments I want to forget and pretend they never happened, not to <em>me.</em> But no. Potter doesn't let me. He always makes sure I won't.</p><p>There's this flickering moment of hesitation when, poised to strike, neither of us moves. The air between us is as deadly as it was in that fucking <em>bathroom,</em> just before he drew my blood. Then something shifts in Potter's face, as though a storm passes aside.</p><p>"Fuck." He lowers his wand. "What's wrong with us?" Shaking his head, he approaches the bench between us and sits down.</p><p>"So much for the apologies." I turn away to face the lake.</p><p>"I'm not here to apologise."</p><p>"I figured." I sheathe my wand inside my sleeve.</p><p>Potter snorts and draws a deep breath and exhales, long and slow. "Would you sit down? We really need to talk."</p><p>I look at him over my shoulder, bright moonlight reflecting off his glasses. He sits with his arms crossed. All the fight leaves me, and now I just feel tired. I walk towards him and sit on the bench. </p><p>"Talk."</p><p>"I gather you’re fucked, Malfoy," he says. "Utterly fucked."</p><p>I stare at him. Is there any chance that he <em>knows</em> what he's talking about?</p><p>"I have no idea what it is, but I'm not blind. I've seen enough to figure out that you are trapped, alone, and your time is running out," he continues, staring at the lake. "So I say it again: go to Dumbledore before it's too late and tell him everything. Whatever the fuck it is. He'll help you figure it out. He's the only one who can."</p><p>We sit in silence, wheels turning frantically in my head. I am fucked either way, and Potter has no idea what he's talking about.</p><p>Potter stands up and walks to the water.</p><p>"What does Dumbledore say?" I ask his back.</p><p>"Dumbledore?" He looks over his shoulder.</p><p>"You said I should go to him for help. What did he say? He sent you, surely he told you of his plans?"</p><p>Moonlight blinks on Potter's glasses. "He didn't send me. No one did."</p><p>"What? Then why?.."</p><p>"No one sent me," he repeats, "I just thought, that..."</p><p>
  <em>Fuck.</em>
</p><p>I realise there's no plan, Potter acted on impulse, all this was only his stupid idea, and Dumbledore is none the wiser.</p><p>"So Dumbledore doesn't know." Sick to my guts, I stand up. </p><p>No one is going to help me. Neither Potter nor Dumbledore. <em>No one.</em> For one brief moment, there was a glimpse of hope, lurking behind Potter's words. But it’s been snuffed out in an instant. Potter didn't know what he was doing. <em>There was no plan. </em></p><p>"No, he doesn't," Potter says, "but if we go and tell him, he will help."</p><p>I can't go and <em>tell him.</em> Tell him that I must kill him, that it’s either that or my parents' death, that I didn't have a choice and I still don't.</p><p>"He will not. Believe me, when he hears, he won't."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"He can't help me in this, and he won't want to."</p><p>"What is it, Malfoy? What is it that you have to do?"</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>"I won't tell anyone."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"I promise."</p><p>"You'll tell Dumbledore, and... <em>he</em> must not know."</p><p>"What happens if he does?"</p><p>"He... he'll kill my parents." My voice cracks. I walk to the water, past Potter, away and back. I breathe and breathe to ebb away this feeling in my throat, to not let the tears flow. <em>Shit.</em> I'm about to break down in front of Potter. <em>Again.</em></p><p>"Dumbledore?" Potter asks dumbly.</p><p>"No, the.... the Dark Lor-" My sob eats the name away. </p><p>Unable to hold it back anymore, I bite my lip and turn away to hide my crumpling face from Potter. I begin walking along the water, quickly picking up pace. Only when I think the distance between us is safe enough do I dare to wipe my eyes.</p><p><em>Thump, thump, thump, thump,</em> the heavy splash of Potter's feet against the sand eats up the distance in no time.</p><p>"Malfoy, tell me! <em>What is it?!"</em> He grabs my elbow, breathing heavily from the run. "We'll sort it out."</p><p>"No!" I shout in his face. "If I tell you, <em>you'll </em>kill me. You probably should have - in the bathroom - and been done with it!" I shrug his hand off and start to walk away, my vision blurry.</p><p>Potter catches up with me and grabs my wrist, turning me to face him. When I try to wrench free, he grabs my other wrist. </p><p>"Let go! <em>Let go!"</em> I shriek, trying to kick him in the shin. My voice is shrill, and I fail to control my face, to make it appear normal. I despise myself, but I can't stop, can't hold it back anymore. I sag to my knees, dragging him down with me, and howl.</p><p>"Okay, Malfoy... okay... okay, Malfoy," Potter repeats over and over, his face bewildered.</p><p>He's freaking out, he has no idea how to deal with me; I don't know how to deal with myself either.</p><p>He doesn't let go.</p><p>Eventually, my tears stop, exhaustion washing over me. Only then do I realise that he is squeezing my wrists so hard that I can't stand it.</p><p>"Let go," I mumble. "It hurts."</p><p>He releases me. "Sorry."</p><p>I sit back on my heels. "Fuck."</p><p>Potter says nothing. I reach down and cup some water in my palms to wash my face. And again. A stray hiccup or sob jerks me now and then. I scramble to my feet and Potter follows. Water slurps in my boots.</p><p>"Leave me alone, Potter," I say weakly, watching as he brushes wet sand off his trousers.</p><p>"No. Whatever it is, Malfoy, we are going to Dumbledore. Now," Potter says wearily and adjusts his glasses.</p><p><em>Fuck it,</em> I think, <em>it can’t possibly get worse.</em></p><p>"Alright, damn you," I say, and follow him up the hill.</p><p>I'm done struggling. </p><p>I'm done.</p><p>"Wait," Potter says as we approach the castle. </p><p>We stop, and he reaches into the front pocket of his trousers, retrieving a small piece of cloth. He unfolds it, and unfolds it, and unfolds it until the liquid fabric slithers through his fingers in rich transparent folds.</p><p>"What's this?" I ask, though I think I already know. There were rumours, and once I witnessed it myself in the third year, though I didn't know what I was seeing.</p><p>"Invisibility Cloak," Potter says, and steps closer. </p><p>I'm a bit taller than he, an inch maybe, so I have to bend my head down as he covers us both.</p><p>"Keep close," he says, and links his arm through mine. </p><p>We head up the steps to the front door.</p><p align="center">**</p><p>I try to eavesdrop by the door, but can't make out any sound. They have been at it for about an hour now.</p><p>When I led Malfoy in, Dumbledore greeted us and said: "Do kindly wait in the outer room, Harry. Make yourself at home. I want a word with you later."</p><p>I knew dismissal when I heard it.</p><p>I try not to get offended. I try. </p><p>I assumed that Dumbledore would surely include me in Malfoy's secret since it was my idea in the first place. I thought he'd ask my opinion, and even allow me to help. It's Malfoy, and it's not like I'm eager to get into trouble on his behalf, but... well... I nearly killed him, I have to make amends.</p><p>Malfoy finally emerges, very pale in the face. He looks through me as though I'm not here and walks out.</p><p>"Harry," Dumbledore calls, "do come in."</p><p>"It was a good decision on your part to persuade Draco to come to me with his worries," he begins as soon as I am seated. "It shows that you are wise and have your heart in the right place, I never doubted that."</p><p>"Thank you, sir."</p><p>"You are most welcome. However..." Dumbledore reaches into the bowl of sweets in front of him. "There is something I have to ask of you." He arranges bright candies in a circle with his left hand; his right one lies on the desk - black, dead and useless. Looking at it, I try not to cringe.</p><p>"I've given Draco an important task to fulfil; a crucial task which everything depends on. Harry, I want you to-" He looks up.</p><p>I don't let him finish. "You want me to help him, I know-"</p><p>Dumbledore sighs. "Hear me out, Harry."</p><p>"Sorry, sir."</p><p>"Following my orders, Draco is doing an important task in the Room of Requirement. I want you to leave him alone and not try to find out what that task is. You must not interfere. You mustn’t. It is essential."</p><p>Whatever I might have expected, it wasn't this. "You don't trust me, sir."</p><p>"I trust you with my life, my boy." Dumbledore's voice is as soft as ever, but his eyes are piercing - the sharpest, clearest blue. "It is not a matter of trust, but your safety. To protect you from each other I must divide you."</p><p>"From each other?" </p><p>"Yes, so that neither of you would be able to expose the other." Dumbledore stands up and walks to the window. "And there's another thing you should know, Harry." With his back to me, he looks into the darkness outside.</p><p>Something coils in my stomach. I don't like it. I don't think I want to know what he's about to say next.</p><p>"I am aware of the unfortunate bathroom incident between you and Draco."</p><p>
  <em>Fuck. Here we go. </em>
</p><p>"Professor Snape has told me about it in detail."</p><p>
  <em>No doubt he has.</em>
</p><p>"I will not berate you, my boy, for I am sure the burden of guilt you carry weighs heavily upon you even without my rebuke."</p><p>I stare at my hands in my lap, at the white scar across the back of my left hand: <em>'I must not tell lies’ </em> thin, faded letters. I must not. So I say nothing.</p><p>"However, your mere presence here shows your effort and willingness to right the wrongs you did to Draco."</p><p>"I hope it has made a difference, sir," I say, my face burning. "He didn't accept my apologies, but he accepted help, in the end."</p><p>"It has made all the difference in the world, my boy." He turns to face me. "However, there is more to it."</p><p>I still don't like this feeling in the pit of my stomach. I still don't.</p><p>"It so happens that when you wounded Draco with the Sectumsempra curse, a bond formed between the two of you. A bond of a special nature that binds you to protect him, should he be in mortal peril again. The bond can only be undone by a protective spell, one of equal power to the Sectumsempra curse you cast on Draco."</p><p>My insides turn to lead. "I must save his life if need be?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"And if I fail?"</p><p>"You die." His voice is gentle.</p><p>I stare at him.</p><p>"Which absolutely <em>must not</em> happen, Harry. Do you understand?"</p><p>"Yes," I say dumbly.</p><p>"You must make sure that no harm befalls Draco."</p><p>I nod. <em>Holy shit.</em> That means I have to keep an eye on Malfoy from now on, lest he gets harmed in my absence. I feel ill, and my face probably betrays me, because Dumbledore sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose with his good hand.</p><p>"Harry, I am aware that you are not happy about it, but you <em>do</em> understand that we should take responsibility for our actions, even unintentional ones. Forgive me, I am not able to release you from this bond. It dissolves as soon as you fulfill your debt. <em>If</em> you fulfill it."</p><p>"And if the situation never comes?" I ask, liking it less and less.</p><p>"Then the debt stands until it does."</p><p>I nod, drawing circles in the carved surface of the wooden desk.</p><p>"It is late, my boy, time for you to go back to your dormitory."</p><p>I stand up. "Goodnight, sir." Reaching the door, I turn. "Sir? Should I let Malfoy know?"</p><p>"It is for you to decide."</p><p align="center">**</p><p>The corridors are deserted during lunchtime. I meet no one on my way to the Room of Requirement.</p><p>For once, Potter has stopped stalking me. Probably Dumbledore told him to. He used to lurk in the background every time I set foot outside the Great Hall or classes. No doubt he imagined himself a master of stealth and me being none the wiser. Idiot. A drunken bear is subtler than Potter creeping behind me along the corridors.</p><p>But now he’s left me alone, I'm sure.</p><p>I reach the blank wall on the seventh floor and stop, glancing around. No one. I close my eyes and concentrate, picturing the place I need to reach. Walking past the wall three times, back and forth, I say the words in my head:</p><p>
  <em>'I need to get to the room of hidden things.'</em>
</p><p>Three times. </p><p>I open my eyes.</p><p>The familiar door appears in the wall and lets me inside, dissolving instantly, blending back into the wall.</p><p>I walk past the row of old furniture and turn to the right, past the pile of cauldrons and a broom closet and a skeleton of some big animal, probably a bear on its hind legs. One turn to the right again, and here it is: tall and narrow, dark wooden doors carved with their intricate pattern.</p><p>“The Vanishing cabinet must be destroyed now?" I asked Dumbledore a week ago. That night when Potter dragged me to him and everything changed.</p><p>"No, my boy. From now on, you should try and do your best to make it work. It is essential that you succeed."</p><p>In shock, I gaped at him like a fish. "Sir?"</p><p>"Voldemort gave you the task. Your failure would be a threat to your parents' lives."</p><p>I flinched at the Dark Lord's name that he said so easily, as though it were nothing, as though it were the same to him as saying <em>'Draco Malfoy'</em> or <em>'Mrs. Norris.’</em> I wished he'd rather not do it.</p><p>"But how can I succeed if that means-”</p><p>"You need to let Death Eaters inside Hogwarts, as is required of you, and leave the rest to me," he said.</p><p>I didn't know what that meant, not really. The only thing that was clear to me was that it was not the kind of <em>'help'</em> I expected. The fool that I am, surrendering to Dumbledore’s mercy, I was sure it would be different. I thought that he’d hide me somewhere and find a way to sneak my parents out of the Dark Lord’s clutches. I thought he would say that I needn't worry anymore; I thought he would take my burdens away. I thought he would relieve me from the Dark Lord’s task. I thought it would be different, I thought it would be the end - of my fears, worries, danger. Little did I know, it was only the beginning. I went to him for help, but instead, he gave me another task that was different and the same as the Dark Lord’s.</p><p>Trapped between the hammer and the anvil, I have no choice: either side I am on - light or dark - I am bound to let evil in.</p><p>I open the narrow double door and peer into the cabinet. Nothing. Empty. I retrieve a walnut from my pocket and carefully place it in the middle of the empty shelf and concentrate.</p><p>“<em>Harmonia Nectere Passus,”</em> <em>[1]</em> I say, and close the door.</p><p align="center">**</p><p>We Apparate to the top of the Astronomy Tower. Dumbledore stumbles forward. He would have fallen if I didn't catch him by the arm.</p><p>"Thank you, Harry."</p><p>"Are you all right, sir?" My voice comes out shrill. I am so shaken with <em>what </em>I saw in that cave, I know Dumbledore is definitely <em>not</em> all right. "We should go to Madam Pomfrey, or I can bring her-"</p><p>"We don't have time, Harry. Quickly, I need your Cloak."</p><p>I don't understand what he has in mind, but I don't question his request. I've long ceased to question Dumbledore's actions, really; I just do as he says. I retrieve the Cloak out of the pocket of my jeans. "Here, sir."</p><p>"Thank you." He folds the Cloak over his stiff right arm and... points his wand at me.</p><p>With a silent flash of white, he sends me into the corner behind the pillar, and my back hits the wall. Pain explodes in my head where I smash it against the stone, warmth trickles down my neck. Blood. I cry out. No, I would - if I could. But I can't. My voice is stuck in my throat; in a panic, I choke on my tongue. His Full Body Bind is a cruel thing. I am unable to move, I am a wooden slab - a stiff useless thing - even my heart feels frozen. My mind screams, shock finally giving in to bewilderment, hurt, anger, outrage. Too late. It took him a mere second, and I never saw it coming.</p><p>Dumbledore spreads out the Invisibility Cloak and drapes it over me, covering my stiff form from head to toe.</p><p>"Forgive me, Harry." He steps back and leans against the railings. His breath is laboured. He looks so old and frail <em>- harmless -</em> his deceptive appearance at odds with what he is capable of. </p><p>I wrench against my bonds. At least I think that I do... or would have done if I could. I can't even blink. </p><p>"Now, listen to me carefully. Death Eaters are about to be here any minute, and <em>Draco</em> will be the one leading them. Whatever happens, Harry, you <em>must</em> remember: he is performing my task; he is doing what I commanded him to. <em>Whatever</em> happens, Harry, do you understand? You must promise me to protect him in the end. You will Ennervate him, get him out of here and hide him. It is my wish, Harry, and my command."</p><p>I have no idea what he is talking about, it hardly makes any sense; it sounds wrong, and I don't have a chance to ask him. I want to shout, demanding to lift this fucking spell so that I can finally breathe and... I try, but... I try and try and try...</p><p>"Expelliarmus!" </p><p>Dumbledore's wand flies out of his grip and clatters against the floor.</p><p>"Do it, Draco," a voice says. <em>Oh-so-familiar,</em> insane, cold, dreadful voice. I'd recognise it anywhere.</p><p>I don't see the woman, but no doubt she is here. I can see nothing but Dumbledore against the railings right in front of me. All I can do is stare ahead.</p><p>Malfoy steps in front of Dumbledore, holding him at the wand point.</p><p>"Good evening, Bella," Dumbledore says mildly. "What a pleasure to see you."</p><p>"Old man..." Bellatrix Lestrange is behind Malfoy. "The old man has lived too long. Do it, boy. You have to <em>mean it."</em> She caresses Malfoy's nape with her fingers and takes half a step back.</p><p>The wand in Malfoy's hand shakes in the dim light of the lanterns on the walls. It's not the wand, I realise, it's Malfoy. He is shaking with horror written across his face.</p><p>"Dumbledore..." His voice is barely a whisper, and he must be grateful that Bellatrix doesn't see his face.</p><p>"Do it and be done with him," someone grumbles, "or I'll do it."</p><p>Malfoy doesn't move.</p><p>"Fenrir," Dumbledore says and raises his left hand in greeting.</p><p>A silent flash of green light erupts from his palm and sends Malfoy reeling. He hits the floor and stills, motionless, his hand still gripping his wand. From here I see his eyes - huge in shock - staring at the ceiling.</p><p><em>No.</em> This cannot be happening. Dumbledore would <em>never...</em> My mind reels. Everything is wrong, false as a terror of a nightmare.</p><p>"You've killed the boy," Bellatrix says. There is no fear or regret in her voice. Only wonder.</p><p>"He would have killed me," Dumbledore shifts against the railings.</p><p>
  <em>No. You would have never done that.</em>
</p><p>"But a <em>wandless</em> Avada Kedavra?" Carefully, Bellatrix steps around Malfoy's body to take a closer look, all the time holding Dumbledore at wand point.</p><p>"This old man is old," Dumbledore says, "and full of surprises."</p><p>Moonlight makes his face look a pale-grey mask, old and weathered, <em>dead.</em> Terror spreads in my guts. I understand nothing anymore.</p><p>"The old man has lived long enough." Bellatrix turns her head to look at him, her poise never wavers. Her wrist twists in a tiny movement for a better grip.</p><p><em>No! No!</em> I thrash and scream. I try.</p><p>"No," a voice repeats after me. Deep and dark and familiar.</p><p>I would sag in relief to the floor if my body would obey me.</p><p>
  <em>Snape.</em>
</p><p>Never in my life have I been so glad to see him.</p><p><em>Snape is here</em> and everything is going to be alright. Snape is here to fix it.</p><p>Bellatrix turns. "Severusss..."</p><p>Now I see him: a tall dark shape steps out of the shadows and with a sudden movement shoves Bellatrix aside.</p><p>"You killed the boy?" His voice is blank. He doesn't look at Malfoy's prone form on the floor.</p><p>"Severus," Dumbledore says - soft and gentle, <em>pleading</em> - "Severus, <em>please."[2]</em></p><p>Snape raises his wand.</p><p><em>Now.</em> He will strike that insane bitch Bellatrix, and the Werewolf, and all the Death Eater scum that have wormed their way into Hogwarts. He will defend Dumbledore, he will save him and call for help and...</p><p>
  <em>"Avada Kedavra."</em>
</p><p>What did he say?</p><p>In a flash of green light, Dumbledore reels back, his hands thrown wide as he grasps the air for support, falls over the railings and is gone.</p><p>Silence falls.</p><p>My thoughts slow, thick like jelly, I stare at the spot where he stood mere moments ago. No, no. It's a mistake, someone's stupid mistake. It cannot be happening, not to Dumbledore, never to him.</p><p>"Hurry!" Snape's voice breaks the silence. "Out of here." He moves out of the line of my vision, Bellatrix following. </p><p>There is shuffling of feet against the floor, the scrape of the heavy door on its hinges, urgent footsteps scattering over the staircase, dying down in the distance, until the door slams shut, its echo fading into a ringing silence, leaving me alone in the small stone room at the top of the tower. Me and dead Malfoy.</p><p>I wrench against my binds and stumble forward, stepping on the hem of the Cloak, because the binds are no longer there. I fall forward, landing painfully on my outstretched palms. I curse and tug the Cloak off and scramble on my knees, shuffling across the floor to Malfoy.</p><p>No, no, it <em>was his plan.</em> What else could it possibly be? Dumbledore wouldn't die. He didn't die. Not like this. His clever plan - that's what it was. He has fooled them all, he didn't die, he didn't fall, Fawkes has saved him in the air and carried him away. It was his plan, he told me.</p><p><em>What plan?! What plan?! </em>My mind races.</p><p>I don't know, he never told me, but I am sure it was his plan all along. What else?</p><p>I look down at Malfoy's dead wide eyes staring at the ceiling; at his face frozen in surprise; at his wand, still pointing up.</p><p>I touch his hand and flinch. It is stiff and icy cold. I press my fingertips to the base of his neck, where I think a pulse point must be.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Or I probably just can't find it, because I don't know how to check a pulse.</p><p>
  <em>No.</em>
</p><p>It's a trick.</p><p>
  <em>'...Ennervate him...'</em>
</p><p>It's a trick.</p><p>
  <em>'...get him out of here...'</em>
</p><p>He's not dead.</p><p>
  <em>'...hide him...'</em>
</p><p>Malfoy is alive... and <em>so is Dumbledore.</em></p><p>
  <em>'...it is my wish, Harry, and my command...'</em>
</p><p>I know he's alive. All I have to do is find him.</p><p>I spring to my feet. </p><p>
  <em>'... you must promise me to protect him...'</em>
</p><p>I look down at Malfoy. I did, I promised. Did I have a choice? There's no time for that right now. I bend over Malfoy and grab his ankles. Though skinny, the bastard is heavy as fuck, and I barely manage to move him at first. My hands are shaking. </p><p>"Fuck, Malfoy," I grunt, dragging him into the corner behind the pillar, the very one Dumbledore threw me into. "You could get up and walk on your own, save me the trouble."</p><p>Staring at the ceiling, Malfoy doesn't reply. His head bumps over the uneven flagstones. Finally, I drop him in the corner and pause to catch my breath. I'm so thirsty; my tongue tastes of smoke and dust.</p><p>"I'll be right back," I tell Malfoy. I don't know whether he hears me. </p><p>I pluck the wand out of his grip and tuck it into the waistband of his trousers, covering him with the Invisibility Cloak. My boot bumps against something that clatters over the floor. Dumbledore's wand. I pick it up and dash to the door.</p><p> </p><p>The stench of smoke hits me on the staircase.</p><p>
  <em>Down, down</em>
</p><p>The echo of screams and firing curses roll along the deserted corridors.</p><p>
  <em>Hurry</em>
</p><p>A loud crash from the landing beneath.</p><p>
  <em>Almost there</em>
</p><p>Scattered footsteps, a heavy <em>bang!</em> of the great double doors.</p><p>The entrance hall is covered in debris, stone shards everywhere, gaps in the walls where the paintings have been. There's no one here. I run outside, catching up with people hurrying along the castle wall.</p><p>
  <em>Around, around</em>
</p><p>Past the greenhouses, past the back porch opening on the path to the Quidditch pitch.</p><p>Bushes flash past in a blur as I speed up.</p><p>
  <em>There</em>
</p><p>At the foot of the Astronomy Tower.</p><p>He must be there, among the people, he must be warning them about the Death Eaters’ attack. There - in the middle of the crowd - I'll find him. He is telling students not to be afraid, he is giving orders - to McGonnagal and Flitwick and Snape.</p><p>
  <em>No</em>
</p><p>
  <em>No Snape</em>
</p><p>
  <em>No Snape</em>
</p><p>I approach, pushing through the wall of backs that conceals him from me.</p><p>I must tell him. I must tell him that Snape is a traitor. He should know, he should never trust him again. </p><p>I feel faint, I feel funny, what's the matter with me?</p><p>Someone sobs - to my right and left. Everywhere. </p><p>
  <em>Where is Dumbledore?</em>
</p><p>Tall and straight as a spear, McGonagall is right in front of me. I stare at her messy bun of grey hair, loose strands falling in disarray over her back. I have never seen her so untidy, what-...</p><p>She turns.</p><p>Her dirty face is streaked with tears, twisted in a silent grimace of grief.</p><p>
  <em>"Harry."</em>
</p><p>She sounds wrong.</p><p>I shake my head. Whatever she is about to say - I don't want to know. <em>I don’t.</em></p><p>Where is?...</p><p>
  <em>Where is?...</em>
</p><p>McGonagall steps aside, revealing a patch of grass and <em>something</em> lying there. Something wrapped in cloth, and...</p><p>
  <em>"Where’s Dumbledore?!"</em>
</p><p>There's no reply.</p><p>I take a step forward to take a closer look. </p><p>It looks like a ragdoll... and something broken... and...</p><p>I kneel.</p><p>The world crashes down on my head.</p><p>"It's his plan... it's his plan," I repeat over and over, "it's his plan." Until my voice drowns in tears that choke me.</p><p>Later, much, much later, I realise that I am still clutching his wand.</p><p>I put it on his chest. "Your wand, sir."</p><p>In the night skies above, a phoenix sings.</p><p align="center">**</p><p>I try to raise my head and growl when it falls back and hits the stone floor. Sharp pain makes sparkles bloom before my eyes.</p><p>It's dark, and I am sprawled on the floor. I don't know where I am or how I got here. The last thing I remember...</p><p>A figure moves over me, moonlight glinting off glasses.</p><p>
  <em>What?...</em>
</p><p>"Potter?"</p><p>He looms, his face in the shadows, but I know it's Potter.</p><p>"Get up," he says, and when I don't move, he bends down and yanks at my arm. "Come <em>on,</em> Malfoy, get up."</p><p>He is rude and makes me grunt in pain. "Get <em>the fuck</em> up." There's something in his voice - blank and hollow - something that isn't Potter.</p><p>I sit up and then slowly get to my feet. My mind is hazy, and the queasiness makes me prop my hand against the wall for support.</p><p>"What happened?" I finally realise that we are on the balcony of the Astronomy Tower.</p><p>"Where's Dumbledore?"</p><p>"Dead."</p><p>I hear the word, but I don't understand what he means. It doesn't make any sense. </p><p>"No."</p><p>"Yes." Potter turns away. "We have to get out of here." His voice sounds... not like his voice. There's nothing in it. <em>Blank.</em></p><p>"But... how?..."</p><p>It's some wicked mistake, this can't be true. Dumbledore can't die, he couldn't. He wasn't supposed to die after I told him everything. My plan should have worked out, except he wasn't supposed to die. So he told me. </p><p>"Shut up and follow me." Potter bends down to rummage on the floor and straightens up again, holding something in his hands.</p><p>Panic grips me.</p><p>"I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on!" My voice echoes around the hollow room.</p><p>Potter slaps me, hard. I can't believe it. My ear rings and my cheek burns. </p><p><em>"Shut up!</em> Unless you want to get yourself killed." He throws his cloak over me. "You'll ask your questions later." He grabs my wrist, tugging me along.</p><p>"Where are we going?" I whisper, following him down the stairs. Better do as he says.</p><p>"The Room of Requirement," he whispers back. "You must not be seen."</p><p>I follow him in silence along the dark corridors, the sound of our feet on stone stark for the world to hear. When we finally enter the Room and the door blends into the wall, Potter turns to me and wrenches the Cloak off.</p><p>"Dumbledore's dead. Snape killed him," he says curtly, folding the Cloak many times until it is no larger than a handkerchief; he stuffs it in his pocket.</p><p>
  <em>Snape?</em>
</p><p>I gape at him, feeling strangely calm.</p><p>"He knocked you out and made it appear as though you were dead," Potter continues. </p><p>He drops into the armchair, and only then do I realise that the Room has taken the appearance of a cosy single bedroom with a narrow bed, an armchair, and a bedside table. There is even a little door on the back wall, very much like a bathroom door. A window on the wall shows a moonlit lawn and a grove in the distance. An illusion no doubt, as we are deep within the castle.</p><p>"Snape?" I blurt.</p><p>"Dumbledore." Potter studies his hands. "Before... Snape came in and killed him. He made me promise that I would protect you after... after his death. Bring you to safety, and..." He exhales shakily.</p><p>"You <em>knew</em> he would die?" I say dumbly. I am still standing by the door - by the wall where the door should be. Suddenly tired, I approach the bed and sit down.</p><p>"No, I didn't..." Potter takes his glasses off and pinches the bridge of his nose. "Just before you came in with the Death Eaters, Dumbledore cast a Full-Body Bind on me and covered me with my Cloak. He told me that you were acting on his orders, and he made me promise to protect you. <em>'In the end,'</em> - he meant... I don't know... Now, when I think of it, it sounded as though he knew he was going to die," Potter whispers miserably. "So it was his wish - his last wish - that I’d get you out of there. I... told them that you were killed on the Astronomy Tower, and the Death Eaters took your body when they fled. So I-"</p><p>Potter doesn't finish; with a sudden strangled cry, he falls off the armchair.</p><p>"Potter?!" I kneel beside him. "Potter, <em>what?!"</em></p><p>With a cry, he presses his fingers into his scar and throws his head back against the floor.</p><p>"Potter?!"</p><p>Wide-eyed, he stares right through me and hisses: <em>"Luciussss..."</em></p><p align="center">**</p><p>"Lucius, come." I beckon at the kneeling man, his blond hair tied at his nape with a black ribbon. "Rise, my friend, and be pardoned."</p><p>His eyes still lowered, Lucius rises to his feet with a bow. He does know the art of kneeling and bowing before his Master well, I have to give him that.</p><p>"Young Draco has done well and proven himself to be most loyal. Alas! The boy has died tonight, and nothing can bring him back." I raise my voice, surveying the semi-circle of people before me. "But I'll have you know that Draco Malfoy did not die in vain! He died fulfilling his task. The task of the utmost secrecy and importance I gave him. And is there a more honourable way to die than serving your Master until the very end, I ask you?" I pause, waiting for their reply.</p><p>"There isn't!" Bellatrix in the front row ardently presses her hands to her chest.</p><p>"You are right, Bella," I agree, "there isn't. Pray that everyone would be as willing to meet their death as young Draco. Lucius, I posthumously reward your son with the honour of being called my most faithful servant. You owe your pardon to him, remember that."</p><p>"I shall never forget, My Lord." Lucius bows even lower.</p><p>"You are dismissed," I say, and the man retreats to take his place in the semi-circle.</p><p>There's a dull sound of something hitting the floor and the crowd parts around Lucius.</p><p>"What is it?" I ask.</p><p>"Forgive me, my Lord, my wife is unwell," Lucius says, and I see a prone form on the floor. </p><p>"Is she in good health?" I frown.</p><p>"I am afraid not, my Lord. She fainted. She is unable to stand upright due to the fever. I beg your leave to deliver her to her chambers."</p><p>"Please do." I wave my hand at him. "Do take the utmost care of your wife until she is recovered and give Narcissa my best regards once she comes to her senses."</p><p>"Thank you, My Lord."</p><p>Still not looking up, Lucius snaps his fingers, and an elf appears in front of him. He gestures at his wife, and the three of them disappear from the hall.</p><p>"Very well." I clap my hands. "Now, Severus Snape. Come forward."</p><p>All in black as always, Severus steps out of the crowd and bows. "My Lord."</p><p>"Come, Severus." I beckon. "Come to your Master and be rewarded." I rise from the high chair and step down off the dais. </p><p>Severus approaches. Neither too slow nor too fast. He holds my gaze, moving at just the right pace. He doesn't cower, but he is never arrogant either. The perfect balance of power and obedience. Everything is measured. I even like it about the man.</p><p>"Welcome, my friend." I spread my arms wide as though for a hug. </p><p>Severus, however, knows better than to step into my arms. He stops a few paces away and bows low. "My Lord."</p><p>Perfect. I survey him for a moment. Now, isn't it a perfect servant that never gets on my nerves?</p><p>I clasp my hands in front of me. "Rise, my friend." </p><p>He does.</p><p>"Friends!" I address the crowd. "Today is a day of the utmost significance. The turning point of my rise and my enemies' downfall. Severus Snape has made it so. He slew Albus Dumbledore with his own hand." I begin to clap.</p><p>Instantly, applause explodes around the room.</p><p>His hands clasped behind his back, Severus looks straight ahead, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. Everyone is cheering, beaming at him. Everyone but Bellatrix. Her head bowed, she is standing motionless with her hands at her sides.</p><p>Now, this is interesting.</p><p>"Silence!" I wave my hand at them.</p><p>Instantly silence falls. Bellatrix looks up.</p><p>"You may speak, Bella." I gesture to her to come forward.</p><p>"My Lord." She kneels. "Forgive me, but let me voice my doubts."</p><p>"Doubts?" I frown. "Whom do you doubt?"</p><p>"Snape." She looks up, her black eyes gleaming.</p><p>"And what about him do you doubt?" I glance at Severus, whose face remains as calm as ever.</p><p>"His loyalty and devotion, My Lord."</p><p>Bella has always been suspicious. Of everyone and everything. She's recently grown jealous of Severus and the role I gave him, jealous of the place he's earned by my side. However, it won't do to dismiss even the tiniest thing. </p><p>"Rise and speak," I say.</p><p>She rises on her feet. "Severus Snape secretly made an Unbreakable Vow. He promised help and protection to Draco, lest he failed in the task you gave him, My Lord."</p><p>"Unbreakable Vow? To whom did he vow all that?"</p><p>"To my sister Narcissa Malfoy, My Lord."</p><p>"Is that true?" I turn to Severus. </p><p>"Yes, My Lord." He meets my eyes without even a hint of fear.</p><p>"Why, pray, I was never aware of that?"</p><p>"I beg your forgiveness, My Lord, but I took the liberty of agreeing to Narcissa's plea since either outcome would play to your benefit." </p><p>"And how is that?" I watch him closely. He doesn't fidget, doesn't show any sign of fear. </p><p>"Draco worked hard, there were high chances of him succeeding without my help. But should he have failed, the Vow would urge me to accomplish his task, hence your plan would prevail either way." Severus bows.</p><p>"Very clever," I agree. "But if <em>you</em> failed, Severus?" </p><p>"Then I would die."</p><p><em>"But you didn’t die!"</em> Bella snarls. "Draco is dead, and you are not. How is that?"</p><p>I turn to Severus. "True. How is that?"</p><p>"Where's the lie, Snape?" Bellatrix pokes him in the chest. "You can't break an Unbreakable Vow."</p><p>"I did," Severus says.</p><p>"Where's the trick?" Bella's eyes narrow as she fiddles with her wand.</p><p>"There's no trick." He looks me in the eyes, paying her no attention. "Only my will and my desire to serve My Lord."</p><p>"And how does your breaking the Vow that you swore to my sister serve our Lord?" The tip of Bella's wand presses under Severus' chin. He doesn't even flinch. Calm as a brick wall.</p><p>I should punish her for speaking ahead of me, but I find their banter far too amusing. Besides, Bella's jealousy is funny and her attempts to prove Severus' words false and win my favour over him entertain me to no end. He is not deceiving me, I've checked myself many times. Clean. But let Bella make an effort.</p><p>"What use would that be if I died with the boy? Draco died, and I completed his task as I swore to his mother. I broke the Vow and returned to your side, My Lord."</p><p>"My Lord, he is lying. He deceived Narcissa, and now he is deceiving you."</p><p>Severus grabs the tip of the wand pressing into his throat, wrenches it out of Bella's grip, and throws it on the floor. The wand clatters, rolling over the marble, and with a shriek, Bella dives after it.</p><p>"My Lord!" She scrambles on her feet, outraged. "Let me-"</p><p><em>"Silence,"</em> I cut her off.</p><p>"Severus." I turn to him. "Look at me."</p><p>He obeys. </p><p>
  <em>I dive.</em>
</p><p>His mind welcomes me, embraces me and rocks like the deepest waters of the dark ocean. He is well-trained and knows better than to resist. He lays everything bare, ripe for the taking.</p><p>I see the Unbreakable Vow, him hand-bound to Narcissa with the red string, Bella performing the ritual.</p><p>I see Dumbledore silently killing the boy in a green flash of light.</p><p>I see Severus casts Avada Kedavra, and the old man topples over the railings.</p><p>"Out of here!" Severus urges the group of Death Eaters.</p><p>With one last glance at Draco's body, he is gone.</p><p>I pull back in a rush. Severus flinches. I know his head hurts.</p><p>"Well, well... not as unbreakable as it seems.” I smile. “I am most pleased."</p><p>Severus bows. "My Lord."</p><p>His eyes turn grey, his hair blond, his face a mix of bewilderment and grave concern.</p><p>I realise I am lying on my back, staring at the ceiling, and Malfoy looms over me.</p><p>"Potter? Can you see me?" He waves his hand in front of my face.</p><p>No, Malfoy's dead. Dumbledore killed him, I saw it in Snape's mind, I...</p><p>"Potter?"</p><p>No, I didn't... It was not I who saw it, it was...</p><p>"Voldemort," I say, sitting up.</p><p>Malfoy flinches.</p><p>"Voldemort, he..."</p><p>"Don't say his name!"</p><p>"I saw him... I mean, through his eyes that... I saw Snape and..." My scar burns viciously, it is all I can do not to cry.</p><p>"Through <em>his eyes?!</em> What are you saying, Potter?"</p><p>"I was him, Vol..."</p><p>"Don't!" Malfoy yelps, shuffling on his knees backwards.</p><p>"In my vision I was <em>him.</em> He pardoned your father; he said you succeeded in your task. He thinks you are dead, he thinks Dumbledore killed you."</p><p>Malfoy stares at me in horror. "How?.."</p><p>"I don't know, sometimes I see what's happening to Vo... to <em>him</em> through his eyes."</p><p>"My mother," Malfoy whispers. "Is she alive?"</p><p>"Yes, I saw her, she's alive. She's well," I lie. </p><p>I can't, I don't want to explain that she fainted when I... when Voldemort said Malfoy was dead.</p><p>"But she thinks you are dead," I continue, slowly getting on all fours and then on my feet. The world tilts, and I catch myself on the armchair. </p><p>Bewildered, Malfoy stares at me, kneeling on the floor.</p><p>"They all do, <em>he</em> <em>– You-Know-Who-"</em> I feel stupid, saying the nickname, "he told them you died performing the task he gave you. That's why your parents were pardoned. So it's better if your mother thinks so. You are both safe, as long as they think you are dead." </p><p>I drop into the armchair, watching Malfoy sitting back on his heels on the floor. His face lowered, he blinks as though trying to ebb the tears away.</p><p>"Yes, you are right. It's better if she thinks I'm dead." He wipes his eyes with his palm.</p><p>With his dirty face and hair, in stained clothes and kneeling on the floor, he looks so miserable, that I suddenly realise I feel sorry for him and his mother. Can't bring myself to care for Lucius, though.</p><p>"Malfoy?" </p><p>He looks up.</p><p>"Dumbledore told me you were acting on his orders, performing the task he gave you. What task?" </p><p>Getting to his feet, Malfoy exhales shakily. He drags himself to the bed and collapses on his back.</p><p>"To let Death Eaters into Hogwarts," he says, staring at the ceiling.</p><p>"What?" I think I've misheard.</p><p>“To let Death Eaters into Hogwarts," he repeats.</p><p>"<em>Dumbledore?"</em> I ask dumbly.</p><p>"Dumbledore," Malfoy agrees.</p><p>"And what task did you have to perform for You-Know-Who? He said you succeeded."</p><p>"To let Death Eaters into Hogwarts."</p><p>I say nothing, I understand nothing anymore.</p><p>"To let them into Hogwarts." Malfoy hesitates. "And..."</p><p>"And?"</p><p>"Kill Dumbledore."</p><p align="center">**</p><p>When I enter the Room of Requirement, I see Malfoy curled on the bed with his back to me.</p><p>I approach and put the paper bag I've brought on the bedside table. He doesn't pay any attention.</p><p>"Here's some cheese and scones, apples, water," I say automatically. </p><p>I've brought him food because people must eat to stay alive, even if they are Malfoy, I reckon. But I don't really care if he eats it or not, if he lives or dies... except that I do. If he dies, I die, as long as my debt stands.</p><p>And maybe the idea is not that bad? To crawl into bed and close my eyes - I want nothing more right now, really - stop eating, stop talking, stop <em>anything,</em> and eventually cease to exist.</p><p>With a quiet sob and a sigh, Malfoy turns on his side to face me. "Thank you."</p><p>I drop into the armchair. "What am I going to do with you now?"</p><p>Malfoy doesn't reply. Sullen and puffy-eyed, he just looks at me. He's been crying a lot, I think dully. I recently cried a lot, too.</p><p>"Dumbledore told me to hide you, once he... once he was dead, that's what he meant, I think... he knew they were going to kill him." I wipe my eyes and force the lump in my throat down.</p><p>Malfoy sits up in the bed.</p><p>"What did he tell you? What were you going to do once you let them in?" I ask.</p><p>"He said, I only had to let them in and lead them to him, and he'd take care of the rest." His face is devoid of expression.</p><p>"But how did you let them in?"</p><p>"The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement. I fixed it. The other one is in <em>'Borgin &amp; Burkes'.</em> The link between the two connects the one to the other." Malfoy stares down at his hands, spreading out the duvet on his lap.</p><p>"So that's what you were doing there." I'm so tired, so very tired. </p><p>"He said, as soon as I make sure it worked properly, I should let him know and wait for his command. Here." Malfoy reaches into the front pocket of his shirt, retrieving a coin - an ordinary gold galleon. "I touched it with a spell, and it grew hot, and so did the one he kept so that he'd know I was ready. I had to go to the Room of Requirement and wait for his command. Yesterday morning, I sent him a message and waited. The coin grew hot only in the evening, so I went to <em>'Borgin &amp; Burkes'</em> and summoned...<em>them</em> and..." He shakes his head, his voice barely a whisper. "Led them here. He told me, he'd be waiting at the top of the Astronomy Tower, so we... went right there. And there he was - alone. I thought he'd call the Aurors. Nothing went as planned." Malfoy covers his eyes. "He talked wrong, and never tried to fight, and there was Aunt Bella... I didn't know what to do. Then he knocked me out with a spell, and..." He shrugs.</p><p>"Snape killed him," I finish for him, feeling nothing, nothing at all, only numbness. </p><p>"I have to go." I stand up. "I'll be back in a few days, I think. You must not leave the room. I told them that the Death Eaters took your body when they fled. So everyone here thinks you are dead, too." </p><p>"But... Potter... What am I going to do?" Malfoy asks in a panic.</p><p>"I don't know." I shrug. I really have no idea. I don’t think I care. "But I promised Dumbledore to help you, so... I must figure something out. Until then, you'd better stay here." I head to the door.</p><p>"Potter!"</p><p>Not looking at him, I shake my head and take the door handle. "Dobby!"</p><p>The elf appears with a pop. "Harry Potter! My friend!" He squeaks, taking off his ridiculous hat in greeting.</p><p>"Hello, Dobby." I try a smile. "May I ask you a favour?"</p><p>"Of course, Harry Potter!"</p><p>"Can you please take care of Malfoy here in my absence?" I gesture at the bed where Malfoy is gaping at us. "I mean... bring him food, and all... he may need." Hell if I know what Malfoy needs, it's not that I care, but I promised Dumbledore. "He must not leave this room until my return. I'll be back in a few days, I think. I have a... lot to do." I want to crawl into bed, take a Dreamless Sleep potion and sleep for ages, and forget this entire nightmare as if it never happened. I plan to do just that - the sleeping part.</p><p>"Yes. Dobby is happy to help his friend Harry Potter!"</p><p>"Thank you, Dobby." I press the handle when a sudden thought strikes me. Dobby is a free elf, after all, and can do as he pleases, so nothing really prevents him from... <em>Shit.</em></p><p>"And please, Dobby, <em>please,</em> don't do him any harm. Remember, Dumbledore forbade it; it was his last wish."</p><p>"Yes, Harry Potter. Dobby understand. Dobby remember."</p><p>This is all I can hope for now. "Thank you."</p><p>I leave without looking at Malfoy.</p><p>I should go back to my dorm and lie the fuck down because the pain in my scar is splitting my head in two. Instead, my feet carry me to the Astronomy Tower. I emerge at the top into the small empty room, the place where everything had turned into <em>'before'</em> and <em>'after'</em> mere hours ago. Breathing heavily after the climb, I lean against the railing and look down. I suddenly realise that I stand at the very spot where Dumbledore stood, touch the stone where he laid his hand, look down at the ground where he fell. There's nothing and no one there now. They carried the body away, I don't know where. Probably to his private chambers. It's still dark, but the dawn begins to gnaw at the black line of the Forbidden Forest. The world is still and silent. Empty. As empty as I am.</p><p>I don't know what to do now. Dumbledore has left me so many things to accomplish and figure out. But now I see no point. Without him, there is no way I will succeed. Without his command and guidance, without his wisdom and support. He always told me what to do, he was always <em>there... </em></p><p>I always did as he told me, always trusted him without question.</p><p>And now...</p><p>I am lost.</p><p>Blind </p><p>Ignorant</p><p>Fumbling helplessly in the dark</p><p>Scared</p><p>Alone</p><p>I sob and bend my face down over the void, feeling hot tears cooling on my skin in the morning breeze. When the sky turns white over the black forest, I finally step back and wipe my face. I really need to lie down.</p><p>A glimpse of something on the floor right next to my boot catches my eye, and I squat down to have a better look. A coin - an ordinary golden galleon. Very much like the one Malfoy showed me. I pick it up, put it in my pocket and finally head down the stairs.</p><p align="center">**</p><p>"Guys, there's something I have to tell you," I say on our way back from Dumbledore's tomb.</p><p>The funeral crowd recedes, groups of people moving to the gates.</p><p>I see Ginny's bright hair far ahead. We've talked with her and said our farewells. I'm leaving Hogwarts, and she's not coming with me. My chest tight, I breathe deeply, trying to school my face into calm. My eyes are about to betray me. Ron looks away. </p><p>No one would judge me now if I broke down and wept in front of them all. They would think my tears were for Dumbledore. But no. Since that dreadful night, I don't have any tears left for him. I shed them all. </p><p>I want to howl for Ginny, for Hogwarts, my life, for everything I haven't had and now am leaving behind. I don't know if I will ever come back to reclaim it.</p><p>I don't want to go. <em>I don’t.</em> I am so scared and tired and <em>fed up.</em></p><p>I don't know what I'm doing, <em>what's the plan?</em> There is no plan. I know nothing. Dumbledore had a plan, but he didn't live long enough to tell me.</p><p><em>He could have told me long ago,</em> the traitorous thought worms its way into my mind. <em>He had more than enough time to tell me everything if he wanted me to know.</em></p><p>Why didn't he do it? Why leave me like that - groping in the darkness for the shreds of knowledge that elude me at every turn?</p><p>I don't know, and he will never tell me.</p><p>"Harry? What is it?" Hermione asks, and I realise I've been staring into space for too long.</p><p>I don't know how to put it so they'd understand, I hardly understand it myself.</p><p>"What's the matter?" Ron frowns.</p><p>"There's this <em>thing</em> that Dumbledore had asked of me. Just before... he died." </p><p>I stop, and they stop with me. People are brushing past us, their faces grave.</p><p>"What thing?"</p><p>"Well..." I don't know where to begin. "I'd better show you."</p><p>They exchange glances and follow me to the castle.</p><p align="center">**</p><p>The opening door startles me. It's been a few days. How long? I don't know for certain. A week, maybe, or more, or less, I don't know. I’ve ceased to care. At first, I expected it to open any second. When Potter didn't come in a few hours and didn't come the next morning, and the next evening, and didn't come, and didn't come, and didn't come – I stopped waiting.</p><p>The elf brings me food three times a day. Our former elf. He gives me nasty looks but doesn't talk. I don't talk either. I'd never been as cruel to house-elves as my Father was, though as far as I recall, neither was I very nice. So I'd better keep my mouth shut. I began to add <em>'Thank you',</em> just in case, so that the wretched creature could never tell Potter I provoked him.</p><p>At first, I didn't leave the bed, though sleep wouldn't come. I lay, staring at the patch of bright blue skies outside of the window; as it faded into white and darkened to grey and deepened into black, dotted with stars, then paled into white, and gained blue again, and brightened, and repeated, repeated, repeated.</p><p>The sky is fake, there's no 'outside' behind the window. The window is fake, it's not a window. It's the Room playing tricks with me, so that I’ll find my prison pleasant. And pleasant it is.</p><p>Eventually, I had to get out of bed and visit the bathroom. That's where I saw the bath. A huge white marble basin with shining taps. It looked so inviting. I began to unbutton my shirt but then my hands stilled. What if Potter came and saw me in the bath, naked?</p><p>Potter wouldn't come. He left me here for good. He left me here to rot. I undressed and filled the bath with hot water and climbed in, and it felt really good... until my gaze dropped to my left forearm. I squeezed my eyes shut and wept. Not for taking the Mark, no. Maybe a little, though. For the mere pain alone, I would have never agreed to take it if I knew beforehand. On the eve before I was branded, my Father told me that if I endured the pain without screaming, it would very much please him. I promised I would try. <em>Haha.</em> I fainted halfway before the Dark Lord was done with me, and bore the rest without complaint. Though I doubt it pleased my Father much. The sheer agony of it... They say even Snape shrieked like crazy receiving the Mark.</p><p>I wept for my Mother and the thought that I'll never see her again. For her safety and mine - Potter said.</p><p>But what a life would that be?</p><p>I wept.</p><p>It was yesterday, I think, or a week ago, or perhaps it never happened and I dreamt it all.</p><p>So when the door opens <em>now,</em> when I am already certain it never will, I nearly lose my shit.</p><p>Potter enters. He looks better than when I last saw him, I give him that. Behind him, I see Granger's bushy hair and Weasel's red mop.</p><p>Why the hell bring them here?</p><p>They gape, and so do I.</p><p>Then I remember that I'm dead - as far as they must be aware - and rise from the armchair to show that I am pretty much alive and stand tall and proud so that they won’t take me for some stupid ghost.</p><p><em>"Malfoy."</em> Weasel's eyes bulge.</p><p>"Weasley."</p><p>"Harry?" Granger says faintly.</p><p>"So..." Potter gestures at me. "This is Malfoy."</p><p>"We know it is," Weasel supplies. "What the hell? You said he was dead."</p><p>Do I hear the regret in Weasel's voice, or merely disappointment?</p><p>"Urghm... long story." Potter scratches his head. "You'd better sit down."</p><p>We do. I lower myself back into the armchair. Granger and Weasel sit on <em>my</em> bed. Potter remains standing in the middle of the room.</p><p>"So." He crosses his arms over his chest. "Well... that time when I... used Sectumsempra on Malfoy in the bathroom..."</p><p>He tells them everything from the night in the hospital he came to apologise. I watch Granger's and Weasel's faces rather than listen... until he comes to the part of his conversation with Dumbledore after I left.</p><p>
  <em>The debt.</em>
</p><p>I stare at him.</p><p>So this is what it was. He didn't merely <em>'promise'</em> Dumbledore to protect me as he told me. He didn't have a choice, he still doesn't. If he fails to protect me, he dies. A chill spreads to my fingertips. I think I should laugh at the irony and mock Potter, tell him that this is what he deserves for gutting me in the bathroom. But then I remember how he came to apologise, and what had happened next. Everything's changed, and things are not quite what they seem. I realise I don't want to be mean to Potter, at least about this debt. If he didn't come that night, didn't persist, didn't drag me to Dumbledore - what would have become of me? Would things be any different? Dumbledore would have probably died anyway, only <em>I</em> would have killed him.</p><p>But what's the difference in the end? Either way, he is dead and nothing will bring him back.</p><p>"So Malfoy led Death Eaters in on Dumbledore's orders," Potter says, and his friends stare at me as though I've grown a pair of horns.</p><p>"Once they met on the Astronomy Tower, Dumbledore pretended to kill Malfoy and made me promise I'd help him. So now everyone thinks he's dead, and I brought him here.”</p><p><em>But hell if I know what to do with him,</em> Potter doesn't say.</p><p>"Bloody hell, Harry," Weasel says.</p><p>"What are you going to do with him?" Granger voices my thoughts.</p><p>I see that they both are not quite convinced of my agenda, and to say that they are not happy about it would be an understatement.</p><p>"I'm still here, in this room," I remind them sourly.</p><p>Fuck, why did Potter have to bring these two here? Was it absolutely necessary? They hate me, and not without a reason, I must admit. If Potter is counting on their help with the solution as to what to do with me, he is mistaken. His friends will only make everything worse. Worse for me.</p><p>Turns out, this is what Potter does - he expects Granger to figure things out for him. </p><p>"But..." Granger gives me a dirty look and turns to Potter. "Are you <em>sure,</em> Harry? How do you know he doesn't still serve You-Know-Who?" </p><p>
  <em>Here we go.</em>
</p><p>"She's right," Weasel joins.</p><p>She's wrong, but I can't prove it. Not to these two. Whatever I might have said or done would never be enough. And they don't even know yet I've got the Mark on my forearm.</p><p>But there is Dumbledore's word against their suspicions, and for Potter it outweighs their reasons.</p><p>"Dumbledore told me so," Potter replies, and I almost exhale in relief. Turns out, I’ve come to know Potter a little bit.</p><p>"But what if he was mistaken?" Granger insists. "He trusted Snape, Harry, and Snape killed him."</p><p>She's right, damn her. </p><p>
  <em>She’s right.</em>
</p><p>I still can't wrap my head around the fact that Snape managed to fool Dumbledore.</p><p>The three of them stare at me as though it was I who killed Dumbledore, but I have eyes only for Potter. There's something in his face... and I remember that night by the lake when I broke down in front of him. He didn't tell them, he just said that he <em>'persuaded'</em> me to go to Dumbledore. He is probably thinking the same, weighing the chances whether all that was pretend, whether I only played the part and faked everything: my tears, my terror, my desperation, my fear for my Mother's life. Potter stares and stares and I stare back. <em>Fuck him,</em> I may have proved myself to be a coward and a weakling and earned nothing but his contempt, but I'll have him know, that night by the lake I wasn't false.</p><p>"No," he finally says, not breaking eye contact, "in this Dumbledore wasn't mistaken."</p><p>"How do you know, Harry?!" Weasel rises to his feet.</p><p>"<em>I know,"</em> Potter snaps, "and, besides, I am bound to protect his life anyway. I need a place to hide and keep him, once we leave Hogwarts."</p><p>"I'm still here, Potter," I remind him.</p><p>"Oh, <em>shut up."</em> He cringes and goes to sit down on the bed next to Granger.</p><p>"Hermione, I need your help to figure it out. I can't leave him wandering around unprotected. Dumbledore said if something happened to him, I'd die."</p><p>"What the hell, <em>why?"</em> Weasel says, annoyed, heading to stare out of the window.</p><p>Shit, the pig-head pisses me off. <em>"Because</em> Potter almost spilled my entrails out on the floor and nearly killed me, Weasley, and now he bears the consequences."</p><p>"<em>Almost</em> and <em>nearly</em>." Weasel rolls his eyes. "Listen, <em>you..."</em> His hands clench into fists. "If he had killed you, everything would be much simpler, you know."</p><p>"Ron!" Granger raises her voice.</p><p>"Ron," Potter adds.</p><p>
  <em>"What?!" </em>
</p><p>"Listen to yourself." Granger shakes her head. "And besides... Malfoy is right. It is only fair... the way it is," she adds reluctantly, "it is just."</p><p>Granger is just; I have to give her that. If anything, she is just.</p><p>"What am I going to do with him?" Potter asks. "He can't stay here forever."</p><p>"Maybe he can?" Weasel suggests, glaring at me. "Leave him here to rot. It's not the worst way to rot anyway..." He plucks a grape from the fruit bowl on the windowsill and stuffs it into his mouth.</p><p>There is no lack of food, though I barely eat. The elf brings it and takes it away thrice a day. </p><p>Weasel chews noisily, and I grind my teeth, wishing I could punch his ugly mouth.</p><p>"Where's the guarantee he won't leave Hogwarts and go wandering around, getting himself killed? Or he may even return to You-Know-Who's side," Granger says grimly.</p><p>"Hermione's right." Potter rubs his eyes under the glasses. "I need him where I can keep an eye on him."</p><p>"Grimmauld Place? I don't know...perhaps?" Granger offers uncertainly.</p><p>
  <em>Grimmauld Place? </em>
</p><p><em>What the hell? The ancestral home of the Black family? Is she mad? What does it have to do with her?</em> I think but hold my tongue.</p><p>Potter looks at her, eyes narrowed. </p><p>"The Order doesn't-" she continues eagerly until Potter puts his palm on her thigh and squeezes, urging her to stop talking.</p><p>"I get it." He throws me a brief look. "You are probably right, but I need to check first."</p><p>The three of them exchange glances, and I know there's more to it than I'm aware of. Whatever it is, they are not about to tell me.</p><p align="center">**</p><p>Unable to sleep, I toss on the sofa over and over, winding the blanket around my legs. Fuck. I sit up to disentangle myself. The faint moon throws barely a hint of light from the window. This place is dark and creepy, and most certainly cursed. </p><p>I hate it.</p><p>I'd rather prefer the cosy bedroom the Room of Requirement provided for me at Hogwarts. At least the space was small and clean, and I felt perfectly safe there. Yet, here I am. In the vast living room of the ancestral home of the House of Black, tossing on the ancient sofa. I couldn't bring myself to sleep in one of the bedrooms on the upper floors. Potter said I may take whichever room I want. So the living room it is.</p><p>Several weeks ago, he dragged me out of bed in the middle of the night. A house-elf stood beside him, the most ancient and ugly one I’ve ever seen.</p><p>“You’re leaving Hogwarts,” Potter said, “Kreacher will apparate you to a safe place.”</p><p>“What place?” I tried to blink the grogginess away.</p><p>“My house. Come on, get dressed.”</p><p>“Your house? Your Muggle relatives’ house?”</p><p>“No, my own house. Come on, Malfoy.”</p><p>I had no idea Potter owned a house. “Okay.”  I grabbed my clothes from the armchair and headed to the bathroom to change out of my pyjamas. I dressed as quickly as I could, wary of asking more questions, for they obviously annoyed Potter.</p><p>The house belonged to him, he explained as soon as I emerged from the bathroom, and was under the Fidelius Charm, so no one could Apparate in and out. He inherited it from Sirius Black, Mother's madman of a cousin, who happened to be Potter's godfather to boot. It was plainly written in Sirius' will that after his death Potter would get everything in his possession. That meant the house was his, as well as Kreacher, who obviously hated his new master, though he was bound to serve anyway.</p><p>I would stay in the house for the time being, Potter said. For how long - he didn't know. He had to return to his Muggle relatives until his seventeenth birthday. He’d turn of age at the 31st of July and then... He didn't know what then. He had a lot of things to do and no idea how long it would take to complete them.</p><p>What things? It was stupid of me to ask. I did anyway. He didn't tell me.</p><p>So Kreacher apparated me out of Hogwarts and brought me here. Potter hasn’t visited ever since. My only company in this creepy old place is the creepy old elf. The house drives me mad. Huge, ugly and dingy - scary. I chose the living room's sofa as my sleeping place. I don't care for the upper floors, for the grand staircase with the house-elves' heads on pikes along its walls.</p><p>Kreachers serves food and never talks. Potter had ordered him not to. Days pass in the gloomy silence and sounds of the elf moving about the kitchen. Nights pass in distorted sleep and nightmares.</p><p>I think of Potter and Dumbledore, of Snape and my Father, of what's happening out there while I rot in this place - I have no clue.</p><p>But mostly I think of my Mother. </p><p>I ceased crying long ago. In that tiny bedroom at Hogwarts, in another life, I wept all my tears out. I am barren and hollow and not alive. What's the point? I sometimes ask myself. What's the point of hiding and sitting here, if I could leave the house and breathe... or get caught, or killed - I barely care.</p><p>Barely, but still. </p><p>I still don't have the courage to make that final step.</p><p>I trudge on.</p><p> </p><p>One day, when I heard the door opening, I completely lost my shit. The sound was in the Entrance Hall, and for a second my heart leapt, expecting Potter... but then Dumbledore's damned <em>shadow</em> rose on the threshold and Mrs. Black's portrait started to shriek, but then all the noise abruptly died down. I instantly knew it wasn't Potter. Whoever it was, they must not see me. In a panic, I sprang on my feet, not knowing where to hide. The footsteps were approaching, and the living room door stood open, offering me on display. But then Kreacher was there; he waved his hand, covering us both with a Disillusionment Charm. My heart in my throat, I stood there, watching as Snape emerged and headed briskly up the main staircase. He came back in some fifteen minutes and left the house the same way he arrived.</p><p>Hell if I know what that meant. For a few days, I was jumpy and anxious, expecting his return any minute. He never came back, so eventually, I'd ceased to fret.</p><p>I lie back down on the sofa and close my eyes, beginning to drift, when the door bangs. Mrs. Black's portrait shrieks and I hear the <em>swoosh</em> of Dumbledore's shadow and... <em>voices.</em></p><p>I go cold.</p><p>There are a few of them.</p><p>
  <em>DEATH EATERS.</em>
</p><p>If Snape can enter the house, surely others can.</p><p>"Shut <em>up,</em> you ugly, old..." the voice rises, and the portrait falls silent.</p><p>My limbs turn to jelly with relief.</p><p>
  <em>Granger.</em>
</p><p>I sit up on the sofa.</p><p>".... Hermione," Potter says. </p><p>Potter.</p><p>
  <em>Potter, Potter!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Finally.</em>
</p><p>I don't know what's the matter with me, but Potter's voice sends my mind reeling, sends my heart racing, fills me with hope. <em>Finally. </em>I realise all this time I've been waiting for his return. And now I'm alive again.</p><p>The light flares on, and I stare at the three of them in the doorway. Grim, stony-faced, all three hold me at the wand point. We stare at each other in silence. Potter is the first to lower his wand.</p><p>"Malfoy," he says warily, looking me up and down, and I want to squirm in my pyjamas.</p><p>Granger lowers her wand, but Weasel doesn't.</p><p>Potter tucks his wand in his pocket and heads to the armchair. With a sigh, he collapses, rubbing at his scar. "Kreacher!"</p><p>The elf appears. "Master."</p><p>"Ron, lower your wand," Potter says. Reluctantly, Weasel obeys.</p><p>"Kreacher, we are staying here - my friends and I."</p><p>The elf nods and disappears.</p><p>Potter's face is smeared with dirt, his hair dusty as though debris fell on his head. Granger is no better.</p><p>"What's happened?" I blurt.</p><p>"None of your business," Weasel snaps, dropping down in another armchair.</p><p>"We got attacked at the wedding," Potter replies, "there's a Trace on me. We have to stay here for the time being.</p><p>"Wedding?" I repeat dumbly. </p><p>"Ron's brother's wedding. Scrimgeour is dead; the Death Eaters have taken the Ministry." Potter's voice is hollow. "We left immediately, and now we can't go back without drawing attention. It's too dangerous for anyone to associate with me."</p><p>"With <em>us,"</em> Granger corrects him.</p><p>Potter stands up. "Kreacher!" </p><p>The elf reappears.</p><p>"Do you have something strong? I mean... a drink - Firewhisky?"</p><p>"Yes, Master." The elf snaps his fingers, and a bottle swims in the air through the doorway surrounded with four glasses.</p><p>"Thank you, Kreacher."</p><p>Potter grabs the bottle and a glass, pouring generously and handing it to Granger. She gives him a grim look.</p><p>"Fuck, we need it right now," Potter says, taking the second glass and filling it for Weasley. I see his hands are shaking. He spills a bit and licks it off his fingers. He fills the next one and sends it in my direction. "There, Malfoy."</p><p>I grab it out of the air, mumbling, "Thanks."</p><p>Potter fills his glass and puts the bottle down onto the floor. He raises his glass briefly, not in a toast, but as though in an afterthought, then throws his head back and swallows the contents in one go. </p><p>I do the same. The fiery liquid burns its path down my throat and spreads in my chest. I hear Granger coughing and press my palm to my mouth to wait the burn out. When I look up at Potter, he is staring down into his empty glass. As though feeling my gaze, he looks up and our eyes meet.</p><p>When he nods at me, and I nod back... <em>I know.</em></p><p>Whatever it is - I know - <em>it has begun</em></p><p align="center">**</p><p>They plot something, I know. The three of them. They will never tell <em>me</em> - the outcast.</p><p>They shut themselves in the kitchen, often summon Kreacher, and talk, talk, talk. Whisper when I'm around, giving each other signs. Fall silent whenever I so much as glance in their direction. Cryptic conversations:</p><p>
  <em>'...locket, diary, ring...'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>'...ring, diary, locket...'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>'...fake...'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>'...seven...six...four...'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>'...Dumbledore...'</em>
</p><p>
  <em>'...R.A.B...'</em>
</p><p>Once I even heard someone else there in the kitchen, a man's voice. People talking over each other, shouts and commotion. But when they emerged, there were only three of them. </p><p>In fact, there are neither four of us in the house, nor <em>'the trio'</em> and I. It's ‘two’, ‘one’ and ‘one’. </p><p>Granger and Weasley are so obvious that even <em>I</em> cringe and feel half-annoyed with Potter and half-sorry for him when he doesn't see when he is being a third wheel. I can't say I mind that much though. Caught up in each other, Weasley and Granger don't pay me much attention. Their distracted indifference is better than their hostility.</p><p>Potter's got to side with me in that regard. I don't mind. He talks to me sometimes and overall doesn't act like I don't exist. When he looks in my direction, he looks <em>at me,</em> not through me like his friends do. It's far from calling it a 'friendship' or even 'getting along'. He is cautious and never talks much; we keep our distance, but somehow I feel that Potter doesn't hate my guts, not anymore. I don't think I hate him either.</p><p>I feel utterly useless. In the evenings, I used to retreat to the living room balcony - to stay out of the way. Just like now. I sit on the floor with my back to the wall and listen to the whispering of trees in the dark back garden. I don't know how long I've been sitting like that. Hours. I inhale deeply. The air is sweet with summer and reminds me of the Manor gardens and our strolls with Mother in the twilight.</p><p>Mother. I try to will the thoughts of her away. I am afraid of these thoughts. I know I will probably never see her again. As long as I am 'dead', she is safe and so am I. Everyone gains, really, if I am dead.</p><p>The thought strikes me that, had I died, had I ceased to exist, it would have made no difference to anyone, including me. I can hardly call this a life - the way I live now. I'm weak and useless, and everyone hates me. Well, Potter doesn't, or so I wish to think, but it makes no difference in the end. There is a chance, of course, that Potter may defeat the Dark Lord and save us all from this misery... but honestly, I don't believe it. He is doomed; he probably knows it, too.</p><p>I stretch my legs out in front of me on the stone floor of the balcony and wince as pins and needles prickle my toes. I've been sitting here for too long. I get on my feet and reach for the door handle. </p><p>When I slip into the living room, it's completely dark. I take a step forward and stop dead because there's rustling on the sofa. A sigh and... hot breathing, and... kissing sounds... <em>"Ron..."</em></p><p>
  <em>Oh shit</em>
</p><p>Granger and Weasley are doing <em>it</em>.</p><p>Unaware of me on the balcony, they have come here, while I was unaware of them.</p><p>"Nghhh..." Weasley grunts, and there as a metallic click of a belt unbuckling.</p><p>
  <em>Fuuuck</em>
</p><p>Now what?</p><p>"Touch me."</p><p>Strangely aroused and disgusted at the same time, I silently step back, intending to retreat to the balcony and wait it out until they are done, when the lights in the room flare on. </p><p>Potter is blinking in the doorway with his hand on the switch.</p><p>Granger is straddling Weasley on the sofa, her T-shirt up under her armpits. His fly undone, Weasley's hands fondle her small tits in a black bra. The two of them gape at Potter and me in turns.</p><p>My face burning, I look away and meet Potter's eyes. In silence, we stare at each other across the room. </p><p>"Sorry," he utters, his face horrified, steps back out of the room and slams the door.</p><p>The pair on the sofa turns to me. Granger slides off Weasley's lap and tugs her T-shirt down.</p><p>I dash past them to the door and switch the lights off on my way out. <em>Shit... </em>I stride into the hall... No doubt they thought I was deliberately standing there all along, getting off like a pervert. I turn the corner and head down the steps to the basement. When I enter the kitchen, Potter is there at the table with his face crimson and bewildered eyes.</p><p>
  <em>Fuck</em>
</p><p>I turn on the spot and exit, hurrying up the steps, back along the hall, past the damned living room door and up the staircase to my bedroom. I've used the living room as my sleeping place before, but when Potter and those two had returned, I moved to the bedroom on the first floor, just to the right of the staircase. It's dark and shabby, and I don't like it. Not that I particularly care.</p><p>I flop on my bed and close my eyes. Why is it always my wretched luck? Once I walked in on Blaise sucking off Theo Nott. Last Christmas when I stayed at Hogwarts. They were experimenting, Blaise told me later.</p><p>Potter's friends would be better <em>experimenting</em> in their bedroom.</p><p align="center">**</p><p>The next day, none of us speaks to each other. The awkward silence hangs in the air, our embarrassment palpable.</p><p>Weasley and Granger usually never address me, that's nothing new, but now they don't speak to Potter either.</p><p>Potter, in turn, avoids everyone's eyes and only clears his throat.</p><p>After dinner, I walk out through the kitchen door to sit on the porch in the backyard. I need fresh air, and now I'd better avoid the living room balcony. Let them fuck on the sofa to their hearts’ content.</p><p>In half an hour, twilight gives way to the darkness, and the garden lamp above the porch switches on. I prop my chin on my knee and sit and sit and sit.</p><p>The door creaks open, and I look over my shoulder. Potter.</p><p>Seeing me, he makes a move to leave, but then says: "Do you mind if I sit down?"</p><p>"No," I reply and stand up to leave.</p><p>"No, stay," Potter says, lowering himself on the steps. "Really, Malfoy, stay."</p><p>I shrug and stay.</p><p>We sit.</p><p>"At least here we won't get in the way," Potter breaks the silence and nods at the house.</p><p>"Yeah," I agree. "Last night..." I clear my throat. "I wasn't there on purpose, no matter what they think. I spent the evening on the balcony, and when I went back, they were there. I had no idea."</p><p>"I know," Potter says. "It's so... awkward, you know..." He picks at the grass that grows between the stone tiles. "We've always been together, you see, the three of us. Until now, when they... when they're <em>together,</em> and I am no longer a part of it. Sometimes I feel like... an outcast. It's stupid, I know, but..." He trails off.</p><p>"It's not stupid," I say, "it's... normal, I guess." I turn to him. "To feel the way you do."</p><p>Potter gives me a long look. "It's not like I'm <em>jealous</em> or... anything, and I'm happy for them, truly, but..." He shrugs, looking away.</p><p>"You feel lonely," I say, suddenly realising it's true. </p><p>"I... yes. Yes, you’re right."</p><p>We say nothing for some time, then: "Do you have a girlfriend?" Potter asks.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Me neither," he says quietly.</p><p>"You dated Weasley's sister."</p><p>"We broke up."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Reasons," he says, "I just... I broke up with her, to keep her safe. It's dangerous to associate with me. For anyone, let alone my 'official' girlfriend." He makes quotes in the air. I guess I hear the bitterness in his voice.</p><p>"The wedding... was the last time we met, and... and she kissed me."</p><p>"For the first time?" I mumble. </p><p>It's so embarrassing to have this conversation with Potter, but tonight he seems to be in a rare mood for talking, and I don't mind. I'm fed up with silence. Let him talk. I prop my chin on my hand.</p><p>"No." Potter shakes his head. "Not for the first time, of course... but she <em>kissed</em> me, you know... like she never kissed me before."</p><p>I look at him sideways, at his profile in the mellow light of a garden lamp. With all that talk of kissing, my gaze immediately falls on his mouth. On his full lower lip, on his upper lip, on its precisely cut bow. He is saying something, but I hardly listen, imagining those lips meeting the other lips and <em>touching</em>, caressing, opening up under someone's kiss, kissing back, back, back, letting tongues slide together <em>and...</em> For some reason, I don't like this idea of Weasley's sister kissing Potter like <em>that </em>- the way he put it - like she never kissed him before. This whole thing about Potter kissing embarrasses me. Not kissing, but <em>Potter kissing. </em></p><p>I've never kissed anyone, I mean... Pansy in our fifth year doesn't count. She just insisted that she needed practice, and I, as a good friend, absolutely must help her out. So it wasn't real kissing.</p><p>Now, staring at Potter, there's this weird certainty in my guts, that if he offered to make out - right here and now - I wouldn't mind at all. I have no idea where it comes from, but it feels perfectly fine and I'm sure I would like it a lot. <em>Now. With Potter.</em></p><p>It's probably because for a while Potter has been the closest person to me. In fact, he's the only person I ever talk to; the only one who is aware that I exist and acknowledges my presence, who doesn't recoil as though I'm diseased every time he lays eyes on me. It has to make some kind of connection. I consider Potter <em>mine,</em> I guess. My <em>what?</em> I don't know. <em>My person?</em> The mere notion is ridiculous as I'm thinking about it. But I definitely don't like to imagine Potter being kissed by Weasley's sister. I look away.</p><p>"That's when I realised," he continues, unaware of my inner turmoil, "that if I indulged in it for another moment, I would have never left her, would have never had the courage to walk away. That she could have persuaded me to take her with me, and I couldn’t risk her life and safety."</p><p>I am really glad that Weasley girl isn't here with us, but my stomach sinks anyway. Because Potter has just all but confirmed my suspicions: they are on a mission, the three of them; secret and dangerous, one that includes no one else.</p><p>"You're leaving soon," I turn to him.</p><p>"I don't know, maybe... er... probably yes. Eventually, we might." He looks at me, surprised at the sudden change of topic. "How do you know?"</p><p>"I'm not blind." I shrug. "Or deaf, or stupid. I notice things." Not looking at him, I fiddle with my wand. "You’re going to leave me behind."</p><p>He doesn't deny it.</p><p>I despair. He will leave me here and I can do nothing. I'll have to stay in this wretched house forever. I have nowhere else to go, my Mother thinks I’m dead anyway, and at least here I'm safe. Not like it does me any good. This safety isn’t any better than prison.</p><p>"What am I going to do once you leave?" I finally bring myself to ask. "I can't stay here forever."</p><p>"Why not? You can." Potter turns to me. "You can't go with us and... this <em>thing,</em> my debt... it would be better if I knew you were safe and I didn't have to look out for you."</p><p>I know he's right.</p><p>Of course he is.</p><p>I can't go with him, and I don't think I'm too eager to go either, but the prospect of staying trapped here alone makes me feel doomed. </p><p>I want to cry.</p><p>I won't cry. I'm done crying in front of Potter. </p><p>"You're right." I stand up and open the kitchen door. "Goodnight.”</p><p align="center">**</p><p>I've taken up the habit of sitting on the back porch with Malfoy in the evenings. After the epic embarrassment with Ron and Hermione two weeks ago, things had gotten back to normal, but I avoid getting in their way, trying to give them the privacy they need.</p><p>"Do you like to play the third wheel?" Malfoy asked me once. "That's what you are doing."</p><p>"I'm not!" I protested, though deep down I knew I was.</p><p>"You are." He shrugged.</p><p>"Okay, I am," I agreed.</p><p>But I've stopped doing that ever since. At least, I've been trying to.</p><p>So I spend evenings with Malfoy on the back porch by the kitchen door. He's not that bad. He's not bad at all. I've come to appreciate his company.</p><p>I know he hates being excluded, hates that we never tell him anything of our plans. But it's the way things are, I cannot help it.</p><p>"Tomorrow morning we’re planning to go somewhere, do things," I say, and I know what his reaction will be. Though he tries not to show it, I know he's afraid to be left behind. "If everything goes as planned, we'll be back by lunchtime."</p><p>He looks up. "And if not?"</p><p>"It will," I say and look away. I don't want to think about all the 'what ifs' if something goes wrong, lest I lose my determination to go at all. Hermione's plan of ambushing the Ministry is madness, but it's not like we have a better one. And we need that locket.</p><p>"You are not returning," he says quietly.</p><p>"No, I mean, we plan to... sort something out and return. We hope that nothing goes wrong."</p><p>"Where?" Malfoy asks. He picks at the grass between the tiles and throws it in front of him on the steps. </p><p>I follow the movements of his hand with my eyes. "The Ministry," I finally say after a hesitation. Hermione would kill me if she heard me now. I wouldn't blame her, she has more than enough reasons to hate and mistrust Malfoy.</p><p>Do I trust him?</p><p>I don't know. However, I don't distrust him completely anymore, this much I can tell. And I see no harm in telling him about the Ministry. It's not like I've told him about Horcruxes or anything. <em>Besides, if we get into trouble, he's the only person who knows of our whereabouts,</em> says the treacherous thought. I try not to dwell on it.</p><p>"The <em>Ministry?!"</em> Malfoy raises his voice in a whisper. "Are you fucking <em>insane?</em> You are going to get yourself killed."</p><p>"It's dangerous, yes, but we have to. There's no other way to bring Vol... You-Know-Who down."</p><p>"I’m not even going to ask what you're going to do there." Malfoy shakes his head.</p><p>"It’s better if you don’t," I agree. "Trust me."</p><p>We sit in silence for a long time.</p><p>It's getting late, and I need a good rest; we plan to set out in the early morning. I get to my feet. "I'm going to bed."</p><p>Malfoy stands up, too. </p><p>"Good luck, Potter." He offers his hand.</p><p>I shake it. "Thanks."</p><p>He nods and sits back down on the steps.</p><p>I look at his back and hunched shoulders, at his blond hair, golden in the lamplight. Uneasiness lodges in my chest, ties my stomach in knots. He's right, it's madness, and chances are high that we won't return.</p><p>"See you, Malfoy," I say to his back and leave.</p><p align="center">**</p><p>They left this morning. I saw them through the window, Disapparating from the front porch. </p><p>I wait and wait. And <em>wait.</em> I've been standing by the window for hours. It is lunchtime, they left at eight.</p><p>I despair.</p><p>And wait, and watch the front porch, expecting to see them reappear any moment, ceasing to hope that they will.</p><p><em>Please, let them come back,</em> I pray to some unknown power, repeating the words over and over. <em>Please, make them come back.</em> </p><p>
  <em>Bring Potter back.</em>
</p><p>Standing here, staring at the porch, I realise that I'm not only afraid of what would become of me if I'm left alone. I am also afraid for Potter, afraid that something may happen to him. I have no one but Potter, and now when he's gone, I am alone in the world, lost.</p><p>
  <em>Please, make him come back.</em>
</p><p>As though having heard my prayers, Potter appears on the porch. I cry out in relief, ready to dash there and throw the door open and drag him inside.</p><p>Weasley is gripping Potter's shoulder, holding Granger's hand, but... I see Yaxley appearing behind, clutching at the hem of Granger's jacket. Granger kicks him sideways, and the three of them suddenly disappear, leaving Yaxley alone on the porch. Everything happens in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Yaxley grabs the door handle.</p><p>I bolt out, away from the window, aware that he is already opening the door.</p><p>There is a <em>crash!</em> in the hall, a <em>swoosh,</em> Yaxley swears, and Mrs. Black begins to yell.</p><p>I dash down the stairs to the basement, praying that her shrieks cover the noise I make. When I wrench the kitchen door open, by the sounds from the hall I realise Yaxley is dealing with Dumbledore's shadow. I sprint across the kitchen to the backyard and shut the door, leaning with my back against it, and try to catch my breath. Insane with terror, I realise that Yaxley is going to search the house. Even if he doesn't intend to do it right now, he'll let Death Eaters do it later, now that Fidelius has failed. </p><p>In a panic, I rush forward and stumble over the steps, falling face forward into the grass with my wand in my outstretched hand. Something stings my chest through the front pocket of my shirt. I reach into the pocket and retrieve a golden galleon. The coin is very hot, it stings, it burns my fingers, and I almost drop it... but the next moment darkness swirls me away.</p><p align="center">
