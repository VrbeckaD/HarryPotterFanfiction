    <p>“Essentially, the program is designed to be completed in two years, so the tuition waiver applies to enough hours to cover two years of study. You should aim to take around 9 hours per semester, and consider taking summer classes, depending on what you’re thinking thesis-wise—creative, of course, or degree paper.”</p><p><br/>
The woman—Dr. McMankin? McMurphin? Mc—something or other—paused, finally, giving Remus time to catch up in his notes.</p><p><br/>
He’d just finished write <em>decide on thesis</em> when she started in again.</p><p><br/>
“We do have Graduate Assistants who overstay their welcome. If you take longer than eight years to complete the program, your tuition waiver becomes invalid.”</p><p><br/>
Remus wrote <em>finish in 8</em> around the time that the guy behind him flicked his ear. He jumped, and craned his neck to glare at the offender.</p><p><br/>
“Hey.”<br/>
</p><p>It was a stage whisper at best, and Remus swore he saw Dr. Mc—McGoon? Maybe? glare at him before he returned his attention to the stage-whisperer.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, d’you have any sweets on you? Only, my mate James’s a diabetic and—”<br/>
</p><p>“I thought you were the diabetic—” This came from the stage-whisperer’s right. The stage-whisperer froze, and then turned to glare.<br/>
</p><p>“Excellent, well <em>done</em>, Pete. Ever heard of a cover? You’re supposed to be into “reading between the lines” and all that, aren’t you, you fuc—”<br/>
</p><p>The stage-whispering had escalated to this point, and had drawn the attention of Dr. Mc—McGarland? Mc—whatever her name was had noticed and had stopped talking and—<br/>
</p><p>“Mr. Black, isn’t it?”<br/>
</p><p>Stage-whisperer froze, caught with his proverbial hand in the proverbial cookie jar.<br/>
</p><p>“Er—”<br/>
</p><p>“And Mr. Lupin, Mr. Pettigrew, Mr. Potter, yes?”<br/>
</p><p>Remus flinched at the use of his name, and in that moment, he decided that he did not like or care for Mr. Black or his friends and he would, for as long as he lasted in the program, never forgive them for getting him called out at graduate student orientation.<br/>
</p><p>(*)<br/>
</p><p>This ultimatum lasted for a grand total of two hours.<br/>
</p><p>They had to meet with Dr. Slughorn after Dr. McGonagall had lectured them all on the importance of being organized, and Dr. Slughorn had tried to explain his (overly confusing) computer lab schedule, before “leaving them to it” and waddling out of the classroom they were meeting in to his office.<br/>
</p><p>“Reckon he’s gone to get a drink, then,” one of the boys who’d asked Remus for chocolate at the orientation said. It wasn’t stage-whisperer--Mr. Black--but one of the others. “Right, who’s got a tack?”<br/>
</p><p>Remus rolled his eyes and turned his chair away from the group, turning into a group of girls.<br/>
</p><p>“Remus, right?” one of them asked. She was generically pretty, Remus supposed--blonde hair, nice smile. “I’m Marlene.”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, Remus--I’m Remus. Nice to meet you.”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re in poetry, yeah? I’m in poetry as well, suppose it’s the two of us.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ah, excellent,” Remus said with a smile. “Wondered if I was the lone poet--not the first time.”<br/>
</p><p>Marlene chuckled. “Not hardly. There’s two other second-years, but we’re the two incoming. You’ve met with Kettleburn, then?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, for a bit,” Remus said. “He always that--”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah.” Marlene grinned. “He’s a good sort, though. Anyway, this is Dorcas and Amelia.”<br/>
</p><p>Remus offered the girls a wave and they turned to their respective schedules.<br/>
</p><p>(*)<br/>
</p><p>“There’s got to be an easier way to organize this,” Remus said finally, to no one in particular, after staring at the sheet long enough that he could feel a tension headache building, and he despaired of knowing where he was to be teaching and, furthermore, where to tell his students to report to.<br/>
</p><p>Marlene leaned over her desk with her pencil in hand.<br/>
</p><p>“Look here, if you just think of it as a poorly formatted word document—” Marlene drew a few lines, connecting the times and places. “See? Doesn’t that help?”<br/>
</p><p>“Doesn’t what help?” Stage-whisperer was back, this time leaning over Remus’ desk. Remus fought the urge to cover the sheet Marlene’d just clarified for him with his arms.<br/>
</p><p>Instead, he opted for quiet passive-aggression. “Sorry,” he said stiffly, and not sorry at all. “Didn’t realize Marlene hadn’t shared her tip with the class.”<br/>
</p><p>“On my way to,” she said with a grin, completely missing Remus’ point and standing, flouncing off to the next group, leaving Remus alone with stage-whisperer.<br/>
</p><p>“Look, I believe we’ve gotten off on the wrong foot, yeah?”<br/>
</p><p>“What gave you that idea?” It was as snootily dismissive as Remus could manage (which, all told, wasn’t all that snooty or dismissive, but he was trying).<br/>
</p><p>“Listen, I know you think I’ve ruined things for you with Dr. McGonagall—” (right, Remus filed away internally, that was her name) “—but in my experience good ol’ Minerva’s the forgiving type. And, in my defense, you look like the sort of bloke to carry sweets with you. Am I wrong?”<br/>
</p><p>Remus thought, briefly, of the chocolate bar tucked in his backpack, and then decided to, in a roundabout way, avoid the question. “What’s that even mean, hm? What exactly does that sort of a bloke look like?”<br/>
</p><p>“I knew it.”<br/>
</p><p>“Knew what, exactly?”<br/>
</p><p>“Knew you were the sort of bloke to carry sweets with you, keep up. See, James and Peter and I—we devised a sort of plan, right? To coax something out of you, but it was blown to bits by Peter’s brilliant grasp of metaphor—the man can interpret Shakespeare like you’ve never seen, but try to get him to come along on a last minute plot to score some chocolate and he’s all thumbs.”<br/>
</p><p>Remus paused, caught between being offended that stage-whisperer had pegged him so—accurately, distraught at the inappropriate use of “metaphor,” or frustrated that he still didn’t know stage-whisperer beyond three possible last names which, as previously established, was no great strength of Remus’ anyway. In the end, he settled on a bit of all three.<br/>
</p><p>“Listen, Mr.—er—you. Even if—”<br/>
</p><p>“Black,” stage-whisperer supplied. “Surname’s Black, or Sirius if that’s a bit too formal for you. We are peers after all. Colleagues, even.”<br/>
</p><p>Remus filed that away and lifted his chin, intending to finish his telling off before sorting out names. “—Even if I were the sort of bloke to carry chocolate with me, I certainly wouldn’t give any to you after you’ve behaved the way you have.”<br/>
</p><p>“Behav—” Sirius let out a sharp clap of laughter in (Remus assumed) feigned disbelief. “Behaved the way I have? My god, I haven’t been told off like this since my Mother found pot in my top drawer.”<br/>
</p><p>This, to no one’s surprise, only added to Remus’ ire. “Well, I’m not telling you off, I’m just— look, you’ve already got me on our director’s bad side—”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, Dr. McGonagall’s not the director of the GAs! Just the grad school director.”<br/>
</p><p>“—that’s supposed to make me feel better?”<br/>
</p><p>“Well, I just mean—”<br/>
</p><p>“No, I know very well what you mean.” Remus tried, again, to emulate snooty dismissiveness, with varying success, if the way Sirius’ eyebrows arched was any indicator.<br/>
</p><p>“Right, well. My mistake—”<br/>
</p><p>Sirius looked as though he were about to say more, but was interrupted by one of the other foiled chocolate thieves.<br/>
</p><p>“Pads, mate, Wormy’s about to launch phase 2 of operation desk. Reckon if we can get the three by the door then—”<br/>
</p><p>“Have you got a desk?” Sirius interrupted his friend, turning rather abruptly back to Remus.<br/>
</p><p>“Have I—none of us’ve got desks that’s— that’s what today’s for,” Remus said, faltering just a bit at Sirius’ change of pace.<br/>
</p><p>“Right genius you are,” Sirius said drily. “Never would’ve guessed—has anyone asked you to share a desk?”<br/>
</p><p>“Er—no—no, I’ve not been asked yet, just figured—”<br/>
</p><p>“Perfect,” Sirius said, wrapping his fingers around Remus’ wrist. “Come on, then.”</p>
