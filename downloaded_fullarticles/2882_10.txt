"For you, my dear."</p><p>Augusta took them and grinned. "These are my favourite, how did you?"</p><p>Marge interrupted, "Know? A little birdie told me."</p><p>Augusta smirked."It must've been some magical birdie that talks."</p><p>Marge replied, "It was."</p><p>Augusta chuckled. "I've never seen the like."</p><p>Marge assured her, "I'm sure there's plenty of things you haven't seen before."</p><p>Augusta asked, "Like what?"</p><p>Marge responded, "Like a porn movie."</p><p>Augusta stated, "Well, you're right. I've never seen a porn movie before."</p><p>Marge suggested, "Maybe I could fix that by taking you to see one some day."</p><p>Augusta smiled.
