    <p>I do not own Axis Powers Hetalia or Harry Potter. I own nothing but Adrian, my own character. I have also posted this work on my quotev account, Ki'tarial.</p>

  <strong>Scars/Markings: </strong>
</p>
<p>Adrian is not one who has never known tragedy. Scars from everything that has happened to him over his 27 years years mar his body, leaving him with most of his back, chest, and legs covered by scar tissue. The worst is on his back- burn scars from a dragon that he got too close to.</p>
<p>Several smaller scars from various accidents with magical creatures litter his legs. A 2 inch long scar is just under his eye, a souvenir from the many giants he has dealt with. Another large scar goes vertically down his face; near the middle of his forehead, given to him by none other than Sadik in a bad fight.</p>
<p>Many other scars line his torso from various accidents.</p>
<p><strong>Other Distinguishing Features:</strong> Adrian is usually seen wearing simple makeup, gold studs in his ears, and glitter in his hair.</p>
