    <p> “I can’t believe this.</p><p>“Slughorn actually wants me to get a tutor. Me? Sirius Black, needing a tutor? It’s preposterous!”</p><p>Remus Lupin sighed for what felt like the twentieth time that day. This morning, Professor Slughorn had pulled his best friend aside to tell him that his grades were getting dangerously low and that Sirius should consider asking one his fellow classmates to help him with his potions – “preferably someone that is… shall I say, <em>excelling</em> in the subject.”</p><p>“After all,” Slughorn had said, “this is your NEWTS year and I’m afraid you’ll need all the help you can get if you hope to succeed in passing your exams.” Slughorn had never liked Sirius – or so Sirius had insisted, at least.</p><p>Ever since potions that morning, Sirius had been complaining about it. Quite vocally, Remus might add. It was now dinner and Remus was still listening to Sirius point out all the reasons for Slughorn being a “clueless oaf, who wouldn’t recognise proper genius if I sat on his desk and hit him over the head with my intellect and wit.”</p><p>It took another ten minutes of this for James to finally snap, much to Remus’ relief.</p><p>“Oh Merlin’s beard, Padfoot! Would you just ask someone to help you study already and be done with it.” There was a moment of silence while Sirius scowled at his best friend.</p><p>“Fine.” Sirius huffed. “Well who am I supposed to ask then? It’s not like anyone here’s going to be much help. I’m ten times smarter than this lot anyway.” That last part was muttered under his breath, a stubborn pout forcing it’s way onto his face as he gestured to the collective group of students sitting among them in the Great Hall, but Sirius’ friends heard it nonetheless.</p><p>“No clue.” James shrugged, taking no offense to his friend’s last comment. He knew Sirius didn’t mean anything by it, he was just pissy because Slughorn had injured his pride. “I’m rubbish at potions, so I’m out.”</p><p>“Prongs.” Sirius fixed him with a pointed look. “Your dad is literally a potions master. How is it you managed to miss out on that gene?”</p><p>“It’s just so <em>boring</em>.” James shrugged with a laugh, as if that was answer enough. Sirius supposed it was.</p><p>“Yeah.” Sirius sighed in agreement and then turned to Remus, who, upon seeing the look on his friend’s face, immediately cringed away. “How ‘bout it, Moony? You’re great at every subject.” He smiled at his friend, hopeful.</p><p>“Sorry, Padfoot.” Remus replied, and he really did look it. “It’s just that I’m having a hard time keeping up with my own studies and… well, it’s coming up to that time again, you know, and I’m feeling pretty run down as it is.”</p><p>As a matter of fact, Sirius noted, Remus <em>was</em> looking a lot paler than usual. Perhaps the stress of their exam year was making his transformations even harder. Sirius made a mental note to keep a closer eye on Moony this full moon.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it, Moony,” Sirius waved a dismissive hand, “I’ll find someone else.”</p><p>“What about Lily Evans?” Peter chimed in, “She’s brilliant at potions.”</p><p>Upon hearing Lily’s name, almost like clockwork, James’ hand flew up to his head to fluff his hair as he straightened.</p><p>“That’s true.” James nodded eagerly, “Lily is the smartest student in probably all of Hogwarts and she’s always so kind to people. I’m sure she’d help you study for potions.” James’ face suddenly brightened as he was struck with an idea, “Hey, maybe I could study with you guys? After all, I’m rubbish at it too, like you said.”</p><p>“Merlin.” Sirius flinched at his friend’s desperation, “Look, before you get into another one of your Lily Rants, I’m not asking Evans to help me.”</p><p>“Well, why not?” James asked, dejectedly.</p><p>“Because,” Sirius explained none too gently, “You’ll just get me to talk about you the whole time. Or worse, you actually <em>will</em> join us and it’ll just turn into another Potter-Evans Battle Royale. Honestly Prongs, I thought you said this year was going to be different this time?”</p><p>James huffed defiantly, but said nothing in response. He knew Sirius was right.</p><p>“Well, who are you going to ask then?” Peter asked curiously, around a mouthful of mashed potatoes.</p><p>“I don’t know.” Sirius sighed, slouching back in his seat and taking a large bite out of the bread roll sitting on his plate in front of him. “But I need to find someone soon before Slughorn picks someone himself. You should’ve heard him, ugh.” Sirius screwed his face up to morph into the patronising expression Slughorn had worn earlier that morning, and raised his voice in a crude imitation of his teacher’s voice. “I’m afraid a tutor is <em>absolutely</em> necessary Mister Black, if you intend on passing my class. If you are struggling to think of a suitable candidate, perhaps I could appoint a student of my choosing to aide you in your studies. Mister Snape, perhaps?”</p><p>James visibly shuddered beside him, Sirius joining him soon after, at the thought of being forced to learn potions from <em>Snivellus.</em></p><p>“Merlin, no.” James grimaced and laid his hand on his friend’s shoulder in a show of support. “We’ll think of someone, Padfoot. We’ll find you a tutor so good at potions that you’ll be getting Outstandings within the week.”</p><p>Sirius smiled at his friend in thanks, as he munched down on the roll in his hand.</p><p>“Well,” Remus began hesitantly, “You could ask Sara Bennett to help you? She’s always been pretty good with potions.”</p><p>“Bennett?” Sirius’ nose wrinkled in disgust.</p><p>“Oh, here we go.” James rolled his eyes, removing his hand from Sirius’ shoulder and bracing himself for what was to come.</p><p>“That snobby know-it-all that thinks she’s <em>so </em>much better than the rest of her house that she won’t even <em>grace </em>us with her <em>oh so fabulous </em>presence?” Sirius sneered, gesturing to the other end of the table where indeed, only four of the five Gryffindor seventh year girls were sitting.</p><p>“Oh, come off it, Padfoot. You don’t even properly know her.” Remus said, coming to the absent girl’s defence. “Have you ever really even spoken to Bennett before, besides the usual bickering?”</p><p>“I don’t have to.” Sirius shrugged with his chin raised and nose in the air stubbornly, giving off a slight ‘holier than thou’ vibe. “I know her type. Not a fan.”</p><p>“That’s rich coming from you.” James guffawed, “I seem to remember a certain eleven year old punching Joshua Sven in the jaw for asking if it was true you were already set up to marry on of your cousins because ‘isn’t that what all you pureblood types do?’” James shook his head in amusement. “Talk about judging a person, Padfoot.”</p><p>Sirius didn’t give a reply to that, but he did lower his head a little and had the courtesy to look ashamed, even if it was only slightly.</p><p>“Look,” James reasoned, “You may not be the biggest fan of Bennett but she really is good at potions. Remember that time last year when she saved Remus’ Draught of Living Death from exploding, after he fell asleep on his desk because it was the week of a full moon?”</p><p>“Slughorn said it was among the best draughts made by a student he’d ever seen and she didn’t say a thing.” Remus added with a nod and a blush, “Gave me all the credit.”</p><p>“At least she’d be better than having Snape teaching you.” Peter added, helpfully. Sirius sighed, seemingly convinced, if somewhat grudgingly so.</p><p>“Okay, fine.” He relented, “I’ll ask Bennett to help me with potions. Any idea where Her Highness might be?” He asked his friends, looking around the Great Hall.</p><p>“Well it’s Friday.” Remus said, thoughtfully, “So she’ll probably be in the library at around seven, if you want to ask her then.”</p><p>Sirius narrowed his eyes in suspicion.</p><p>“How do you know that?” He shared a look with a similarly suspicious James. Peter continued eating his mashed potatoes.</p><p>“Oh – eh, no reason.” A slight blush could be seen snaking it’s way up Remus’ neck and spreading across his pale cheeks. “I just uh – see her in there from time to time. On Fridays. When I’m in there. Because I go to the library a lot and I sometimes see her in there on Fridays. Sometimes at seven o’ clock.”</p><p>“Uh huh.” Sirius slowly withdrew from his blushing friend, choosing to address whatever <em>that </em>was at a later stage. “Well, I guess I’m going to head to the library then.” He stood up from the table and made his way to the doors of the Great Hall. Throwing his head back over his shoulder and raising his voice so his friend’s would hear him, he added, “If I’m not back in an hour, send back up!”</p><p>That earned a laugh from the remaining three boys sitting at the Gryffindor table.</p><p>Once Sirius’ retreating form disappeared out the door, James turned to Peter and Remus, a mischievous smirk dancing across his features.</p><p>“They’re going to kill each other.” He laughed and it didn’t take long for the other two boys to join in on the laughter.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>After a not so quick detour to the kitchens (what? He’s a growing young man… and he missed dessert), Sirius arrived at the library by around 7.30. Perfect. Little Miss Superior should be here by now, assuming Moony’s – let’s face it, creepy – information was correct.</p><p>It took Sirius almost ten minutes walking around the large library before he finally spotted her. There she was sitting in a dark corner where, unless you were actively searching for her, you would never have noticed her. Sara Bennett.</p><p>If Sirius was being honest, he didn’t exactly know why he hated the girl as much as he did. There was no denying that he hated her, that was for sure, but he couldn’t quite pin point the exact reason why. Something about her just really <em>got to him</em>. Perhaps it was her cold, rigid demeanour, or the way she just had to look like she knew exactly what she was doing every second of the day. Perhaps it was because Sirius found her to be rude, arrogant, and always acted far too superior to mingle with a lowly Gryffindor such as himself, as though the mere effort of replying to his comments was beneath her – and yet she always had a snide remark ready to throw back at him every time. Perhaps it was all of the above. Yep, definitely all of that.</p><p>Sirius watched as Her Highness continued reading her book, oblivious to his eyes on her.</p><p>It wasn’t like she was horrible to look at or anything. On the contrary, she was extremely beautiful. Long, seemingly endless, legs were crossed at the ankles beneath the desk she sat at. Creamy alabaster skin that Sirius suspected probably felt as smooth as it looked, not a pimple in sight. Full red lips, obviously tinted with some form of cosmetics but still managing to not look completely painted on. Impossibly black, thick, shiny hair that fell down to her elbows and cheekbones that could cut a man.</p><p>She was like a sexy Snow White, Sirius thought to himself jokingly.</p><p>Although he would never admit to finding Bennett attractive aloud, there was one thing Sirius could not deny. Sara Bennett has the most beautiful eyes you will ever see. Ridiculously long, black lashes framed them, along with meticulously groomed eyebrows, the same shade as her hair. Sirius had heard one of the other Gryffindor girls saying that Bennett was of Italian and Irish descent, but looking at her now, the subtle turn up at the edges of each eye, and the slightly exotic feel they gave off, Sirius would hazard a guess that there was something else in there too. But the really annoying thing about Bennett’s eyes was the colour. They were a deep shade of forest green with swirls of a brighter emerald that almost seemed to move under the light. For some reason, that really confused Sirius because they were such a warm, cosy colour but Sara Bennett somehow managed to make them look cold and sharp. Always judging, calculating.</p><p>Basically, Sirius surmised, putting an end to his inner monologue of checking Bennett out, she was hot.</p><p>But, like he always told his friends; half of it was most likely body charms and transfiguration spells. Or maybe she was a metamorphmagus? His little cousin Dora was a metamorphmagus and it was unbelievable the changes she could make to herself, and she was barely five years old. Imagine what a fully grown one could make themselves look like? Probably something like Bennett most likely.</p><p>The truth is though, if she were anyone else, Sirius probably would’ve asked her out years ago. Hell, he might’ve even dated her. But she wasn’t someone else. She was Sara Bennett, and Sirius wouldn’t touch <em>her </em>with a 10 foot long wand, let alone go out with her. But it wasn’t just Sirius that felt that way. Oh, no. Sara Bennett was about as fond of Sirius Black as he was of her.</p><p>So, after five or so minutes of staring at Bennett, wishing he could ask someone else to help him with stupid potions, Sirius took a deep breath and stepped forward.</p><p>For a moment he said nothing, just stood in front of her waiting for her to notice him standing there. Finally, she slowly raised her head and those confusing green eyes locked onto his hands, balled up into fists, then his clenched jaw, his mouth which was pressed into a straight line, and then finally landed on his own grey eyes. A slow smirk formed on her lips.</p><p>“Black.” She said in greeting.</p>
