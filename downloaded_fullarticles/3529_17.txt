    <p>Kissara was bored, her mommy had brought her to a dusty old shop, it seemed to have very interesting things in the jars but her mommy wouldn't let her look. So Kiki grabbed her new stuffy and told her mommy that she was going to people watch just outside the shop.</p><p>'Stay within sight of the window.' Her mommy told her.</p><p>She nodded back and exited the store. She started pacing in front of the store window. Then someone caught her eye. Kiki stopped and stared. She clutched at the huge blue Easter rabbit her mommy had just bought her and looked carefully at the stranger down the road. If she and the woman were the same age, they could be twins. Although the woman was much darker than Kiki, both in appearance and in the aura radiating off of her. The little girl couldn't help but stare at those charcoal eyes. Uncomfortable, Kiki put her thumb in her mouth and sucked, holding her teddy even more tightly.</p><p>The dark woman, on her part, felt eyes on her. Of course they were always eyes on her, but this pair felt different. She grimaced and turned around to see what ignorant fool was staring at her so intently. The woman's eyes sought and found the culprit, then widened in surprise. It was the one person she hoped she would never see again.</p><p>Hermione stepped out of the shop and spotted her daughter staring at the corner of the street. She went to the little dark-haired girl and put a hand on her shoulder. But instead of looking up and bouncing like she always did, Kissara didn't react at all. Her mother found this odd, the overactive girl was almost never still. Changing her tactic, Hermione wrapped her arms around her daughter to lead her back to the Leaky Cauldron where they would be able to access the Muggle world. While Kissara did start to move, her eyes stayed glued to the same spot. Giving up, Hermione turned to see what had gotten her daughter's attention. When she spotted the woman of interest, Hermione couldn't hold in a gasp. She tightened her arms around her little girl and prepared to scoop her up and leave. But it was too late to make a quick escape, Bellatrix Black had spotted them, and she did not look impressed.</p>
