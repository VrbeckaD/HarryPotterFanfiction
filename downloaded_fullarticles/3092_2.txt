    <p>Hermione thumped the last book onto the pile on her table in the library. Even after a couple of weeks of flagrantly abusing the Restricted Section pass McGonagall had given her at the beginning of the year, she still couldn't find anything about horcruxes.</p><p>She was certain they were significant. She had thoroughly grilled Harry after each of his private lessons with Dumbledore, and this was the first term she hadn't known. Slughorn wanted to hide his connection to them, and Dumbledore wanted to discover it. Knowing what Slughorn had said was no doubt important, but just knowing what they <em>were</em> would be a start.</p><p>Hermione wished, briefly but intensely, that she was a Ravenclaw. Not that she didn't love being a Gryffindor, but she'd heard that Ravenclaw maintained a proper card catalog of the library. For that matter, she wished that Madam Pince would agree to introduce one, but Madam Pince had never heard of indexing and didn't hold with new-fangled notions.</p><p>At any rate, she hadn't found it yet.</p><p>Hermione sent the books to the cart to be reshelved and packed up her things. She was supposed to meet with Luna before dinner, to spend some time developing their Arithmantic model of Flow. It was pleasant, having a friend who was just as eager to explore the theory of magic as she was. She could ask Luna to check the card catalog, but she wasn't sure Luna would consider it important enough. Luna tended to ignore things that didn't interest her, which tended to be bad for Hermione's blood pressure.</p><p>Hermione headed up to the seventh floor. The Room of Requirement was increasingly busy these days, but Luna seemed to have fairly good luck getting in. Whenever Hermione went there first, it was always occupied and locked.</p><p>Luna was in the hall when Hermione arrived. The Room must be occupied already. That was disappointing, but they could work on their analysis in an empty classroom, even if they couldn't try certain experiments.</p><p>"Can you tell who is in there?" Hermione asked Luna, once she was close enough. Luna could "hear" magic, which seemed to be a sort of extrasensory understanding of the magic going on around her. Hermione was uncertain whether it was unique to Luna, or just something most wizards never noticed. Sometimes she thought she could "hear" something—like a deep resonance in her mind—but she wasn't at all sure she wasn't imagining it.</p><p>"They're not at home," Luna replied. She turned and led the way to a secret passage they'd discovered behind a portrait at the end of the hall. It led to a large vacant classroom which they had gotten into the habit of using when the Room of Requirement was unavailable.</p><p>Once inside, Luna conjured the clear glass boards she favored and began copying their most recent Arithmantic model onto it. Hermione busied herself with putting up the privacy charms she'd begun using for these sessions.</p><p>The charms done, Hermione turned to Luna, biting her lip nervously. "Luna, have you ever heard of horcruxes?"</p><p>Luna blinked at her, and Hermione hurried to explain. "They're terribly important, and I can't find anything about them in the library. I'm afraid I can't tell you why they're important—I would if I could, but it's not my secret. I was just wondering..." she trailed off.</p><p>"The Ancient Egyptian mages used the hair of Pythagorean Felixes to keep babies safe from Woozles," Luna commented.</p><p>Hermione sighed. Obviously Luna wasn't interested. She turned to the board and pulled out some notes she'd made last night.</p><p>"I was thinking we should add a variable for sleep quality," she suggested. "Lack of sleep affects both energy and concentration, after all."</p><p>Luna's eyes lit up. "Sleep and waking echoes morning and evening. The body knows whether it is in harmony or not, even if the mind does not."</p><p>"Exactly! That's why I love getting up to go to the library first thing in the morning! The sunlight helps regulate my circadian rhythms, too," Hermione agreed.</p><p>"The sunshine tastes best in the wild," Luna replied, copying Hermione's notes onto the board.</p><p>------</p><p>Hermione and Luna parted in the Great Hall at dinnertime. Hermione didn't see her boys at the Gryffindor table, so she sat by the Patil twins.</p><p>"Why did you come in with Loony Lovegood?" Parvati asked curiously.</p><p>"Her name is Luna, and we're working on something together," Hermione replied.</p><p>"I see she's got that necklace back," Padma commented.</p><p>Luna had been wearing her mother's necklace, but Hermione was surprised that Padma recognized it. Luna had said it had been lost for some time.</p><p>"What necklace?" Parvati asked.</p><p>"The necklace she's wearing. It was in the cabinet over the fireplace in our common room for ages."</p><p>There was a sinking feeling in Hermione's stomach. "How did it get there?" she asked.</p><p>"The fifth-year prefect took it away from her when she came as a first year. Said it was too valuable for her to keep with her. She put it in the cabinet and said she could have it when she graduated."</p><p>"...but she could access it whenever she wanted, right?" Hermione asked.</p><p>Padma shrugged. "Shouldn't think so. That cabinet has some pretty strong magical locks on it."</p><p>The sinking feeling in Hermione's stomach had become a cold knot. "What about when the prefect graduated?"</p><p>"I think she took it with her. I'm not sure. It wasn't in the cabinet anymore, at any rate." Padma looked at Hermione, puzzled. "Does it matter? She's got it now, and two years earlier than she should."</p><p>Hermione grit her teeth together. Punching Padma and shouting wouldn't accomplish anything.</p><p>Parvati squealed—some boy had come in—and grabbed Padma's arm to point him out. Hermione looked at her plate, but she wasn't hungry anymore. She quietly excused herself and headed for the library.</p><p>------</p><p>Felicia Urquhart. Hermione remembered who she was (she'd been deeply invested in becoming a prefect even then, after all, and she was nothing if not thorough) but hadn't sought her out or spoken to her. If she'd known then that a prefect was bullying first years, she would have gone straight to McGonagall. Of course, McGonagall might not have done anything. Harry said Luna had been pinning up signs asking for the return of her things, including her shoes. If the teachers hadn't intervened in response to a student being deprived of her shoes in winter, why would they respond to the mere theft of a necklace?</p><p>Hermione sighed. Sometimes she hated this school. She knew that she had to maintain proper respect for the faculty, as part of the unspoken social contract that allowed schools to be orderly, safe spaces. She just wished the faculty was willing to hold up their end of the invisible bargain.</p><p>But for now, she wanted to know about Felicia Urquhart. An archived <em>Daily Prophet</em> showed that she had married Rowan Rackharrow two years ago, and that they lived in Hertfordshire by the Lea River. A wizarding genealogy showed that her uncle was a famous warding researcher, so wherever she was, it was probably impossible to access.</p><p>Well, Hermione wasn't the smartest witch in the school for nothing. She would just have to find a way in.</p>
