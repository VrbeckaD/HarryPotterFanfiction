  <span>“You’ll be home without me, for about a week,” Draco informs Scorpius while they are taking a meal at </span>
  <em>
    <span>Pur</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Draco’s favourite restaurant in Paris. It’s one of the posh establishments Scorpius has entered since before he can remember, but he still has a sense of discomfort as he fiddles with one of his many forks. Draco gives him a disapproving glance, causing Scorpius to quit and sit up straighter in his seat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Business,” Scorpius replies with a bored, enquiring tone. Failing to notice that his father is wearing a troubled frown. “I’ll be fine, Dad, go on—do what you do.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do I do,” Draco asks with a wry quirk of his brow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Scorpius grins, his reply full of cheek, “Take over the world, of course.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco snorts in a derisive manner, but he still has a charmed glean to his grey eyes. “One day, Scorpius,” Draco begins in an overly posh tone—the one Scorpius will inherit when his voice quits changing, no doubt. “One day, you won’t be a cute thirteen-year-old child.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think you said the same thing last year, Father.” Scorpius only refers to Draco as such when he’s being extremely bratty. “And, I think, I can recall you saying it the year before that.” His grin grows impish, “I dare say, Father mine, you will call me a cute child even when I’m fifty.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We will see,” Draco is all poise. Giving nothing of his innermost thoughts away. “Now, come. I would like to your help in selecting your grandmother’s gift.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Scorpius hates shopping with his dad, and huffs in disappointment, “Why? Dad, you always buy Nan the same old perfume and expensive chocolates.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can’t very well put your name on the gifts when you didn’t help select them.” Scorpius narrows his eyes, but Draco seems to realise he’s won the argument because he grins like a cat that caught the canary. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Git</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Scorpius thinks and his Dad’s grin grows dangerous, as if he can hear the thought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll only come if I get to pick her out a gift of my choosing.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not buying your grandmother a goat, Scorpius.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’d be a great replacement for that goat she married,” Scorpius tries to reason. His father doesn’t cover his laugh, and Scorpius cackles as he hurries to walk beside his father through the cobbled streets of Wizarding Paris. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Teddy is left in charge of Scorpius—in name only, because Draco’s not an idiot. Scorpius is the one who will most certainly put a stop to any possibly illegal shenanigans. Even if he’s a bit of an irresponsible dreamer, Teddy’s Scorpius’s favourite human besides his Dad. When he steps out of the Floo, with a large duffle Scorpius charges at him with a hug. His pride be damned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Missed me, have you, Pious?” Teddy’s all warm, brotherly affection as he ruffles Scorpius’s blond hair, with long, heavily tattooed fingers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” he admits, but he tries to keep his wistfulness from bleeding into his tone. School is hell for the only son of Draco Malfoy. They all treat him like he’s some sort of malady they will catch if he’s too close. And those are the people who are kind. The worse ones are the ones who shove him, call his Nan a whore, and steal his homework. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, we’re going to spend a whole week eating crap food and watching the Live. Maybe we’ll go play in Muggle London.” This he says loud enough for Draco to catch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Only if you aren’t taking him any place dodgy or south of the river,” Draco warns. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No place fun then,” Teddy hangs his head in mock dejection, but Scorpius catches a hint of his sharp-toothed grin. “Draco, you always manage to take away all our fun.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco doesn’t respond, instead, he moves closer to draw Scorpius into a fierce hug. “You be good, stay safe, and if you need me you ring me at the Mirror.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I will,” Scorpius promises. “Love you, Dad.” </span>
  <span></span><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you more,” Draco responds with the paternal voice that comes when they are away from the constant pry of outside eyes. He brushes a brief kiss to Scorpius’s hair. Then when he moves away and catches sight of Teddy watching them, Draco adds, “Love you, too, Teddy. Do you want a kiss?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If you tell anyone you kissed me on the hair, I’ll hex you,” Teddy replies with feeling, but Draco pulls him into a hug anyway and makes a show of planting a kiss on his teal hair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now I’ve got blackmail fodder—don’t do anything with my son I wouldn’t approve of.” Grey eyes narrow at Teddy, who frowns in response. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, yeah,” Teddy waves him off. “I’m not as stupid as I look.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco’s smile is soft, full of fatherly affection, “I know, if you were I wouldn’t leave you in charge of my life.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It goes great until Lucius shows up with Nan to check on them. “The Muddied Half-Breed is here, Narcissa,” he sniffs when he comes into the room where Teddy and Scorpius are watching a Quidditch match on the Live. A bowl of crisps between them on the ornate rug Draco constantly warns them not to ruin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Teddy, ever calm in the face of Lucius’s ignorance, grins up at the infuriating old man, “Lovely to see you, too, Uncle Lucy.” He scratches his shaven chin with his tattooed middle finger, subtly—yet not—giving Lucius a not so polite gesture. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The face Lucius wears in response makes him appear as if he’s sucked down a whole lemon. Nan, bless her, doesn’t give him an ounce of pity, “If you’re going to harass the children, go to your old study and read. I’m sure Draco’s mountains of business ledgers will hold faults in your eyes.” She waves him out of the room, giving all her attentions to Teddy and Scorpius. Doting on them both with copious amounts of affection, Nan pulls out boxes of fine chocolates and ignores Lucius until he stomps out in a huff. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It’s funny to Scorpius to watch an old man skulk away. Nan pats Teddy’s head in silent apology for her berk husband, and Teddy gives her a soft look of appreciation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nan plays Wizards Chess with them both for hours, until Lucius comes back into the room, wearing a foreboding smile. Scorpius doesn’t like the dread that follows him into this space, it’s as if Lucius is a darkness that sucks away joy. A human Dementor.  “Your son is missing Christmas with family—for a whore.” There it is, something to steal their happiness. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Scorpius feels ice plummet into his stomach at those words. Teddy sits up, wand out, wearing a snarl on his face, “I accept that you’re a twatter to me—I get it, but how fucking dare you come in here and upset a child like this.” The hex that hits Lucius doesn’t come from Teddy’s wand, it comes from Nan’s. Hitting him square between the eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do not dirty my son’s name with your filthy tongue,” there’s a fury Scorpius has never seen before in her. The snarl is more frightening than Teddy’s and Scorpius stumbles back, into his cousin—who wraps his arms around Scorpius in a physical hold of protection. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nan hurls more curses, beating Lucius down in a way Scorpius has often wanted—now he finds it worrisome. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Still, he never tells her to stop. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At dinner, Lucius’s pride is wounded so he’s hitting the bottle hard. “Your father is betraying your mother’s soul. Touching another as he does.” Scorpius tries to ignore him the way Nan and Teddy do, but he’s unable when Lucius says, “That’s why she died, Draco didn’t deserve her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My Mother who you called a weak, insipid woman—now you act like you care for her because my father is lonely and misses her enough to seek the comfort of a paid mistress.” Scorpius’s whole body trembles when he spits, “Fuck off, you miserable tosser. Don’t put my mother’s name in your mouth with the intent of soiling my father. You are not worthy of either of their names.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Teddy and Nan have proud grins resting on their faces when Scorpius flops back into his seat. Exhausted from his rage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Still Scorpius resents Draco for betraying the memory of his mother. He can see the glow in Draco, when he looks for it, after he’s returned from Paris. The glow Teddy has when he spends nights fucking willing, eager partners. After the holiday, after Scorpius returns to school he seeks anything to keep his mind from his Father’s deeds. There’s an advert in the common room, offering summer work to the musically inclined. Scorpius doesn’t care for the details as he tears off a strip with the Floo address. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Conservatoire is as grand as he remembers, his mother had brought him to learn musics before he could comprehend speech. It’s an elitist society, where all good little rich masters and mistresses go—to boast that they are gifted in the arts.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Scorpius doesn’t really care; music is a distraction that’s kept him sane thus far. And he hopes it will continue to as he follows one of the summer instructors into one of the many music rooms. “You’ll be in charge of Lysander today. He’s a rowdy child, so if you cannot get him to concentrate we understand.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Joy. </span>
  </em>
  <span>“I’ll do what I can.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lysander is a cherub of a child with a halo of hair as yellow as daffodils. His blue eyes are mischief and his grin is that of an imp—Scorpius is not charmed in the slightest as he takes his seat on the piano bench beside the boy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You have to sit still,” Scorpius sighs after fifteen minutes of this child fidgeting beside him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why, you get paid either way,” Lysander quips smartly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Scorpius scowls, “I’m not here for the money.” Because he’s not. Scorpius could spend his whole life not working, blowing money, and still be rich. The well of wealth runs deep for his family. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Everyone, everywhere, is here for the money,” is Lysander’s annoyingly perceptive response. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not, I’ve got more than I know what to do with,” Scorpius admits. “I’m here—with you—because I love music.” He looks at Lysander’s small, heart-shaped face, “Music is the best distraction.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mummy and Daddy don’t have time for me,” Lysander admits, eyes cast down, and Scorpius wonders if that’s why this kid acts up. Perhaps his annoying behaviour is to get someone to notice him. Whatever, not Scorpius’s problem. He’s got his own shit to deal with, after all.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck ‘em,” Scorpius whispers. “Who needs them when you have music?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lysander minds after that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Scorpius starts noticing the patterns of Draco missing. Every few months he leaves for an extended meeting in France, returning with that glow and fewer creases in his brow. He is conflicted. On one hand, he wants his father to be happy, but on the other, he remembers that bonds are deep—sacred—Draco is betraying his by being in the arms of another. It hurts Scorpius to think his mother’s soul might be suffering for his father’s actions. It calls into question so many wonderings about bonds—none that he will ever speak. So Scorpius remains wretched in silence. Burying his head in the sand as best as he can. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can I work at Hell Gate with you,” Scorpius asks his summer after Third Year. Teddy glances up from a ledger, full of sloppy writing, with a frown. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mate, I serve alcohol, do you know how fast Harry would shut me down?” He gives a grimace at the thought, “Harry’s already not fond of me </span>
  <em>
    <span>pissing my life away</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Scorpius shrugs, “My dad thinks you’re wasted in a pub.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, well, I don’t feel like being a damn uni student.” Teddy lights his cigarette, taking a deep draw of it before he exhales smokey words in Scorpius’s direction. “Just because I was Head Boy doesn’t mean I enjoy seeking more from magic and the world.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I need something to do,” Scorpius sighs. Pressing his forehead into his hands, “I need somewhere loud, somewhere no one is looking at me too closely.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Teddy’s eyes are full of emotion, understanding, and he hesitates before he finally tells Scorpius, “Aberforth isn’t afraid of Harry, and damn sure isn’t afraid of your dad—he won’t pay you well, but he’s always willing to take on able-bodied youngsters.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Boy,” Aberforth barks. “Ale, fetch it from the storage room.” Scorpius hurries down the rickety steps to the room beneath the Hogshead to drag up a heavy barrel of ale. Aberforth—the slave driver—refuses to let him use magic. Which is fine because he can focus on the ache in his muscles rather than be left alone to the musings of his mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wipe down the glasses,” he grumbles and Scorpius does with little complaint. Aberforth keeps him so busy with menial, mind-numbing tasks he can’t think to complain. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the end of each day, Aberforth puts three silver coins into Scorpius’s palm, murmuring, “Don’t spend it all in one place, boy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>All of it winds up in a coin jar beneath Scorpius’s bed. He’s got a key to a bigger pile of gold, and doesn’t actually need the money but Aberforth refuses to allow him to work for free. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When term begins so do the rumours about Scorpius putting his arse up for old man Dumbledore. He ignores the bulk of it, biting down scathing retorts such as </span>
  <em>
    <span>Aberforth is the one who fucks goats, it’s the dead one that fucked blokes. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Trying to defend his work would exacerbate the rumours, and he’s never been stupid enough to dump fuel on a fire. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The words only sting when Albus Potter’s green eyes fall over him with a cloud of doubt. That’s when Scorpius knows shame—even if he’s never done a thing that is shameful. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Givens, a bloke in Gryffindor—one of that berk Potter’s mates, has another couple of boys hold Scorpius down while Givens works Scorpius over with his fists. It doesn’t hurt nearly as much as Albus’s gaze had when he’d watched Scorpius with pity the night before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the weekend, when Scorpius sneaks out through the tunnel behind the one-eyed witch that Teddy told him about, he goes to Aberforth’s place. It’s the first time Aberforth shows concern for Scorpius, grabbing him gently by the chin and turning his face at all angles to better inspect the damage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I never liked your grandfather, but the man has his pride.” He releases Scorpius, with a stern expression drawing his bushy eyebrows down, “Borrow that pride, don’t let them look down on you as much as they do. You’re better than you think.”  With a tisk Aberforth turns, “I’d dare call you good.” He doesn’t cry, but his throat grows tight and his eyes sting from those words. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After that Aberforth teaches him how to mix drinks, and starts letting him tend the bar. Rather than sticking all the grunt work on Scorpius. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The summer after Fourth Year is when Scorpius, in an effort to avoid his life, holds down three jobs. He teaches brats at the conservatoire in the mornings, works for Aberforth in the evenings— most days well into the morning—and between he brews potions for his dad’s apothecary. His gruelling schedule has him falling into dreamlessness when he gets the chance to sleep, and that’s exactly how Scorpius like it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You ever thought about fucking around,” Teddy suggests on one of the rare afternoons Scorpius has off. The bags under his eyes caused Aberforth to bark at him that he needed a day of rest. Not that Scorpius stays home. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you mean?” Scorpius glances up from his summer homework, puzzled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know, get off with someone, drink, dabble in recreational potions,” Teddy appears exasperated. “Have some fun for once.” Teddy rarely tries to entice Scorpius with things that Draco would not approve of—not for fear of Draco, but because Scorpius is his brother and he likes to keep him safe. He must be terribly pitiful if Teddy’s trying to jog him out of that funk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fun is overrated,” Scorpius mutters, correcting his spelling of one of the great wizards of the dark ages’ names. Teddy’s the one who points it out to him with a smug grin, Scorpius gives him two fingers as he makes the changes. Fucking smart, useless wanker. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“All work and no play makes Pious a dull boy,” Teddy quips, but Scorpius doesn’t understand the reference and Teddy huffs. “I’m getting you laid. You’re fifteen, going on to sixteen in October, you need your cock played with.” Teddy makes it sound like this is some rite of passage that’s required during this age. Scorpius doesn’t agree. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I play with it twice a day,” Scorpius snarks in return, but Teddy pays him no mind as he starts going through a little black book he’s got behind the bar. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He’s writing small notes that he’ll send out with Minute Owls while Scorpius frowns at nothing. Scorpius is fifteen, he’d love nothing more than to get off with another person. It just seems pointless when the only person he wants to get off with hasn’t got a fucking clue as to who he is. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The parties are all right, there’s a lot of booze, potions, and spliff. There are also plenty of willing bodies, but Scorpius doesn’t find a single one appealing. He’s a bit drunk when he wanders out into the back garden. The moon is over bright, casting an eerie glow over everything. Scorpius flops heavily onto a stone bench, staring up at it with a frown. He wants nothing more than to be at home, in his bed, reading up on how to get his Felix Felicis just right. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You seem weary,” a voice calls—soft, yet full of intention. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am, I’m too old and too young.” Scorpius moves his gaze in the direction of the voice. “Being both at once makes me tired.” She stands there, the image of a fable come to life. One Scorpius can remember whispered in reverence. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Perhaps I can help,” her voice is pitched low, sultry, as she extends a hand to him. Scorpius takes it, knowing the intention in the gesture. For a brief moment he thinks of Albus, of his father, and finally of his mother. He too will live to disappoint her, it seems. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The flat is warm, inviting if overly ornate in an attempt to seem posh, but he doesn’t worry about that when soft lips press to his own. She tastes wrong and right at once, cinnamon liquor on her tongue along with the ash of her cigarette. Scorpius doesn’t have time to pay it much mind as she slips the shirt off his shoulders, exposing his skin to the room. Her sharp red nails run along his pale flesh, pulling a shiver from him, “What do you wish?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With honesty, Scorpius rests his gaze on her beautiful face and whispers, “I wish that you were someone else.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A chuckle bubbles in her throat, “You are just like your father.” Then she falls, with grace, to her knees. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Scorpius closes his eyes, winds his fingers in her hair, and pretends it’s a different mouth wrapping around his cock.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So,” Teddy begins when Scorpius shows up the next morning. “How was Miss Parkinson?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Too talkative,” Scorpius admits. “She’s got a thing for comparing me to my dad.” Which was unsettling, so Scorpius had to tune her out most of the time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Teddy’s grin is wolffish, “Yeah, that’s why she chases us, mate, she’s looking for the one she wants the most.” It’s weird to know he’s shared the same woman as his father and near brother. The same woman who had them all first. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Scorpius grows quiet, messing about with things on Teddy’s small flat’s kitchen counter. “Why doesn’t my father fuck her, then, why does he soil my mother by touching a whore?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’d only soil her if he touched another who loved him. Your dad knows your mother would forgive all others, but she would ache if he returned to his childhood sweetheart.” Teddy hands Scorpius a cigarette. “Besides, your father isn’t a cruel man—despite what some believe. He never loved Pansy, and he wouldn’t hurt her by giving her false affection to sate his own desires.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Scorpius wonders as he puts his cigarette to his lips. Wonders if he’s a shit for letting her touch a piece of his father. If he’s wronged his mother by giving his virginity to the woman who first had his father. He puts the worry away, focusing on his book to ignore the guilt that suddenly bubbles within him. For his mother, for Pansy, and a bit for himself.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco comes into the apothecary a week before Scorpius is due back for Sixth Year, and has an unusual expression on his face. “I’m proud of you,” he tells Scorpius. Out of the blue. Causing Scorpius to lift his eyes in confusion, from the potion he’s bottling for sale. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why?” He half demands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why shouldn’t I be?” Draco uses a question by way of reply and a lump forms in Scorpius’s throat. He swallows it down, and manages to shrug by way of thanks. Draco smiles, sincere and full of love, as he pats him on the shoulder. That’s when he thinks it’s about time he starts forgiving his father. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My dad told me he was proud of me,” Scorpius tells Teddy as they split a spliff. It’s three, and the drunks have been packed off for the night. The floors of Hell Gate are littered with garbage and sticky puddles of stale piss. Teddy doesn’t pay the mess any mind, he just takes a deep draw and holds his smoke while he thinks of something to say in reply. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course he’s proud of you,” his response comes with an exhale of a pungent cloud. “You’re pretty great.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He should be prouder of you,” Scorpius responds. “You’ve actually made something of your life.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Teddy’s laugh is hollow, “That’s why they all look at me with disappointment. Gran, Harry, everyone—I was supposed to be the one who made up for two deaths.” Teddy gestures at the room around them. “Tell me how this makes up for any magnitude of loss.” Scorpius doesn’t know what to say. Teddy grins, shaking his head, “Don’t look so sad, mate. I’ve made peace with what I am and where I come from.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Scorpius isn’t so sure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>*</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When he turns seventeen he receives an Owl from Teddy. It’s a package of Muggle Johnnys, and Teddy’s familiar scrawl, on stained parchment, reads: </span>
  <em>
    <span>Don’t use them all in one go.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Scorpius chuckles at that, dropping the box of condoms into his trunk. Where they will remain, forgotten, until Scorpius opens his trunk again—in Seventh Year. </span>
