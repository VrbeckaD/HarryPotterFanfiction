    <p>“New York!” Ron had exclaimed. “You’re not going to New York for a business trip and leaving me behind!” And so the addition of Ron meant Hermione, and then Ginny had become offended that she hadn’t been invited either, and somehow that had turned into Neville and Luna joining them and so Harry’s business trip had been extended into an opportunity for them to party it up in New York.</p>
<p>Or rather, his friends were partying it up in New York. Harry was sitting outside in a quiet corner of the smoking area, a beer in his hand, enjoying the sounds of the city at night. He’d never been one for crowds, and although he could handle them, he preferred the muted peace that night time brought.</p>
<p>He was, of course, rudely disturbed, as is the way of such things, but when Harry turned to look at the interloper seating himself beside him, he found he didn’t mind as much as he probably should. Tony Stark looked even better in person than he did on the broadsheets, and there was a cheeky glint in his eye as he turned to smile at Harry that couldn’t possibly be captured by any photograph.</p>
<p>“The name's Tony,” the man introduced himself with a smug grin. Harry snorted and accepted the offered hand, the skin rough with calluses gained only through hard physical labour.</p>
<p>“Harry,” he replied, and took a swig of his beer, glancing sideways at Tony, who was watching him shamelessly, an appreciative look upon his face.</p>
<p>“Oh British. I like that. What’s a nice guy like you doing in a place like this?” Tony asked and Harry groaned.</p>
<p>“That was awful.”</p>
<p>Tony grinned. “It was, wasn’t it? Okay, okay… do you have a map? Because I keep getting lost in those green, green eyes.”</p>
<p>“Please stop,” Harry muttered, but he couldn’t help the grin on his face.</p>
<p>“Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?” Harry buried his face in his hands. “No? No good? But that was my best shot! Well, if you want me to stop with the chat up lines, then I suppose you’d better come home with me…”</p>
<p>Harry snorted a laugh. “Rather forward, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Tony wiggled his brows. “I know what I want, and I’m not afraid to go and get it. I couldn’t help but notice you with your friends earlier. Thought I’d take the chance to come chat while you were sitting on your own.” Tony shuffled closer, pressing his thigh against Harry’s. The touch sent a flush of warmth through Harry’s body and he abruptly set aside his beer, not wanting to further loosen his inhibitions.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t you be taking me out for a meal first?” Harry retorted as he battled with his conscience over how attractive Tony was.</p>
<p>“I can always order breakfast in tomorrow morning,” Tony said hopefully. Harry laughed, turning his face toward Tony’s, which was suddenly rather close. Tony moved the final distance, brushing their lips together. One hand came to rest on Harry’s hip, and Harry tangled his fingers in Tony’s hair.</p>
<p>“So that’s a yes?” Tony whispered when they drew back for a breath. Harry grinned and nodded.</p>
<p>He was abruptly pulled to his feet, and Tony entwined his hand with Harry’s.</p>
<p>“My driver’s just around the corner,” he announced, and led the way.</p>
<p>The drive to Tony’s excessively opulent tower was filled with heated glances and casual touches, but Harry refused to frot against Tony, in a car of all things, when they were about to be getting into what he suspected would be an outrageously large bed. He was proved right when Tony shoved him onto a bed the size of a room.</p>
<p>“Nice digs,” Harry remarked.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you the tour later,” Tony muttered, and fixed his hands upon the buttons of Harry’s shirt. Harry returned the favour, and if he used a little bit of magic to loosen the starch of Tony’s dress shirt, well, no one would ever have to know. The blue glowing light caught his attention, and Harry brushed his hand carefully over the arc reactor seated in Tony’s chest.</p>
<p>“It’s beautiful,” he murmured. Tony grunted and slapped Harry’s hand away.</p>
<p>“Let’s focus on you,” he leered, and Harry let Tony take the lead. The next few minutes was a rush of removing clothing and sloppy kisses, until they were both happily naked. Tony curled his hand around Harry’s cock and he sighed with pleasure. He pushed up to wrap a hand around Tony’s neck, bringing their lips together. Tony licked into his mouth and then trailed kisses along Harry’s jaw and down his neck. Harry groaned.</p>
<p>“I’m going to blow you, and then I’m going to fuck you,” Tony growled, and Harry thrust up involuntarily. “You like the sound of that?” Harry hissed a yes and collapsed back into the pillows as Tony began making his way down. Every lick against his nipples, every scrape of teeth against his abs, every soothing kiss wound Harry higher and higher and he thought he might combust from pleasure.</p>
<p>Wet heat enveloped him and Harry scrabbled at the sheets to regain control. “Tony!” he cried. Bright eyes looked up at him and Harry had to scrunch his own shut.</p>
<p>One slick finger slid into him, and was soon joined by a second and a third as Harry was gently opened up. Tony avoided his prostrate after the first time he curled his fingers over it and Harry had shouted and pushed Tony off his cock lest he come.</p>
<p>“Fuck me!” he commanded, and pulled Tony up into a kiss. “Now.”</p>
<p>Tony grinned, sliding on a condom and slicking himself up. “It will be my genuine pleasure.” Tony pushed against his entrance carefully, and slid into him in tiny increments, painfully slow. Harry could feel every centimetre of blood hot flesh, thousands of sensitive nerve endings tingling with pleasure.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to break,” Harry snapped, irritable with arousal and desperate for more.</p>
<p>Tony smirked. “I know. Now lie there and take it.”</p>
<p>Harry whined as Tony pulled his leg up so that it was bent in half, a hand around the back of his thigh, and continued his gradual glide inward. The other hand was gripping Harry’s hip, forcing him to wait for Tony’s cock at his own pace. He stopped halfway and Harry nearly sobbed.</p>
<p>“Please,” he moaned. Tony snapped his hips forward and Harry made a guttural sound of pleasure.</p>
<p>“So, fucking, hot,” Tony muttered with each thrust. Each slide of his cock over Harry’s prostate sent sparks of pleasure up his spine. Tony leaned forward, lacing one of their hands together, and Harry’s cock was caught between their bodies.</p>
<p>“Harry,” Tony whispered, and Harry snapped his eyes open. Tony was smiling down at him, and he wrapped their joined hands around Harry’s cock. It only took a few strokes before Harry felt the familiar rush.</p>
<p>“Tony!” he cried as he came, spine bowing, muscles clenching. Stars erupted behind his eyes.</p>
<p>“Fuck,” Tony hissed and thrust once more before following him over.</p>
<p>Harry floated in the white haze of pleasure for a while, not even minding as Tony pulled out and moved away. He only stirred when Tony returned with a warm cloth and wiped away the mess between them.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” he murmured, opening bleary eyes. Tony grinned and chucked the cloth to the floor, hoping back into bed and wrapping his arm around Harry’s shoulders. Harry closed his eyes again, just for a moment.</p>
<p>He awoke to the blinding light of the morning sun. Tony grunted and rolled over, burying his head below a pillow. “Dim it Jarv,” Tony muttered, and the windows darkened until only the smallest amount of light shone through. Harry raised his brows, impressed. Muggles had found miraculous ways to make up for a lack of magic. He used the bathroom then pulled on boxers and jeans, leaving the bedroom to explore the penthouse apartment he’d disregarded the night before. He found a kitchen and began making breakfast almost automatically.</p>
<p>His wand was secured in a hidden space, and attached to a leather bracelet around his wrist. He didn’t dare to use magic in such a technologically able environment, but found he wasn’t lacking. He’d made breakfast the muggle way for years after all.</p>
<p>Harry didn’t know who was more surprised when a noise caused him to spin, clutching a knife, only to see a heavily muscled man dropping out of a ventilation shaft.</p>
<p>“Hi?” Harry said. The man jumped, his hand dropping to the gun Harry could see at his hip.</p>
<p>“Who the fuck are you?” the man growled. Harry blinked.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure it should be me asking you that…”</p>
<p>The man eyed Harry’s incomplete state of dress and the half cooked breakfast. Harry could almost see the assumptions being made as his dishevelled appearance was taken in.</p>
<p>“Bacon? My name’s Harry, by the way,” he said, turning back to check on the food but keeping himself alert and ready to move quickly lest the man prove to be a threat. He was fairly certain the man was part of the superhero group, ‘The Avengers’. The bow on his back kind of gave it away, and he’d seen photos of each of the members.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Call me Clint.”</p>
<p>Harry filed that away and added more food to the pan.</p>
<p>“Will the others be joining us, or is it just you that breaks into Tony’s apartment?” Harry asked, genuinely interested. There was a long pause.</p>
<p>“The others may be joining us,” Clint admitted. “But I’m the only one that breaks in.” Just then the elevator dinged, drawing both their gazes. A very pretty redheaded woman, and a tall blonde man walked in, only to pause upon seeing Harry.</p>
<p>“Breakfast?” he offered brightly, and served four dishes up, with a side of coffee.</p>
<p>“He’s Tony’s latest boy toy,” Clint said, gesturing to Harry. “I think.” The two new arrivals appraised him and took a seat at the bar next to Clint.</p>
<p>“I’m thirty-two, I’ll have you know,” Harry retorted, and tucked into his own breakfast.</p>
<p>“Really?” the blonde man said, then blushed. “Sorry, you just look younger than that. My name's Steve.”</p>
<p>“Harry,” Harry said, nodding at Steve.</p>
<p>“And I’m Natalie,” the woman added. Harry cocked a brow, but didn’t bother calling her out on her lie.</p>
<p>The four of them sat in silence as they ate, apart from murmured noises of approval of his cooking. That was the sight that greeted Tony as he stumbled out of the bedroom in jeans and a t-shirt.</p>
<p>“Am I dreaming?” Tony asked. Harry grinned and sauntered over, pulling him into a kiss.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you something to dream about,” he muttered in Tony’s ear. Tony snorted and moved back.</p>
<p>“Maybe later. Is that bacon? Did you cook breakfast?” He swiped a forkful off Harry’s plate and groaned.</p>
<p>“How would you like a job as a live-in chef?” Tony asked and scoffed the rest of the food down. Harry rescued his coffee before it could be absorbed by Tony and cradled it in his hands, leaning back against the counter.</p>
<p>“Good morning Tony,” Steve said, eying him with amusement.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah,” Tony muttered. “Morning all. What the hell are you doing up here?”</p>
<p>“We’ve got a video conference with the Director,” ‘Natalie’ reminded him. Tony groaned.</p>
<p>“Speak of the devil,” a British voice that Harry didn’t recognise interrupted them. The mysterious JARVIS, an AI if Harry’s intel was correct.</p>
<p>“And he shall appear,” Clint finished.</p>
<p>“Load it, J,” Tony said. A few seconds later a holographic screen displaying the conference call from the Director of SHIELD appeared at the end of the bar.</p>
<p>“Right you sorry lot…” Fury said, then narrowed his eyes. He sighed, and pinched the bridge of his nose.</p>
<p>“What the fuck have you done now Stark?”</p>
<p>Tony blinked, and opened his mouth to reply, but Fury cut over him. “Why the fuck is Harry Potter standing in your kitchen?”</p>
<p>Every head in the room swivelled to look at him. Harry ruffled a hand through his hair and grinned.</p>
<p>“Director Fury.”</p>
<p>“Director Potter,” Fury said tersely. Tony was opening and shutting his mouth like a fish, while ‘Natalie’ had tensed.</p>
<p>“I’m here on personal business,” Harry said mildly. “Although I believe I’m calling into your office later to discuss certain… oversights, shall we say?”</p>
<p>Fury bristled. “You know damn well that I had my reasons…”</p>
<p>Harry interrupted. “I know damn well that you kept a certain artefact from my agency, and messed around with powers you knew nothing about. Did you really think we wouldn’t realise who had the tesseract before Loki got hold of it?”</p>
<p>“Now see here! If the International Unspeakables weren’t so tight-lipped about their advancements and were maybe inclined to share them with the wider world, then we wouldn’t even have to attempt researching such developments on our own.”</p>
<p>“That’s an argument for your Council to take up with the ICW, not with my division. But perhaps this is a matter better discussed in private? I wasn’t aware the Avengers had the necessary clearance.”</p>
<p>Fury glared at him, then at the Avengers. “They don’t,” he growled.</p>
<p>Harry smirked. He turned to Tony, who was watching them with a hint of glee in his eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s been fun.” He jogged into the bedroom and pulled on his shirt and shoes.</p>
<p>“Thanks for breakfast…” Tony said, a brow raised. Harry winked.</p>
<p>“See you around, Tony, Natasha, Steve, Clint.” He sauntered into the elevator before they had a chance to question themselves.</p>
<p>“Ground floor please, JARVIS.”</p>
<p>“Certainly sir,” JARVIS replied, and Harry departed Avengers Tower. Hermione was waiting for him outside and he wasn’t surprised that she’d figured out where he’d gone.</p>
<p>“Got what you needed?” she asked wryly. Harry grinned.</p>
<p>“That, and more.”</p>
