    <p>Harry sat up with a slight cry, panting hard. Sweat clung to his hair, causing it to stick to his forehead. He looked around, clutching the sheets of his bed. Harry was in his room, not a cupboard under the stairs. He was in his messing room that clearly needed to be cleaned before his father saw it. The poor boy took some deep breaths trying to calm himself. Sadly, he was failing to do so. Harry gets up slowly and shakingly makes his way out of his room.</p>
<p>He instantly saw a light from the kitchen. He frowned and walked over to find Severus standing at the counter. The tall man was reading a letter, a look of irritation and worry in his eyes. Harry thought about heading back to his room, not wanting to bother Severus; but the man turned and saw Harry standing in the doorway. He looked at the younger boy surprised.</p>
<p>“Harry? What are you doing up?” he asked, putting the letter down. “It’s after midnight.”</p>
<p>Harry looked down as if embarrassed. “I-It’s nothing. I was just heading back to bed.”</p>
<p>“Harry.” The small boy looked over at him. “Come here.”</p>
<p>He sighed and walked over, head still bowed.</p>
<p>Severus sighed and knelt down to his level. “Tell me, what’s wrong?” he asked, looking Harry in the eye.</p>
<p>Harry bit his lower lip slightly. “I...I had a nightmare.” he admitted. “A really bad one.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to talk about it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to burden you.” Harry said.</p>
<p>Severus sighed again and led the boy over to the table. They both sat down. Harry sat as still as possible, bracing for an attack that never came. Severus smiled gently at Harry. “You aren’t a burden to me. You are my son.”</p>
<p>Harry studies him for a moment before sighing. “I was back at my aunt and uncle’s home.” he said quietly, not looking at the older man. “I was in the cupboard under the stairs. They were all yelling at me, calling me mean names. My cousin pulled me out and started hitting me. Uncle Vernon did the same. He said I was a freak and that no one cared about me. Then he...he dragged me outside and tied my hands to a tree branch. He started hitting me with his belt. I screamed out for help but no-one came.”</p>
<p>He paused, shifting in his seat. Severus didn’t say anything. He knew that Harry’s biological family disliked that Harry was a wizard and often tried to make him normal in the past, but he didn’t realise that Harry was this scared of them. After a moment, the raven haired boy continued.</p>
<p>“After he finished hitting me, I was stuck in a dark room. People were whispering things I didn’t understand. I called out, but no one answered or even came to help. Everything hurt. I tried to find you, but I just tripped over stuff and ran into walls. Then there was a flash of green light. It was about to hit me when I woke up.” he finished, trying to keep his voice steady but couldn’t hide the fear in it.</p>
<p>Severus pulled Harry close, holding him tightly. This wasn’t the first time he had heard the child talk about similar nightmares. It honestly broke his heart a little every time. Harry clung to him, letting out a small sob. The nightmare’s really scared him at times. Severus rubbed his back until Harry’s crying stopped.</p>
<p>He pulled back. Severus wiped away tears off of the small boys cheeks with his thumb. “Dry those tears. You’re safe now.” the potions master said softly. “Would you like a sleeping draft so that you won’t have that dream again tonight?”</p>
<p>Harry shook his head. “I think it’s done for now.” he admitted, rubbing away any left over tears.</p>
<p>“You sure? I want you to sleep well. Your godfathers will have my head if they find out you’re not.” Severus said, cautiously playing the family cards. Harry didn’t like it when family was used as an excuse, so Severus was careful to only use it when he felt strongly about something. Thankfully, that wasn’t very often.</p>
<p>“I know, but I really don’t like those drafts. They taste gross. And I can’t avoid dreaming forever. I’ll be fine.” the raven haired boy stated, officially putting his foot down.</p>
<p>The older man smiled and shook his head. “If you insist. You know where I keep them if you change you mind,” he said, giving Harry one final hug. “Now, head back to bed. Your Godfathers are come over tomorrow. I doubt they’d like seeing bags under your eyes.”</p>
<p>Harry hugged him back. “You’re right. Good night.” he replied.</p>
<p>Severus watched Harry begin to head back to his room. He frowned. “Harry?” </p>
<p>“Yes?” Harry paused and looked back at his guardian.</p>
<p>“Did you’re...never mind.” he said, shaking his head. “Good night.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded, smiling slightly. Severus watched for a moment before turning back to the letter. He grumbled it in his hand. Those cursed relatives. He wasn’t going to let them win this fight. They didn’t have any success in the past (big thanks to Lucius), and they certainly won’t this time.</p>
<p>-_*_-_*_-_*_-</p>
<p>Severus woke up to a knock at the front door. He groaned, sitting up properly. It took him a moment to register he had fallen asleep on the couch again. He rubbed his eyes as he went to answer the door. “I’m coming. Hold on.” he called as there was another knock. Well, it was more like a pound but still. Severus opened the door to see Sirius Black and Remus Lupin standing in there. He sighed. “You two are here already?”</p>
<p>Remus raised an eyebrow. “It’s almost nine.” he stated, looking his former classmate up and down. “Did you just wake up?”</p>
<p>“I was unaware that I had fallen asleep.” Severus snapped, finding slight insult in that statement. Though, there was probably truth to it. “Come inside. Harry’s still asleep, and I’d like him to stay asleep as long as possible.”</p>
<p>Sirius looked slightly disappointed. He had wanted to wake his godson up this visit. Remus looked at Severus surprised. “What kept you up so late?” he asked as the two stepped inside. </p>
<p>“I got a letter from his aunt and uncle.”</p>
<p>The dog animagus growled slightly. “Did they want custody of the boy again?” he demanded, not forgetting the hell both Severus and Remus had gone through to ensure that Harry remained in the potions master’s custody last time. Sirius would have played a part in it, but he was stuck serving time in Azkaban at the time.</p>
<p>Severus nodded, handing the two friends the crinkled letter he had received the previous day. “They can’t make such claims. Even the muggle governments won’t help them this time. They don’t even like the boy. Why do they want him?” Remus demanded, skimming over it.</p>
<p>“Your guess is as good as mine.” Severus replied, collapsing on the couch. “It won’t matter soon anyway. Harry is old enough to start school. The claims are that I’m not there enough for him because of work, which will be false soon due to the fact I work as the potions master in the same school. And to make matters worse, the minister of magic is supporting their claims, using my past as an excuse as well.”</p>
<p>“They have no right. You were found innocent before Harry was even put in your care. James and Lily would never allow their son to go to a home where he isn’t safe. Does Harry know about this?” Sirius asked, sitting on an arm of the couch.</p>
<p>Severus shook his head. “I haven’t told him. And I don’t want to. He’s having enough trouble sleeping as is.”</p>
<p>“Nightmares?” Remus asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. They’re growing worse. But he refuses to take a sleeping draft no matter how much I ask him to.”</p>
<p>Sirius nodded slowly. “You should get this cleared up with the ministry before it becomes a problem.” he said, handing the letter back. “How soon can you do that?”</p>
<p>The potions master sighed and summoned his calendar from his room. He skimmed through it, checking his plans. “I can do it today if you two don’t mind taking Harry out.” he admitted.</p>
<p>Remus opened his mouth when there was a cry from Harry’s room. Severus and Sirius leaped to their feet and all three men ran to the room. Severus threw the door open to find Harry on the floor, blankets tangles around him. The potions master smiled and shook his head. Why wasn’t he surprised? Harry struggled to get his head out of the blankets. He gasped for breath as he appeared.</p>
<p>“I live!” Harry cried out before spotting his godparents and guardian standing in the doorway. “Sirius! Remus! You’re here!”</p>
<p>“Hey, cub.” Sirius laughed, walking over. “Got yourself in a tangle today.”</p>
<p>Harry shrugged his shoulder. “I guess I moved a lot last night.”</p>
<p>“That you did.” Remus said as Severus shook his head. “You ok?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” the small boy replied, trying to untangle himself but was struggling to do so.</p>
<p>Sirius tried to help him but got himself tangled up as well. “No! I’m being attacked by blankets!” he cried out, causing Harry to laugh.</p>
<p>The potions master rolled his eyes. “You need any help, Harry?” he asked.</p>
<p>Said boy shook his head. “Gimme a few minutes and I’ll be out.”</p>
<p>“Ok. I’ve got some...unexpected business to take care of at the ministry today. Remus and Sirius will keep you company until I get back.” Severus said, choosing his words carefully. </p>
<p>Harry looked at him surprised. “I thought it was going to be all four of us today?”</p>
<p>Severus nodded. “Harry…”</p>
<p>“You promised!” the not-quite-eleven year old cired.</p>
<p>“I know I promised, but I can’t put this off.” the potion master said, walking over to his step-son. “I’m sorry. I’ll get this taken care of as fast as possible. Then I will spend time with you and your Godparents. Ok?”</p>
<p>Remus and Sirius glanced at each other, exchanging worried glances. Harry hated it when promises were broken, but he would hate it even more if he found out it was because of his relatives and Severus didn’t tell him. Harry looked at severus for a moment before nodding. “Ok.” he mumbled, looking away.</p>
<p>Severus brushed Harry’s hair out of his face and hugged him. “I’m sorry.” he apologize.</p>
<p>“It’s ok,” Harry replied, hugging him back. “Just come back as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Sirius smiled, pulling himself out from the sheets. “Don’t worry, cub. He’ll be back and spending time with us before you know it. In the meantime, how about we go to Diagon Alley?” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes!” Harry said instantly, looking at his godfather.</p>
<p>Severus pulled back from the hug and nodded. He rubbed the top of Harry’s head as he stood up. “Keep him out of trouble.” he told Remus.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Harry’s safe with us.” the werewolf replied.</p>
<p>“I was talking about the Mutt. Harry will stay out of most trouble if Sirius does.”</p>
<p>This caused both Remus and Harry to laugh while Sirius stuck his tongue out at the Slytherin. Severus smiled at the Black as he left the room. He quickly went to his room to shower and change into some clean robes. Severus sighed as he leaned against his desk. It broke his heart to let Harry down like that. It was like he was hurting Lily again. Just it hurt more to hurt her son. Those blasted muggle relatives had hurt Harry enough. Even when he was far from their grasp, they still tried to ruin his life.</p>
<p>Severus straightened up and pulled on some clean robes. He tucked a couple of runes into his pocket before apparating to the Ministry of Magic.</p>
<p>-_*_-_*_-_*_-</p>
<p>The potions master was surprised to say the least when he arrived at the Minister of Magic’s office. Albus Dumbledore stood in front of Minister Fudge’s desk. The old man looked over at the younger man. “Severus, this is quite a surprise.” he said.</p>
<p>“Mr. Snape, Albus and I were in the middle of a conversation.” Minister Fudge stated.</p>
<p>Severus stormed over and slammed the letter on the desk. “What is the meaning of this, Fudge?” he demanded, ignoring the headmaster.</p>
<p>Minister Fudge looked at it. “I see you received my letter.” he said calmly.</p>
<p>“You can’t take Harry away from me on these claims. His relatives hate him. That’s one of the reasons why I fought for full custody of the boy in the first place.” Severus snapped. “The Muggle government stated that the Dursley’s no longer have the right to Harry. They are lucky I didn’t report the abuse Harry went through.”</p>
<p>“Now now, Severus.” Albus said calmly. “There is no need for such harshness. The Dursley’s are Harry’s family by blood. They do have the right to see their nephew.”</p>
<p>Severus glared at him. “You don’t know what they put him through. Harry…”</p>
<p>“Should be placed in a home where he will be safe.” Fudge interrupted. “And he isn’t when living with you.”</p>
<p>“I won the right to be Harry’s guardian.”</p>
<p>Fudge sighed. “Only because it was written in both Lily and Jame Potter’s Wills. However, the boy’s safety is more important than the parents wishes. They clearly didn’t know what you had become after school.”</p>
<p>Severus tightened his hands into fists. How dare the minister slander Harry’s parents name in such a way. Sure he never liked James, but severus knew that James would never put his son in the care of someone he knew might not take care of him properly. The potions master put his hands on the minister’s desk as calmly as possible. “You can not and will not take the boy away from me. He is safer with me, away from people like those muggles and you. Wizengamot and Lady Magic decreed that I am Harry’s guardian. If you attempt something like this again, I will call upon on Lady Magic to serve judgement. Do I make myself clear?”</p>
<p>Fudge looked at Severus. The two stared at each other until Albus cleared his throat. “Minister, it is quite clear that Severus isn’t going to back down from this. I would do as he demands.” he suggested.</p>
<p>The minister sighed as folded his hands. “Very well, Mr. Snape. I shall inform his relatives that you are denying their request.” he said.</p>
<p>“Good.” the potions master replied.</p>
<p>He turned to walk away as Albus said, “I am heading out that way, Minster. I can inform them for you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Albus.”</p>
<p>Severus tightened his fists. Albus...naturally he’d get involved in something that had nothing to do with him. He made his way out of the ministry of magic when he heard his name called. Severus turned to see Lucius Malfoy walking towards him, looking rather surprised. </p>
<p>“Lucius.” he said calmly.</p>
<p>“Severus, what brought you to the Ministry of Magic?” the tall blonde asked.</p>
<p>“I had some business with the Minster. He thought that he could remove the Potter boy from my custody.” </p>
<p>Lucius snorted and shook his head. “I take it you gave him a piece of your mind?” Severus nodded. “Naturally. I warned you that willingly being the boy’s guardian would be difficult.”</p>
<p>Severus smirked. “Better me than his relatives. You saw how shaken he was during the trial.”</p>
<p>“That I did. How is the boy?” Lucius asked.</p>
<p>“There’s been some slight improvement, but he’s still scared of being alone with me sometimes. I can only imagine why.”</p>
<p>Lucius nodded. “Has he made any friends? I know you bring him with you when go to gather supplies.”</p>
<p>Severus shook his head. “Harry will stay clear of other children. I’m hoping that he will gain some friends during his time at Hogwarts. If not friends, then people he can trust.” he said, rubbing the back of his neck. “Though, I am hoping for friends. He deserves some after everything he has been through.”</p>
<p>“That I can understand. Draco isn’t too sociable himself. I blame Narcissa. She spoils him too much. Perhaps our sons should meet before school starts. Harry does start this year, doesn’t he?”</p>
<p>“He does. That sounds like an excellent idea. Perhaps they should meet before Harry’s birthday in a couple of weeks. I’d say today, but his godparents are spending time with him. We both know how they’d react to Harry becoming acquainted with more ‘slytherins’.”</p>
<p>Lucius let out a laugh. A few people ducked away, fearing the Malfoy. “I take it they still think that you will turn the boy against them?” he asked.</p>
<p>Severus chuckled. “Not much any more seeing as I gave them visitation rights. Though, Black still thinks that he would be better at raising him. Lupin has informed me that neither of them will be pressing for custody so long as they can spend time with the boy.”</p>
<p>“I can hardly imagine the werewolf and man would be able to take care of him properly. Have they even found jobs yet?”</p>
<p>The potions master shrugged. “I’m sure they did somewhere, knowing them. Plus it was part of the Mutts deal. He has to have a job.” he said, glancing at the time. “Well, I promised Harry I would head back home as soon as possible. I shouldn’t keep him waiting any longer.”</p>
<p>“That boy has you wrapped around his pinky.” Lucius stated, “I actually need to head home myself. Draco caught a cold and Narcissa is out at Azkaban. I don’t feel comfortable leaving him home alone.”</p>
<p>“She visiting her sister?”</p>
<p>Lucius nodded. “Narcissa is determined to make sure Draco still has his aunt in his life. She is not a good influence for him.” he said as they approached the exit. “Well, I shall floo you a date and time Draco is available.”</p>
<p>Severus nodded shaking the Malfoy’s hand. “I look forward to it.”</p>
<p>As the two begin to part ways, something struck Severus in the back of the head. He stumbled forward slightly but quickly recovered his footing. He turned and looked around. Several people were looking at him. Mad Eye Moody was glaring at him. The old, ex-auror had it out for the potions master. Severus knew it was mostly because he was a Death-Eater, despite that he was proclaimed innocent of his crimes; but the hatred increased when he took in the ‘Savior’. Severus didn’t see a wand drawn, so he turned away only to feel what was most definitely a compulsion spell. Rage coursed through him. </p>
<p>Every since he took Harry in, Severus had taken precautions against spells. Potions, he already had charms and runes to protect him. If it wasn’t for the rune he put in his pocket, he would have listened to the compulsion. Severus took a deep breath and turned back to Moody. “What do you want, Moody?” he demanded in the kindest tone he could give.</p>
<p>“That boy isn’t safe with you.” the ex-auror said, wand drawn and pointing at Severus.</p>
<p>The Potions master looked at Moody’s wand. “Put that bloody wand away before you take another eye out.” he said. “And may I inquire who you are referring too?”</p>
<p>“Who am I referring to...the Potter boy.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Harry. Well, if you believe you know better, Mad Eye, where do you think Harry should be living? With you?” Severus challenged.</p>
<p>Mad Eye rolled his good eye. “Merlin no. Boy wouldn’t last ten minutes. No, he should be placed with his relatives. They love him and care for the boy, unlike you. I’ve seen how you treat children. It’s amazing you can still pull off as a teacher. Potter deserves to live with someone who is going to love and take care of him.”</p>
<p>“And who do you think is going to be able to do that?”</p>
<p>“His family. His real family.” Mad Eye snapped.</p>
<p>Severus couldn’t help but let out a small chuckle. “The muggles? The same muggles I fought for custody? The same muggles who starved Harry and treated him like a House Elf? You saw him at the trail, nothing but skin and bones. Don’t try to tell me they love him. What parent would abuse a child they love?” he said.</p>
<p>No one dared answered that question, but Severus knew many families around them agreed with him. Mad Eye growled. He moved to try and counter what the Potions Master said, but Severus apparated out of the Ministry and to Diagon Alley.</p>
