    <p>Tom Riddle watched the Peverell Heir like everyone else did, with a bit of curiosity and well hidden aversion.</p><p>Hadrian Peverell was shorter than average by a few inches, had wild black hair that seemed to have its own life, and he was dressed in a casual and tasteless dress robe. He was badly underdressed for the occasion and it looked like he didn't care at all, which was an inadequate behaviour for an heir and proved that he hadn't enjoyed an appropriate upbringing. That alone was enough to harm his reputation and prestige in the upper class of the wizarding world, but he had to outdo himself because he came alone. Doing that was a symbol of ignorance and lack of knowledge, and so Hadrian Peverell become everything Tom hated packed in one person within the very first seconds Tom saw him.</p><p>Nevertheless, Tom couldn't do anything about feeling a bit of interest raise inside him the longer he observed the mere <em>boy</em>. He didn't seem to be the most intelligent and even though he stood there as he would have every right to do so. A child, Tom thought, that wasn't aware of his own influence and that everyone wanted to be on his good site, just because of his surname. The Peverell's were an old family, old and <em>oh so </em>well-known; and it was told that the family was extinct. But here he was: Hadrian Peverell, the ring, that was evidence of his Lordship over The Noble and Most Ancient House of Peverell, on his finger. It wasn't a big ring, not as large as the Lordship ring of the Malfoy family, and even though it made his hand looking small and fragile.</p><p> </p><p>The first rumours of the claiming over the Peverell Lordship started in Tom's last and final year at Hogwarts and in the beginning he couldn't believe it at all. It was <em>his </em>right. Only his, like being the heir of Slytherin. And as he saw a picture of the boy in his newspaper one morning, he had to make sure not to laugh out loud because of the ridiculousness and absurdity of the situation. How could this plain boy be able to do what he couldn't? He wasn't even off age.</p><p>The information about Hadrian Peverell were limited, to name it like it was. He was at least one year younger than Tom, was homeschooled and would finish his education at a minor and petty school because of his recent loss of his parents. Why the parents, the father, didn't claim the Lordship himself was a question Tom couldn't be sure about.</p><p> </p><p>“Lord Malfoy,” Peverell said and tilted his head in a bow. His voice was smooth and a bit silky, something Tom hadn't expected.</p><p>“Lord Peverell,” Lord Malfoy replied, his face passive and cold. Abraxas stood beside them and was completely ignored.</p><p>“I was excited to receive an invitation.” Tom decided that there was something off about the boy: His stance too straight and voice too even. It was like he was used to this but that couldn't be possible. Tom would know. “It's beautiful.”</p><p>They had never meet before, Tom was so sure as he could possible be, but as their eyes looked, it was like something shifted in both of them. Tom himself was able to conceal the feelings that suddenly rushed through him, Peverell not. His face was a mixture of shame, shock, fascination, disgust and everything was stressed with the urge to flee. There was something about Peverell, Tom couldn't put his finger on it. Something subliminal and elusive. It made him mildly curious, because it stood against his first impression; and he had <em>never </em>been wrong so far.</p><p>“Lord Peverell,” Tom greeted, a winning smile on his lips. “If I could introduce myself? My name is Tom Riddle, it would be my pleasure if you address me as Tom.” It wasn't difficult for him to cover his dislike for his name; Tom was so plain and nothing special. It couldn't express the greatness, dignity and pride he obsessed. But he wasn't a Slytherin, by blood even, for nothing and so it was too easy to put the smile in his lips. If there was someone who could dupe him, then he would be deeply impressed.</p><p>“Mr Riddle,” Peverell said, a somehow forced smile on his lips, quite contrary to Tom's expression and Tom was indeed pleased with himself.</p><p>“I insist that you call me Tom.” His neatness wasn't returned and Tom liked the thought that it was his doing that the boy didn't feel as comfortable as he did before. Tom had a passion which involved solving enigmas such as Hadrian Peverell. The boy was full of differences: Stoic and uncertain and at the same time confident about himself. He managed to touch Tom like only few persons did before him; and every time it was an enjoyment to break them slowly, to pell every layer off of them and reveal all of their dirty little secrets while watching their pride was destroyed so that everybody could see it. To form and shift them as he wanted, to see them struggle during the procedure, desperately trying to break free off his web if they noticed what happened.</p><p>A welcome addition was the taste of Hadrian's magic. Free, fresh, unbounded. Tom took a deep breath as he stood near the smaller body, wondering if the skin would feel cool or warm to his touch. He smelt like too many herbs, his nose wasn't straight because of a little hunch and his face seemed to maintain a bit of the plumpness of a little child and his eyes were covered with a pair of large, black and round glasses. All in all he looked ridiculous with his, a bit too large, dress robe. But his eyes... Merlin.</p><p>“Harry,” the boy said through clenched teeth and Tom let his smile widen. A first step was a first step, after all.</p><p> </p><p>That the boy wouldn't have end up in Slytherin was painfully obvious. He wasn't moving with the same elegance and grace members of the house did, his words weren't well-chosen and his expressions not guarded.</p><p>Tom watched, from the corner of his eyes, as Hadrian was being getting engaged in a conversation with a young witch, while he, Tom, kept talking with a man, the name of him already forgotten. It was as would everyone have a discreet glance on the Peverell Heir, who was acting like no heir dared to do before him. A bit clumsy and sometimes so awkward that Tom wondered whether it was real not. Hadrian blushed, like a thirteen-year-old girl who had a crush on someone and would talk to this person, and he talked in such a blatant manner that practically screamed that he had no experience; and that he lacked a proper knowledge of upper class etiquette.</p><p>It bothered Tom that he couldn't find a reasonable excuse to talk to Hadrian. Every fibre of his body desired to be near the boy, to touch him, to explore him, in both meanings, and to claim him as his. Tom's mind screamed, thirst for being with him. He was like an interesting object Tom wanted to sort into his collection, keep it and don't give it away until he knew everything and his curiousity was satisfied with his findings.</p><p> </p><p>“Tom,” Abraxas said, his eyes focused on the ground, feeling visible inconvenient. “Father would like to see you sitting next to us.”</p><p>The dinner was a serious matter. People seemed to be nervous about getting a good place to sit, so they could form new and lucrative acquaintances, keeping contact to old acquaintances and watch their so called enemies. Tom observed the pathetic human beings who thought themselves as being superior to others. All their behaviour was beneath him because <em>he</em> was above them all, they just weren't aware of it although they acted as they would; and it humoured him every time someone went out off his way because they could feel his power, his presence.</p><p>The young Peverell heir was quite the opposite, he realised suddenly through the dinner. He wasn't afraid to look into Tom's eyes when their looks accidentally crossed, he didn't back off and his face and emotions were carefully shielded away. This small rebellion let Tom smiling fondly at him, his wish to claim him as his increasing with every moment, and he wanted to torture everyone who dared to lay a hand on what was his.</p><p>The Yule Ball was arranged by the Malfoy's and took place at the mansion. The people dressed up to show their wealth and to impress. It was like a muggle circus, everyone tried to show off. Hadrian Peverell did nothing like that, he stood out like a Hufflepuff in a group of Slytherins, and gained what everyone else was hoping for: Attention. They expected better from the new heir, who was for the first time within their society, they gave him disapproving glances and still he got was the others wanted. A name, a reputation, money, potential. It was all there, the question was what Hadrian decided to do with it.</p><p> </p><p>It were the eyes of Hadrian that left the most effect on Tom. Somehow sad, forceful and still hoping for better times. They told stories Tom couldn't get a hold of, he couldn't capture what he saw or what they tried to tell him.</p><p>“May I ask for a dance, Hadrian?” Tom asked, reaching out with a hand, holding it in a waiting manner midair. A few couples occupied the dance floor and others were going to participate when the next play started.</p><p>“You might,” Hadrian said, his hands frantically searching for something, <em>anything</em>, to hold on. “Sadly young Lady Lydia insisted that I continue the conversation we had to interrupt because of dinner. It would not be wise to let a Lady wait for long, don't you agree?” He bowed his head slightly, just on the border of being impolite, and turned around to go to the young woman Tom watched him talking to earlier. Hadrian Peverell, a hidden <em>hothead.</em></p><p>Tom raised an elegant eyebrow and looked after the moving form of Hadrian. He wasn't used to people trying, more or less successful, to give him counter, and he found it amusing and irritating at the same time. Usually they jumped at the occasion and wanted to impress him with their knowledge and skills. Looked like it would be even funnier to break his new little toy, he mused silently, while he scratched out a few wrinkles of his robe.</p><p> </p><p>“Lady Lydia, Hadrian,” Tom greeted as he reached both figures. While Hadrian glared at him, it was a nice, although strange, change to the scared or awed expressions he got otherwise, Lydia looked confused and helpless. Yes, it was a privilege to address Lord Peverell by his given name. A privilege that Lydia seemed not to share with him and it satisfied him deeply. If Hadrian was aware of the meaning that they addressed each other with their first names? Tom wasn't too sure of it.</p><p>“I have to excuse the interruption of your, certainly important and profound, conversation. Our Hadrian here promised me the next dance and it's time for me to fetch him.” He gently took her hand for a kiss on her hand, watched pleased the shade of red appearing on her cheeks. “If you would excuse us?”</p><p>To dance with Hadrian was amusing. The boy tried, grimly and without great success, to take the lead from him while Tom spun them gracefully around the floor. Hadrian wasn't a great dancer per se, but he made it up with passion, fighting and challenging Tom whenever he could. It was ecstatic and Tom grinned manically. Oh yes, he would enjoy Hadrian.</p><p>One dance turned into two and three. Whenever Hadrian tried to flee Tom hold him back. People started to look and to whisper about them, and Tom promised himself to make sure that they understood that Hadrian was taken. Why Tom wanted him? Neither he knew but he would find out soon enough. Perhaps because he saw something in the boy, something powerful and maybe even a bit of wit in his eyes. It wasn't his appearance, but the aura around him, that changed something, <em>everything </em>. If it wasn't for that, and his Lordship, Tom wouldn't care to take a second glance in his direction.</p><p> </p><p>Tom kissed Hadrian. Right there, in front of the whole room. Forcefully and not at all gently. The pairs around them stopped dancing, Tom ignored Hadrian's struggle to get free and pulled him closer. His mind screamed to claim him, to protect him, to keep him safe. To mark Hadrian Peverell as his possession. His magic reached out, acting according to his wishes, touched a tiny bit of the foreign magic and wrapped around it like a heavy blanket.</p><p>There was a clapping sound. Disbelief was written on Tom's, and Hadrian's, face as Tom slowly touched his cheek, one hand still holding Hadrian. It felt a bit warm, nothing really hurt but it was the thought behind it that mattered. Tom grinned. A few people gasped, their eyes went round, when they hadn't their facial expressions under control, but Tom just stared in two green orbs. Two eyes that considered him with rage, hate, disbelieve of his own actions, and fear. Hadrian was beautiful in that very moment as the certainness sunk in that it was too late for him.</p><p> </p><p>Step two: Starting the claiming, successful.</p><p>Step three: Showing his claiming, successful. (And claiming him, was like claiming the Peverell Lordship.)</p><p> </p><p>“Hadrian,” Tom started and stopped because he wasn't sure what he could possible say. Did he need to excuse himself in front of a stranger? Was he even sure what he wanted to say or that he even wanted to apologise? He didn't know if he could apologise though, since it was his very intention to do as he did.</p><p>“Tom.” Hadrian was close lipped, only his eyes and his slightly trembling body betrayed his true feelings.</p><p>“It would be an honour for me to take you out tomorrow.” Tom Riddle was never shy to say what he wanted. And he wanted the boy. He felt even better as he saw the despair written in Hadrian's eyes and the single teardrop that rolled down his cheek.</p><p>“How dare you?” Hadrian asked calmly, his eyes suddenly promised a slow death. Tom was fascinated and somehow in love.</p><p>Fun, indeed.</p>
