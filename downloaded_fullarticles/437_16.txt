    <hr/><p> </p><p>When Rick woke up the first thing that registered was the lack of noise. The normal background music of voices, footsteps, and beeping of any hospital were missing. Gone was the almost indecipherable buzz of electricity. It was as if the man-made world had suddenly died and stopped its constant humming. His throat was parched and he hoarsely called for a nurse. Forcing himself to turn he reached for the vase of flowers he had at one point remembered his partner bringing him.</p><p>The vase he reached for was empty with just a handful of dead flowers. Attempting to get off the bed, his legs couldn’t hold his weight and he collapsed to the floor groaning, he slowly sat up, looking down he sees the IV in the crook of his left arm; he slowly feels away the tape that held the needle in his arm and pulls it out. Grabbing the IV pole Rick pulls himself to his feet.</p><p>Walking into the small bathroom attached to the room, he shifts his weight from the IV pole to the sink turning the handle. The water that flowed from the faucet was a godsend for his parched throat. After drinking his fill he splashes water on his face; trying to wash away the feeling of grime and sweat. His face was coarse from the stubble that had begun growing while he was in his coma. Looking at his reflection in the small mirror above the sink, his eyes widen: his face was a little gaunt with slight bags under his eyes, and his hair was greasy from lack of washing. He wondered how long had passed since he’d been shot.</p><p>Judging from the stubble on his face he’d guessed the last time someone had shaved him was two maybe three weeks ago. That didn’t tell him how long he had been in the hospital for though, merely how long till whatever had happened, happened. He shakily grabbed the pole and slowly made his way back to the main room looking for something, anything that would give him an idea of what was going on. The only thing he saw was the dead machines, and flickering lights.</p><p>Rick slowly moved towards the door and twisted the knob pulling it open carefully. He wasn’t sure exactly what was going on but he didn’t like it, and he didn’t want to be caught unawares by whatever it was. A gurney had been pushed in front of his door, and he surmised that it was most likely one of the reasons he hadn’t been discovered by whoever had turned the hospital into a third world war zone. Pushing the gurney aside he slowly made his way down the silent hallway; papers and blood littered the floor and bullet holes riddled the walls and doors. Given the silence and the fact that no one had known he was here for at least two weeks, Rick stayed quite incase whatever had done this was still here somewhere. He made his way slowly towards the nurse’s station leaning against his Iv pole for balance, and to help counteract the nausea and dizziness he was feeling.</p><p>The hallways were dark,<b> </b>the only light coming from the occasional flickering of an emergency hall light, leaving shadows in the nooks and crannies. Abandoning the IV pole for the counter of the nurses station, Rick felt around for the phone he knew would be kept there. He pulled the receiver up to his ear, moving to punch the buttons when he heard it. Silence. There was no dial tone. Whoever or whatever had done this had not only destroyed the hospital and cut the power but the phone lines as well. Running his shaking hand over the nurses side of the desk he searched for anything that he could use. His fingers grasped a small matchbox a nurse had likely confiscated from a patient. A buzzing noise caught his attention down the hall. He moved towards it leaning on the wall for balance, he could see one of the hospital’s emergency lights flickering.</p><p>The flickering of the light led him to a set of closed double doors, baring him from entering by a piece of wood shoved through the door handles. Puzzled, he peered into the flickering hallway and takes in the destruction. His eyes are drawn to the ground and what he sees makes him sick; the top half of a woman’s body is laying inside an open doorway. Swallowing thickly he recognizes the face of the woman, Candice, a nurse who had helped the doctor with Carl’s cast when he was seven and jumped from the shed’s roof trying to be Superman.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He backs away quickly stumbling a little as he moves down the opposite hallway towards the cafeteria. His mind was racing as he passes more blood pooled on the floor and sprayed on the walls, bullet holes marring the walls and a hole in the roof were it had most likely collapsed. Upon reaching the closed cafeteria doors Rick was taken aback at what he saw. The doors were chained shut, a padlock locking them together, a wooden board had been shoved between the handles also. But it was the words spray painted across the door that shocked Rick, ‘Do Not Open, Dead Inside.’ His eyes widened and he took a step back, tripping over his feet he landed hard on his ass and watched as the doors started straining against the chains, groans and snarls accompanied the slightly decaying fingers pushing through the crack the board and chain allowed. As the groaning got louder he stumbled to his feet and backing away he pushed through a set of doors to his right, rushing past the elevators he slammed into the door proclaiming ‘Stairs’.</p><p>He stood panting in a pitch black stairwell as the door slammed shut behind him. Fumbling he opened the matchbox and quickly swiped the head against the box, it took a few tries but finally a small flame flickered to life. Now that he could somewhat see he listened for anymore of that groaning. Hearing nothing he made his way slowly down the stairs gripping the rail to keep from falling. He went through three matches before he found what he hoped was the exit. Pushing the door open sunlight immediately blinds him, raising his arm up he tries to block some of the brightness. Moving down the metal stairs he lets his arm drop as his eyes slowly adjust to the brightness. He wishes they hadn’t a moment later.</p><p>The back lot of the hospital was covered with a hundred or more bodies, all covered with white sheets, flies buzzing around them. The only sound he hears are the flies and his own ragged breathing. Whatever had caused all this looks to have affected the whole town which means Lori and Carl might be hurt or in trouble somewhere. Slowly he made his way through the bodies and out of the back lot of the hospital and half crawling, he crests the hill leading to what used to be the staff parking lot, but is what now looks like a destroyed camp the military had tried to put together; helicopters, tents, and cars lay abandoned like the people using them just disappeared, he stumbles over and around pieces of broken wood, crates, metal barrels, and worst of all more body bags. The main road on the other side of the parking lot doesn’t look any better; cars crashed or left abandoned on the roads and sidewalks, their doors wide open. The further he walked the more cars were crashed or left behind, storefront windows busted and what looked like looted goods discarded on the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rick couldn’t help but feel like he was the last man in the whole town. He looked around and watched carefully for any movement, his ingrained police instincts began kicking in, even in his foggy and panicked state. Some part of him-that wasn’t pushed down by the panic of making sure his wife and kid were okay-knew that he was in danger the longer he stayed out in the open. Scanning around his eyes landed on a rusted red bicycle laying in the grass, crossing to it he quickly stood it upright and that’s when he saw it. Movement out of the corner of his eye, turning his head he flailed backward, stumbling over the bike and falling hard on his back leaning on his elbows he quickly lock eyes on the…thing. Two feet in front of him is a decomposing top half of a body, and it’s moving. Arms reaching out toward him snarling as it tries to crawl toward him, as his eyes take in what his brain is refusing to believe, he sees its spine wiggling as it tries to move. Gagging he scrambles up grabs the bike and half jogging he jumps on and starts peddling.</p><p>Although rusted the bike moves easily enough, he would make it to his house quicker than if he was walking.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He can feel the adrenalin rushing through his veins as he arrives at his house. Dropping the bike he half crawls up the stairs and opens the door. As Rick searches the house calling Lori and Carl’s name he stupidly wonders why the door was left unlocked given the war zone the city has become. After finding no trace of anyone in his ransacked house he collapsed on the floor, sobbing. After a few moments he looks up doing a double take when he notices the albums were missing. Lori. She was the only one who would take their albums which meant she and Carl had gotten out. A sudden weight lifted itself from his shoulders and then slammed back down tenfold, If they weren’t here were where they? Where they okay?</p><p>Regaining his composure he moved back to the front door and closed it, he didn’t need anything sneaking up on him. He moved around the house filling a backpack he found in the hall closet with things he might need. The first aide kit was missing along with all the canned food, most likely pack by Lori before they left. Moving into his bedroom he searched the dresser for clothes. Packing a few pairs of jeans, a few t-shirts, boxers, and a couple pair of socks. After changing out of his flimsy hospital gown and boxers, he moved to the nightstand and rummaged around looking for his personal side arm, finding it missing he went to check Lori’s side. She had probably moved it when he was in the hospital to feel safer. Opening the drawer he pulled the sheaf of papers that were on top out and found nothing underneath. She must have took it with them. He went to put the papers back when he glanced at the letter head; ‘Carson &amp; Carson Divorce Attorney’ his body stiffened and with trembling hands he began looking them over. She had already signed them, along with her lawyer almost two week before he was shot. He sat heavily on the edge of the bed, he knew their marriage was rocky but he hadn’t thought they were anywhere close to a divorce. As he sat there a memory suddenly sprang up: about a year ago he was on his way home from work when he saw her getting into her car at a nearby motel, when he asked her about it she had brushed him off saying a friend of her parents were in town and she stopped by to say hi. At the time he brushed the incident off but now he wasn’t so sure. He leapt to his feet when he remember the security camera he set up when a neighbors house was broken into. Swinging the door open he stepped out onto the small porch and grabbed the camera from its perch beside the door. He groaned and almost threw the camera when the dead battery icon appeared. Getting an idea he stepped back inside and went back to the bedroom, he prayed to whoever was listening that the laptop was still charged. Plugging the memory card in he waited to see what his computer would do.</p><p>“Thank you.” He gasped aloud when the laptop came on and showed the video files. As he watched and fast forwarded he didn’t see anything strange or out of the ordinary, when he almost missed it. Someone standing in the camera’s blind spot tilted it to face the yard instead of the door. Confused he continued watching a week later the same person moved the camera but was distracted halfway through, as Rick watched the scene unfold his confusion became hurt which quickly became anger at the evidence of his wife sleeping with his best friend. He slammed the laptop closed and stared at it for a few silent moments. After getting ahold of himself his mind went back to the issue at hand, locating Lori and Carl. He’d deal with Lori and the divorce papers later, remembering the papers he quickly retrieve and signed them before stuffing them inside his bag.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He made it halfway down the front steps of his house when he stopped. He realized he still had no idea what was happening, what had happened to the town, or were to go to look for his family. Dropping his bag he all but collapsed on the stairs head in his hands all the adrenaline, desperation, confusion and anger that kept him going was beginning to fade, and even sitting he was starting to feel dizzy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He noticed a figure stumbling down the road, he was halfway stood up when when a man suddenly came up behind the figure and shot him in the head. Rick watched in horror as the figures-he now realized it was a man-head snapped forward as he crumbled to the ground at the same time as pain suddenly erupted in the back of his head and he fell landing on his side. Vision spotty and quickly going black he saw a young boy’s face look down at him with wide brown eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Carl?” He mumbled deliriously before he passed out.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Rick came to it was with a slight headache, his shoulder however felt better, cleaner. Looking around he saw he was in a bedroom, the window’s covered with blankets and wooden boards so the light couldn’t get in or out. Candle flames flickered making shadows dance across the room.</p><p>“Awake then?” Asked a bald black man as he entered the room. Rick tried to sit up but his wrists were tied to the bed frame. “Got that bandage changed out. It was pretty rank,” the stranger said as he walked over towards him. Rick saw the gun strapped to his hip. “What was it from?”</p><p>“Gunshot.” Rick croaked.</p><p>“Gunshot? Anything else?” He replied as he came to a stop beside the bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“What, gettin' shot isn’t enough?”</p><p>“Look I asked you a question common curtesy is to answer, right? Now answer the question. Did you get bit?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Bit?” Rick repeated confused.</p><p>“Bit, chewed, scratched anything like that?” He asked.</p><p>“No I got shot. Just shot as far as I know,” Rick answered. The man reaches a hand towards him and Rick flinches.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Hey man, just let me.” He chides gently and touches the back of his hand to Rick’s forehead. “Feels cool enough,” he pulls out a switchblade. “Fever would have killed you by now.” He continued as he cuts the rope binding Rick to the bed. “Come on out when you’re able.” The stranger said as he left the room. Rick rolls on his side ignoring the throb it sends through his shoulder. He’s had the day from hell; waking up from a coma and finding his town destroyed along with dead bodies moving, finding out his wife cheated on him with his best friend. And on top of all that not knowing were his child was. With a sigh he swung his legs over the side of the bed, he noticed his shirt and jeans are missing leaving him in nothing but his grey boxers, he wraps the blanket around his mostly bare body as he leaves the room.</p><p>Stepping into a familiar living room he sees the man sitting at the table with his son.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“This place,” he pauses as he looks around at the bare room. The windows in the room are also covered with blankets and wooden boards. “Fred and Cindy Drake?” He questions.</p><p>“Never met them,” the stranger replies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“This is their house, I’ve been here.”</p><p>“It was empty when we got here.” The man says spooning something into a bowl for his son. As Rick moves towards the covered window he reaches for the dark sheet covering it when a voice startles him.</p><p>“Don’t do that they’ll see the light. There’s more of them out there than usual. I never should’ve fired that shot.” The man shakes his head before adding for Rick’s benefit. “Sound draws em’. Now they’re all over the street.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Rick turned to look at him as he remembered what happened before he was hit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“You shot that man today,” Rick accused. The man shrugs as he asked somewhat rhetorically,</p><p>“Man?”</p><p>“Ain’t no man,” the kids says as his dad berates him before motioning for Rick to come eat. After his son says a blessing and they begin to eat they introduce themselves as Morgan and Duane Jones. After dinner the father and son sit on an air mattress while Rick leans against the wall as Morgan explains everything.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He’s in the middle of telling him about the safe zone the military set up in Atlanta when the doorknob started turning. Everyone tenses, creeping quietly to the door Rick looks out the peephole while Morgan tries and fails to calm a crying Duane. After reporting what he sees, a young black woman with messy hair in a white nightgown, Morgan goes on to tell him about his wife who died and came back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>The next morning sees Morgan teaching Rick how to kill ‘walkers’ as he calls them. Before the three of them leave for the police station. Rick surprised the father and son with hot showers; the station had a back up gas generator that hadn’t been used. While waiting for Morgan and Duane to finish showering, Rick found his spare uniform he kept at the station. After Morgan had cut his clothes off looking for bites and scratches he let Rick borrow some of his clothes but it felt good to put on clothes that actually fit him. Bringing them to the gun locker he began splitting the guns and ammo between the two of them, Rick filled up one of the cruisers for himself while Morgan siphoned gas for his jeep before parting ways.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>They each took a walkie promising to turn it on for a few minutes every day at dawn, to save power. Morgan and Duane were going to follow Rick to Atlanta in a few days.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rick ran out of gas thirty miles from the city. Seeing a sign for a gas station about a half mile up the road he pulled over. Grabbing the gas canister and his duffel bag-he decided to stuff everything in the backpack into the duffle carrying the guns so it’d be less to carry.-Pulling down the visor he takes the picture of Lori, Carl and himself folding it so only himself and Carl are visible. Tucking the picture in his front shirt pocket, he sets off. As he gets closer to the station he sees the vehicles parked on the side of the road; some even on the grass going all around the station. He doubted that there would be any gas but it was worth a try.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The buzzing of flies and the smell of rot greeted him as he moved between cars. As suspected there was no gas and he didn’t have the tools to siphon any. He began making his way back through the cars when he heard the soft sound of shuffling feet, he stopped and listened, when the noise came again he dropped to the ground and peered under the car in the direction of the sound. There, a couple cars over were a pair of small feet in pink slippers. Getting to his feet he made his way around the cars, the little girl had her back to him and was shuffling away,</p><p>“Little girl? I’m a police officer, don’t be afraid okay. Little girl?” Rick coaxed in a low voice. He reached his hand out as if to touch her on the shoulder even though she was a couple feet ahead of him, when she turned around. The first thing he noticed was the right side of her mouth was torn, showing teeth. Stumbling back a step he reaches for the pistol on his hip as the little girl stumbles after him, groaning and gnashing her teeth. Bringing his gun up he remembered what Morgan said: it had to be the head, if you didn’t destroy the brain it kept coming. She picks up speed the closer she gets; raising the gun he shoots, the bullet throwing her head back as she falls to the ground, lifeless. Rick stares at her for a moment sadness blinding him.</p><p>He starts walking, backtracking a few miles to a farmhouse he had passed. The house looked abandoned as he walked up the unpaved driveway. Leaving his bag and gas canister on the porch steps he takes the hat he got from the police station off and knocks on the door. “Hello? I’m a police officer, can I borrow some gas?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>When there’s no answer he moved around the house toward a window, “Hello? Anybody home?” Unable to see anything from the windows on this side he goes to the other side and stops dead. This window looks into the living room, at the woman on the floor gunshot wound to the head and the man sitting on a recliner, shotgun under his chin. In blood on the wall above the man are the words ‘God Forgive Us.’</p><p>As he makes his way back to his stuff he sees a pick-up truck beside the house. Jogging over he searches for the keys. Not finding any he moves back toward the house when he hears the neighing of a horse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seeing the horse he decides it would be better to ride it to Atlanta rather than drive, since he couldn’t find any gas. Opening the gate to the pasture he moves slowly towards the horse taking the rope on the fence with him. The horse watches Rick with untrusting eyes, it takes a step back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Easy now easy. I’m not gonna hurt you.” As he gets closer he slowly and gently loops the rope around its neck talking soothingly as he leads it to the barn.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>A few hours later finds Rick on a two lane highway approaching the city. He rides over an overpass moving deeper and deeper into the city; looking around at all the cars, trash, and wreckage that has befallen Atlanta since this all happened. He notices a few walkers beginning to follow and urges the horse on, as they pass an abandoned and somewhat burned city bus.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“It’s just a few nothing we can’t outrun.” He’s not sure if he’s trying to reassure the horse or himself. As they turn onto another street they’re passes an abandoned tank when he hears it. Looking up he sees a helicopter reflected in the glass windows of a skyscraper. Kicking the horse’s flank he tries to follow it, turning down yet another street he freezes and feels his blood turn to ice in his veins. “Oh shit,” he breaths as the horse starts whining and backing up its eyes looking around fearfully. The entire street was filled with walkers. As they start to notice him he turns the horse around and flees. He gets to the abandoned tank when he sees the few stragglers that were following have turned into triple that. He’s blocked on both sides.</p><p>“Oh God, oh shit,” Rick swears breathlessly. He’s desperately trying to find an escape but it’s too late the dead had reached them. The horse starts to panic as walkers grab and pull at them, the frightened horse rears up and Rick is thrown backward, his duffle bag slipping off his shoulder during the fall. As Rick lands painfully on his back, the air knocked out of him, struggling to catch his breath and get up he kicks a walker that’s bending toward him and shoots a couple that got too close. Surrounded by the ones not interested in the feeding frenzy that fell atop the horse he quickly scrambles under the tank, hoping to escape on the other hopefully less crowded side. As he crawls he’s grabbed by the ankle and shoots the walker that grabbed him. Checking the cylinder he sees only one bullet and walkers are now coming from both side of the tank, out of options he puts the revolver to his temple, <em>I will not turn into one of those things, </em>is the last thought he has before he sees a head-a kids head looking at him and reaching out a hand. Quickly he pulls himself through the opening into the bottom of the tank and slams the door shut.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Catching his breath he looks over to his rescuer sitting in the corner as far from Rick as he can get in the small space. The boy is small and thin but not sickly so, he looks around Carl’s age making him eleven or twelve with short messy inky black hair, and the most stunning green eyes Rick has ever seen that are watching him wearily.</p><p>“Thank you,” he breaths trying to get his pounding heart to slow down. He settles himself beside the only other occupant, a dead soldier. Seeing the gun on the soldiers belt Rick reaches for it and that’s when the ‘dead’ soldiers eyes snap open, turns out he wasn’t as dead as he had thought. Bringing his own gun up he fires, using his last bullet to put a hole through the now dead soldiers head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>The sound of the shot echos throughout the small tank making Rick and the boy dizzy and deaf. After a few moments the ringing had somewhat stopped and he hears the crackle of a radio.</p><p>“Hey dumbass. Yeah you in the tank, cozy in there?” A male voice asks from the radio. Rick looks incredulous at the radio then at the kid, who’s eyebrow is raised before he moves to grab the radio.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
