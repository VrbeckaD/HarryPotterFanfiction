    <p>
  <span>Draco still wasn’t used to taking his copy of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Prophet</span>
  </em>
  <span> from the delivery owl and seeing something other than Harry Potter’s face plastered across the front page. Not that he was used to seeing Harry Potter’s face, but the past several years had seen him featured in the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Prophet</span>
  </em>
  <span> far more than anyone or anything else. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>At first, the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Prophet</span>
  </em>
  <span> had continued running stories on the Boy Who Lived. None of the public had seen hide nor hair of him since testifying at all three Malfoy’s trials. Even Rita Skeeter couldn’t track him down - not for lack of trying, of course. People had swarmed Godric’s Hollow, had followed Weasley’s back to their homes, even started creeping towards the Manor to ask Draco himself. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Months later, they occasionally ran a small story on the latest conspiracy theories, but Harry Potter no longer dominated all conversations. Draco was relieved. It wasn’t like he was all that special anyway. He should’ve stayed with his muggles and never come into Draco’s life. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He almost wished he could tell everyone where Harry Potter was, because that would mean he would know where to find him so he could give him everything he deserved. He had looked Draco in the eyes and told the entire Wizengamot about that night at the Manor, the torture and the fear and the scrambling mess of a fight and how Draco had looked at him and known him, and did not give him up. He told them about the night on the Astronomy Tower, and he watched as Draco realized that he had not been alone with Dumbledore after all. He looked away after that, as if he couldn’t look at Draco when he told them about his connection to Voldemort, about watching the absolute power he had over the Malfoys, about forcing Draco to do horrible things, the threats against his family, all the horrible things he saw through that monster’s eyes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He’d been allowed to sit in on his mother’s trial as well, and once again he stared as Harry Potter told a story about Narcissa saving his life, of her unwavering love for her son, knowing that if she could keep Potter alive, she could see her son again. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco and his mother had then sat side-by-side, no longer facing imprisonment, as Harry Potter once more stood in front of the Wizengamot. He did not look at Draco even once this time. His voice was darker, his eyes brighter, and Draco saw his hand stray to his wand every so often. When he spoke, he didn’t start where Draco expected. Instead, he described a certain diary being slipped into an eleven year old girl’s cauldron, leading to the opening of the Chamber of Secrets and his second encounter with Voldemort. He never paused in his narrative, skipping forward to fourth year, when he was tricked into a graveyard and pinned to a gravestone while Lucius Malfoy came crawling to his master’s call. Then the next year, when he was tricked into the Department of Mysteries and Lucius Malfoy came close to killing every one of his friends. The next year, knowing that Voldemort had taken up residence in the Manor, of the terror he had brought upon his family. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He stopped then, like he wanted to look at Draco, but didn’t. Instead, he ended by once again recounting the events at the Manor, and ending with Lucius’ involvement in the attack on Hogwarts. Then he fell silent. “I have called for mercy on behalf of two Malfoys today because I knew that all their sins are on the shoulders of one Malfoy, and he should pay for them all.” The Wizengamot, intent on his narrative, had taken several moments to gather themselves enough to thank and dismiss him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry Potter deserved as many curses as Draco could think of. How dare he stand there, pouring all his goodness onto Draco as if he deserved a shred of it. How dare he give all his sins to his father when he knew what he was doing. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Draco?” With a start, Draco realized he had crushed the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Prophet</span>
  </em>
  <span> in his hand, and his mother was standing in the doorway, looking concerned. “Are you alright, darling?” she asked, coming to take his hand. </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“I’m quite alright, Mother. Thank you.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She looked unconvinced but let it go. Draco glanced at the Potter-less front page, then tossed the paper away. Dwelling on Harry Potter had never gotten him anywhere. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>****</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Portkey that landed Harry Potter and his two best friends in Sydney was a rock. Ron commented on lack of originality, but Harry thought it was amusing. </span>
  <em>
    <span>If only Voldemort had thought of a rock</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Once there, tt took days for them to orient themselves enough to attempt to find the Grangers, and weeks after that to actually find them. Hermione still had an owl deliver a </span>
  <em>
    <span>Prophet</span>
  </em>
  <span> once a week, and it was always a week behind. It entertained them to see the theories on the disappearance of Harry Potter, but Harry was relieved when he finally looked at a copy and didn’t see himself. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron, of course, had needed Hermione’s expert charms to keep from being burnt to a crisp, but both Harry’s and Hermione’s dark skin thrived under the baking sun. Being away from Britain was doing good for all of them, but Harry still couldn’t sleep for more than a few hours without nightmares waking him up, and Ron had a habit of checking on everyone’s whereabouts far too often, afraid to lose them again. Hermione had brought dozens of books in her beaded bag. She felt restless and useless when she wasn’t reading.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Once Hermione’s parents were found, she performed some complicated charm work on them to convince them back to London. After months of being away, they were finally going to go home.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>****</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After arriving in London, Hermione promptly Stunned her parents and took them to St. Mungo’s to get them treated and back to their normal selves. Harry and Ron were given the task of returning their belongings to Grimmauld Place, which was accomplished with much groaning. They’d decided to all stay at Grimmauld for the time being, since they weren’t going to live at the Burrow, and it didn’t make sense for Ron and Hermione to get their own place when Hermione was returning to Hogwarts for her last year. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After moving everything in, Ron Floo’d to the Burrow. He invited Harry along, but Harry waved him off and promised to visit the Weasley’s soon. Once Ron had gone, Harry stood in the drawing room and ran his hands through his hair. The silence was pervasive in this house, a heavy thing that wrapped around you like a blanket. Harry was unaccustomed to being alone, in the quiet, with no mission before him. He took it all in for several long minutes before trudging up to the room he’d come to think of as his.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>No one had seen Harry return to London, but Hermione’s and Ron’s returns were noted, and suddenly he was back in the paper. Owls began finding him again, with a combination of fan mail and requests for interviews and endless letters from various Ministry departments, asking for favors and offering jobs. He chucked them all into a pile in the drawing room and let them gather dust. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry spent most of the next several days at Grimmauld. Ron and Hermione were gone most of the day, returning mostly to bring back food and share Wizarding gossip before going to sleep in their room upstairs. Hermione was visiting her parents and preparing to return to Hogwarts, a few weeks past the start of term. She was as frantic about classes as usual, and Ron reminded her about how much she’d been studying, as usual. Ron himself was helping George with the joke shop, and Harry didn’t know what to do.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>For the first time, Harry had nothing. He had fulfilled his destiny, so what point was there in anything else? The Aurors were practically begging him to join them, but the thought of using his power on behalf of the Ministry made him feel sick. Hermione had asked him to return to Hogwarts, but for as much as it had once felt like home, now it felt only like death. So he spent his time cleaning Grimmauld Place, much like Molly had once made them all try to clean. Only this time, he had nothing else to do and a need to be useful, and he made more progress than they had years ago.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The only thing that made him leave was when Andromeda Tonks sent him a letter to tell him that, as Teddy’s godfather, he was welcome any time. She’d attached a picture of a small, chubby baby with a tuft of blue hair, and he found himself both smiling and crying. He remembered Remus’ last words - “</span>
  <em>
    <span>he will know why I died and I hope he will understand I was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So Harry Floo’d to Andromeda’s place, once again pausing to remind himself that she was not her sister. It was easier to remember when she had a baby on her hip and was gently bouncing him up and down, and when she smiled warmly at Harry. “Hello dear,” she greeted. “We’re glad you came by.” </span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>“Thanks for, er, inviting me,” he said. “Again.” The house was the same as when he’d arrived the year previous, only Ted Tonks wasn’t there to welcome him alongside his wife. </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“Well, since you’re here, could you take him for a few minutes? I’m trying to get dinner finished.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry hesitated, and she smiled at him. “Have you ever held a baby?”</span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>“No, I haven’t,” he replied, and she just pressed Teddy into his arms. </span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“Just don’t drop him, and feel free to sit down.” She gestured to the couch and promptly left the room. Harry stood for a moment longer, then decided sitting would be the best way to not drop him. Teddy sat on his lap, chubby legs stretched out with his little toes pressing into Harry’s belly. Harry kept his hands around his torso and watched as Teddy waved his hands towards him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hi Teddy,” he said quietly. “I’m your godfather. I promise I’ll always be here for you. Your dad - your dad said he loves you. I’ll tell you all about him, and your mum too. They loved you so much. Remus wants you to know that they were making a better world for you. I like to think the same thing about my parents, you know. I’ll tell you about them too, and all the trouble my dad got your dad in. And my godfather, who I guess is your grand-godfather, or something like that.” Teddy watched him seriously, as if he understood everything Harry was saying. Harry wasn’t even sure what he was saying or why, but Teddy didn’t seem to mind. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He likes you,” Andromeda remarked from the kitchen doorway, startling Harry. </span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>“I don’t really know what I’m doing,” Harry replied with a wry smile. </span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>“That’s alright. You’ll learn. I hope you stay for dinner?” While it seemed like a polite request, Harry wondered how often she had company these days, how lonely it must be without her husband or her daughter. He smiled and nodded.</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“Yeah, alright.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>With the exception of visiting Teddy, Harry hadn’t left Grimmauld since they’d returned to London. He wasn’t sure if he was ready to be seen in public. After two weeks, Hermione asked if he would come visit her parents, and he agreed, if somewhat reluctantly. They were still in St. Mungo’s, though the healers predicted they would be able to go home soon. Hermione Floo’d them to the hospital lobby, where they were checked in (with many stares) and sent up to one of the wards. Whispers trailed Harry, and Hermione looped her arm through his, keeping up a constant stream of chatter about her NEWTs in an obvious attempt to distract him. After all this time, the attention didn’t really bother him all that much, but he appreciated the thought.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hi Mum, Dad,” Hermione said as she pushed open the door to their room. Harry followed hesitantly. </span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>“Hermione!” her mum exclaimed. “It’s so good to see you. It must’ve been ages since we saw you.” </span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>“I was here yesterday, Mum, remember?” Hermione explained patiently. She had told Harry that their memory wasn’t quite to normal yet, but they were doing much better. “Do you remember my friend Harry?” Mrs. Granger noticed him then and smiled.</span>
  <span></span>
    <br/>
  
  <span>“Of course. It’s good to see you.”</span>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>“It’s good to see you too. Both of you,” he said, glancing at Mr. Granger, who was watching his wife and daughter with a small smile.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He sat nearby while Hermione talked to her parents, letting himself be dragged into the conversation every now and then. He was just getting bored when a nurse walked in and announced that it was time for another dose of potions, and Harry turned to see the nurse walk in, followed by an all-too familiar face. </span>
