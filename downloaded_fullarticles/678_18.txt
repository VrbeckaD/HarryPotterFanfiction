  <span>I gasped and opened my eyes, revealing two faces staring down at me. “What's going on?” I asked softly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You're awake Abraxas,” my brother Lucius whispered, his face full of shock. “You're awake.” I blinked up at his face with confusion as I shifted my eyes from him to James Potter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What happened?” I asked, my voice croaking as I spoke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What is the last thing that you remember?” James asked me.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I racked my brain and a memory surfaced. “Of killing Voldemort,” I whispered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you remember what happened afterwards?” James asked. I shook my head. “You bargained with death and saved my soul.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How?” I asked as I stared in his hazel eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don't know. I don't remember everything that happened. At one point I was meeting Death and you appeared and then the next thing I know I was being flooded with your memories. Death told me that I owe you everything and that he will be visiting you soon,” James said all in one breath. “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I just nodded my head, as I wondered why I felt so drawn to Potter. I sat up and my brother hurried from the room, looking for a healer. James poured some water in a cup and then handed it to me. As our hands touched, I gasped as all my memories came rushing back into my head. When I surfaced, James was staring at me worried.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you okay?” He asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I remember everything,” I whispered. “The Dark Lord was after your son.” I paused as I tried to string my memories back together in order. “And Severus made me promise to protect Lily because he had loved her.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why would you risk your life for him?” James asked as he took a seat on the edge of the bed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because I loved him,” I answered honestly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James nodded his head, but there was a look in his eyes that I couldn’t quite read. “What do remember happened next?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I went to your house and I sacrificed myself for you and your family,” I answered. “I should be dead….is the Dark Lord dead?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, you killed him and you saved my whole family,” James said. “What else do you remember?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You were also hit with a spell too….and we were both dying and then Death appeared and I made a deal with him…..we both did,” I responded as I stared at James with wide eyes. “Is that why I feel so drawn to you?” I asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James just leaned forward and placed a kiss on my lips. I pulled back and stared at him. “You’re married James. Don’t do that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James shook his head as he moved closer to me. “I’m not married anymore.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why?” I asked as he reached down and gripped my hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’ve been unconscious for two years now Abraxas,” James stated and I gasped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“When I woke up from my magically coma a year ago, everything was different. Lily thought I was going to die and Severus was there to comfort her, so when I woke up it was to find them in love with each other. Lily and I tried to make it work, but neither of us was into it. I felt like half of my soul was missing and my eyes were open but I wasn’t awake. Then I found you. I had come to you to thank you, but when I realized that you were still in a coma, I knew then why I felt the way that I did. You and I are joined as one, I could not live without you so I began to travel the world hoping that I could find something that would wake you from your slumber, but nothing worked.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then how did I wake up?” I asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I kissed you on the lips and you woke right up,” James stated. “Like Sleeping Beauty.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I stared at him for a moment in shock and then I questioned his metaphor. “What is Sleeping Beauty?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll have to read it to you sometime,” James said with a smile as he stood up. The curtain was pushed to the side and Lucius had come back with a Healer who began to exam me.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You seem perfectly fine. All your vitals are good. I recommended resting these next few weeks, don’t do anything strenuous.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Does that mean he can go home?” Lucius asked. The Healer nodded his head as he turned on his heels and hurried from the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lucius sent a glare at James before turning to me with a smile. “I have a room made up for you in my Manor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>I looked past Lucius to James to see him preparing to leave. “I don’t want to go home with you brother,” I stated and James stopped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lucius frowned. “There is no where else for you to go.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I want to go with James,” I answered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why?” He asked with a disgusted look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because it feels right,” I answered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lucius sighed as he gripped his cane tightly. He turned and faced James, shoving his cane into his chest. “If anything happens to my brother, I will make you pay,” Lucius said. James just nodded his head, a smile forming on his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lucius turned back to me and patted me on the head. “Let me know if you need anything,” he said with a small smile before leaving the room with a mask on his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>James helped me to my feet and then handed me some clothes to change into. He turned his back on me as I changed and I smiled at the action. When I was done, he grabbed ahold of my arm and apparated us out of the Hospital and into the entryway of a Manor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Where are we?” I asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Potter Manor,” came his short reply.</span>
