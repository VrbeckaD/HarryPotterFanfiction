Life After Death.</p><p> </p><p>A/N: This will eventually be a Severus /Hermione.</p><p> </p><p>"Severus, it has begun," said the painting of Albus Dumbledore from the wall of the headmasters office. Headmaster Snape looked at the painting of his friend and mentor with a look of dread on his dark features. Nodding he stood and straightened out his robes. He absent mindedly ran his tongue over the muggle dental caps on his back teeth. Dr. Granger had pulled two teeth for Severus and replaced them with hollow false caps that contained a powerful anti-venom to Voldemorts' accursed snakes bite and the most potent healing potion he could brew.</p><p>On his way through the castle he ran into Minerva and while to anyone watching it seemed as if they traded vitriol as usual, it was not the case at all. When Snape looked into the older witches eye he cast a silent Legilimens.</p><p>"Don't look so worried. I'll see you in a few hours. I know you have everything prepared and won't allow anything to go wrong. Take care of the students." He never broke stride as he passed her in the hall and she didn't allow herself to look back. He knew she had everything under control. She had to, lives of students were at stake.</p><p>He kept walking to the front doors as the mark in his arm began to burn. He stepped out on the entrance stairs and disappeared only to reappear in the blink of an eye in the Shrieking Shack. He bowed before a monster that Severus knew would soon be dead. He could hear Potter and his lackey's behind the crate that Severus had so painstakingly placed days ago. He sent silent prayer to Merlin that this would go like clockwork. As Nagini's bubble came closer he knew what was to come. When Nagini struck Severus bit down on the cap with the anti-venom and tasted the sharp potion on his tongue. Everything went black for a moment.</p><p>Severus was vaguely aware of the sound of the crate scraping across the floor and hoped the silly boy had waited for the Dark Lord to leave before he came into the shack. Opening his eyes he saw the three standing over him. He bit down on the healing potion and hoped it would repair the damage to his neck before he bled to death. It hurt almost as bad as a Crucio. Still he forced his way through the pain as he learned to do when just a small boy.</p><p>He finished what he had to do with the Golden Trio. He could feel the healing potion start to do it's job. He had finished his last service to Dumbledore. Potter now knew everything he needed to complete his task. Everyone thought him dead and he was free of both Masters now. As long as he survived at least. He closed his eyes too tired and in too much pain to care anymore.</p><p>Sometime later he opened his eyes and saw Minerva and Poppy standing over him. He looked around and realized he was in the secret room off the infirmary. His head and neck still ached but it was not the blinding pain it had been.</p><p>"Minerva, the students, did Potter win?" he croaked between dry lips. Apparently his potions were still trying to fight the venom in his body. He wanted to at least sit up but knew he couldn't. Gods how he hated to feel weak.</p><p>"Yes, Severus. There were heavy losses but Potter lived to save the day. Rest, everything will be fine." she replied quietly. He realized she was tucking in his blankets and let her do it. The normally stoic man allowed her to comfort him just a little. It was testament to just how tired and hurt he was.</p><p> </p><p>Several days later he stood in quarters in the dungeon for the last time. Looking around he checked to make sure he had everything. In his hand was a picture. He glanced at it one last time before he carefully packed it into the small valise at his feet. It was Hermione sitting by the lake. Her face was in profile looking out over the water as the wind gently blew a few stray curls across her face and she turned to camera and gave a sweet smile. It was his favorite picture of her.</p><p>"Tell her Severus. She may surprise you. She is much more mature than her counterparts." Minerva said from across the room. She had known for sometime that Severus loved Hermione from afar but wanted to wait until she was older to say anything. The war was over and he was leaving for the Prince family villa in Italy. He was the last of the Prince line and inherited a considerable fortune. He had sold most of the properties and started a potions greenhouse and laboratory under the name Alan Prince.</p><p>""Not yet Minerva. She has to follow her own path for a while yet. She will be much older before our paths will cross again. Sybil was very clear in her prediction of my future. I would not have believed it myself if I had not witnessed it. he said in response to her snort of derision.</p><p>"What if she marries the Weasley boy? What will you do then Severus?"She asked with an edge to her voice. She had taken this man under her wing when he just a broken boy at the age of 11. He had been at the tender mercies of his father since his mothers death. This little half blood who had been sorted into the most dangerous house in the whole school for someone who was not a pureblood. A child who was so despondent because he could not be a Gryffindor like his best friend Lillie.</p><p>"I'm not certain. My heart will have to endure it, somehow. You know as well as I do the prophecy said she will come to me after a great personal tragedy. I had thought it would be the war but it was not. If I rush this I will lose her for good. If I have learned nothing else in my life I have learned patience. I will wait." he said with finality.</p><p>The two of them left later that day to the villa in Italy. It was everything he could want in his new life, except the woman he wanted to spend his life with. Minerva had helped him get settled and went back to Hogwarts. Keeping his secret proved hard over time.</p><p>TBC</p>
