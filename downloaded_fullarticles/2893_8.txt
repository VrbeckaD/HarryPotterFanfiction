    <p>“I’m telling you, Sirius, we’re both in. You were bloody great out there.”</p><p>James ran his hands through his hair, trying to mold the sweaty mess into some sort of shape, as he and Sirius climbed back up the steps to Gryffindor Tower. They’d come from Quidditch tryouts, down on the pitch, and it was the hottest day since they’d arrived back at Hogwarts two weeks ago. One fourth-year girl had even fainted, though whether that was from the heat or a delayed response to a particularly bad Bludger-blow was still in question.</p><p>“I mean, that’s nice of you to say, James, but you’re full of dragon dung.” Sirius looked grim. He’d grown out his hair a bit over the summer, but the heat had made it limp, and it clung to his neck like an army of snakes. He’d spent half the walk back ranting that he was going to use a Severing Charm on it as soon as he got upstairs, even if he had to cut his own throat in the process.</p><p>“You’re the only one who never got hit with a Bludger,” James protested, “and—”</p><p>“That might be true,” Sirius interrupted. “But I was also the only one in our group who didn’t score. Not once. Gideon Prewett is not going to want a Chaser who can’t score, no matter how good at dodging Bludgers they are.”</p><p>“Well, maybe you can be the team’s Seeker. I know Gideon isn’t looking for one, but you probably impressed him with that speed of yours.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>James was lying, of course. And Sirius didn’t even consider playing along.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Isaac Langley spent three months in the hospital wing last year re-learning how to count,” Sirius said, as they approached the Fat Lady. “And he could still fly circles around me any day of the week.”</p><p>“Well—”</p><p>“James. It’s fine. I came down, I tried out, I’m clearly not Quidditch material. Stop worrying about me so much. You be the Quidditch star. Remus, Peter, and me can be your cheering squad.”</p><p>“And some of the girls, right?” James said. “There’s got to be at least one girl cheering for me or I’m gonna be the laughing stock of the castle.”</p><p>“Sure,” Sirius allowed. “Not Quickley and Dawlish, though; they’re bloody daft. And Evans isn’t not allowed until she dumps that greasy friend of hers.”</p><p>“Oh,” James said. He’d been hoping for Lily. “I thought you two buried the hatchet at the start-of-term feast.”</p><p>“Jobberknoll,” Sirius said to the portrait, who smiled and swung open on her hinges. “And not really,” he continued. “It was nice to chat, I guess, but then as soon as the feast was over she ditched all of us to go talk to Snivellus. Hasn’t seen any of us all summer and that slimy git is still her priority.”</p><p>“Right,” James said, absentmindedly. Maybe if Sirius and Remus got Beatrix and Mary to join them, Lily would come along anyway…</p><p>As he and Sirius stepped through the portrait hole, James suddenly realized there were an awful lot of students crowded into the common room, huddled in corners and whispering. Crying too, he realized with a jolt — almost all of the girls, and the boys looked sick.</p><p>“Bloody hell,” he said, reaching out an arm to stop Sirius. “What’s going on?”</p><p>“Beats me,” Sirius said, scanning the room. “Remus’ll know.”</p><p>He pointed across the room at Lupin, who was sitting at a small table, tearing a piece of parchment into tiny bits and nodding at whatever a pale-faced Peter was saying to him.</p><p>He and Sirius cut straight through the mass of students, getting a few dirty looks from the older ones as they passed by. James only caught a few words here and there —<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Last night.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Aurors.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Fire.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Warning.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“Murder.”</p><p>“Thank god you’re here!” Peter shouted as he saw them approach. “We were going to come down to the pitch and get you. Well, okay, I was. Remus didn’t want to. He said it was dumb.”</p><p>“It was dumb.” It looked like January on the table in front of Remus, or the aftermath of a very sad party. The scrap of paper he was currently shredding into confetti wasn’t his first. “We only found out like 20 minutes ago.”</p><p>“Found out what?” James said, hurrying to sit down and lean in close. “Obviously everyone knows except us.”</p><p>Neither Remus nor Peter seemed to want to answer. But Remus was finally the one who did. “There’s been another attack.”</p><p>“The Death Eaters?” That didn’t really surprise James. The renegade group of wizards and witches had been lashing out at Muggles all summer — or at least that was what he had picked up from his parents, who were finally either worried or lax enough to talk about it when he was around.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>James knew enough not to ask directly about the Death Eaters — acknowledging his interest in something usually made his parents clam right up — but he had listened out of idle curiosity without looking too attentive. He’d already known that the group, led by some maniac who called himself “Voldemort,” had been operating since before he’d come to Hogwarts, and that the Ministry was “at war” with them — but as far as he could tell, there was no such war happening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Or, at least, it had never gotten big enough to notice. Not until this summer. Now he was seeing articles on the front page of the <em>Prophet</em> before his dad could snatch it away, and he was catching his parents sneaking off to a remote corner of the house to fret about it at least every other week.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Peter nodded, like his head was going to pop off. James felt his whole body relax. “I mean, that’s sad,” he whispered, “but it doesn’t really explain why the whole of Gryffindor House is acting weird like this about a few Muggles.”</p><p>“That’s just it,” Remus said. “It’s not a few Muggles. It’s wizards. Julie Queshire’s entire family was executed in Cokeworth last night.”</p><p>James couldn’t breathe. Next to him, he heard Sirius gasp, “Holy shite.” But he barely even heard him over his own heartbeat.</p><p>Julie Queshire was one of them. A fourth-year Gryffindor with long brown hair who always seemed to be in the common room, putting off studying. James knew she had an older brother who graduated from Ravenclaw last year, Hayden, because she had always been complaining about how good he was doing in all his NEWT classes. Just last weekend, he’d heard her telling Martha Church she was glad to be the only one of them at Hogwarts this year, so her mum would stop comparing the two of them. Then they’d taken turns folding paper into animal shapes, and Banishing them back and forth across the room.</p><p>And now her family was dead? Murdered?</p><p>“T-that’s not possible,” Sirius stammered. “The Queshires…they’re one of the oldest pureblood families in Britain. The Death Eaters are against Muggles, not against us.”</p><p>Remus’s lips tightened into a sharp white line. “Pureblood or not,” he said. “they’re dead. All of them. Her parents, her brother, and one or two other wizards who had the misfortune of visiting them yesterday.”</p><p>“At least that’s what we’ve heard,” Peter added. “I guess McGonagall sent Fabian and Sarina to bring Julie to her office earlier today. They thought it was just normal prefect fetch-and-grab but then they heard her screaming and crying behind the door. And then…well, you know how the rumor mill is here.”</p><p>“That’s horrible,” James finally said. “Her whole family. Gone.”</p><p>He and the others sat there, silently. James’s thoughts were on his parents, lying flat on their backs in the family manor, bodies charred by some Dark spell. And him, standing there, looking down on them, helpless.</p><p>“Is that all we know?” he asked, after a few minutes. “Nothing in the <em>Prophet</em>?”</p><p>“Maybe it’ll be in the Sunday edition tomorrow,” Remus said. “But I heard Angie Trelawney and Blake Wilson poring over her copy cover-to-cover earlier. Nothing yet.”</p><p>“Why?” Sirius said, still stunned. “This is the first time the Death Eaters have attacked anyone but Muggles. Why would they change their strategy now?”</p><p>“Maybe it was an accident,” Peter said. “Or maybe the Queshires said something a Death Eater just didn’t like.”</p><p>“Or maybe they’re finally done toying with Muggles and they want people to pay attention.” There was a hard edge in Remus’s voice. “Haven’t you all been following the same news this summer as me? This isn’t just a bunch of disgruntled rejects anymore. They’re like the IRA now. Militant. Underground.”</p><p>“The what?” Sirius asked.</p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p>“Whatever they are,” James interjected, before Sirius and Remus started properly bickering, “they can’t get us here at Hogwarts. And now that they’ve done this…awful thing…the Ministry won’t let it just keep happening. Right?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Peter said. “Besides, we have the best secret hiding spot in Hogwarts, remember? Even if they do show up here, we could just go hide in the Cavern.”</p><p>“They wouldn’t show up here,” Sirius said, testily. “Their objective is to overturn the Ministry and gain power. There’s no benefit to them in attacking Hogwarts.”</p><p>“We don’t know that,” Remus said. “We don’t know anything. Even if they weren’t a complete mystery even to most of the Ministry, we’re stuck here. The only information we get about the war is thirdhand at best, things other students have overheard or tidbits plucked out of the <em>Prophet.”</em></p><p>“We need to get information from the source,” James muttered to himself, a thought occurring to him. A student’s family had been killed, and the news came straight from one of the professors. So the best way to learn more would be to see what that professor said to her colleagues…and there was something in his trunk that would be extremely helpful in that endeavor.</p><hr/><p align="left">James should have felt worse about this. But he’d stopped feeling guilty about his secret Invisibility Cloak months ago.</p><p>He’d weighed the pros and cons of telling the other boys about it for two weeks after Christmas, hiding it in the back of his wardrobe the whole time so they wouldn’t find it. An ironic problem for an Invisibility Cloak, he supposed.</p><p>But the more he thought about it, the less it made sense. He’d only known Sirius, Remus and Peter for a few months. His father had sent it in secret, instructed him to open it in secret. It made sense to keep it that way.</p><p>Besides, he’d said to be irresponsible.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>So one cold January night, after everyone was in bed, he’d pulled the cloak out from under his pillow, draped it over his body, and crept out of the dorm for the first of many trips.</p><p>The Invisibility Cloak was clearly designed for an adult. When James wore it the way it was meant to be, tied at his throat, it dragged on the floor for a foot or more. Instead, he went out with the whole thing draped over his head, like he was hiding under a tablecloth. It felt silly at first — but, of course, all it took was a glance in the mirror to remind him that no one could see how silly he looked.</p><p>He went out once every week or so, after that. Mostly at night — especially when he was first exploring — but as he got braver he began lurking around the castle during the day too. Daytime trips were actually better, in many ways. He wasn’t exhausted the next day, for one, and he didn’t have to worry about the dual problems of waking the other boys — if they were all upstairs — or blowing them off, if they were headed to Peter’s hidey-hole.</p><p>But the best thing of all was listening to everyone else.</p><p>It was astounding, the things people would say or do when they thought no one was around. Last term, he came across no less than five couples snogging someone other than their usual boyfriends and girlfriends, including Tom Gallagher again — Invisibility Cloak or not, he’d skedaddled out of that particular situation quickly on instinct alone. He felt bad for Nicholas Bulstrode, though; he’d seen him with Tom again a few weeks later as if nothing had happened.</p><p>One of his first trips, after testing out the Cloak in the Gryffindor common room, had been to go back down to the Slytherin dungeons, and wait by the entrance. He hadn’t dared go in — too risky, even if he was completely concealed — but he’d overheard that just about every graduating seventh year was heading out to join the Death Eaters in the summer, even that wanker Percival Cain, who’d gotten and turned down an offer from the Caerphilly Catapults.</p><p>Without even trying, just wandering around the castle, he’d overheard conversations he should have been nowhere near. Tales of family strife and broken hearts and good news and successes and failures and secrets.</p><p>And today, he was going to the staff room for more.</p><p>He hadn’t used the Invisibility Cloak since getting back to Hogwarts, but sneaking into their professor’s hidden sanctum was a fitting adventure to kick off his second year. He’d actually seen a bit of the staff room once before — he’d walked partway into the room in his third week, thinking it was a toilet. The sudden appearance of Professor McGonagall had certainly clarified that mistake quickly.</p><p>This time around, he was hoping she’d be there. McGonagall was their head of house and deputy headmistress. If anyone knew what had happened to the Queshires, it would be her.</p><p>His hope was not to be, it seemed. James had caught a lucky break on the way in — Professor Sprout was hurrying the same direction as him, and he was able to slip in by catching the door behind her with his shoulder before it closed all the way — but McGonagall was nowhere to be seen in the small square room.</p><p>Almost every other professor was there, though. Two square tables had been pushed together across the room, with O’Brien and Slughorn seeming to hold court at opposite ends. Between them was practically the whole teaching staff, many of whom James didn’t properly recognize. It was easier to see which teachers were absent: McGonagall, their astronomy professor Apollo Sargas, Professor Binns — though if the ghost had showed up, James probably would have fainted with surprise on the spot.</p><p>Most of the professors had serious, solemn looks on their faces, befitting the moment. The exception, pale and quivering, was Professor Lexington, their worthless Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Lexington had come to Hogwarts after the winter holidays last year, replacing Professor Brocken — the only real casualty of the Warbling Cough outbreak.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>James had never heard more than a garbled version of the truth as to why she never returned to Hogwarts, even after he’d started sneaking through corridors with the Invisibility Cloak over his head. The most he knew was that she’d gotten sick. <em>Very</em> sick.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>But beyond that was hazy. The truth was somewhere between Brocken being so outraged at Hogwarts’ lack of immunization policies that she quit, or Brocken hacking up a petrel so large it tore her throat in half on the way out — but if anyone knew they weren’t talking. And potentially neither was Brocken, he supposed.</p><p>Lexington had replaced her, and he’d seemed like a relief at first. Brocken had been so intense, it was nice to have someone like Lexington running the class. Lexington was about her same age, James suspected, but he was calm, took his time with lessons, didn’t assign much homework. Of course, in April, James and the other boys had taken a look through their notes from Brocken’s class, for old times’ sake, and realized that their old professor had expected them to know three times as many spells as Lexington had taught them in a few months. And that they barely knew how to properly do the handful he’d taught them.</p><p>They hadn’t been the… most well-behaved students in the class since then.</p><p>“We really should have been told, Horace,” said the woman Sprout was squeezing in next to, a witch with sharp, pointed features. “Can’t you say something to Dumbledore?”</p><p>Slughorn looked over at her, amused. “I think, Septima, you have not been here long enough to learn that Dumbledore does not truly take suggestions. Nor does he choose to inform beyond a need-to-know basis. I’m surprised we found out this soon, to be honest.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be late,” Sprout said. “My walking camellias and the fourth-years have been having a terrible time together this fall — I had to keep a rowdy contingent of them from storming out of Greenhouse 3.”</p><p>James wondered whether it was the camellias or the fourth-years who were upset.</p><p>“Are Minerva and Apollo coming?”</p><p>“I doubt it,” said Slughorn. “I think Minerva’s still with the girl. Helping her to make arrangements.”</p><p>“And I saw Apollo on his way up to Ravenclaw Tower.” This was one of the professors James didn’t know, a man with a stiff brown beard and a severe middle part. “He said he was going to see if any of the older students needed someone to speak to. The boy graduated just last year, you know.”</p><p>That made the witch next to Sprout start crying, though she seemed to grow all the more furious for it. Sprout rubbed her shoulder sympathetically before speaking again.</p><p>“Then let’s get on with this,” she said. “We know it was the Death Eaters? Not something else? Some…accident?”</p><p>Several of the teachers began talking over each other, but O’Brien interrupted them all loudly. “Without a doubt. Dumbledore had me—”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>He stopped, and scanned the other teachers, as if thinking about what he’d revealed. It made the hair on James’s neck stand up.</p><p>Whatever O’Brien was going to say, he didn’t say it. “Trust me,” he continued. “This was a targeted strike. Which, if you’ve been paying attention, means it wasn’t just a random group of Death Eaters who decided that ‘Muggle-lovers’ are worth targeting now.”</p><p>Sprout gasped, and Lexington got even paler, which James wouldn’t have guessed possible. “Y-you mean…” he stammered.</p><p>“We think…I think…the rumor I am hearing is that a top-level Death Eater was in charge of the strike. Voldemort may have even been there in person.”</p><p>The teachers reacted like the wizard himself had walked in the room, gasping back surprise and looking back and forth at one another. Lexington even squeaked. What a loathsome excuse for a Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.</p><p>“That’s not my opinion,” O’Brien quickly clarified, raising his hands to try and quell the uproar. “I don’t think he would risk exposure over the Queshires. But the fact of the matter is this was a targeted attack. Not a spree killing, or an impulse, or an accident.”</p><p>“Well, that makes sense, doesn’t it?” This was the wizard with the beard again, sternly looking over the assembled group.</p><p>“What do you mean, Mordicus?” asked a one-armed wizard who must have been the infamous Professor Kettleburn. James took a step or two closer, hesitant to miss a word.</p><p>“Come on,” Mordicus said, seeming to grow impatient. “You all must know that Warren Queshire is a member of the Wizengamot. Not especially high-ranking, but his bloodline makes up for that. We can’t assume the Death Eaters chose him and his family by chance.”</p><p>James hadn’t known Julie Queshire’s father was on the Wizengamot, but it made sense. Most every pureblood family in the country had a relative who’d been selected for the court within the last half-century, and selection wasn’t always a matter of political position within the Ministry. His father had actually been nominated for a seat shortly after selling Sleekeazy’s and retiring — he always said at parties he’d rejected it because he wanted to “spend more time with my lovely wife,” but when they were home James’s mother always reminded him that he was just grumpy about the Chief Warlock having dated her during their Hogwarts days.</p><p>There were dozens of members to the Wizengamot, most of whom served at their leisure and were only required to go into London for major trials. Presumably Warren Queshire was one of these — and thereby not qualified for Auror protection at his home.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>“This is an assassination, not just a murder,” Egg continued, “and its intent is to strike fear into the heart of British wizarding society — so we will capitulate to Voldemort’s monstrous demands instead of fighting back.”</p><p>“Well it is <em>working</em>!”</p><p>The shout came from Lexington, who sprang to his feet. James had never seen the professor move so fast.</p><p>“Louis, sit down,” O’Brien snapped. “You’re embarrassing yourself.”</p><p>“You’re embarrassing <em>your</em>self!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>James had thought Lexington was a lousy teacher, but it was disappointing to see he was as horrible a person out of the classroom too.</p><p>“We’re sitting here, talking, and You-Know-Who—”</p><p>“<em>Voldemort,</em>” O’Brien cut in sharply. “The man calls himself Voldemort. And those of us who have been at this school longer than 20 minutes know his true name is—”</p><p>“Whatever you call him,” Lexington screeched, “he is coming for all of us now. We refused his demands, refused to surrender the Ministry to his superior strength, and now everyone of us is in mortal peril!”</p><p>“I always thought you were soft, Lexington.” Egg’s voice had gone cold and sharp, like a rapier. “Told Dumbledore it was a mistake hiring you. You’ve had your nose in books so long you’ve forgotten that those defenses you’re meant to be teaching aren’t just academic exercises.”</p><p>“Mordicus,” Slughorn started, “there’s no need to lay into the boy…”</p><p>“I’m no boy,” Lexington said. “And believe me, Mordicus, I’m well aware of the realities of the world. <em>I</em> haven’t been wasting my time researching bloody Muggles for the last 20 years.”</p><p>Mordicus lunged to his feet to stare down Lexington along the table, one arm reaching into his robes for a wand. Lexington had his out already, quivering in his left hand. Between them, Kettleburn ducked, reflexively protecting his remaining arm with his body. The witch next to Professor Sprout screamed. Madam Hooch sprang away from the two, picking up her stool and holding it warily as a shield while, beside her, O’Brien started to pull his hefty body up from the table as well.</p><p>Holy hell, this was getting good.</p><p>“What in heaven’s name are you all doing?!”</p><p>James was so startled he almost fell out from under the Invisibility Cloak. Professor McGonagall had pushed her way through the door to the staff room, slamming it against the stone wall with a bang. Lexington had dropped his wand at the sound and backed into a wall. Almost everyone in the room was standing now, or looked near to fainting. And Mordicus had his wand all the way out now, the dark wood leveled straight at Lexington’s throat. His hand wasn’t quivering a bit.</p><p>“Mordicus!” McGonagall shouted. “Put that wand away. There’s been enough bloodshed today, I think.”</p><p>James tried not to breathe. The room was absolutely silent now, as everyone looked to see what the professor was going to do.</p><p>Then Egg’s arm came down in a swift, graceful sweep, and Lexington was scuttling the other way, past Hooch and O’Brien, around the table, and — though he didn’t know it — straight for James.</p><p>James’s whole body broke out in a cold sweat as he watched his Defense Against the Dark Arts professor come running toward him. He couldn’t move. The room was too quiet. But he couldn’t stay. Lexington would run straight into him and then—</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going, Louis?” McGonagall said, and Lexington stopped on a sickle inches away from James. He could have reached out and pinched the man.</p><p>“I’m doing what all the rest of you should be doing,” Lexington said. He was half-turned away from James now, but the boy could see his cheeks were flushed with embarrassment. “I’m leaving. Leaving Hogwarts, leaving England. Going somewhere that isn’t getting ready to eat itself alive.”</p><p>“Coward,” Egg spat. He was glaring at Lexington across the table, and James could almost feel the rage boiling off of him. “People are out there dying, and you’re just going to run.”</p><p>“You’re damn right I’m going to run,” Lexington said back. “This is going to get worse before it gets better. The Ministry is doing nothing. There’s more Death Eaters every day. And now they’re going to start attacking us? We didn’t do anything to them.”</p><p>“Neither did any of the Muggles they’ve killed,” O’Brien said, moving away from the table and walking slowly toward Lexington. “Men, women, children — families who committed no crime except being born without our gifts. Gifts you’re squandering.”</p><p>The men were only a step away from each other now. But Lexington was too far along to shrink away from the Charms professor now. “If I stay here, in Britain, I might die with my gifts. I’d rather live with them somewhere else.”</p><p>“We’ve finally found somethin’ we can both agree on,” O’Brien said, his Brooklyn accent and rage blurring the words together. “I’d rather live with you somewhere else too. Minerva, out ‘a his way.”</p><p>McGonagall stepped aside without a word. Lexington left the same way, never looking back at the other professors.</p><p>“Bollocks,” Slughorn said, after the sound of his footsteps faded away. “Dumbledore’s going to be awfully sore to have to hire another Defense Against the Dark Arts professor so soon.”</p><p>“He’s used to it,” Egg said, arms crossed. He didn’t sit back down. “I think we all know who we have to blame for that.”</p><p>“Wait,” the witch beside Sprout said. “The jinx is real?”</p><p>“Catch up, Septima,” McGonagall said, crossing the room and taking Lexington’s old seat. Now that he was looking at her straight-on, James saw her eyes were puffy and red, and she looked more haggard than he could have ever imagined. “Merlin knows I’ve explained enough of that man’s actions today.”</p><p>“How is she doing?” Sprout asked, as O’Brien came back to the table. “Her whole family. I can only imagine.”</p><p>“Whatever you imagine, it’s worse,” McGonagall said, reaching a hand back and undoing something behind her head that caused the whole bun of hair to collapse, settling on her shoulders. “I finally had to bring her down to the hospital, have Poppy give her a Sleeping Draught. A nightmare to wake up to… but she’ll have soft, simple dreams for a few hours.”</p><p>“The whole school knows,” Kettleburn said. “Or near enough.”</p><p>“What are we doing about it?” Egg asked. “My contacts out in the Muggle Liaison Office are terrified. They think if the Death Eaters are going to start attacking wizarding families that oppose them — even purebloods — they won’t have a chance of drumming up sympathy. Half of them are thinking of doing the same thing as that insect Lexington — fleeing the country, heading for the Continent or some remote corner of the world.”</p><p>“I don’t want to talk about it anymore,” McGonagall said, a double-flick of her wand conjuring a cup and saucer and floating the kettle across the room to fill it with boiling water. “I just want to sit here, drink some tea, and complain about the new crop of first-years. You want to do something, Mordicus, go right ahead. But for now all I want to do is let everything be normal.”</p><p>“Alright,” Egg said, pocketing his wand and going around the table. “I need to get out of the castle anyway. Otherwise I’m going to do something terrible to Lexington before he turns in his resignation.”</p><p>James was going to have to trust his instincts more often. Just by coming down here, he’d found out more about the attack on the Queshires, seen two professors nearly duel, watched one of them effectively quit on the spot, and even gotten to see McGonagall literally take her hair down. It was the best afternoon of his life. He almost wished he could tell the others about it.</p><p>He was probably pushing his luck sticking around much longer. After Professor Egg left the room, he would probably follow behind and—</p><p>“Oh, and Mordicus,” McGonagall said, as he was nearly gone. “Shut the door on your way out, would you?”</p><p>Damn it all.</p><hr/><p>It was an hour before one of the other professors got up to leave — well, a professor who was skinny enough that James could slip past them without bumping into them. Bloody Slughorn.</p><p>By then, James’s feet were killing him, and his back too. He had been able to shift his weight here and there, and occasionally move around when the conversation level had reached a dull roar. But he didn’t dare sit down on the floor, not knowing when one of them would get up and try to step on him. For all the information he’d gotten, he was going to have to think twice about making another trip down to the staffroom.</p><p>On the other hand, it was hilarious to hear Slughorn’s impression of the first-year Slytherins trying feebly to come up with reasons why it was bad to poison people.</p><p>After escaping the staff room, he’d ditched the Invisibility Cloak in the boys’ lavatory down the hall, rolling it up and tying it like a belt around his waist. The band of silvery fabric looked ridiculous in the mirror, but if he kept his robes tight, it would just look like he’d had a huge dinner.</p><p>James decided to take the auxiliary stairs back up to the Gryffindor common room, so as to minimize the number of people he might bump into. And that’s how he stumbled onto Lily Evans, sobbing inconsolably.</p><p>He almost missed her, which was probably what she had been hoping for. He was on his way to the fourth floor stairs, walking past the balconies, and slowed down for a second to see if there were still storm clouds on the horizon — things had looked gloomy when he was on the Quidditch pitch with Sirius, but he’d been hoping the four of them could go out on the quad tomorrow if the weather held.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>And she was just there. She wasn’t facing him, and he could barely see much of her, the way she was curled away from him on a stone bench. But there was something about her hair or her figure that told James immediately that it was Lily Evans. Maybe it was the fact that she’d gone out of the dorm in her Muggle clothes — a white jumper, and pants in a near-glowing green. Maybe it was just the exact color of her red hair, or the way it was cut. But a second later, he picked the sound of her crying out of the ambient noise of the castle.</p><p>So then he was there too, awkwardly standing over her in the twilight, the sun behind the castle beginning to cast the whole balcony in shadows.</p><p>“Hey,” he said softly, and she reacted with her whole body, spinning around and flinching back.</p><p>“Dammit, James,” she gasped, looking up at him through tear-stained eyes. “I nearly jumped off the balcony just now.”</p><p>“Sorry,” he said, looking down at the ground. “Can I sit here, or…”</p><p>“No, no, that’s fine,” Lily said, wiping her face off with her sleeve. “Sit, sure.”</p><p>He tried to take up as little space as possible on the bench, so she could uncurl, but Lily just shifted a little so she could lean her head back on the parapet with her eyes closed. As if she was gathering the strength to talk to him.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she said finally. “I, uh… well, you must have heard about the Queshires by now, right? I feel like you always know all the Hogwarts gossip.”</p><p>“Uh, yeah,” James said. This was probably not the moment to try and show off by sharing what he’d learned in the staff room. “Yeah, Remus and Peter told me when I got back from Quidditch tryouts. I…I guess I didn’t realize you knew Julie?”</p><p>“I don’t,” Lily said, her voice sounding choked suddenly. “I mean, she seems nice. Her little origami trick is really cute. But I don’t like know her.”</p><p>“Oh. Then…”</p><p>Lily took a deep breath. “The town where her family lives. Lived. Oh, God.”</p><p>She was crying again then. This was the worst. Did girls always cry this much when sad things happened?</p><p>James inched a little closer, then gingerly reached out and patted her on the shoulder, feeling like an idiot. But it seemed to help. Lily began to catch her breath, and the sobs turned to slow sniffles.</p><p>“I’m from the same place,” she finally gasped, as if it hurt to say. “Cokeworth. I grew up there. Never knew there were any other wizard families until today. Except Severus’s family, of course.”</p><p>“So…you feel bad that you never knew the Queshires?” James asked.</p><p>“Well, yeah, I guess,” Lily said. “But I was… Nobody seemed to know whether it was just the Queshires, or if there were neighbors hurt too, or if there was more than one attack…”</p><p>James understood, all in an instant. “Your parents. You thought—”</p><p>“Yeah,” Lily said simply, to cut him off. “Trix came up to me in such a panic, ‘cause she knew, of course, where I was from. But she thought I already had heard, so she just asked right away if they were okay, and I didn’t even know what was happening.”</p><p>“<em>Are</em> they okay?” James asked, without thinking, and he watched her face crumple. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, of course, they’re Muggles, of course you don’t know—”</p><p>“No, I do actually.” Lily said, breaking into the first smile he’d seen from her yet. “Severus—well, I was beside myself when Trix told me, and I was halfway to the Owlery, and then I thought… When I went home for Easter holidays last year, Mary and I went to visit Trix, and we and her family went to Diagon Alley with this dust stuff.”</p><p>“Floo powder,” James interjected. “Except you can’t have gone and visited your parents, right? Because they’re not on the network.”</p><p>“That’s what Severus said, when I tracked him down. I was practically in hysterics — worse than this — but he sat me down and explained it all to me. That I couldn’t just pop into any fireplace, and that the fireplaces here were specifically set up so you couldn’t travel through them.”</p><p>“Then how—”</p><p>“He knew this other way. You could just talk through it. Sort of like a telephone.”</p><p>James gave her a blank look, but didn’t ask.</p><p>“So I begged him to call his mum. I couldn’t believe he wasn’t doing it himself, honestly. He already knew about the Queshires, and he didn’t know any more than me, but he wasn’t worried at all. It was weird, actually — but I didn’t care. I just wanted to make sure my parents and Tuney were okay.</p><p>“So he got some powder from the dungeons, and then we found an old sitting room on the ground floor that had a fireplace. And he called out his parents’ address, and his mum told us both that everyone by us was fine. The explosion was on the other side of town, and the only bodies they’d found were wizards, and she was sure my parents were totally fine because otherwise there’d be Obliviators wandering the streets.”</p><p>“Well, that’s good!” James said. “Why are you still making a face like it’s not good?”</p><p>“Because…” Lily put her head in her hands for a second, then pulled them across her face, fingers interlocking behind her head. “It <em>could </em>have been my family, James. I remember hearing about a Death Eater attack or two last year, and being a little scared. But then nothing else happened and I thought… well, there are bad Muggles too, you know? Why shouldn’t there be bad wizards too?</p><p>“It’s different now. There’s been at least one attack every week since the end of July. Did you know that? Mary told me, on the train. She said she was afraid to tell her parents, and I don’t blame her. I’m afraid to tell mine too.</p><p>“As soon as Severus put out the fire, I started crying. And he just didn’t get it. He didn’t understand, James. He told me my mum and dad and Petunia were fine, and no one we cared about was hurt, and it was silly to be upset. But the way I see it, it’s silly to <em>not </em>be upset, and pretend like they aren’t in danger. That we all aren’t in danger, everywhere except here at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Wow,” James said. “I—I hadn’t thought about that either, I guess.”</p><p>“I know,” Lily said, a touch of bitterness in her voice. “It’s the luxury of your wizard family, I guess. No one’s hunting you, yet. No one thinks you’re less than human, yet.”</p><p>“I don’t think you’re less than human,” he said, cutting her off. “I think you’re one of the most brilliant witches I know.”</p><p>Lily flushed bright red before James realized how much of a compliment he’d given her. “Um, thanks,” she whispered. “I guess I didn’t know you felt that way.”</p><p>“Well it’s not like we talk much,” James said. “You and Trix and Mary are always three peas in a pod, in class and up in the common room. And…well, you know Snape and I have a bit of a history.”</p><p>“I guess,” Lily said, rubbing the bottom edge of her jumper between her fingers. “I’m sorry. I’m not trying to be some stuck-up prat.”</p><p>“I didn’t say that,” James said. “We’re just…not really friends.”</p><p>“Well, you sat here and watched me cry and listened to my whole freakout,” she replied. “So maybe we’re not friends, James. But I guess we’re something like friends-adjacent.”</p><p>“I’ll take it.” James was practically beaming. This was the <em>best </em>day. “It’s always good to have a place to start. If I work hard, pretty soon I’ll be able to move up to ‘friend-when-all-your-other-friends-are-busy.’”</p><p>Lily giggled. “I’ll be looking forward to that, James. I really will.”</p><p>A moment later she was off, promising to give him advice on their Potions assignment later and headed to the girls’ dorm to give Beatrix and Mary an update on her family. James just sat there watching her go, cloak tight around his waist, feeling extremely, giddily visible.</p>
