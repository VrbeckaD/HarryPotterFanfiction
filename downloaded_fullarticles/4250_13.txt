<p> </p>
<p>Draco  Malfoy was no longer the fifteen-year-old arrogant prick who thought he owned the world. Nor was he the sixteen-year-old that was forced to commit the worst crime he could possibly imagine. He was not even the seventeen-year-old that was scarred, Marked, and pulled through the worst parts of a magical war by the Darkest Wizard ever known. Now he was a tormented young adult being forced to return to a school he could not stand; a place  he knew no one would want him to return to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When his mother had first taken ill, he had never once thought that her last request would be for him to go back to school; it had seemed so absurd. Why would a Malfoy ever think of going back to that Salazar forsaken castle?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the time since the end of the war, Draco's life had been turned completely upside down. Not that the time during the war had been any better for him considering his father’s trial and the subsequent Dementor’s Kiss. Harry Potter had spoken on behalf of his mother and himself, getting them pardoned from a lifetime in Azkaban,  but they were then kept under house arrest and had most of their possessions taken during a raid headed by Arthur Weasley.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Narcissa Malfoy had tried to be strong but, in the end,  the depression just overtook her and she started to refuse food altogether. No matter what Draco did, she sat in her rocker looking out onto the grounds of their vast estate and refused food. Even when he brought her tea and crumpets, she would just smile politely and leave them untouched.  He had begged and pleaded with her; all he got in return was her pleas  that he not give up on himself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Draco..." Her voice was so weak, and it was breaking his heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He knelt next to her and took her hand, looking at her through eyes that were meant for an older man. He felt so tired, and not just physically, but mentally as well. He wasn’t as dashing as he used to be,  he had lost a lot of weight,  and his skin had sunk in on his face. Perhaps he was giving up, too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"It hurts me to see you in so much pain, my son. I need you to know that life is not all bad, and that this will pass."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco felt as if she was mocking him. How could she say such a thing to him when she too ill to be here to guide him?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Why are you leaving me?" his voice quivered like a child’s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Narcissa raised his hand to her chapped lips and kissed it tenderly  before gazing into his grey, stormy eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"My son, I love you with all my heart; but I can no longer cope with this life. I cannot stand to be without your father, and he is no longer here with us. He never will be." She took a long slow breath. "And I worry about you. You don’t eat. You don’t sleep. You do nothing with your life, and it breaks my heart. The war is over. You have your whole life ahead of you.” She grasped his hand tighter.  “I need you to promise me, Draco; promise me that you will try. For me. Go back to Hogwarts. Find a girl you love and settle down. Have children, be there for them like I wish we had been for you. Promise me, Draco. You must!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her insistence was adamant. He felt five years old as the tears streamed down his face. He didn't know what else to do, or what more he could say to keep her here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Alright, Mother. I promise…"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She gave him a faint smile, and turned over to go to sleep. She was drained from not eating and pushing herself to convince her son that he was worth more to her than he would ever know.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Narcissa died the next day. Draco’s first reaction was anger - anger at himself for causing her death. He was distraught that he was all alone in a big manor that felt emptier than his heart did. The only thing that kept him going was his promise to his mother.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Beginning the next day, he started to act on his promise; sending a letter to Professor McGonagall asking to return with the other seventh years that didn’t complete the last year. Then he started going out to buy his robes and gather up his school supplies. He did his best to stay busy until September when he would return to that old haunting castle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>oOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A month had gone by since his mother had passed beyond the Veil , and Draco's best mate had made it his mission to get Draco back in the swing of things by inviting him to a dinner he was hosting for the Slytherins who were returning for their final year. Draco had agreed but only because Blaise Zabini was annoyingly persistent. The pompous git.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As the blond  approached Zabini’s home he felt nervous;  he wasn’t the best company now. He stood back from the door after knocking, a rather large bottle of the best Firewhiskey Galleons could buy firmly gripped in his hand. Almost two minutes passed with no one coming to greet him and he  was just about to walk away when the door was flung open.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Draco! It’s good to see you, mate!" His friend’s Italian accent enunciated his name, as he held out his hand to the pale man in front of him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco reached out with his free hand, his serpent ring gleaming in the shine of the porch light. He gripped his Blaise’s hand warmly; almost thankfully.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Thanks for having me, Blaise."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Making their way through a large well-lit hallway , they entered a cozy lounge area. An array of large plushy chairs was spread out across the room, carefully placed on top of a beautiful Persian rug. In the middle of the far wall there was a large fire currently blazing in a giant rock fireplace. Old paintings moved and shimmered around on the walls. The general colour scheme of the room was pale blue with beige furniture, making the visitors feel as if they were up in the clouds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco looked around the room and nodded to the others. Pansy, Theo, and the Greengrass sisters made up the group. He was relieved that Blaise had kept the gathering small; he had become prone to bouts of anxiety in crowds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Ladies, Gents, I give you the elusive Draco Malfoy. I caught him streaking through the forest and, since I was able to catch him, he must give me all his gold." Zabini chuckled, as he clapped a tan hand on the Malfoy heir’s shoulder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I believe you have me crossed with a Leprechaun," Draco informed him, rolling his eyes, although he couldn’t help the small smile that danced across his lips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Okay, so he doesn't bring gold, but he does bring us all a strong drink! Personally, I think that we all need a little loosening up before we go back to school."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The group all grumbled together, but Zabini was not going to have them in bad spirits while they were in his home. He clapped his hands together enthusiastically, and motioned to the adjoining room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Let's go to the dining room and eat. The House Elves have really outdone themselves."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The group followed Blaise into the dining room which was laid out with all the best foods - fillet steak, mashed potatoes, Shepherd’s Pie, green vegetables, salad - typical pure-blood cuisine. Draco glanced around before taking his seat; the last time they had all been together he was not in the best of moods. To be fair, it had been Narcissa’s funeral and they were all very understanding but he really didn’t want to be a buzzkill tonight.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While everyone filled their plates, he placed the large bottle of liquor on the table. There was wine already available; but he needed something stronger, smiling at Pansy as he poured himself a glass over ice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Anyone else wanna partake?" He waved the bottle in front of the others. Blaise reached for it immediately, pouring a measure for himself before Astoria intercepted and served herself a very healthy dose. He was surprised that his stomach flipped when she made a shy face at him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They made small talk throughout the dinner and, by the time they were done, Draco had drunk three glasses of the firewhiskey. He felt warm and light; it was nice to laugh and feel loved again. He found himself grinning at everyone and joining in with some teasing. By now they were in the parlor, enjoying some dessert by the fire.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Pansy, if you weren’t so da mn fickle, you might actually keep a boyfriend.” Draco pointed out after the topic of her latest boyfriend came up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Uh,” she huffed as she flipped her long black hair over her shoulder, “He just wanted to be with me for my money. Joffrey wasn’t even that good looking.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Daphne and Astoria cooed and agreed with her, in good girl squad fashion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Keep this up, and you will never find a husband,” Theo smirked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That’s why I keep you around, Theo, dear. You know you promised to make an honest woman out of me, if we aren’t married by forty.” She simpered at him, fluttering her eyelashes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Maybe you’ll get to have as many weddings as Blaise’s mum. She just loves all of her new marriages.” Theo shot back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Oi, speaking of marriages and my mum-" Blaise started, clearing trying to change the subject.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"She isn't getting divorced again, is she?" Pansy sighed dramatically.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"No, she isn't!" Blaise glared at her. "My mum's new husband, Frank-er-Henry - whatever his name is - works at the Ministry and, apparently, they have just put the finishing touches to a new law.” He paused, taking a bite of the chocolate cake that was being served for dessert. The Italian enjoyed his dramatics, and tormenting his friends. “They are going to make everyone between the ages of 17 and 24 get married and start producing children within the next three years."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco's mouth fell open in disbelief as his friend continued with his story.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"They are going to pick our matches for us, using a bonding charm that can seek out who is most compatible with you.” He gave them a sly wink.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What if you are currently with someone?” Daphne asked, keeping her eyes down.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Didn’t know you were with someone, Daph.” Draco said, as he raised a curious eyebrow. She had never been the dating kind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her face went bright red, as she shook her head, letting her hair fall forward to hide her flushed cheeks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m not, I just was wondering about others who have started to settle down,” she muttered, taking a long drink from her wine glass. She didn’t comment further on her curiosity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“They are making a few exceptions for those already in long term relationships,” Blaise spoke up, “however, Frank and or Henry said that, if the bonding charm reveals that you are not long term compatible, then it will choose someone else."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The group grew hushed and frowned; each one was deep in thought. Pansy bit her lip, and began to tap her fingers on the table- a nervous tic that she picked up during exams. Daphne shook her head again, causing her strawberry blonde curls to spill forward into her face. She didn’t seem distraught at the thought of getting married; in fact, she had a small gleam in her eyes. Her little sister, on the other hand, was keeping her eyes on Draco. She hadn’t said much during dinner but what she did say was mostly directed at him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Theo and Blaise didn't seem to mind that they would be married off, and Draco knew why. They were both players with no plans to settle down unless told otherwise. Theo's dad was with Draco's in Azkaban, but he was spared the Dementor’s Kiss. Theo had been enjoying his new freedom where he didn't answer to anyone and, since Blaise had never had a true father figure, he had planned to have a wizard world record for most hook-ups. Blaise had never really cared for any one girl; they just came and went. Draco was intrigued to find out how Blaise would cope with a wife.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The blond Slytherin felt his heart sink. It was bad enough that he was going down with the Malfoy name but to ask some innocent girl to go down with him was an idea that was starting to take over his mind. It made his sick to his stomach.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"When are they going to put this into effect?" Daphne finally asked,  as the silence had grown suffocating enough to choke them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco looked over at her, while waiting for the answer. Daphne was a pretty girl; she had an oval face, with light blue eyes. Draco would not be disappointed if he was to be wed to her. Daphne Greengrass was pretty, very pretty he thought. Her peachy skin complemented her long wavy hair; her eyes were, by far, her best feature - large and expressive - and her womanly figure attracted many stares whenever she transversed a room. Yes, Draco considered, marrying Daphne would not be a disappointment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Astoria moved forward, taking a seat on the arm of the chair Draco was sitting in. She gave him a sweet smile and he found himself observing the differences between her and her sister; Astoria’s hair was a dark brown, with red undertones. It seems that they had some Irish in them with the red tints of their hair. She had a small plump nose and her face was more square-shaped compared to her sister’s round face. Her eyes were the same light blue as her sister, and it seemed that  was the only feature they shared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco had gone to school with Daphne his whole life, and he had known who Astoria was because of the parties hosted between the families. He had never thought too much about her, but now it was obvious Astoria had a crush on him. That wouldn't be the worst thing ever, except that Draco didn't feel as if he deserved to be happy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Well at least 'Stori will get a chance at real love," Daphne mumbled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Pansy asked, as her pug nose tilted back and she finished her glass of wine. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pansy had not changed over the years, except for her figure to look womanly. She was still short and not very pretty; her face still had the squashed quality to it. But she had the curves that boys wanted, and she was always good for a joke and laugh.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"She isn't seventeen. She just barely turned fifteen a few months ago so this law won't apply to her."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco watched as Astoria seemed to understand what her sister was saying, and a small pout crept across her face as she watched Draco with sad eyes. A part of him was relieved, the other upset. He was afraid to know who would be deemed his match, and find out how much they probably hate him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, as bonding charms go, it could be anyone. Drake might even get with his schoolboy crush.” Blaise winked at him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It was not a crush!” Draco insisted,  as his face went from pale to bright red.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“’Oh, that Granger, I could teach her a thing or two. She only thinks she knows-it-all.’” Theo jumped in. “I believe that’s how it went.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“She doesn’t know it all,” Draco claimed as his defense. <em>Pathetic Draco</em> , he berated himself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The girls giggled in a group and he found his flush fading away. He rolled his eyes deciding to play their little game.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And I’m sure the little flame you carried for the She-Weasel is gone, Blaise.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh, from what I can tell, it’s become a full-blown torch. He’s been trying to keep up with her Quidditch offers for after school.” Theo tossed out, adding to the now growing jab at their friend.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“There is nothing wrong with knowing a good bet. She is gonna make me tons of gold soon.” Blaise explained, but Draco noticed his face was tinted red.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco laughed but decided to end his friend’s misery and head back to his empty home. He stood roughly and looked at his fellow Slytherins, walking over to Blaise and Theo and shaking their hands. He then turned to the girls and gave them all a hug. He even gave Astoria a small kiss on the cheek.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I really must be going. I have so much to sort out before September. I’m thinking of selling the Manor, and getting a small flat in London."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The group nodded in understanding, standing up with him. Blaise put an arm around Draco’s shoulder as he escorted him to the door.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Don't be a stranger, Draco. It’s not good for you to be alone all the time. But if we don't see you, we’ll meet you on the Hogwarts Express."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco took in his handsome best mate;  his dark skin and pleasant face. He was an attractive man and there was no doubt in Draco's mind that whoever was paired with Blaise Zabini would be happy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Thank you again for inviting me. I really needed this push to get prepared for what’s to come at Hogwarts. And thanks for the heads up that we will all be married soon. Something else to look forward too," Draco added, smirking as he shook Blaise’s hand again before Apparating home.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once he arrived, the Malfoy heir made his way to his room and stripped down to nothing but his silver silk boxers. After taking a light Sleeping Draught, he climbed up into his big empty bed and allowed himself to slip away; dreaming of himself being happy with a small family by his side. He smiled in his sleep at the thought of little brunette children with wild curly hair.</p>
