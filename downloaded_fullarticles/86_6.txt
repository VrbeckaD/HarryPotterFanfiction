    <p>Andromeda was in a sour mood. They were assigned pairs for the most recent Ancient Runes Assignment and she found herself stuck with some Hufflepuff who most likely wouldn’t be able to hold his own. Andromeda despised group projects, much preferring to work alone. It was the only way she could trust the work she handed in. Last year she was able to work on her own most of the time, occasionally paired with a Ravenclaw or Slytherin student. Fortunately, they were able to keep up. That was all Andromeda required - an even match and little to no conversation. Hopefully, they were able to finish the project quickly so she could work on something more pressing, like the Defense essay she had barely started. </p><p>As she walked into the classroom, she spotted the boy right away. He was early -- that was a good sign. “I’m Andromeda,” she gave a curt nod as she introduced herself and sat down across from him. “You’re Edward, right?”</p><p>“Ted, please,” he replied, nodding politely. He was hesitant about this partnership; he’d managed most of his time at Hogwarts away from the teasing and jeers that were hurled at Muggleborn witches and wizards, and he knew the Blacks by reputation, so he wanted to tread carefully in the presence of one. </p><p>“Ted, then. We should get started.” </p><p>“Happy to,” he obliged, hoisting his bag into a desk and pulling out their textbook, two additional books he’d checked out of the library, a few rolls of parchment, and a sleeve of biscuits, all of which he lined up neatly on the desk. </p><p>She watched him set up, an eyebrow raised. She didn’t anticipate he would be prepared. Maybe this wouldn’t be as painful as she expected. She busied herself with making a schedule for both of them to make sure they were able to complete the project before the due date. “Do you have any obligations I need to account for? Quidditch practice? Prefect’s duty?” She knew nothing about him that would help her plan. </p><p>“No and no,” he replied, “I’m a reasonably boring bloke, actually,” he refrained from adding not like you, but certainly entertained the thought. </p><p>“Good to know.”</p><p>Now that they were in such close proximity he was able to take in just how lovely she was, and the recognition only added to his anxiety. “What about you?” he asked, “any responsibilities or obligations?” </p><p>“I don’t have anything that will interfere.” She made a few finishing touches to the schedule and slid it to him for approval. “Does that work for you? I’d like to complete this before the due date so we don’t have to worry.” </p><p>He leaned in, trying not to get too close, “looks good to me— wait, just this date,” he pointed, “it’s umm— me mum’s birthday, I’ll be heading back to Surrey that weekend.” He swallowed at having to mention his Muggle parents, then quickly recovered with, “the rest looks great.” </p><p>She noticed the way his voice wavered. It didn’t occur to her that he would be nervous, but she supposed that most people were wary of Slytherins these days. Hopefully, it wouldn’t deter him from being productive. “That’s fine,” she said, pressing her lips together in concentration as she tried to figure out an alternative date. “We can move it to the day you come back.”</p><p>“Perfect,” He said, relaxing just a bit. </p><p>She pulled out Spellman's Syllabary and flipped it to the chapter on the runic alphabet. They were meant to write an essay on how runes were used on powerful magical objects. “We can start by translating the runes from a Pensieve,” she suggested, opening Magical Hieroglyphs and Logograms to a picture of the object. “These look Saxon.” </p><p>“I’m a bit better at the Nordic than the Saxon,” he mused, “but I do know the wood species symbols well.” </p><p>“The Saxon runes aren’t so bad once you get a hang of them,” she mused, half to herself, “it’s just a different pattern than Nordic runes, but a pattern nonetheless.” She gave him a questioning look when she saw him smirk, but didn’t pause long enough to elicit an explanation. After a few minutes of working in silence, she pointed out a line of translation she had written on her parchment. “See? The inscription isn’t complex. Saxon runes were originally used by wizards in the Netherlands and were passed down to the muggle Anglo-Saxons in Great Britain, so there isn’t a large difference between their runes and Old English.” She wasn’t sure how muggle schooling worked, but she assumed he had some sort of formal education before Hogwarts, so this information wasn’t foreign to him. </p><p>Ted leaned over to look at the translation. “I think that’s where I start to get confused, is in the overlaps, but I’m a quick study, not totally useless, just partially.” He looked at her and tested out a smile. “I also don’t mind applying the theory once the translation is done, if you want to split some of the work that way.” He shrugged, then reached to open his sleeve of biscuits, pausing to offer her one. </p><p>“It helps if you know Latin,” she said simply.</p><p>“Carpe tuberum?” He asked playfully.</p><p>Andromeda snorted despite herself. “Not quite relevant, but it’s a start.” She paused before accepting the biscuit and thanked him with a nod. He seemed nice enough and was willing to pull his weight, which was an improvement over some of her past partners. She handed him her piece of parchment. “Why don’t you work on the theory behind this phrasing and I’ll continue translating.” It wasn’t much of a question as it was a suggestion. Another fifteen minutes passed and she handed him a second piece of parchment.</p><p>Ted turned from her to hide the grin that touched his face when she made the noise. He took the parchment from her and sat quietly taking notes, occasionally moving to look at the image in the textbook. He’d just about finished the first passage when she handed him the second, and he took it wordlessly and switched to that bit when he completed the one before it. “It’s interesting that so much of the Pensieve’s efficacy is reliant on the wizard. That doesn’t seem to be the case with some other magical devices.” </p><p>“I suppose, but wands are essentially the same way. Most of the magic you produce every day is reliant on your skill and confidence, and magical devices respond differently to each witch or wizard.”</p><p>“Yes, but theoretically any magical being could use any Pensieve successfully, that’s not always the case with wands, and if you look at the connection between the ‘memory’ rune and the vessel itself, it’s not the actual bowl that makes the magic possible.” </p><p>She looked up from her third round of translations, surprised. It wasn’t that she expected him to be unintelligent, but she generally assumed a negative before proof of a positive. “You’re right. I’ve never thought about it before.” Her eyes searched his face, not entirely sure what she expected to see. “Sometimes another perspective can be refreshing.” </p><p>Ted offered her a small smile and a shrug before saying “just a thought,” and returning to his work. Black reputation aside, she didn’t seem as frightening as people made them out to be. He got through the second parchment faster than the first, having made some easy connections between the lines of text on them, and he sat and watched her as she finished, brows furrowed. </p><p>“You’ve finished already?” She looked up and passed him another translation. “For someone who was quite self-deprecating one hour ago, you seem to be doing fine.” She double-checked the schedule she made at the beginning of the session, checking a few items off their list. “We might actually accomplish more than we planned if we continue at this pace.” </p><p>“Told you I’m a quick study,” he said, handing over his notes for her review. “We Puffs are not as blundering as everyone seems to think.” He took the newest sheet from her and went back to work. </p><p>“Honestly, I wouldn’t know. I don’t think I’ve ever had a conversation with a Hufflepuff before. Students from your house don’t exactly jump at the chance to approach me.” </p><p>Ted couldn’t help but chuckle. “Your house also carries its reputation.”</p><p>She watched him carefully. Now her interest was piqued. “Oh? If you indulge me, perhaps I’ll tell you what’s true and what’s a myth.” </p><p>“You haven’t heard?” He said playfully, “All Slytherins are blindlessly driven Pureblood zealots.” </p><p>“That’s only half true. Some of us can see quite well.” She sat back to gauge his reaction, genuinely curious to see how far she could take this before the conversation left her without a partner. </p><p>“That’s fortunate,” he said, trying to hide a smile, “I was thinking of taking up a donation collection of spectacles for you all.” He paused, “all of that Hufflepuff good-will showing through, yeah?”</p><p>“So we can best see our path to zealotry? How kind of you.” She absentmindedly twirled a stray curl around her finger. “And then we can return to our lives of sadistic debauchery in the dungeons. Have you ever stopped to think why no one from other houses has ever stepped foot in our Common Room, Ted?” </p><p>“Because of all of the debauching?” He suggested. </p><p>She tilted her head to the side. “You think I’m joking, don’t you?” There was probably more truth to her statements than she cared to admit. </p><p>“Well, now you’ve got me nervous,” he replied, not entirely joking. “Despite what anyone might say about your house and family, you don’t seem all that bad to me, Andy.” He offered a smile. </p><p>She was never Andy, always Andromeda. The word sounded foreign, especially coming from him. “And that’s why you’re a Hufflepuff. You trust too easily. After a few hours of schoolwork, you feel so safe and familiar that you’ve given me a nickname?” </p><p>“Why not?” He asked, “I see no reason not to go in and expect the best of someone. Think about it—“ he paused, “if I’d come in here with all of the preconceived notions about you based on your house and what I’ve heard of your eldest sister, I’d have already decided I didn’t like you, and missed the chance to realize that I do.” He shrugged. “And I like the nickname. It suits you.”</p><p>“It does not.” She scolded herself for sounding like she was going toe to toe with Narcissa. This conversation was too much to process without sounding like a defiant child, and it was getting more personal than she had anticipated. “Let’s just go back to work,” she resigned, “and maybe we can get ahead like we discussed earlier.” </p><p>“As you wish,” he replied with another smile, returning to his notes.</p>
