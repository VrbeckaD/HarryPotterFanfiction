          <div class="userstuff"><p>
  <span>There are things we do that no-one understands. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Like the feel of her skin against my strong hands.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And the weight of his body pressed against mine.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Knowing nothing matters, when all we have is time. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>In our room, there is just us, a tiny home of three.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But even so, there are things she does just for me.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sexy things she knows I like, and tender things too, </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>All the things we wanted from life, but were too afraid to do.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>But it’s not only me she cares for, because there’s another.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>A man we both adore, and I don’t mean like a brother.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He’s our cold aloof Slytherin who pretends he doesn’t care,</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But melts like ice when we run fingers through his hair.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Our odd relationship of three, make most people dumb-struck </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But I love my two so much, and so hard, that I couldn’t give a fuck.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Besides, I’m used to the stares, the glares, and the looks,</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In fact, I’ve signed “with love, from all of us” in many of their books.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I love when it’s the three of us, all tangled in our bed,</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When she sits on my face, and he’s giving me head,</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And the world just melts away when we take her together,</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I love that she tastes like cinnamon, and he smells like leather.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>I quake, and sob into her fire-red hair, as I find my release, </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Her body convulses around us, as she too feels some peace.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Finally, my other love, whose thickness pulses in beats so heavy,</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Whispers words of precious love, collapsing between us all sweaty.</span>
