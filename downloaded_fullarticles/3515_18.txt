    <p>“You have to promise not to tell mother, okay?”</p><p>Loki’s eyes went wide and he nodded quickly; he would have sworn to secrecy if he had to, and he suddenly felt that it might <em>be</em> that serious, especially if the look that Thor was giving him was any indication. “I promise I won’t tell.”</p><p>“We aren’t allowed to do magic outside of school,” Thor’s voice dropped down to a whisper as he reached into his jacket and pulled out his wand, as well as two small vials of a murky purple liquid, “but I got these from Heimdall.” He held up the two vials and Loki gasped as he noticed that the liquid <em>wasn’t</em> murky, but instead made up of what looked like violently swirling purple and black clouds – a storm in its prime. “He said that it would get rid of the Trace for an hour.”</p><p>The two brothers sat facing each other, their bodies obscured from view by stretches of overgrown grass. The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky and bathed everything in golden light, unaware of the mischief that was about to take place, painting them the picture of innocence; Loki was thrilled.</p><p>He didn’t know who Heimdall was, nor did he fully understand what <em>the Trace </em>was, having only heard his mother threatening him and Thor with it when they misbehaved, but if being without it meant that they could perform magic without getting into trouble then he would’ve liked to be rid of it sooner rather than later. He wasn’t old enough to really <em>do </em>anything – he didn’t even have his wand yet – but Thor always excited him with tales of Hogwarts, telling him about charms and potions and creatures, and Loki found himself counting down the days until it was time for him to go to school. Now, being faced with the thought of seeing <em>actual magic</em>, he was almost ready to force the potion down Thor’s throat.</p><p>“Are you going to drink it?”</p><p>Thor grinned and opened one of the vials, downing its contents without hesitation. He held the other vial out to Loki; “You have the Trace, too.”</p><p>Loki took the vial and watched the swirling clouds for a moment, “what if it doesn’t work?”</p><p>“Then we should expect a letter from the Ministry very soon.”</p><p>The threat had no weight – Loki had the vial open before Thor had even finished his sentence. The liquid was thick and cloyingly sweet as it slid down his throat. Loki pulled a face.</p><p>“I don’t feel any different.”</p><p>“You shouldn’t,” Thor reassured him. Loki watched his brother expectantly. Thor lifted his wand a little higher and pointed it at Loki, reciting a charm before Loki could protest against it, and Loki looked down in time to see the blue of his shirt turn to a deep emerald green.</p><p>Thor’s mouth cracked into a grin, “Can you imagine father’s face if you came home in Slytherin’s house colours?”</p><p>Loki frowned; his father had told him enough about Slytherin for him to know it was <em>bad</em>. Bad people came from Slytherin: people who cared only for themselves and people who stepped on others just to get what they wanted.</p><p>Loki didn’t want to be in Slytherin.</p><p>“I want to be in Gryffindor.”</p><p>Everyone in their family had been in Gryffindor.</p><p>Thor said the charm again and Loki watched as emerald faded into a warm sunset; red and gold, Gryffindor’s house colours.</p><p>“The other houses are good, too.” Thor had friends from all of the houses, and he’d found them all admirable: Ravenclaws were hard-workers, and he’d often found it best to talk to them when he had a problem; Hufflepuffs were friendly and caring and easy to be around; Slytherins were smart and determined. He had yet to meet a “bad” Slytherin, despite all his father’s warnings.</p><p>But Loki had already made up his mind. He shook his head, “I want to be in Gryffindor.”</p><p>Thor shrugged, “Well, you still have some time before you have to worry about that.” He didn’t give Loki time to answer, already reciting another spell that had water spraying out of his wand that made Loki burst into a fit of giggles.</p><p>They continued going over spells and charms until the hour was up, with Thor getting the spells wrong more often than not and making Loki laugh at the result. Neither of them spoke of it once they got home. Thor grinned at Loki over the breakfast table the following morning when no letters from the Ministry of Magic arrived.</p><p>Loki was more excited for Hogwarts than ever.</p>
