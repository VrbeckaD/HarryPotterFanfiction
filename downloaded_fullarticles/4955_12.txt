          <div class="userstuff"><p>1. Regulus was never lonely until six days before his death. He always had either Sirius or Snape up until that point. </p><p>2. Actually, he always had Kreacher.</p><p>3.  The Sorting Hat asked him if he'd rather be with his brother. Given the choice, he said no. It took him almost a minute to decide. </p><p>4. He became the youngest Seeker ever to play for Slytherin nineteen years before Harry became the youngest seeker ever.</p><p>5. He was twelve and had only just figured out that Sirius was telling people James Potter was his only brother.</p><p>6. He should have been happy but could only feel numb and hurt inside. </p><p>7.  He beat James Potter to the Snitch in their first match and felt better than he had since he was sorted Slytherin.</p><p>8. He and Sirius had a silent, curious fight as a result. Regulus would always make an extra effort when Slytherin played Gryffindor.</p><p>9. Second and third years were a blur of tight smiles, awkward holiday dinners, and Quidditch matches. </p><p>10. By the time Slytherin won the house cup in his third year,  Regulus and Sirius weren't speaking.</p><p>11. In Regulus' fourth year he watched his best friend destroy his life, and he started hating Lily Evans and James Potter.</p><p>12. His feelings towards his brother were much more complicated.</p><p>13. Regulus didn't start ignoring Sirius again until after he had taken the Mark and Sirius had run away.  </p><p>14. Fifth year was a blur of pretending he didn't have a brother and that everything was fine.</p><p>15. He learned what Horcruxes were from Slughorn at a Christmas party his sixth year.</p><p>16. When he finished seventh year, his parents and Sirius both came to his Graduation and clapped.</p><p>17. Regulus was given his first assignment a week later, but he also heard that Lily and James were getting married.</p><p>18. They found out he was a Death Eater when he was part of the raid on the Prewetts' place.</p><p>19. He figured out where the locket was before Graduation and almost told Sirius, but his parents were right there.</p><p>20. Regulus left a message for Sirius with Kreacher, but Kreacher never passed it on because he didn't think Sirius was worth it.</p></div>
