    <p>Let me tell you a tale. It's the story of a boy who only dreamed of living a quiet and happy life but, due to circumstance and fate, had to embark in an adventure and become a hero. After all, what did he expect to happen when he was living in a fairy tale?</p><p>Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a very distant land which may or may not have existed. It was a place where everything was possible and magic was just another force of nature. People lived peacefully, never reacting with shock if they saw a witch flying on a broom or if a mysterious man offered them a handful of beans in exchange for their cow.</p><p>Our tale begins on a sunny summer afternoon in the garden of a small cottage, with our protagonist hanging the laundry out to dry. Harry Potter was a very thin boy, and too short for his age. He had messy black hair and his green eyes were hidden behind old, ugly glasses. The cottage belonged to his aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, with whom Harry had lived since his parents' death. Aunt Petunia liked to brag about how Harry's parents had been murdered by a dark wizard who wanted to get rid of them because of a prophecy, but Harry suspected that was just an invention from Petunia that she used to impress her friends. In any case, the boy was an orphan and there was nobody else who could take care of him, so his aunt, uncle, and cousin all took advantage of the situation and treated him like a servant. His cousin Dudley even went as far as to call him by the incredibly unoriginal name of Cinderharry.</p><p>Fortunately Harry wasn't entirely alone, since his best friend Sirius went everywhere with him. Sirius was a big black dog that was, at the moment, sleeping by the door. He didn't react at all when a hooded figure exited the forest and approached the cottage. Upon arriving to the fence, the suspicious figure stopped and called out:</p><p>"Hey, boy! You didn't happen to see a gorgeous brunet who looks like he's running from an assassin, did you?"</p><p>"Nope. I'm sorry that I can't be of more h-- Wait! Are you the assassin he's running from?"</p><p>"I... ah..." the man, because the figure had a man's voice, began twisting his hands nervously. "I... No! Of course not! I'm not an assassin! The truth is that I... uh... I'm trying to find him to give him these invitations for the royal ball! Yeah, that's it."</p><p>Harry studied the hooded man, who now held some papers in his hand and trembled subtly.</p><p>"Suuuure... Sirius, attack!"</p><p>The black dog tackled the man and started growling with his muzzle right by the man's face.</p><p>"Good doggie," whimpered the assassin. "Don't bite me, there's a good boy. Don't bite old Wormtail... I knew this job wasn't right for me!"</p><p>"Why do you want to kill that guy?"</p><p>"It's not that I want to kill him, it's the boss who wants him dead. I work as an assassin for Lord Voldemort, the king of the neighbouring country."</p><p>"And why does Voldemort want him dead?"</p><p>"Well... It's a long story. When Lord Voldemort killed our king and took over the throne, he married a powerful dark witch to help him control us. The problem is that they had a falling out and she turned him into a half snake half human monster before leaving. Now he has no power to control us, but he's so pitiful that we just play along with his fantasies. I'm in charge of enforcing the 'Evil Queen Law', a fairly standard law which says that everyone who's prettier than Lord Voldemort should be executed. That's the reason I was chasing that boy, but I lost him after he crossed the border."</p><p>"Well, if he crossed the border doesn't that mean your kingdom's laws don't apply anymore to him?" asked Harry, feeling slightly sympathetic towards the obviously useless assassin.</p><p>"I wish! Figuring something like this might happen, Lord Voldemort added the 'Heart Clause' to the law. If I don't bring the boy's heart back with me they won't let me back into my country!"</p><p>"Mm... I know! Why don't you do that thing from the papers?" when he realized that Wormtail didn't know what he was talking about, Harry explained: "Yeah, you know, the Snow White thing! Her would-be assassin hunted down a wild boar and gave its heart to his queen telling her it was Snow White's. If it wasn't for her magic mirror she wouldn't have known the difference."</p><p>"That could work! Voldemort doesn't have any magic mirrors!" the now cheered up assassin stretched the hand holding the papers towards Harry. "Here, as a thank you for your help I'll give you these tickets for the royal ball. Some weird old man gave them to me in the forest but I don't need them."</p><p>Harry watched Wormtail walk into the forest until he couldn't see him anymore, and then looked down towards the papers in his hand. There were four of them, and each one had a different name written on it: Vernon, Petunia, Dudley, and Harry.</p><p>"So weird! It's like somebody invited us to the royal ball."</p>

</center>In a forest clearing a gorgeous brunet who looks like he's running from an assassin knocked on the door of a crooked wooden house.<p>"Hello? Is anyone there?"</p><p>A sign affixed to the front of the house announced to anyone who could read that the name of the place was 'The Burrow'. A handwritten addition a little bit lower added: 'We're at work'.</p><p>Starving and exhausted, 'Gorgeous brunet who looks like he's running from an assassin' entered the house and hoped with all his might that the owners would be understanding and forgive his breaking and entering. He could always try to use his tragic story to soften their hearts, although that strategy could backfire and they could decide to deliver him to Lord Voldemort for a bounty. And, with the way the house looked, they definitely could do with a bounty.</p><p><i>Well, I'll worry about it when the moment comes.</i> He thought, mentally shrugging as he made himself a sandwich.</p>

</center>In another forest clearing, inside the highest room of a large stone tower, a princess named Pansy slept the years away as she waited to be rescued by her prince charming. Nobody knew the reason why she had been cursed or even who had done it. The only thing anybody knew for sure was that a ferocious dragon guarded her zealously, which explained why nobody had tried to rescue her yet.<center>

</center>In another forest clearing, in a cheerful little cottage, an old lady was writing a letter to her daughter, telling her that she was ill and thus couldn't go to the market to buy supplies.<p>
  <i>'... so I was wondering if you could send my much beloved granddaughter Hermione with some food for me. It's been so long since I last saw her! By the way, tell her to wear that lovely red hood I sent her for Christmas, would you? You know it's a family heirloom. And remind her to wear sturdy boots in case it rains, and to follow the path without taking any shortcuts. Do also make sure she brings some of that lovely bread with walnuts and raisins that I enjoyed so much last time. And please tell her to study hard, and to wash her teeth thoroughly, and to not start fights, and to listen to her teachers, and to avoid talking to strangers, and...'</i>
</p><p>That's to say, the typical letter from a grandmother.</p>

</center>In another forest clea-- sorry, my bad. At the royal palace:<p>"But Mother, I don't want to go!"</p><p>"Stop complaining, Draco. Saturday's ball is one of the most important events of the year and you must attend it."</p><p>"Your mother is right, Draco. Your duty as the prince and only heir to the Crown is to find a bride and produce offspring."</p><p>"But I'm gay! G-A-Y! I like boys, darn it!"</p><p>"What does that have to do with anything? You don't think I actually like your mother, do you?"</p><p>"Your father is right. The most important thing is to find you a good queen and produce an heir; afterwards you can always live separate lives. And if you like men... then you can get yourself a 'personal assistant' or a 'royal advisor' like your father."</p><p>"Mother! You can't mean that Father and Severus...! And you don't care?"</p><p>"Well, it's not as if she doesn't have her own 'private seer', is it?"</p><p>"Sybill?!"</p><p>"You have to admit it makes more sense that thinking we hired her for her 'gifted Sight'."</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>-_-_-</p>
</center>In the middle of the forest, but this time not on a clearing, Wormtail the assassin was thinking: <i>I never knew that hunting a wild boar could be so difficult. I wonder if my lord would notice the difference if I bring him the heart of that dead pigeon over there.</i>
