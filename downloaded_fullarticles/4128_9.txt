    <p>It had been a year since they had fought the Dark Lord’s daughter.</p>
<p>A year since the Malfoys became partners with the Potters.</p>
<p>A year since they thought they were all safe…</p>

<p> </p>
<p>I run down the stairs into the Slytherin common room, my robes brushing against my fast legs. I immediately spot Albus, slouched on the sofa reading his book, stopping abruptly in front of him. “You would never believe who just asked me to the ball-thingy?” I say, excitement filling my body.</p>
<p>Albus, his hair brushing the top of his eyes blurring his view, looks up. He winces, the dim glow of the candle lighting up his face. “Let me guess, my number one cousin?” He says, a hint of sarcasm dripping off his tongue. I jump onto the sofa beside him, my shoulder pressed firmly against his. I lean my head on his shoulder and pout.</p>
<p>“No reason to be rude… But yes! How great is that!?” I say quickly, smiling at him. I stare at his face, the small creases on his cheeks and forehead from his cute smile. <em>Wait… Cute smile? </em>I feel the blood rush to my cheeks and quickly turn away. “Have you got anyone to take?” I ask him innocently, kicking my shoes off and put my feet on the arm of the chair, my body leaning against Albus.</p>
<p>“Nope and I don’t intend to…” he says through gritted teeth. I feel his body move away from me and I fall back so I’m lying down. I watch him head down the stairs to our dormitory, his head down and silky dark hair covering his face… <em>silky…</em> I jump up quickly and follow him into our room, slamming the door behind me.</p>
<p>“Al…” I say quietly, watching him undo his tie and kick off his shoes.</p>
<p>“Albus…” he corrects me quickly. <em>Why Albus all of a sudden… He always lets me call him Al…</em></p>
<p>“Okay... Albus. Please tell me what’s wrong? You’re acting all weird...” I eye him as he slides his jumper off and begins to unbutton his shirt. My eyes glide over his body, his beautifully toned body. <em>Okay… What is going on in my head!?</em></p>
<p>“Oh! Am I?” He says, sounding like a child. He pulls a grey Slytherin shirt over his head and plops onto his bed. “Shouldn’t you be spending valentines evening with your new girlfriend?” He snaps before pulling the blanket over his head. I sigh and turn on my heel, opening the door quickly.</p>
<p>“Maybe I will….” I say growling and walking out before slamming the door shut behind me.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>I giggle, fiddling with the key to my restraints. They loosen and my wrists are free, covered in dried blood. There’s a hole in the wall of my cell, just big enough for me to squeeze through. The dementors will be distracted by my father’s followers just enough time for me to get out and apparate. I hear the shouting from them echo through the empty and dreary corridors and immediately get to work, sliding my body through the gap towards the vicious sea. As soon as I’m out, I begin to drop towards the waves below, as they crash against the fort. I whimper slightly and allow myself to fly upwards away from the prison. When I’m as far away as possible, away from the wards, I apparate out of the area, giggling when I realise I’m just outside the grounds of Hogwarts. The candle lights inside flicker. <em>Phase one of getting daddy back is go go…     </em></p>

  <u>SCORPIUS POV, Slytherin Dormitory</u>
</p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>Albus’s quiet snores fill the silent room. I look out of the tiny window of our dorm at the stars as they flicker. I hear one of the beds creak and shut my eyes quickly, pretending to sleep. The sound of footsteps on the wooden floor instantly tells me someone’s awake. The door opens slightly, letting in a ray of light that blinds me as I open my eyes. The room is engulfed in darkness again as the door is shut. <em>Who’s getting out of bed at- oh…? I should’ve guessed.</em> I look over to see Albus’s bed empty; his bedsheets crumpled up at the end and his pillows strewn over the place. I slide out of my own bed, pulling my black dressing gown around me and follow him out of the room.</p>
<p>I head upstairs quietly to the common room and see him sitting by the fire, his head down and face hidden by his mop of hair. I move nearer and sit on the sofa behind him. He obviously knows I’m there but doesn’t turn around. “Dad messaged me earlier… Delphi’s escaped…” He says so quietly, I have to strain my ears to hear him. He sighs and covers his face with his hands.</p>
<p>I stand up and bend down beside him, wrapping my arm around his shoulders. His arms are cold due to the lack of clothing and the cold February night. I pull my dressing gown off and place it over his shoulders, attempting to keep him warm. The flames of the fire dance in front of us and the sound of the portraits snoring and the flames flickering echoes around the room. “Scorp… I want to leave…” He looks up at me, a tear brimming his eye.</p>
<p>I lean forward brushing it away, my pale fingers lingering over his darker <em>handsome </em>face. “Where do you wanna go…?” I whisper. “We could take your cloak and sneak out to Hogsmeade for a walk if you wanted or-“</p>
<p>“No… I mean I want to leave Hogwarts…” He sighs and pushes my hand away. “No one likes me here… No one. No pupil. No teacher. No portrait. Not even a fucking house elf in the kitchen!” he looks down again.</p>
<p>“I like you…” I say, moving my face nearer to his. “You’re my best friend Al. You always will be…”</p>
<p>“What about Rose though? Once you two start getting closer, I’m not going to be your best friend anymore… Am I?” <em>           </em></p>
<p>I move away, taken back by what he just said. I sigh and take a deep breath. “Albus Severus Potter. You listen to me, okay?” I look at him intently, watching him nod slightly. “I love you…”</p>
<p>He looks up suddenly, blushing. His lips part and a smile forms. I continue: “Yes. I love you. You’re my brother Al. You always will be. Besides ‘Bros before hoes’ yeah?” I chuckle. “I love Rose as my girlfriend but I love you as my best friend.” I watch his smile fade and a frown begins to form. “Everything okay?” I ask, warily.</p>
<p>He stands up suddenly, throwing my gown onto the floor. “Seriously?” he asks, anger in his voice. “You seriously just did that!?” he sarcastically laughs and grabs his wand before storming out of the common room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*********************************************************************************************************************************************************** </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After our little argument, I hardly saw Albus for the next few days. Goodness knows where he was going as he was never in the common room or dorm or library or great hall. I had begun to hang out with Rose more, her Gryffindor buddies slowly accepting that I’m actually okay. The Valentine’s Ball was in two days and I was already stressing about what to wear etc.</p>
<p>I walk down the corridor towards my Muggle Studies class, Rose’s hand in mine. <em>It wasn’t what I was really expecting this whole relationship thing… I don’t know why, but I feel I want more… </em>I pull my bag onto my shoulder more and begin to enter the classroom when the teacher suddenly runs out. “Thank God! Rose, darling, run and get the headmaster… Scorpius I need your help urgently” he says in a hurry. I feel Rose leave my side and follow the teacher into the classroom.</p>
<p>There are tables everywhere, chairs deposited and students cowering in fear in the corner of the room. Smoke is everywhere and the windows are smashed. I cough, the air full of dust and goodness knows what. I see Albus, curled up on the floor, his head in his hands. His body’s shaking from where he’s obviously crying. I hear sniggers from the spectating students as I move closer.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall and Rose run in, Madame Pomfrey pursuing them. They all gasp at the sight as a group of students, including James Potter crowd around the door outside. I hear them muttering.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that your brother, James?”</p>
<p>“Daddy Potter wouldn’t be proud would he?”</p>
<p>“Do you reckon he’s going mad like Tom Riddle did?”<em>  </em></p>
<p>I sigh and bend down next to Albus, prying his hands away from his face. He’s still crying, tears staining his cheeks. “I’m s-sorry Scorpius…. I didn’t mean to….” He looks around at the audience as I stare at him, fear filling my heart. <em>He looks so vulnerable. I just want to help him… Care for him. Look after him as much as possible. </em></p>
<p>“It’s okay Al…. It’s alright. We’ll get this sorted, yeah?” I hold his hands in mine. He looks up, his bloodshot eyes look puffy obviously from the lack of sleep.</p>
<p>“No, you don’t understand…” He says faintly.</p>
<p>“What’s he saying!?” I hear someone shout from the crowd. I look at Albus, beginning to open my mouth to defend him when two teachers burst through the crowd.</p>
<p>“Professor McGonagall! Dead… Student… Lower boy’s bathroom…” The room fills with gasps and people start to filter out, running towards to bathroom. I look at Albus, my heart beating fast, dreading to hear what I am expecting.<em>                          </em></p>
<p>He slowly nods then suddenly apparates out of the room, right in front of my eyes.<em>                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </em></p>

</p>
<p>I giggle as I see Albus Potter fall in front of me. He sits up suddenly, coughing and wheezing. <em>Must’ve caught him off guard</em>. I pout and flick my wrists up, pulling him onto his feet. I flick my wand, binding him with a golden rope. He winces and looks up, grimacing. “Good morning dear…,” I say, giggling to myself.</p>
<p>“So it’s true?” He mumbles, pulling against my restraints. I nod, as the restraints tighten even more.</p>
<p>“Is it true you killed someone?” I ask him, already knowing the truth.</p>
<p>“Gossip travels fast…”</p>
<p>“Well… What can I say!?” I giggle, stroking his cheek. “Hearing about a Potter using the killing curse is quite fun, isn’t it? Well... Enjoy Azkaban!” I smirk and start walking away, waiting for him to call.</p>
<p>“Delphi! No, wait!”</p>

</p>
<p>One minute I was in front of Scorpius, my vision blurred with tears. The next I am bound up outside Hogwarts, Delphi in front of me smirking. I pull against the restraints, wincing as I look up at her. “Good morning dear…” she giggles. A sickening feeling fills my body making me want to vomit.</p>
<p>“So it’s true?” I stutter, tugging on the rope. She nods slightly, the restraints tightening around my body.</p>
<p>“Is it true you killed someone?” <em>How does she already know!?</em> I think back to only 5 minutes ago, the look in Scorpius’s grey eyes. That look of sadness and disappointment. <em>How could I betray him like that? I’m sorry Scorpius…</em></p>
<p>“Gossip travels fast…” I eventually respond.</p>
<p>“Well… What can I say!?” She giggles, running her fingers down my cheek. They’re cold and harsh feeling, unlike Scorpius’s gentle fingers. “Hearing about a Potter,” she spits “using the killing curse is quite fun, isn’t it?” she jokes. ”Well… Enjoy Azkaban!” She smirks and turns away.</p>
<p>
  <em>So she brought me here to leave me here… Seems a bit extreme…</em>
</p>
<p>“Delphi! No, wait!” I call, hearing the bells of Hogsmeade ring in the distance. She whips around, evilly smiling.</p>
<p>“As long as you agree to help me. We’ll become partners in crime, yeah?” She steps closer.</p>
<p>I take a deep breathe, assembling a deal in my head. “You let me go, I help you as much as I can. But you don’t lay a finger on Scorpius… If he’s hurt, I’ll kill you too…” I say nervously.</p>
<p>She clicks her fingers, the restraints falling off and holds out her hand. “It seems we have a deal, Mr Potter.” I clasp her hand, shaking it tightly before apparating with her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>***********************************************************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My body slams onto a cold, concrete floor. It’s freezing and covered in a dark, black liquid. I look up. Delphi stands above me, her arms crossed. I sit up and look around. People surround me: some I believed to be dead for years. Peter Pettigrew. Antonin Dolohov. Augustus Rookwood. Corban Yaxley. Lucius Malfoy stands back, in the darkness. Delphi grabs my arm and pulls me up. “Granted he’s not exactly the Potter we wanted, but it should still work, right?” She smiles nervously at them, hope in her eyes. I wince as her grip tightens on my arm.</p>
<p>They all eye me carefully, looking me up and down. Peter nods excitedly, grabbing my hand. I try pulling away, whimpering as Delphi sticks her nails into my arm. “Be a <em>good</em> boy” she snaps, smiling innocently. I look at Peter’s hand: long, nasty nails and rough skin. I look away as he inspects my wrist.</p>
<p>Suddenly I feel a stab of pain in my wrist and look down at him injecting something into my arm. I try with all my might to pull away, the pain agonising. “What is that?” I scream out, Augustus Rookwood seizing one arm and Delphi holding the other tightly. It’s the same liquid on the floor…</p>
<p><em>What would Scorpius do..?</em>. I feel my eyes start to droop and my arms become weaker. They drop me to the ground, my body limp and unable to move. “Del…” I start to say but find my eyes close, to the sound of her giggling.</p>

  <u>SCORPIUS POV, Gryffindor Common Room</u>
</p>
<p>
  <u> </u>
</p>
<p>It’s been a week since Albus disappeared. A week since Delphi escaped. Seems odd right? Well, no one apparently thinks so. Our school has been on lockdown until they find Albus; no Hogsmeade trips, no going outside, even on the school grounds. Nothing. <em>Albus is okay </em>I say to myself repeatedly.</p>
<p>Rose rests her head on my shoulder, yawning. <em>God, I wish this were him. </em>I see James playing exploding snap with Lily in the corner of the room and smile slightly. They look happy. At least they’re handling it fine. Harry and Ginny visit frequently, their eyes drooping from the lack of sleep and long nights looking for Al. They are obviously worried about their other two children. I can’t imagine what they’re going through, losing their son again for the third time…</p>
<p>Without noticing, a tear rolls down my cheek. I feel Rose’s hand brush it away and she kisses my cheek again, her lips lingering there for a while. I close my eyes and imagine Albus being here. I imagine he’s sitting here next to me, telling one of his goofy stories about his uncles Fred and George and about the way they pranked Mr Filch multiple times. I imagine his amazing laugh, his beautiful smile and perfect lips. I imagine his shiny hair and how he runs his hands through it constantly. Lastly, I imagine his bright green eyes, the way they shine and sparkle when he gets excited or happy or… when he sees me... I sigh and pull away from Rose, standing up.</p>
<p>“I’m going back to my dorm... I’ll see you tomorrow, okay?” I smile at her before turning around quickly, leaving her looking completely dumbfounded and confused.</p>
