          <div class="userstuff"><p>It was a bright winter morning. Draco had discovered a sight that greatly displeased him. </p><p>Harry, cheerfully preparing breakfast. </p><p>“We’ve talked about this before,” Draco announced. “I prefer my meals to be mercifully blood-<em>free</em>. Do step away from my bagels, please. I don’t want a repeat of last time.”</p><p>“I cut myself once,” Harry grumpily admitted. “You healed me moments later. You’ll never let me forget it!”</p><p>“No, I won’t,” Draco agreed, Accio’ing the knife from Harry’s grasp. “You fainted, remember? Banged your head? Had to go to St. Mungos? <em>Merlin</em>. Bloody good job I love you so much.”</p></div>
