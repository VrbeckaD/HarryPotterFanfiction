You know what Ron called it, the month of bloody headaches. First he had to pack all his belongings up to take with him as he moved around the houses this month. Then he had to let someone else sleep in his bed, so what if the house elves washed and changed the sheets. In his mind the bed would not be the same when he returned, it would be tainted with essence of Slytherin. Not to mention sleeping down in the dungeons for an entire week when it was their turn to be a Slytherin. He would probably end up freezing his balls off, maybe that's why the Slytherins were so nasty, the cold of the dungeons had frozen their hearts. All of this because Mcgonagall had decided that the students should step into each others shoes as a way to get over the animosity. Why couldn't he just spend the month napping and eating in the room of requirement instead of switching houses every week. It wasn't until he was on his way down to the Great Hall to receive the first lot of new house assignments for the first week that he had a panicked realisation. He tugged urgently at Hermiones sleeve, who of course was annoyingly excited to learn more about the other houses and had none of his reservations about this. “Hermione…. What if I can't answer the riddle to get into the Ravenclaw Tower? Or I get kicked out of the dungeons by the Bloody Baron? Or I can't find the Hufflepuff entrance? What am I going to do ‘Mione?” Ron frantically questioned a giggling Hermione who calmly gave him a half-hug. “First of all, Ron you really need to relax, remember what happened last time you didn't relax when I told you?” Hermione asked, almost regretting it after seeing his panic-stricken eyes, almost. “Seriously Ron you will be OK, someone will help you answer the riddle for Ravenclaw. Just like someone will help you get to the Hufflepuff common room. And you are daft if you think Mcgonagall would allow the Bloody Baron to kick you out of Slytherin during this house exchange. Now let's hurry up or we'll miss something important.” Grabbing a slightly calmer albeit still reluctant Ron by the arm Hermione drags him to the Great Hall. *** It was eerily quite when Mcgonagall had stood up at the podium. Everyone wanting to know which house they were going into first. “Now you have all been made aware of what's going on, we want you to have a better understanding of your fellow students and we decided this was the best way to do so. You will draw a slip of parchment with the name of a house printed on it from this hat then you will go sit at the table designated to the house you drew out. Once everyone has been sorted the head of house will escort you to the common room and get you settled in. Now if you please, line up.” With those words the students started making their way to the front of the Great Hall and one by one they drew a slip of paper from the tatty top hat Mcgonagall had decided to use. Reminiscent of the muggle magicians Hermione was so fond of. Finally Ron had reached the front of the line and tentatively reached a hand into the hat as if it held a venomous spider waiting to bite him. His fingers closed around a piece of parchment and he pulled it from the hat. Slowly he turned it over to reveal a single word listed on it. Hufflepuff. A small sigh of relief could be heard by those around him. He happily made his way to the Hufflepuff table where thankfully Hermione had also been placed. At least he had her to help him through the first week. After everyone was sorted Professor Sprout called the new Puffs to attention and got them to follow her. Rons attention peaked when he realised they were headed in the direction of the kitchens. Maybe he could make snack trips to the kitchen to help make the next week better. Surely someone would tell him how to get into the kitchens. Maybe this month wouldn't be so bad after all he thought. He knew everything would be OK when Professor Sprout opened the common room door behind a set of barrels and he was instantly greeted by the scent of freshly baked cookies.</p>
