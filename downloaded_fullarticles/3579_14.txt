    <p>I'm a ghost. Well, I already knew that, but now I'm even more or a ghost. A ghost of my former self.</p><p>They all died. A ghost attacked, and they all died. And I couldn't save them. Amity Park was destroyed, everyone I ever knew is gone. I was the sole survivor. Being a ghost has its advantages, or disadvantages as I say. I ended up in the foster system, and I guess the only positive was I found Dani again, so I'm not completely alone. We are being adopted by a family in England, after a couple of months of foster homes. We're one of the lucky ones- some never get adopted and grow up moving everywhere.</p><p>We packed up our stuff up and got on the plane. I think it was Dani's first time flying without ghost powers, and her eyes were wide with excitement. I'm glad she's happy, it's been a while since I last saw her smile. I started to drift off, dreaming of happy memories. The plane touched down, and I realise my real parents died not knowing my secret, and I don't want to make that mistake again. Our social worker, Natalia gently wakes Dani, and she grabs my hand as we leave.</p><p>"Daniel, Danielle, meet your new family, the Grangers.</p>
