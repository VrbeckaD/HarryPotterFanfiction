    <p>The air was thick with smoke as I walked through the debris-filled courtyard. Everything was blurred and hazy, and it was deathly still. Not a sound could be heard, save for the crackling of small fires that still burned here and there. I walked around the destruction carefully, and as I moved forward through the wrecked courtyard, the piles of debris began to come into focus and I could see that they were not in fact piles of rubble but bodies. The bodies of my friends. My family. Ron and Hermione, Harry and Ginny, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, my Mom and Dad, Dumbledore, Neville and Hannah, Rosie and Seamus, and Elinor. </p><p>My heartbeat quickened and I could feel tears wetting my face, but my feet carried me forward. I stopped at the entrance to the courtyard, a cloud of dust obscuring the bridge that stood before me. Out of the haze, two figures emerged. Horror gripped my heart when I saw who it was. Voldemort was walking towards me, his hand wrapped tightly around Draco's neck, nearly lifting him off the ground. I tried to plead for his release, but no sound left my mouth. A cruel smile spread across Voldemort's face as he raised his wand, pressing it into Draco's throat. "Avada Kedevra!" As Draco's lifeless body fell to the ground, a piercing scream ripped itself from my throat. "NO!!!"</p><p>"Isabelle!"</p><p>I sat upright in bed, covered in sweat and breathing hard. I looked around frantically, my heartbeat slowing down as I took in my surroundings. I was in my bedroom in the flat that Draco and I shared, the same one we had lived in since the Final Battle. I felt gentle hands on my back and I started, turning to see Draco's worried, sleepy face examining me carefully. "Isabelle, it's okay. You're just having a bad dream." Draco said, trying to bring me back to reality. I began to breathe deeper and more evenly, the early morning light showing me that I was indeed in my own bed with my very much alive husband. Draco pulled us back down against the mattress, tucking me into his chest, my back to him. "You're safe, Isabelle. I'm right here." He murmured. </p><p>Draco never asked me about my nightmares, and I never asked him about his - there was no need to since we usually had the same one. It was always the Final Battle, but with a drastically different outcome. I felt Draco's hands drift lower, resting protectively over my slightly-rounded stomach and I smiled softly as sleep began to claim me once more. "I've got you. Both of you" was the last thing I heard before I fell into a peaceful slumber.</p><p>----</p><p>"Mummy!" Cassie cried happily from her high chair, her face covered in gooey banana pieces. I rolled my eyes, laughing as I cleaned the mess from her cheeks, kissing them once they were banana-free. "You're a smiley girl this morning, aren't you?" I chuckled, smoothing her dark curls away from her face. She was growing up far too fast for my liking, already walking everywhere and eager to learn how to ride a toy broomstick like her cousins. "How's my messy girl doing?" I heard Draco say as he walked into the room, pulling on a jumper and swooping down to plant kisses all over Cassie's face, making her squeal with delight. "Are you two ready?" Draco said, looking at me expectantly. I raised my eyebrows as I finished washing the last breakfast plate. </p><p>Draco had informed me this morning that he was taking Cassie and me out today because he had a big surprise for us, and even though I was still a little shaken from my nightmare on top of feeling very nauseous, I just couldn't turn him down when I saw the excited glint in his eye. "Yeah, if you get her in her jumper and shoes, we can leave soon," I said, putting the dishes away and slipping on my trainers and a light jacket. Draco grinned and miraculously had Cassie ready to go in less than a minute, much to my surprise. He took my hand, holding Cassie securely on his hip. "Ready, love? Hang on tight." He said, quickly apparating us out of the flat.</p><p>We landed on an empty sidewalk, in front of a small, single family home. It was all brick, with a beautiful front step and plenty of windows, with vines trailing up the sides of the house. "Where are we, Draco?" I asked, looking around the street curiously. "Kingston-upon-Thames. It's a village outside of London. What do you think?" He said, leading me up the walk and still holding Cassie securely. "It's lovely. Quiet, small, it feels like home if I'm being honest." I said as we climbed the steps to the front door. We stood in front of the wooden door, and realization began to slowly wash over me. </p><p>"Draco...is this...our house?" I said, looking at him in disbelief. Draco smiled sheepishly, shrugging. "I knew you would love it, so I already bought it. A place for our family to get even bigger." My eyes widened and I touched the door handle, discovering that it swung open easily at my touch. I walked inside, covering my mouth when I saw the warm, open foyer, leading into a beautiful and spacious kitchen and living room. "Draco...it's perfect," I said, turning to beam at my husband, who looked quite proud of himself. He set Cassie down, letting her explore her new home while we followed behind, watching her patter around as Draco pointed out different aspects of the new house. 

We went upstairs, and I smiled when I saw Cassie immediately walk into a room, seemingly claiming it for her own. Draco and I walked into the room next to it, which was slightly smaller but still a good size. "This would be a perfect nursery." I mused, looking around the room. Draco wrapped his arms around me from behind, his hands resting protectively and almost possessively over my stomach. "In a few months, we'll bring our new baby here, to our home," Draco said, rubbing my small bump lightly and pressing a kiss to my neck. I smiled, leaning back against him and staring out the window, reflecting on the past few months. </p><p>When we had decided to give Cassie a little brother or sister, we had prepared ourselves for the possibility that it could take as long to conceive again as it did the first time, but we were shocked - we only had to try twice before I became pregnant. After the ordeal we had gone through to create Cassie, this seemed like the greatest blessing we had ever been given. I placed my hands over his and turned my head to kiss Draco softly. "You picked a wonderful home, Draco," I said, smiling against his lips. At that moment, I chose not to think about our horrific past or the nightmares that still plagued both of us or the swirling whispered rumors that Voldemort's supporters were plotting an uprising, lurking in the shadows. My mind was filled with thoughts of the future - our new home, our beautiful daughter, and the new life growing inside of me.</p>
