    <u>December 9, Present Day</u>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <u>Child’s Point of View</u>
</p>
<p>I woke up to see the sun was just rising over the mountains causing the mountains opposite my window to be bathed in a brilliant orange light. I looked down and saw my mother and father gazing out over the lake with dad. Looking at my clock I saw it was just after half nine in the morning. I quickly got dressed, threw on my boots and parka, and went outside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I called out “Mom?”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes sweetie?” she said with a resigned look on her face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I gulped before asking with bated breath, “Can you please tell me how we came to be living here?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t suppose you’ll accept me saying next year again, will you?.” my mom sighed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I sighed before saying “You’ve said that every year I’ve asked. I’m now twelve, I think I’m old enough, besides they’re going to cover it in history this year in school.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My dad sighed before looking at my mom and saying, “I told you, it’s about time we let them know.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Are you sure?” my mom asked, “I know you haven’t gotten over it even all these years later.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t think I ever will.” my father said, “Perhaps it will get better with time after it’s out in the open.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My mother sighed “There’s no talking you out of this, this time is there?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We owe it to them.” My father said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sighing, my mother nodded slowly, then turned to me and said, “We’ll eat breakfast, then we’ll talk.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Helping my mother and father down from the rock we began the trek up the dirt track that swerved throughout the snow, up the hill, back to our cabin. Our home was secluded in the woods, although that didn’t mean we didn’t venture out into civilization. It was peaceful. There wasn’t much chance of a rare temper getting the best of someone. If someone needed to let off some steam, instead of shouting at someone, whoever it was would just go for a walk through the hills. Opening the door there were several other people around the table including all my friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Are you ready to tell them?”, one of my friend’s parents asked my dad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I looked up at my dad in confusion. Apparently, I wasn’t the only one asking, seeing as my friends were at the table.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes.” he sighed, “It’s about time they knew.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“AFTER we’ve had breakfast!” my mom scolded dad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wasn’t the only one laughing at that, although I was the one that got caught. Unfortunately for me, my friends were able to hide it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You think this is funny?” she asked, “Then you can make breakfast!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With a huff, she turned heel and stalked over to the sofa.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What do you want me to make mom?” I asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You can make sausage biscuits. Now go on, it’s going to be a long day.” she said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m sorry mom.” I whispered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I know.” was all she said in response.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I gathered the camping chairs and set them out in a loose circle around where I would build the campfire. I then ran back into the house catching a glimpse of my friends playing table tennis in the room adjacent to the living room. Heading to the kitchen I got out the trays and plates and took them out to the chair next to where I was sitting on. I then repeated the process to get everything else I needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I finally had everything, I made the dough and separated enough biscuits for everyone to have three each. I then placed the uncooked biscuits into the bowl and grabbed the baskets that we used to hold biscuits. Grabbing the cellophane, bowls, and baskets, I hurried outside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once outside, I grabbed enough of the logs that lay beside the house and walked down the path gathering pine needles and small sticks to feed the fire once it got going.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(A/N: For those that don’t know the fire being built here is a self-feeding camp fire. I don’t claim to be any expert on campfires or cooking so if I made a mistake let me know and I’ll do my best to fix it.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I got back I set the logs up and put some kindling on top. I then unfolded the cooking tripod, hooked the tray in place and placed the biscuits on it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sitting back on my chair I gazed out over the lake wondering what was so bad about the story that my friends and I were about to be told. After a while one of our dogs, Aurora, came outside and laid down next to my chair while I was idly feeding the fire. She sniffed the packaging of the sausage patties and licked her chops hungrily.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sighing, I said, “Yes, you can have a bit of my breakfast.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eventually the biscuits were all done and put in the baskets. The only thing left was to do the sausage patties. At that point dad came out put some more logs on the fire and sat in the chair next to me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“How’s breakfast coming along?” he asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I just have the sausage patties left to cook then it’ll be done.” I replied.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He nodded and relaxed back into his chair, closing his eyes and just listening to the crackling of the fire and the sound of the waves crashing onto the shore. Shortly before the patties were done I nudged my dad who had fallen asleep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Huh, what?” was his intelligent response.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Breakfast is almost done, care to go get the others?” I asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Alright.” he said, before getting up and going inside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I turned back to the patties and started serving them. Once everyone was sat down I started passing around the plates with the sausage patties and biscuits on. Breakfast was a quiet affair, after my friends had done the washing up, my mother let me off since I had cooked, my mother led my friends back to the fire to tell the story.</p>
