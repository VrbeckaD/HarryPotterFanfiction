    <p dir="ltr">Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, lived a beautiful princess (not a princess, not anymore, she had become a queen)</p><p dir="ltr">She was so little that her parents often call her their munchkin (Lily loved to read muggle stories, to the complete disarray of both James and Sirius). She was only one year old, but even then, she was smaller than most of the other babies her age, including her chubby sand-haired cousin, Neville.</p><p dir="ltr">The baby had big green eyes, framed by long curved brown eyelashes, and handfuls of bright red hair in her pale white head. She was born on the last day of July, and her parents were anxious about her arrival, as were their friends.</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Two men were in the waiting room of the maternity of St. Mungos. One was sitting on the furthest chair, while the other was pacing, fast and nervous.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- I can't wait for it Sirius, and she won't let me inside. Last time I tried, I was on the end of a Stinging Hex. You know how she is good with them.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>The oldest man laughed, wrinkles at the corners of his blue deep eyes.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- Stop walking around, you will open a hole in the floor. Moony will be here soon.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>James Potter stopped, and look seriously to the oldest Black son.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- Do you think we can trust him?</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Sirius was nothing but serious when he looked deeply into the hazel eyes.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- I would trust Remus with my own life. After all, I trusted him enough to take care of my heart.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Both men laughed, but the sound was fake and choked.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Months after, they both discovered the words were as fake as the laugh.</em>
</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">The shape of her face and her other features, in the opposite, were alike her deceased grandmother, Dorea Black-Potter, making her Uncle Paddy jokingly call her "daughter" (when she called him Daddy, her Daddy cursed him. Her Mummy and Uncle Moony found it all very amusing.).</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- She looks more like me than you, Prongs. The purebloods will be talking, you know how gossip runs in the Ministry.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>The animagus dog laughed hard, looking to the baby in the arms of the wife of his best friend. He was then swatted in the head by an amused werewolf.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- Sirius! - Lily said in a mock tone of recrimination - She has James'... James'... James'... Smile!</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>All friends laughed, deep, true laughs that warmed their cold war hearts, and the male Potter looked stunned, as if betrayed.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- If she calls you dad, I will kill you. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- She may be my blood, but she is your daughter. Our little prankster.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Both of the men laughed more at the frown in Lily's face (like she couldn't imagine her sweet angel as a prankster), the war forgotten and gone in their minds for that small moment.</em>
</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">In the world that the little girl lived there were a lot of horrors, war, misjudgments, and preconceived notions.</p><p dir="ltr">The adult people like Preconceived Notions, they call that horrible things "opinions''. But not opinions about how to end hungriness, or poverty, or slavery, drugs, hate, abuse, and genocide.</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- Are you sure?</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- Yes, Sirius. You're too... obvious. We can't risk them using Regulus against you. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Both friends knew that this was only a poorly thought excuse. Sirius was a Black, and Black folk was naturally attracted to dark magic, it was rooted in their cores and minds like vines. Regulus was just an excuse to not hurt the feelings of the oldest, and it was a lie to both of them.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Just one more lie for the record.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>It wasn't like they were used to fake to themselves.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- Peter won't break in any circumstance, I will make sure of that.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- I'm sure he will not. I trust you, Padfoot.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>It was one more lie. They both knew it.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>The moment they alienated Remus for the beast he carried against his will, something they promised that would never happen, they stopped trusting every person that crossed their path, which included but even each other.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Past were the days when they told everything to one another, past was the friendly meetings and laughter over brunch. One of the Order was a spy.</em>
</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">But our little girl knows nothing about IT. IT is the big war happening outside her cradle and their pacific house.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside the ghostly silver stag that sleeps in her chest, outside the bubbles that her Mom makes to see her smile, and the laugh of Uncle Moony and Uncle Padfoot when they prank Daddy.</p><p dir="ltr">It's far away from the fake scowls of her Mummy, and behind layers of love and domestic bliss, even if the laugh of the married couple sounded a little too fake, a little too heavy with worry.</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Peter wouldn't break, they trusted their old friend, as much as they could trust anyone in this goddamned war. But the Dark Lord was stronger and smarter, and could always discover a way to break the Fidelius charm that kept them safe.</em>
</p><p>(or a way to break Peter's secret out of him)</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>They didn't know if Remus was alive, or Sirius, or Frank, Alice, and Neville. The last time they talked with any outsider was weeks ago, and their food supply was brought by a Potter elf in secrecy every Sunday.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Charlus and Dorea were dead since before the birth of their daughter, and their best friends were long gone and hiding.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Maybe that was a mistake, but everything could be mended after that horrible man was dead and buried, hoping that they were all alive and kicking.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>They hoped that it wasn't too late.</em>
</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">The news about IT came by an old man, with hair who carried hints of an auburn hair that turned grey with stress and age. His blue eyes were always sparkling behind his glasses, and he had lots of wrinkles, from laugh and sorrow.</p><p dir="ltr">The little girl didn't like him; he always sounded fake, superfluous, as he wasn't in the same world as them. Her parents, Mommy and Daddy, were always nervous when the news came by. They had fought in IT but refused to since she was born.</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Albus Dumbledore was a clever, wise man. But he committed errors, and in one of them, he created a villain, a villain worse than the last one. (who was partially his fault anyway) And now, he just didn't know how to overthrow him. The man wasn't indebted to him, neither had humanity enough to be sane or moral.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>So he researched for months and discovered an ancient protective rune spell, that could be activated by less than five years old wizard children born in a very narrow and specific lunar circle.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>On the bad side, it would make the child attacked too strong, too powerful. Too inconvenient to his other plans, the ones he planned to put in action as soon as Tom Riddle was gone for good.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Maybe it would be dead by all the power.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>He hoped so, even if slightly guilty.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>He crafted a prophecy, with a false prophetess and a teenager death eater spy to make bait to the Dark Lord, and said to himself that it was for the Greater Good.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>It was these children or the future of all the magic world.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>That night, after he placed the spell in two babies, telling their parents lies he would regret over their dead bodies, he cried himself to sleep for the first time since his lover's demise by his own hands.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>It was for the Greater Good, after all.</em>
</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Her Mummy was a short and beautiful woman, with auburn hair and green eyes, just like her. Her skin was pale since before the IT she used to pass all her free time reading or just generally inside. She had a lot of freckles, which make it look a bit like someone had just spilled points of paint in her face.</p><p dir="ltr">She had callouses in her hands, and a small scar in her middle back, from when she worked as an Unspeakable and had an assignment in Japan. She also had the most beautiful smile in the entire world, with a laugh that could illuminate all England at once.</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">- <em>Lillian is so amazing! What did I do to get a woman like that? I must have been a freaking saint in my past life. – The man sighed, dropping himself in the couch like a ragdoll.</em></p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- We know, James. Be sure of it, we know. Now get yourself out of the seat, you will wrinkle your suit. – Deadpanned Remus.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr"><em>The group of friends laughed. The Potter Heir was</em> so whipped by his soon-to-be wife it shouldn't be even funny anymore (except it was, it was).</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>(…) - I knew it from the first year, all that foreplay…. – Started Sirius, in the discourses, tearing laughs from all their friends, and a scowl from a sullen McGonagall trying to hide her tears in a cup of scotch.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>-…. James couldn't stop talking about Lily, all day and all night at school and, when the summer came, by stupidly long letters…... – Said Remus, in his turn, mock disgust in his face as James hid his face in embarrassment.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>-… They were like an old married couple… and now they're one! ... – Peter laughed at his cheesy pun, and Sirius snorted in his corner, covering Remus's hand silently with his, a promise that they would be the next in the aisle.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>-… I always thought it was endearing, even with Mr. Potter being so immature…. – A "Call me James, Minnie", could be heard from the newly married couple table.</em>
</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Before the little girl slept, Mummy would tell her tales of beautiful dragons and courageous plebeian girls, who fought through false friends and difficult traps, saving the smart (not so much as he thinks he was) prince in the end.</p><p dir="ltr">More often than not, she would sing too, sing the praises of the gods and ancient heroes, lullabies pleading Sandman to take the bad dreams away.</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- What do you wanna hear today, my little lioness?</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>The mother beamed at her daughter, as she saw the youngster point straight at a medieval story, about Lady Boudicca, who was a barbarian medieval witch who could tame dragons.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>"In AD 60 or 61, while the current muggle governor of Rome Empire, Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, was leading a campaign against the magic island of Mona in the north of Wales, which was a refuge for British magic refugees, that didn't want to be used or slaved because of their powers, and a stronghold of the druids, the Iceni conspired with their neighbors, the Trinovantes, amongst others, to revolt. Boudicca was chosen as their leader.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>The history records that she addressed her army with these words, "It is not as a woman descended from noble ancestry, but as one of the people that I am avenging lost freedom, my scourged body, the outraged chastity of my daughters," and concluded, "This is a woman's resolve; as for men, they may live and be slaves." According to Mathilda Bagshot (great-great-great-great-great grandmother of Bathilda Bagshot), they drew inspiration from the example of Arminius, the prince of the Cherusci who had driven the Romans out of Germany in AD 9, and their ancestors who had driven Julius Caesar from Britain. The books say that at the outset Boudicca employed a form of divination, releasing a hare from the folds of her dress…..."</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>The redhead always liked powerful woman, liking just one fairytale in her short life: The Hunchback of Notre Dame, who, in the core, wasn't even a fairytale, even if her grandma thought so. She smiled, looking at her baby drifting to sleep, safe from all the evil in the world.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Or so she hoped.</em>
</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">Her Daddy was taller than Mummy, and his skin was darker. Looking at his eyes was liking looking at the eyes of a wild fox, with a trickster shine that always makes her Mummy always blame him about pranks (more often than not, Uncle Paddy had set him up just for seeing his face as Mummy scolded Daddy.).</p><p dir="ltr">His hair was messy and black, like a nest of birds. He used round shaped glasses and more often than not was in an old wifebeater and muggle sweats. He used to work as an Auror, who is like a very important magic policeman, and its why his shoulders were always stiff as if he was always ready to combat (but she didn't know that).</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- Who is my precious little girl? - The baby gave him a toothless smile, closing her eyes. The man smiled, happy, and passed the girl to the man on his left.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- Sirius, I want you to be the godfather. - A surprised smile appeared on the older man's face, a shocked expression short after.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">-<em> You know I can't Padfoot.</em></p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- She will be Frank's on paper and yours on the heart and to everyone else.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- Me? Remus is far more known for his responsibility…. And I... I am a Black, James… You know what people say about me behind my back: Reckless, mad…. And also what they say to my face. That I am just waiting to join Him.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>James put a comforting hand over the shoulder of his oldest friend and looked directly into the scared blue eyes, who eyed briefly the package of blankets in his arms, the little human life with big green eyes searching for his own and scorching his soul.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- You know I don't care about this bullshit. And you know Remus can never be her godfather, not because I don't trust him, but because the laws would never permit him to be the guardian. We plan to overthrow these laws someday, and then have a child to be Remus'…</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- Only if it comes from your asshole, Potter. I'll think three times before getting pregnant again. -The weak voice came from the redhead, who lay with her eyes half-open, frowning at them.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>James laughed, and walked to his post-birth glowing wife, smiling proudly towards her. Sirius Black looked at the child in his arms, so similar to him, and at the same time, so more beautiful. He knew in his heart, that was his goddaughter.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">Daddy used to tell the little girl tales about four wizard friends who turned into animals and pranked very bad people.</p><p dir="ltr">Her Mummy didn't like when he did it, and she uses to tell her about a poorly raised teenager who, misunderstood by his peers, was treated like garbage by the pranksters, and ended up alienating his only friend and associating with evil people.</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">- <em>You will not tell her lies, James. You know it's not Severus' fault!</em></p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- You don't talk to him anymore! He is a death eater, for Merlin's sake, Lily!</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>The fierce woman scowled.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- It's your fault too! He never did anything to you, and you alienated and bullied him so much it lead him to the border of suicide!</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- I was immature and wrong, but I did NOT force him to go to the Dark Lord. I did NOT draw the mark that he carries with pride. Any good Snape that you knew once is gone!</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Lily ran from the room, crying.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">The girl was very clever at her young age. She knew that most of the stories had truth in them, and knew that the tears that dropped from the eyes of her mother, or the regret in the face of her Daddy, weren't made up, weren't because of a tale.</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- I know we were wrong about Sni-… Snape, Remus. But how much?</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- I think it's beyond any recovery now, James. I think we broke a.... potentially good boy into pieces, and he put himself back in the way he knew how all sharp shards of glass and twisted metal. I think that we alienate a boy who was alienated by his own, and we caused a lack of trust and connections based only on hate.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>The younger covered his face with both hands, dropping his glasses on the floor, the regret overwhelming his whole self.</em>
</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">The family lived in a house, comfortable as it could be for the three of them. It had a mahogany floor and white/light golden walls.</p><p dir="ltr">Portraits of castles and waterfalls hanging from above the fireplace and on the sides of the stairs that lead to the three big rooms made the place lively and bright.</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>The building was purchased by Charlus Potter, and it was a marriage present.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- What do you think, Lily-flower? It's a bit dusty, but nothing that Sparrow cannot fix.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Lily look amazed at the house, smiling. Her white marriage dress was uncomfortable, and she knew loved even more her parents-in-law.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>She would hate to have to tell her sister to leave the house where they were raised, and where she now lived with her husband and their son, when they were barely trying to get comfortable with each other, and was the redhead by law. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>She kissed James, and he pulled her in his arms, crossing the threshold and carrying her into the hall, while the laugh fulfilled the space and echoed through the emptiness.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">One night, the little girl was in the carpet playing with little bubbles that circled her, a silvery doe and a silvery stag playing around her, while her Mummy and Daddy sat in front of the fireplace, laughing to themselves.</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">They both wore red and yellow sweaters and forgot for a moment about the stress and everything.</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- James…</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- What, Lily-flower?</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- I'm so happy we are here. We, our beautiful daughter… - The man hugged the redhead fiercely, kissing the top of her head.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- And we will grow old, and watch her, and any other child we have, marry and have her sons and daughters if they want to.</em>
</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">If they had looked outside the window at that moment, they would saw a human figure, hiding behind a tree. Its face and body were covered by a black cloak, with a hood that only let show two red dots: his eyes, and a sharp smile with pointy teeth.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe they could have escaped.</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- My Lord… - The Dark Lord rolled his eyes, annoyed by the mere presence of the recruit.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- What, Wormtail?! - ("Couldn't the dimwitted follower backstabber just shut up? He was doing very important things")</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>- I… I was made the secret-keeper of the Potters, Milord.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
  <em>Voldemort laughed high and sharp. He knew the little blood traitor (and now betrayer of his own called friends) would be useful someday.</em>
</p><hr/><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">The figure float, his feet barely touching the floor. He entered the wards, feeling the power run inside his veins and beneath his skin.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, one explosive hex towards the door, and he was inside the house.</p><p dir="ltr">- Lily, grab her and go! - A flash of red hair grabbed the little girl and ran towards the stairs, hiding in her room and locking the door with all the spells she knew.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, two Patronus were sent, one for Sirius and one for Dumbledore.</p><p dir="ltr">Putting the baby in the cradle, she put herself in place for battle. Lily could listen to everything downstairs.</p><p dir="ltr">- EXPELLIARMUS!</p><p dir="ltr">- PROTEGO MAXIMUM!</p><p dir="ltr">- BOMBARDA!</p><p dir="ltr">- SANGUI EXPELLUM!</p><p dir="ltr">- GLACIUS!</p><p dir="ltr">- SANGUI GLACIARE!</p><p dir="ltr">- MORTUUS PELLIS!</p><p dir="ltr">- AVADA KEDAVRA!</p><p dir="ltr">The silence was deafening, but no more than the muffled sound of her husband falling into the floor, dead.</p><p dir="ltr">One tear rolled by her cheek and dripped on the floor. She could listen to the footsteps in the stairs, almost mockingly slow. The door opened with a soft click, none of her spells protecting what was left of the small family.</p><p dir="ltr">She could see the face of a man beyond the cape. It was a brown-haired, aristocratic one, with no more than thirty years, mad red eyes looking to her, smiling peacefully as if he was high or drunk.</p><p dir="ltr">- Get out of the way, mud-blood. I have no desire to kill you, just the baby.</p><p dir="ltr">- Please, please, not my baby….</p><p dir="ltr">- Out. Of. The. Way.</p><p dir="ltr">- Please, she is just a baby, she could do you no harm…</p><p dir="ltr">- OUT!</p><p dir="ltr">- Please, not her, not my baby…</p><p dir="ltr">The green killing course left the white hand, to the middle of Lily's chest, her body bumping into the ground.</p><p dir="ltr">The baby wondered why her Mummy was sleeping on the floor. It must be the green light, one of those spells that Daddy used to put her to sleep in the messy nights, maybe?</p><p dir="ltr">- Oh, you're a clever one, aren't you? You aren't scared of me, little lioness?</p><p dir="ltr">A boring look was settled in the eyes of the little girl.</p><p dir="ltr">- It's a shame you bear a power you should never have, I can't let you live…. AVADA KEDAVRA!</p><p dir="ltr">The green light bumps into the girl's forehead, and she was a little blind for a minute before the man before he bumped into the floor.</p><p dir="ltr">She felt very, very sleepy, and so she never saw her godfather lending her to Albus Dumbledore, or the old man taking her to the house of her aunt.</p><p dir="ltr">Dumbledore knew that now that Voldemort was destroyed (and by the little hands of the last Potter), the girl would be the beacon of hope of the Wizarding World.</p><p dir="ltr">He couldn't let her grow up knowing she was more powerful and loved that he would ever be, he couldn't let a monster, another villain be raised.</p><p dir="ltr">He could not let her grow sly, and cunning, and ambitious, knowing how to use her fame. It would destroy everything, and it would be the demise of everything he has ever done to the Greater Good. It was better to have her under his thumb.</p><p dir="ltr">So, he didn't let Sirius take the child, neither let McGonagall. He apparated to Surrey, taking the baby, in a nest, with a lot of warming spells, into the doorstep of her aunt, who hated anything magical and would raise her needing and anxious to comply to be a perfect pawn.</p><p dir="ltr">Someone suggestible, weak. Someone he could control, someone he could keep an eye on and manipulate. It was for the Greater Good. The girl would thank him someday.</p><p dir="ltr">What Dumbledore didn't know, is that Petunia Dursley wanted a daughter to raise and transform in a better version of herself (didn't matter that she was exactly like her mother: her stunning looks would make it even easier), and Cassiopeia Heather Potter (and Black, but she do not know this yet) was her perfect chance.</p><p dir="ltr">The wizarding world wouldn't know what was coming for it.</p>
