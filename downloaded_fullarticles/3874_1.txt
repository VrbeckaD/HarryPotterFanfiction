    <p>“Fuck off, Potter, I don’t feel like dealing with you today,” Draco said without looking up from her book. She tossed thick blonde hair over her shoulder and turned the page.</p><p>“Oh shove it, Malfoy,” Harry said squeezing through too close bookshelves to get to the back of the shop. Malfoy sat on a tall stool behind the grand counter. As always, she looked like a queen above her subjects. Her subjects being ancient and out of print texts that mostly smelled like mold. Even preserved with spells and potions, most were in shit condition. People still bought them though.</p><p>Harry leaned against the counter. It was hot out and she might have been running down the street to the shop. Her dark curls stuck to the back of her neck and her glasses slid down her nose.</p><p>“Malfoy, listen for like two seconds,” Harry said tapping his freshly done nails on the worn wood. She wanted Malfoy to comment that it was tacky to paint them Gryffindor colors five years later.</p><p>As if Malfoy didn’t wear green half the time. Like today, her mint short sleeve blouse paired with a navy skirt. She had the collar buttoned up all the way to her slender neck.</p><p>She didn’t look up, just turned the page. Harry huffed, pushing her bangs off her forehead. “Come on it’s important,” Harry said. “What are you reading?”</p><p>“Same thing I was reading yesterday,” Draco said.</p><p>“You didn’t tell me what you were reading yesterday either,” Harry pointed out. Draco sighed.</p><p>“Honestly, why are you even here? You show up a week ago back from fucking around in America for five years. You don’t go home, you don’t tell your real friends you’re home, you just hole up in the Leaky Cauldron and bother me. None of it makes sense.”</p><p>Harry rolled her eyes. “Well, when you put it that way it sounds absurd,” she told Malfoy. Now Malfoy finally looked up. She stared at Harry for a long moment.</p><p>“So then put it into terms that make some sort of sense.”</p><p>Harry smiled, pulling an envelope out of her back pocket. She smoothed it out on the desk and passed it to Malfoy. Malfoy looked down at it.</p><p>“What is it?” she asked.</p><p>“I’m gonna teach at Hogwarts,” Harry said happily.</p><p>“No,” Malfoy said with another toss of her long hair. Harry kind of wanted to run her fingers through it.</p><p>“We’ll have a great time,” Harry said. Malfoy made a big deal about rolling her eyes.</p><p>“Why aren’t you off telling Weasley or Granger or the weird man you lived with?” she asked.</p><p>“Sirius? He’s kind of annoyed with me right now,” Harry said. Malfoy snorted.</p><p>“God, I have no idea why,” she said sarcastically.</p><p>“We can have good times again. We’ll just be in charge now,” Harry said. Malfoy had been teaching at Hogwarts for the last two years as a Potions teacher. Since they’d graduated, Hogwarts had expanded and had started signing on new teachers for the added classes.</p><p>“Who let you be in charge?” Malfoy laughed. “Oh right, McGonagall loves you,” she said with another eye roll. Harry beamed.</p><p>“I was teaching in America,” Harry said. “This west coast school that opened like 15 years ago. Hawthorne. I applied after leaving Hogwarts. Hermione had Ron, Ginny was straight, everyone thought I’d go on to be some great Auror,” Harry trailed off with a sigh. “There was too much pressure and I just had to leave. Then suddenly it’d been five years and I get a letter from McGonagall about the position.”</p><p>“What did you teach in America?”</p><p>“Potions. Well, I was the TA. It was taught by this super old guy like older than Dumbledore. He grew most of the ingredients himself.”</p><p>“Potions. And let’s hear the part of the story you’re leaving out,” Draco said knowing the gleam in Harry’s eye too well. Mischief was her middle name.</p><p>Harry shrugged. “Taught them some defense against the dark arts stuff for an after-school club. They didn’t have a class like that at school, so I took the opportunity.” She was proud of it and the kids had enjoyed it. It reminded her of the old days.</p><p>“And let me guess, that’s the position you’re filling at Hogwarts?” Malfoy asked with a sigh.</p><p>“Yep. I get to be the new Defense teacher.”</p><p>“Why’d you come back? Won’t this just bring up all those pressures like before?” Malfoy asked. She’d been on the wrong end of Harry’s breakdowns enough in the last two years of Hogwarts. But then she’d done the same to Harry back then for years.</p><p>“I don’t really know, but that’s why I’m here and not at home. I talked with McGonagall and she warned me that people are still going to remember the war and my name and all that shit. I’m just hoping that since now I’m an adult they won’t be telling me what I should do with my life.”</p><p>Draco looked at her for a long moment.</p><p>“I always wondered what happened to the Weasley girl,” Draco said. Harry smiled.</p><p>“Still thinking about me?” she teased. Malfoy rolled her eyes.</p><p>“You wish, Potter,” she muttered.</p><p>“Ginny liked the kissing, but eventually said she didn’t really feel those feelings for me. But I think she was just being nice because I was a right mess during that time.”</p><p>“Yes, you were,” Draco said.</p><p>“I know. I’m still sorry about it even though you’ve said it’s okay,” Harry said taking her eyes off Malfoy and looking at her nails. Malfoy had long, slender fingers that Harry hand been jealous of. Tiny wrists and soft pale skin.</p><p>She tried not to think about sixth year when she almost killed Malfoy. The way her magic cut into Malfoy, slicing her up on the floor of the bathroom-</p><p>“Potter,” she said. Harry looked up. “Go home. See your friends and stop bothering me.”</p><p>“I like bothering you,” Harry said with a grin.</p><p>“I’m going to quit working at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“You won’t because you love it there,” Harry said. She’d heard from McGonagall that Malfoy and Neville Longbottom enjoyed working there.</p><p>“Not with you there,” Draco told her. Harry just grinned. Malfoy frowned. “Is that why you painted your nails like that?” she asked. Harry laughed.</p><p>“No, I just like those colors,” she said holding them up for Malfoy to see better.</p><p>“I hate the color red,” Malfoy said. Harry was wearing a red v-neck.</p><p>“You say that on purpose and that purpose being just because I’m here,” Harry said pointing and accusing finger at Malfoy. She picked up her book, running fingers through her long hair.</p><p>“Fuck off Potter, I said I didn’t want to deal with you today,” Malfoy said tiredly.</p><p>“You love me,” Harry said, blowing her a kiss.</p><p>“Mmm, whatever helps you sleep at night,” she said as Harry apparated away.</p><p> </p><p>Harry shut the door to her room at the Leaky Cauldron with a heavy sigh. She kicked off her boots and flopped down onto the bed. It was lumpy and the room was stuffy. Harry tied her hair up in a knot and shut her eyes.</p><p>She <em>should</em> tell Sirius she was back.</p><p>She <em>should </em>call Ron and Hermione.</p><p>She should do a lot of things, but the first thing she did when arriving in London was find out which dreary shop Malfoy was working in. Everything was always the same with Malfoy. Harry didn’t know if she loved that or hated it about Malfoy. How even after how disastrous and out of control Harry had been before graduation, things were still the same with them.</p><p>Harry swirled her fingers around causing a thick book to work its way out of her trunk and land on her stomach. It was a new, heavy volume that Harry had enchanted for her defense students at Hawthorne. They’d write in their notes, comments, and questions and Harry would reply.</p><p>But nothing new had been written since Harry had gone of to bother Malfoy.</p><p>She shut the book and went back to staring at the ceiling. Eventually, word would get around that the great Harry Potter was off teaching. Wasting her talents and skills to teach a bunch of first and second years.</p><p>She frowned. That’s what everyone always said. Strangers were the worst with their constant complaining. She hadn’t even really done anything.</p><p>It was a night she couldn’t remember and a day no one else could forget.</p><p>Harry threw the book at the wall. It didn’t make her feel better. Hell, going to Hogwarts was probably only going to make it worse.</p><p>But the potions teacher at Hawthorne was right; she couldn’t outrun everyone forever.</p><p>August would turn into September and everyone would know she was back in England, if everyone wasn’t aware of it already. She honestly would have probably waited longer to come back, but she’d received a letter from Ron saying he and Hermione were getting married December 1<sup>st</sup> and they wanted Harry to be there.</p><p>And Harry wanted to be there even if it’d be just like old times and Harry would be sulking about her stupid crush while Ron and Hermione made gooey eyes at each other.</p><p>She kind of missed seeing that though.</p><p>With a sigh, she decided it was time to go to the Burrow. She wasn’t really sure where Ron and Hermione were currently living. Hedwig just seemed to know. But Mrs. Weasley would be glad to see her anyway and she could tell Harry where to find them.</p><p>So, boots were put back on and the book was shoved back into her messy trunk. She posed in front of the mirror on the back of the door trying to remember what it’d been like when she’d commandeer the mirror in the Gryffindor dormitory during seventh year to take all their pictures. For the memories everyone would say.</p><p>Only Hermione knew that was the year Harry couldn’t even look at herself in the mirror without feeling sick. Well, Ron knew too. And Moaning Myrtle because Harry broke all the mirrors in that bathroom out of anger.</p><p>She sighed, and apparated to an area near the Burrow.                          </p>
