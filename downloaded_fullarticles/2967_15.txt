    <p>Daphne took a seat at the bar and ordered firewhiskey as everyone else begins to settle in. “You usually wait until later to get drunk. What happened?” The bartender, Marcella asks her. Daphne makes a strange smile before blowing out some air.</p><p>“My lovely fiance thought of the best way to celebrate our engagement with my an old friend of mine since I heard them both from the entrance of our home. Where I’ll be avoiding for a while.” She confesses to her as she watches the drink get poured. “ Sorry to hear that Daphne, but if it makes you happy that man has been staring at you since you’ve walked in. Why don’t you get back at you fiance with that.”  Marcella points at Newt who was sitting by Queenie, Tina, and Jacob.</p><p>Daphne grabs the glass and looks at him and nearly drops its when she sees Newt. “The man who has been looking at me is an old friend of mine his name is Newt Scamander. We went to school together and did just about everything together, well we did until he got himself expelled.” Daphne informs her.</p><p>“So you guys didn’t date while you went to Hogwarts?”  Marcella asks and Daphne nearly chokes on her drink. “I wanted to go out with him, but he was in love with Leta and probably still is, and I’m stuck with a cheating asshole who I don’t even love.”  Daphne groans as puts her head down. “Oh you poor soul.”  Marcella pats her head a little bit then she fills her cup.</p><p>Newt watches her from afar and chuckled softly. “I’ll be right back guys.”  Newt stands up from his seat and walks over to the bar to check on her.</p><p>“Excuse me miss but you look a lot like an old schoolmate of mine. Do you mind telling me your name?” Newt asked her. Marcella giggles as she heard Newt’s question as she gave Daphne a refill. Daphne picked her head up and looked at Newt. “My name is Daphne Fiona Blake, I attended Hogwarts for seven years and I am now work for the British Ministry of Magic.” ” Daphne told him.</p><p>Newt smiled faintly as he listened to her introduce herself to him. “I know who you are, Daphne. We went to school until I was kicked out.” He briefly explained to her before giving her a tight hug. “What have you been up to?” He asks her. Daphne scratches the back of her head and looks down at his feet a little bit.</p><p>“I got engaged and then my fiance cheated on me sooo nothing much really.”  She turns to face her cup and finishes in one gulp. “I would say congratulations, but that’s something to be happy about.” Newt sat down beside her and looks at her.</p><p>Marcella took out a sticky note and wrote down an address for an inn down and hands it to Newt, “Take her there for the night. That’s where she usually goes whenever she has days like this one which is pretty often.”  Marcella tells him before she leaves to go refill everyone else’s drinks. Newt lets out a sigh and glances back at his friends, “I’ll be right back Daphne I have to go and talk to some of my friends then I’ll be all your for the night.” Newt walks back over to them, “I have to go and take an old friend of mine to a hotel room because she is terrible drunk and doesn’t want to go home, so I’ll talk to you all later. Bye.” Newt walks away back over to her and takes her ,and walks with her to the inn.</p><p>“I don’t know how much you’ve had to drink but I’ll take good care of you I promise.” He promises her and Daphne lets out a giggle as she reaches for the inn doors.</p><p>“I missed you too Newt!” She smiles at him before stumbling into the inn.  The receptionist shook his head once he saw that it was Daphne, so he grabbed her usual room key,</p><p>“Sir, this is her room key. You can leave it on the dresser for her, and she’ll bring it down in the morning.” He explained to Newt before handing the keys over to him. “Thank you and I will,” Newt puts the room key in his pocket and proceeds to carry Daphne to the room.</p><p>Newt puts her feet on the ground and presses the fourth floor button. “Who did you get engaged to?” Newt asks her. Daphne glances at him and fills her cheeks up with air.</p><p>“His name is Collin. He is a muggle and doesn’t like it whenever I get something from Hogwarts or if I need to travel which is a lot.” She tells him. “But I don’t think I actually like, like the way I thought I did, but it still hurt that he cheated on me. I guess that’s what I get for leaving all of the time without telling him.” She lets out a dry laugh and Newt just looked at her and saw that she was hurting.</p><p>“Wait, Newt why did you ask me that?” Daphne asks him and Newt’s face turns almost completely red. “B-because your my friend and I don’t want you to end up getting hurt.”  She lets out a tiny giggle and kisses him on his cheek.</p><p>Before they knew it the elevator opened and they got off of the elevator and walked towards the room. “Also I know that you were at the bar with you friends and I want to say sorry for dragging you away from your friends, you look like you were having fun.” Daphne apologizes as they walked to the room together and Newt shook his head in disagreement.</p><p>“You didn’t. I saw you walk in and I was trying to find a way to approach you since I thought you wouldn’t remember me.” He assures her smile. He takes out the room key and unlocks the room then helps her inside.</p><p>Daphne takes out tiny bottles of alcohol from her coat pocket and places them on the nightstand. “Well thank you and you’re welcome to stay for as long as you like or until I throw up.”  She tells him. Newt takes off his shoes and his coat and he walks over to her and helps her take off her coat. “I’m not going anywhere unless you want me to Daphne.”   Daphne gets on to the bed and scoots back some and Newt rolls up his sleeves and unties her shoes.</p><p>Daphne found herself blushing a rose-pink color and her face was heating up. ‘After all these years. I still like him.’ She blows out some air and watches him. “You’re really you know that Newt.” She compliments him and he shakes his head disagreeing with her. “I’m doing what any normal person would do.” He tells her. Daphne disagrees with him but she doesn’t say anything instead she takes her left hand and plays with his hair. “Your hair is soft. Softer than I remember it being.” She tells him and she watches his face turn red again.</p><p>“I-it’s still the same I’m pretty sure.” He tells her as he takes off both of her shoes. He gets up from the ground and takes her hand from his hair, and sits down beside her. Daphne leans on him and shuts her eyes, “I’m glad we saw each other at the bar even though I’m pretty much drunk right now, Newt.” She tells him as she fiddles with his right. Newt held onto her hand gently and kisses the top of her forehead.  Daphne moves her head and looks up at him.</p><p>She places her right hand on his cheek and smiles, “I know I’m drunk but I truly do mean this when I say that I’ll always love you even though we probably won’t end up together, but I hope we do i truly do hope so New-” Daphne stops speaking once she felt his brush against hers.</p><p>“Whatever happens from here does not leave this room.”</p>
