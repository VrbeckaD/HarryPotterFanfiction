    <p>“There are flowers growing in my ribcage,” Luna whispered.</p>
<p>Ginny turned around, watching her closely. She didn’t understand. Luna had always said strange things before. But, after the war Luna seemed to retreat into herself, making less and less sense. </p>
<p>“Do you think they’ll die in there?” Luna asked, hand settling on her chest.</p>
<p>“No, darling. They’ll flourish.” Ginny placed her hand atop Luna’s. </p>
<p>It was easier to go along with Luna when she got like this. Ginny was always patient, always understood, always bringing Luna back to reality.</p>
<p>“How will they survive?” Luna’s eyes bore into Ginny’s.</p>
<p>Ginny moved closer, stroking her hand through golden hair. She placed a soft kiss on Luna’s temple. Luna smiled, eyes bright, focused.</p>
<p>“Love.”</p>
