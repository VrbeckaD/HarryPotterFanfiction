          <div class="userstuff"><p>It was fourth year, and Mad-Eye Moody was going through a lesson on the Unforgivable Curses, performing them on spiders, much to Ron's dislike.</p><p>"Why couldn't they just- Use something else other then a bloody spider!" Ron exclaimed.</p><p>
  <em>"Impero."</em>
</p><p>The class watched as the spider started dancing in mid-air as Moody controlled it with his wand. The class burst into laughter and the spider had <em>somehow</em> started <em>flying</em>. It was like saying Malfoy could fear for anythig other than his own life, Harry thought cruelly. Hermione stared with mild interest as the spider started making its way towards a wide-eyed Ron.</p><p>"Ron, are you okay?" Hermione asked.</p><p>Ron swallowed as the spider jumped high, as of trying to jump down Ron's throat if not for the fact that Ron's lips were tightly pressed together. The spider missed Ron completely and landed on his desk, preffering to instead crawl closer to Ron, as slow as it could.</p><p>In a fit of panic, Ron blew at it as hard as he could, making Hermione gasp slightly. The spider flipped over, dead. The class burst into a laughing fit, clearly amused.</p><p>As the trio left the classroom after the bell rang, Hermione couldn't help but giggle slightly as their classmates did an imitation of Ron killing the spider.</p><p>"Traitor..." Ron muttered, blushing as Harry grinned.</p></div>
