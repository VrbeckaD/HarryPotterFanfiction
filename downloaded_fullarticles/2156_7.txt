    <p>Draco was eight years old, sitting on the patio with his mother when the first of the drawings appeared. It was a warm day, and one of the house elves had brought them a pitcher of sweet tea, and with one hand on the cold glass he used the hand opposite to work up one of his sleeves, revealing little doodles on the inside of his forearm. His mother, busy with her spoon dipping into her sorbet, glanced up at the movement and dropped her spoon with a clatter. She sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p><br/>
"You shouldn't draw on yourself Draco, you have plenty of parchment for that," She offered a strained smile.</p><p><br/>
"I didn't draw on myself, mother."</p><p><br/>
"That's what I was afraid of," Narcissa replied, her delicate hand worrying the pearls at her neck. "Pull your sleeve down."</p><p><br/>
"But it's so hot!"</p><p><br/>
"I know darling, but you mustn't let your father see."</p><p><br/>
"But I didn't draw them—" Draco started, and his mother's hand touched his own.</p><p><br/>
"You're special, Draco, you've always been special. Just trust me for now, please?"</p><p><br/>
Draco frowned at his mother's stressed expression, and the smile that didn't reach her eyes. He rolled his sleeve back down.</p><p>———</p><p>When Draco was ten, his father began sculpting him into a 'proper Malfoy heir'. Afternoons that he used to spend wandering the sprawling grounds, or with his mother, he now spent in his father's study, or in the dungeons practicing the proper form for dueling. Just before his eleventh birthday, his father announced he would be taking Draco to another pureblood family's gala, where he would meet the girl he was promised to at birth.</p><p><br/>
His father bought him a new waistcoat for the event, gray with silver stitching, that matched perfectly with the silver vest he received for his last birthday. The day of the gala arrived, and after flooing to a large room Draco had never seen before, they were seated for dinner. Lucius craned his neck, watching for someone in the well-dressed crowd. Draco saw his father smile and greet a large man, followed by a medium-sized girl with jet black hair. She wore a short-sleeved green dress, and an alarming number of loud golden bracelets on her left wrist. She rubbed at them nervously, eyes cast downward.</p><p><br/>
"Come, meet your betrothed, Draco. This is Pansy Parkinson and her father." Draco bowed warily, exactly as his father had instructed him to. He took the girl's left hand and pressed his lips to the back of it. As she drew back, Draco swore he could see flowers etched under the gold.</p><p><br/>
"Pleased to meet you Miss Parkinson," Draco said, just as he had rehearsed. When he stood, Pansy glared at him, and his father looked proud.</p><p><br/>
"They look like a lovely couple," stated Mr. Parkinson, and Draco tried not to think about the contrast of his white-blond hair beside Pansy's black strands, or perhaps how her hand seemed larger than his own. He thought they'd make a hideous couple, but he was taught to keep his mouth shut, so he returned the smile of the brutish man beside his rather brutish daughter.</p><p><br/>
"Perhaps we can reconvene after dinner in order for Draco and Pansy to spend some additional time together?" Lucius offered.</p><p><br/>
Mr. Parkinson must have nodded, but Draco was too busy watching the girl rubbing at her wrist to see it.</p><p><br/>
Lucius led Draco back to their table, and he beckoned a house elf from the wall where they all stood. The elf poured their drinks as another placed their soup in front of each of them, careful not to shake the bowls. </p><p>"Was Master Malfoy needing anything else?" asked the elf. </p><p>"No," Lucius huffed, not bothering to meet the eyes of the servant. Draco lifted his spoon and began to eat before hearing his father clear his throat. "Your napkin, Draco." </p><p>Draco flinched at his father's glare, hitting his wrist on the table in his rush to comply, spilling hot soup onto his sleeve. His <em>brand-new</em> sleeve, the sleeve of the coat his father bought him to meet his <em>fiancé</em>. "My apologies," Draco said, standing. "I'll go clean up." </p><p>Draco slipped into the men's room, taking off his jacket and rolling up his sleeves to work at the stain. His eyes caught on the small words and stars doodled on his arms, but he dragged them away, turning on the water. He couldn't believe what an utter <em>fool</em> he was making of himself tonight. </p><p><em>At this rate, father will never trust you with anything of any importance. Why would he? You can't handle a simple dinner. </em>Draco ground his teeth, and scrubbed more harshly at the material, the spot simply refusing to fade. </p><p>"Draco," said a voice. The boy at the sink turned, finding his father standing in the doorway. He stalked toward him, grabbing his wrist. "I come to see what's keeping you, and I find all of this garbage on your arms!" He shouted. Lucius pushed the boy's arm under the water, scrubbing at the marks on his arms. </p><p>"I didn't—" Draco mumbled. </p><p>"What have you done, spelled this on? You've plenty of ink and paper, why engage in such a low class behavior?!" </p><p>Draco flinched back, tears filling his eyes. <em>Mother warned you...</em> </p><p>Footsteps came from the hall. "Mr. Malfoy? Is everything alright?" </p><p>Lucius turned and found Mr. Parkinson standing where he had not long ago. "We're just finishing up here, I apologize for my sons behavior." Lucius let go of Draco's arm, now angry and red with black marks unfaded, resting his wet hands on the countertop. </p><p>"Step aside." Parkinson demanded, eyes fixed on Draco  </p><p>"My son and I will be along in just a <em>minute</em>—"</p><p>"Let me see the boy's arms," he said. Draco's eyes were wide in fear, his eyes fixed on the still-running faucet.  Lucius sighed and reached out to Mr. Parkinson. </p><p>"Please, it's simply a small—" </p><p>"This boy is <em>marked</em>!" He scoffed. "You tried to marry off your son when he's destined to be with someone other than my daughter?!"</p><p>Draco thought of the flowers. Pansy could have drawn them, he guessed. But then why hide them? </p><p>Lucius was silent, and Parkinson shook his head. "I'm breaking the engagement off. My daughter deserves better than a marked man." </p><p>———</p><p>Draco ignores the marks for as long as he can, but one night he wakes up with his arm stinging and the metallic taste of blood in his mouth. He sees the red seeping through the light fabric of his nightshirt, pulls it up before it can get much worse. There, among the jotted notes, stars, and drawings is a straight red line, blood ebbing along the break. Draco slips out of bed and sits at his desk, taking out his older quill and writes neatly, <em>stop.</em></p><p>He held his breath. He wasn't sure he'd get an answer. </p><p><b>I don't want to. </b>Messy print, but an answer all the same. </p><p><em>Why would you hurt yourself? </em>It's penned carefully as if Draco were writing a formal correspondence, though the ink seeps into the pores of his skin  </p><p>
  <b>It hurts more if I don't. </b>
</p><p>And that's the end of it. </p><p>Draco leans over his washbasin, scrubbing what he can of the ink from his skin. He dabs around the wound and tries to heal it, to no avail. He guesses it can only be healed from his soulmate's side. He wraps it in a clean cloth and hopes it'll stop throbbing by morning.</p><p>———</p><p>Harry thinks he may be going crazy. He dreams of dark, skeletal horses, and a boy with fair hair that never faces him. The dreams, however, are the least of it. Weird things have started following him around, and now words were appearing on his arms. Harry wanted to believe someone was speaking to him, <em>caring</em> about what he did to himself, but Harry was also a rational person. No one was coming to save him, the people in his life had made that abundantly clear. But with each night, the dreams of the boy grew more vivid, though no more words appeared. </p><p>Something was coming. Harry could feel it.</p><p>———</p><p>
  <em>Year One </em>
</p><p>
  <em>———</em>
</p><p>When Draco first sees Harry, the sight sends something between an electric pulse and a tremor of fear through his body. A few days later he feels it. A light pressure on his arm that he knows is from the scratch of a pen. </p><p>
  <b>Are you here </b>
</p><p>
  <em>what</em>
</p><p>
  <b>Where are you </b>
</p><p>
  <em>why </em>
</p><p><b>I think </b>Harry wrote, <b>I feel you near me </b> </p><p>Draco shivered, put his quill down.   </p><p> </p><p>He tries to tell himself that his soulmate couldn't be another boy, couldn't be Harry bloody Potter. </p><p>Tries to tell himself he doesn't want him to be.</p><p>———</p><p>Four days after Harry Potter stops the Dark Lord from returning, Draco feels the pain again. Sharp, stinging, just above the place it hurt before. He slips out of bed and into the Slytherin common room, careful to not wake his roommates. He pulls up his sleeve, casts a lumos, feels something like hope in his chest because why would <em>Potter</em> be doing this just after he fought the Dark Lord? Maybe, just maybe, he wasn't destined to be with the Boy who Lived to make his life miserable.</p><p>Draco picks up a self-inking quill from the desk beside the emerald couch, pushing back his sleeve just a little farther. He writes, <em>why? </em></p><p><b>it was too much</b> <em> </em></p><p>Draco stared at the messy lettering. What was he supposed to say to that? </p><p>
  <b>Who are you? I read the marked are always a witch or wizard. </b>
</p><p>
  <em>Yes, I'm a wizard. </em>
</p><p>Draco watched as an invisible quill circled "who are you". Draco took a long breath. </p><p><em>Harry Potter. </em>He lied.</p><p>
  <b>you're not </b>
</p><p>He could hardly breathe. </p><p>
  <em>How do you know that? </em>
</p><p>
  <b>Because I am.</b>
</p><p>He shuffled to the bathroom, wrapped a bandage from the cabinet around his arm. Looked in the mirror and pushed his white blond hair out of his eyes. He squeezed the edge of the sink, his knuckles white with the force of it. </p><p>This couldn't be happening. </p><p>——— </p><p>Harry tries to contact him in the days to come, but Draco stays silent, though his fingers itch for his pen. His father would probably insist on killing Harry, or maybe just burning the top layer of Draco's skin off— whatever he would decide, it certainly wouldn't be that he get more involved with the boy. His first year at Hogwarts comes to an end, and the day after he returns on the train he wakes to a two inch long burn on his wrist and <b>sorry </b>scrawled just under it. </p><p>Draco can't resist. </p><p>
  <em>What happened? </em>
</p><p>
  <b>burned myself cooking </b>
</p><p>
  <em>Be careful. </em>
</p><p>
  <b>thought you'd tell the world about being my soulmate </b>
</p><p><em>No. </em>He writes, because he might as well not be. There was no they could be together, even if they wanted to be. Which of course, Draco <em>didn't</em>.</p><p>
  <b>how old are you </b>
</p><p>
  <em>As old as you.</em>
</p><p>
  <b>are you at hogwarts? </b>
</p><p>
  <em>Yes. </em>
</p><p>
  <b>are you going to tell me who you are </b>
</p><p>
  <em>No. </em>
</p><p>
  <b>why not?</b>
</p><p>Draco didn't want to answer. Why didn't he want Harry to know? Because he didn't want to see his disgusted face, didn't want to feel the hate surging in his chest and the sick sweet feeling that had begun to congeal around it.</p><p>
  <em>It's complicated. </em>
</p><p>Harry didn't answer. </p><p>Draco thought that was fair. </p><p>———</p><p>..............</p><p>Pansy was eleven when she told her mother that she her soulmate was another girl. Her mother stopped chopping the carrots, looked up at her and blinked twice. </p><p>"I know," she said quietly, glancing at her nails.</p><p>"<em>How</em>?" Pansy had been so careful, wearing long-sleeved shirts, dressing immediately in the bathroom after a shower.</p><p>"I know you can't draw. You always had beautiful flowers on your arms."</p><p>Pansy was quiet, and her mother picked up her knife and began working again. </p><p>"I don't want to marry a boy." <em>Sorry you're not getting the grandchild you want. </em>She thought.</p><p>"Lots of people don't marry their soulmates." </p><p>"But I want to," Pansy mumbled. </p><p>"Have you even met her?" her mother said, the corners of her mouth twisting into something like a smile. </p><p>"Not yet." </p><p>"Then how do you know?" she asked. She placed the knife beside the cutting board and wiped her hands on her apron. </p><p>"I know her better than anyone. She's just— a part of me, you know?" </p><p>Her mother shook her head. "I wasn't marked." </p><p>"Dad wasn't either?" she asked. Her mother's eyes dropped. </p><p>"You'll have to ask him, Pansy. It's not my story to tell." </p><p>"Mom—" </p><p>"Please, go get cleaned up. The guests will be here soon. We'll talk about it later." </p><p>Pansy glanced at her mother one last time and walked up the stairs to her room. She slipped off her sweater and read the message that had appeared on her wrist since she had dressed hours ago.</p><p>
  <em>I'll see you on the other side of all of this, darling. xx. Luna</em>
</p><p>Luna was a beautiful name. It reminded Pansy of the moon and stars and everything she missed when she lived in the city during most of the year. She touched the words to her chest, and turned to sigh at the teal dress hanging on the door of her closet. Pansy prayed that Luna would accept her for everything she was— and wasn't.</p><p>..............</p><p>———</p>
