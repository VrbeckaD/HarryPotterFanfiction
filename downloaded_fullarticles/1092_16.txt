  <strong>July 1998</strong>
</p><p>For the umpteenth time, an eighteen-year-old Hermione Granger slammed her newest edition of Hogwarts: A History shut with a huff. She thought that the book would have more information about how the castle was built, but no. She and a few choice others were assigned to restore the castle walls and wards. Out of the last ten editions she read, not one shred of knowledge was shed light on the information she sought after.</p><p>“Get some sleep. You’ll feel better when you look at the book with fresh eyes,” a groggy Ginny Weasley advised.</p><p>Hermione attempted to reach for the book again, but the redhead yanked it out of her reach. “But…” Hermione started.</p><p>“You need rest. This book isn’t going anywhere,” her redheaded friend said as she locked the book away in her trunk. “You haven’t slept in nearly twenty-four hours. We’re spending the whole summer and the rest of the school year to help rebuild the castle. McGonagall has invited all the students and some people from the ministry to help restore. You can afford to get some sleep,” Ginny argued her point with her hands on her hips.</p><p>Hermione huffed as she tried to pry open her friend’s trunk with a variety of spells but to no avail. Then, the brunette glared daggers towards her friend as she began to frizz more with her temper. Ginny burst into laughter as she threw a pillow at her roommate.</p><p>“‘Mione! We’re not dealing with the Dark Lord anymore. We’re not dealing with an impending doom anymore. You can <em>relax</em>,” Ginny tried her best to encourage her friend.</p><p>Hermione plopped herself down on her bed and sighed. She stared up at the ceiling and willed herself not to cry.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Ginny. I’ve been a bit emotional lately since I got back from the muggle world this morning,” she confessed. “My gran died last week and it got me thinking that life was too short to waste time.”</p><p>Hermione changed into her favorite silk nightie, pulled her hair to one side, and fingered the pendant of her necklace that belonged to her grandmother. It was an unconscious habit that she had developed when she was stressed, as she hoped to gain the guidance of the wise woman who gave it to her.</p><p>In addition to losing her parents after she obliviated them, she also lost her grandmother. Gran had been Hermione’s sitter when she was a young child and both of her parents were at work. It was Gran who introduced Hermione to her love of books. Hermione knew she would cherish her grandmother’s love for the rest of her life. She could clearly remember the moment when her grandmother placed this treasure in her palms. Tears threatened to fall as her mind wandered down memory lane.</p><p>The silver necklace had a heart pendant with an ‘R’ etched onto the metal. She figured the ‘R’ stood for Rosalind, her name. A snake with an emerald for an eye was coiled around the letter, which added more elegance to the antique. It was the most beautiful thing that Hermione ever owned. Even though she received the necklace last week, Hermione knew she would treasure it forever.</p><p>Her roommate let out a sigh which alerted Hermione back to reality. As she was worrying her lip, Hermione looked over to see that her roommate also had a concerned expression on her face.</p><p>“Sorry Gin. I shouldn’t push this on you. Gran was in her eighties and your brother was much younger,” Hermione apologized as she wiped away some stray tears. It was then that she noticed her friend was crying too.</p><p>“No, Hermione. It’s all right. We both lost a <em>lot</em> of people close to us,” Ginny told her, “I understand.”</p><p>The two girls sat in the comfortable silence of sympathy. As if noticing the somber mood in the room, Crookshanks head-butted both girls and then hopped onto Hermione’s bed.</p><p>“Oh Crooks. We know you’ll always be there for us,” Hermione acknowledged as she devoted her attention to her cat. The feline rested himself by her side and yawned. “You’re right, Crooks. Sleep sounds great.”</p><p>At this comment, Ginny snorted. “Oh, so you’ll listen to Crooks, but you won’t listen to me. I see how it is,” Ginny sassed as she tucked herself under her blankets.</p><p>Hermione laughed as she reassured her roommate, “You know you’re one of my best friends, Gin.” Her reassurance was met with fake snores. “Good night, Gin.”</p><p>“Good night, ‘Mione,” Ginny responded before she dozed off. Hermione charmed the lights in the room to go out before she fell asleep.</p><p>If she hadn’t lost focus on her pendant, Hermione would have noticed the pulsating glow of the snake’s emerald eye.</p><p>—</p><p>A young, blond wizard attempted to make his way through the rubble of Hogwarts castle back to his Hufflepuff dormitory. He was carrying a feather duster in one hand and his poorly illuminated wand in the other, stomping, and pouting his way through the quiet corridors. The trek would’ve been much easier before the Battle of Hogwarts, but now the hallways were much dimmer and filled with many obstacles along the way.</p><p>“Why did the final battle take place in Hogwarts anyway?” he grumbled to himself. “It is inconvenient for the rest of us that have to clean up this bloody mess.”</p><p>Many of the students were already safely tucked away in their dorms, but not he! He had been assigned to clean one of the classrooms all the way by the Ravenclaw tower. While he was in the process of dusting off a wall, the ceiling crashed above him, which trapped him in the classroom for three hours.</p><p>He was trapped in an old Charms classroom for <em>three bloody hours</em>.</p><p>“Besides, I didn’t even <em>fight</em> in this stupid war! Don’t they have house elves for these situations?” he whined. “Also, I’m a Smith! <em>I’m</em> a descendant of Helga Hufflepuff. If bloody Voldemort doesn’t want to clean up his mess because he’s a descendant of Slytherin, then I shouldn’t have to- AHHH!!”</p><p>If Zacharias had not been ranting to himself, he would’ve noticed the gaping hole in the floor that he was currently falling through. He screamed bloody murder as he saw other castle floors zip by as gravity took him downwards.</p><p>Once he recognized the first floor and saw a ledge to hold onto, he let go of the feather duster in his right hand and held on tight for his dear life with his left. His wand managed to slip back into its holster underneath his shirt sleeve. He could feel the blood rushing to his toes as the sweat on his hands started to culminate. With every second, it became increasingly more difficult to hold onto the ledge. All he could hear was the sound of his heart palpitating due to his panic.</p><p>“Help me!” he yelled, “Somebody please help me!” There was no response.</p><p>Zacharias desperately tried to think of a way to help himself out. His wand was difficult to reach with his right hand. Each time he struggled to reach his holster, the grip that he had on the ledge loosened.</p><p>“HELP ME!” he shrieked even louder this time. “Somebody <em>please</em> help!”</p><p>To his great relief, he heard footsteps coming from the corridor. The footsteps became louder as his savior got closer to him. Zacharias felt himself being levitated from the gaping hole and onto the stony ground of the Great Hall. He let out a sigh of relief to feel a floor beneath his body.</p><p>“Mister Smith, may I ask what you were doing wandering the corridors at this late of an hour? You know that it’s dangerous to explore the castle at night, especially during this time of repair. We do not have the sunlight to aid us in avoiding these obstacles,” the familiar, condescending tone of the headmistress spoke.</p><p>The Hufflepuff student clumsily scrambled to his feet. Once he dusted himself off, he grumbled his reply, “I was trapped in a Charms classroom for <em>three hours</em>. If there are obstacles in the castle, shouldn’t you be more aware of the safety of the students?” He glared at his professor as he folded his arms across his chest.</p><p>“This is why the staff and I are patrolling the best we can,” the headmistress answered, unaffected by her student’s attitude. She had charmed a parchment to appear to show what duties students were assigned. Her eyes scanned the parchment for his name and narrowed her eyes once she saw his task. “Besides, I was unaware that a simple dusting of a Charms classroom would lead to such a disaster.”</p><p>Zacharias was not happy when he saw a smirk tug at the headmistress’s cheek. Oh, he would show her. “It is when you assign a <em>man</em> to perform <em>household</em> charms,” he retorted with a snort.</p><p>Her smirk was instantly schooled into her usual stern mask. She heaved out a sigh and rubbed her head. “Mister Smith, I advise you to think wisely before you speak. Otherwise, you will not have much luck in your future endeavors in academia, in your career, and especially with your relationships with other females.</p><p>“Now, go to Madam Pomfrey and she will take care of your injuries,” she commanded him as she pushed her glasses higher on the bridge of her nose. “It’s fortunate that school is not in session, for I would take many points from Hufflepuff for your blatant disrespect.”</p><p>Zacharias cringed as he made his way towards the hospital wing.</p><p>Once her disrespectful student left, she heard a soft thud sound from the gaping hole from which she had pulled him away. The older woman peeked over the edge as she held her illuminated wand over it to see.</p><p>The ground was pitch black, and it was difficult to see what was down below. The headmistress had never looked below Hogwarts’ depths before, for it had never been exposed in all the years she attended, apprenticed, and taught at the institution.</p><p>If the headmistress could have seen what was hiding in the abyss, she would have evacuated the whole castle, for a creature much larger than the castle itself, opened its eye and stared at the abandoned feather duster that landed on it.</p><p>—</p><p>
  <strong>July 1945</strong>
</p><p>Tom admired the glowing Slytherin locket in his palm with pride. It has been a long time since he felt complete.</p><p>Three years ago, the glorious murder of his muggle ancestors had been one of the happiest days he’d been alive. Now that he was nineteen, this moment comes at a close second.</p><p>He admired his handiwork of killing the blasted witch. Her frilly yellow dress stained with her own blood and her glassy, beady eyes were smeared with gaudy, makeup tears. She looked just as pathetic as his dear old father. Her only redeeming quality was that she valued the golden cup that had fallen out of her hands.</p><p>How did the most powerful items in all of Great Britain end up in the hands of such a lousy witch? Hepzibah Smith could hardly even cast a proper household spell.</p><p>Once Tom snatched the item, he cast a quick cleaning spell to the quaint cottage. Realizing that the woman of the house could not keep a place so tidy, he added some of her usual clutter to her dining area. He levitated her lifeless body upon the chair she previously occupied, and her face fell onto the plate of biscuits by her tea.</p><p>It was fitting that a woman who loved her biscuits so much that it killed her. Part of the reason she died was that she had a half-chewed biscuit in her mouth as he<em> Avada Kedavra</em>-ed her. Oh well, at least she served well to create another Horcrux.</p><p>Tom fastened the locket around his neck and admired himself in the mirror with pride. At last, he possessed something that belonged to the great Salazar Slytherin. The locket pulsated with a glow that Tom assumed had something to do with his newly-split soul.</p><p>He caught his reflection in a hallway mirror and smirked. Tom smoothed his hair out into its perfectly-coiffed look, winked at his reflection and swaggered out of the small cottage.</p><p>Salazar Slytherin would be proud of what he was about to accomplish. He was sure of it.</p><p>With a soft yawn and easy stretch, Tom apparated himself back to his flat above Borgin and Burke’s. It didn’t take him long to carelessly remove his robes and settle peacefully in his bed. Before he closed his eyes, he heaved out a sigh as he admired the locket on his chest.</p><p>Dealing with brainless people was exhausting, but it was worth it to acquire objects that belonged to one of the most powerful wizards of all time. With dreamy thoughts of world domination, Tom Riddle closed his eyes and went to bed.</p><p>—</p><p>
  <strong>July 995</strong>
</p><p>It was barely dawn when he awoke in his bedchamber. The only sounds that could be heard were her soft, steady breaths that indicated she was still fast asleep.</p><p>He admired how luminous her skin looked in the pale moonlight. She was quite a sight for his sleep-fogged eyes. Without realizing it, his hand raised up to caress her cheek lovingly. The soft touch was enough to stir her from her sleep.</p><p>“Mmm… my love,” she moaned as she pressed her cheek against his calloused hand. Her eyes fluttered open to meet his, then she turned her head to press her lips against his fingers.</p><p>He still could not believe that out of all the wizards who sought her affections, this dazzling witch chose him.</p><p>He did not have much to his name after the Slytherins waged a war against the muggles who had killed their people. Those muggles used the lousy and untrue excuse that the Slytherins and their bannermen practiced witchcraft against them, just to slaughter them and conquer their land.</p><p>Lords Ravenclaw and Gryffindor drew up a truce with the magical and non-magical. After all, the lords had nothing to lose and everything to gain. The Slytherin lands were far away from the Scottish Highlands. It also meant that the wizards and witches that were left behind were brought to be of service to them as well. Lord Ravenclaw agreed to take in Salazar as a ward when he was eight, as Lord Gryffindor took in the younger Selene Slytherin.</p><p>At least the muggles had the decency to not murder children. Salazar knew that this would be their weakness, for angry children grew to become vengeful adults.</p><p>Even though the Slytherins lost the war, his only saving grace was that he was brought up beside Lady Rowena Ravenclaw. She was younger than him, but she possessed an enthusiasm for knowledge that only added to her beauty. While other witches her age were caught up in their own appearances, Lady Rowena was caught up in her father’s library.</p><p>The library was their secret world away from everyone. It was there where they discovered their shared passion for literature, which would gradually grow into a shared passion for one another. It was a match that would not have been approved by Lord Ravenclaw, as Lady Rowena was already promised to Lord Gryffindor’s son. Lord Ravenclaw had tried his very best to keep his ward and his daughter apart, for he feared that the Slytherin purist ideals would poison his daughter.</p><p>Yet it was here, in Salazar’s prison cell disguised as a bedchamber, that Lady Rowena chose to rest. She could have slept in her luxurious featherbed, but she claimed she was much more comfortable sleeping in his arms. He had woken up like this for the past year now, and Salazar planned on keeping it that way.</p><p>Salazar didn’t have many possessions, so he treasured the ones he had dearly. He was hers and she was his.</p><p>As he admired the witch beside him, he felt a swell of emotion flutter in his chest. Salazar was not good at handling and expressing his emotions, due to his traumatic childhood. Despite that, he felt like he could achieve anything with her. The build-up of anxiety was enough to encourage him to confess the depth of his feelings for her.</p><p>While he wasn’t skilled with words that revealed his vulnerability, Salazar excelled at gestures.</p><p>“Rowena,” he softly spoke, “I have something for you.”</p><p>This sparked the attention of the curious young woman. She instantly sat up and peered over at what he was fiddling with on his end table. It appeared to be a nondescript, wooden box, a box she knew to hold the objects he held dear. She knew that was where he placed the locket that belonged to his mother. There were powerful wards protecting the box from thieves.</p><p>She knew Salazar didn’t have much. She would hate for it if he went through the trouble of finding her a gift, even though it was their anniversary. Though Rowena was a highborn lady, she didn’t care much for jewelry and riches.</p><p>“Oh Sal,” she whispered, “You didn’t have to get me anything. You are the best gift I’ve ever received.”</p><p>Salazar opened the box to reveal the lovely necklace he had transfigured the day before. It was a project of his that he’d been working on for since he realized the depth of his devotion for the love of his life.</p><p>He designed the pendant with her in mind. He knew she didn’t care much for the over-the-top jewels, and that she preferred something dainty and simplistic. The oval-shaped silver pendant had an emerald-eyed snake coiled itself around the first leg of the letter ‘R,’ an obvious symbol of himself and his devotion to her. There was also a protective measure on the necklace linked to his locket. If Lady Rowena was ever in danger, it would transport him to her.</p><p>When he presented her with the crafted jewelry, he saw her eyes sparkle in admiration. It may not have been as showy as other accessories she had been gifted, but it had been made especially for her. She held the pendant towards the glowing moonlight and smiled in adoration.</p><p>“It’s beautiful,” she complimented his work. Then, she balled the necklace in her fist so she could steady herself to straddle him. Lady Rowena proceeded to pepper his face and neck with kisses of gratitude and adoration.</p><p>Salazar sat up with her in his lap to meet her kisses with his lips. His hand searched for hers to grasp the necklace once again. He pulled away slightly so he could fasten the jewelry around her slender neck.</p><p>“The necklace is linked with my locket. If ever you find yourself in a dangerous situation, my locket will transport me to wherever you are,” he informed her as he caressed her cheek. Then, he took the time to fasten his locket around his neck. Both the locket and the pendant glowed in unison.</p><p>Lady Rowena narrowed her eyes and huffed in indignation. “Sal, you know very well that I am capable of protecting myself,” she chastised him as she poked his nose playfully.</p><p>“Not when you have ambitions to build our institution on top of <em>that</em> cave,” he corrected her.</p><p>In response, she shoved him back down towards the bed. “The rocks of that cave are thrumming with protective magic that can be traced back to the time of Merlin and Morgana! It’s the perfect place to preserve the education of our future students!” she argued as her wavy locks began to frizz due to her anger.</p><p>He chuckled at her stubbornness and wrapped a lock of her hair around her finger. “You know I agree with you, but there is a reason that the past generations have steered clear of that area by the lake,” he attempted to be her voice of logic.</p><p>“It’s a complete myth, a wives’ tale. Dragons are friendly creatures to humans. There is no way that the cave holds a dragon that will feast on our souls and destroy our world. Dragons depend on us for survival. Besides, Godric takes care of them all the time,” she stated.</p><p>At the mention of the redheaded oaf’s name, Salazar cringed. She pinched his shoulder when she saw him grimace.</p><p>“I know this is a terrible situation, but we cannot make our relationship public while I am still betrothed to Godric. Once we have the school settled, we’ll have a steady form of income and I can break the arrangement of our fathers,” she reassured him. “This is why we need to be as efficient as possible when we build the school. It will help us a great deal if we use that cave by the lake. This is, after all, for <em>your</em> benefit.”</p><p>Salazar switched their positions so that he was on top of her. He gazed hungrily at her body and covered her breasts with his lips. Almost instantly, she moaned and arched herself closer to his mouth.</p><p>“On the contrary, Lady Ravenclaw, this is for <em>your</em> benefit,” he breathed against her skin as his kiss continued moving south. With a mischievous glint in his eye, he looked up to smirk at her as he bit her slender thigh. He proceeded to pay generous attention to the area between her legs and pleasured her with his tongue. He felt her right hand cradle the back of his head as her body buckled under his lips with pleasure.</p><p>With practiced ease, he began to pump two fingers in her slick entrance. He could feel her body tremble with delight as she tried to remain quiet. Salazar thoroughly enjoyed pleasing her, because, for a witch who loved to be in control, she was simply irresistible when she lost it.</p><p>It was one of his favorite pastimes to see her come undone, especially if he was the one that brought her there. It turned him on greatly to know that she would never let anyone else witness her loss of control.</p><p>He looked up from his ministrations to see her body writhing under the flicks of his tongue. She strengthened her grip on the back of his head as she was pushed closer to the edge. A soft moan of “Sweet Salazar” escapes her lips when he added a third finger inside her.</p><p>She had to bite her lips to refrain from being heard as she climaxed. She didn’t want anyone to hear that she wasn’t in her own quarters. Ladies were supposed to be pure and whole before they were married.</p><p>This wasn’t their first time, and this would not be their last.</p><p>“It’s for <em>our</em> benefit,” she whispered as she yanked his body up so that he could enter her. Both Salazar and Rowena never felt more complete when their bodies were joined with one another.</p><p>—</p><p>
  <strong>July 1998</strong>
</p><p>Hermione could not remember if she’d ever slept more peacefully in her entire life.</p><p>It had been difficult to sleep after the war, after all the trauma she had experienced. She would often wake up with nightmares of witnessing her friends’ deaths. She slept with her wand under her pillow, often afraid that a Death Eater may appear out of nowhere.</p><p>She definitely didn’t have any fitful dreams last night.</p><p>Instead, she had a fanciful dream about being Lady Rowena Ravenclaw, having a very illicit affair with her father’s ward while she was betrothed to someone else. Hermione didn’t realize that her subconscious could come up with dirty fantasies of the Hogwarts founders if she read<em> Hogwarts: A History</em> before going to bed. She really must have been going through a dry spell after her brief fling with Ron.</p><p>The dream had been so delicious, that she could still feel the imprint of his warmth pressed against her back and his hardness pressed against her bottom. As her eyes fluttered open, she realized that not only had her favorite silk nightie had disappeared but that her own naked body was pressed up against another, very masculine (and very fit) naked body.</p><p>The only male that she remembered being in bed with was Crookshanks, who was snuggled up peacefully in front of her belly and on top of the blanket. Hermione shut her eyes tightly and willed for the feeling behind her to disappear, and for her nightie to somehow reappear. This had to be remnants of her naughty night fantasy.</p><p>It seemed that Crookshanks noticed her unease, for he nudged her head with his own and licked her cheek in reassurance. The action confirmed that this moment was very much not a dream, but reality at its finest.</p><p>She opened her eyes again to realize she was still inside the Gryffindor Seventh Year Dorm Suite that she shared with Ginny. She knew that this unexpected visitor in her bed would not bode well with her roommate, especially since Hermione had rejected her request to have Harry sleep here and that Hermione had just broken up with her brother.</p><p>To Hermione’s dismay, she felt the stranger nuzzle his head in her hair and press a kiss beneath her ear. Every sense she felt was <em>very real</em>.</p><p>In order to create as little noise as she could, Hermione slowly shifted her body so she could get a better look at the man sharing a bed with her. She made sure to not move so abruptly so that the rouse the stranger from sleep. Also, she didn’t want to create a ruckus, especially when her roommate was still dozing.</p><p>When she turned around, she was shocked to see how handsome the stranger was. His features were similar to the Salazar Slytherin in her dream, but his face was more rounded out. His cheekbones were not as harsh but angled enough to amplify his attractiveness. His hair was much more of a wave than the tight curls. The slight, but well-kept stubble was much more appealing than the full-grown beard that Slytherin wore. He had a leaner frame, but she could still feel that he was well-toned.</p><p>Life was not fair. She wished that she looked as attractive sleeping as he did.</p><p>It was easy for Hermione to jump to the conclusion that the person sharing her bed had to be related to Salazar Slytherin in some way, especially since he was wearing the Slytherin locket. She was supposed to be a Gryffindor, but hot damn! Dream Slytherin and Slytherin descendant were two, very fit, tall glasses of water… and Godric be damned, she was parched. That dream last night really activated her hormones.</p><p>Then, the cogs in her mind began to turn when she realized he was wearing the Slytherin locket, the same locket which was Lord Voldemort’s Horcrux that they had destroyed… and wasn’t Slytherin’s last living descendant Lord Voldemort?</p><p>Before she could solve the issue at hand, Crookshanks decided that he didn’t like anyone else having his owner’s attention, so he jumped and scratched at the strange intruder in her bed.</p><p>“YOU FILTHY FELINE!” the intruder yelled as he attempted to fight off the kneazle. Crookshanks sharpened his claws and dug them into his skin. Hermione tried her best to lift her pet from his face.</p><p>“Crooks, be gentle,” she attempted to soothe the feline, but Crookshanks growled more as he ferociously bit into one of the stranger’s fingers.</p><p>Once Hermione was able to dislodge the cat from the handsome stranger’s face, she saw a spell zoom past her and petrified the stranger. The brunette whipped her head around to see her seething roommate with her wand held high.</p><p>“Hermione,” Ginny growled angrily, “why is there a young, naked, and very much alive Lord Voldemort in your bed?” The redhead hyperventilated enough to induce herself to pass out.</p><p>When her roommate fell to the floor with a thud, Hermione felt her own heart fill with dread and sink to her toes.</p><p>How in the bloody hell did all this happen, and how, in Godric’s name, was she going to fix it?</p>
