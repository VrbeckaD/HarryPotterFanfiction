    <p>Interesting. Harry was suspended in the air as if a levitation spell had been used on him. <em>How odd</em>, he mused as he stared at his lifeless body that lay on the ground. He attempted to merge into his body but found he could not touch it and his hand went straight through. He crossed his arms and legs in midair, and for some reason he could not remember what had happened. He surveyed the scene where his body laid motionless; friends and enemies alike were dumbfounded by this life changing event.</p><p>Well, it doesn't look as though they are going to be much help in figuring this out. With difficulty, he might be able to remember what had happened before this...</p><p>--------</p><p>Frantically, he ran, panic rose in bile up his throat but he could not let it overtake him as they ran through the forest. He couldn't help but be worried about Hermione and Ron, he threw hexes and curses behind him as he dashed, narrowly dodging spell fire, hoping to Merlin that his friends were not far behind. Harry threw up protection spells and charms but he and his friends could not outrun and fight the hunters forever, Ron was captured and Hermione wasn't too far behind but hoping all was not lost, the young girl threw a hex at Harry to disfigure his face and then he was caught too.</p><p>The hunters couldn't tell if he was Harry Potter The-Boy-Who-Lived or if this some ruse set up by the elusive Order. </p><p>"What's your name boy?" the masked hunter gruff voice spat.</p><p>"Dudley" he managed but the masked man was unconvinced. Forcefully the snatchers dragged him by the arm as the others followed. Without a chance of escape they apparated to a large estate, and if Harry hadn't been so preoccupied he would have commented on how beautiful the grounds were.</p><p>They walked in knowing that they couldn't get away easily, and Harry grunted as he was shoved to his knees in front of Malfoy the younger, "Is this Potter?" Malfoy hesitated.</p><p>" I... I couldn't be sure" he would have rolled his eyes at the blond but refrained, knowing by doing so, would give him away. Why <strong>was</strong> Malfoy suddenly cross about giving him away? Lucius Malfoy pressured his son more but Draco refused to give the truth, it's not like they weren't exactly the best of friends...</p><p>Before he could speculate further, he and Ron were thrown into the downstairs dungeon with Luna and Griphook. But Hermione had been left behind, Harry crashed into to the gate as he realized but could do nothing to help as they heard her screams coming from above. He seethed with anger and plotted his revenge against Bellatrix, imagining every sort of dark curse he knew would inflict immeasurable pain and that was when Dobby appeared with a plan to get them all out.</p><p>Everyone had noticed they escaped when the chandelier fell between Bellatrix and Hermione, and everything became fair game. Hexes and curses flew through the air and hit one person and the next. He disarmed Malfoy, punched him in the face, and hexed him again for good measure, and charged towards Dobby.</p><p>But he was too far to reach them, too many obstacles in his path "Go! Dobby quickly get them to safety!" he turned away from the battle briefly heard two different voices in unison, one from Bellatrix and another from Hermione,</p><p>"Avada kedavra!"</p><p>"Harry!"</p><p>------</p><p>A green light, blackness and now aloft over his body...</p><p>"Am I... dead?" He whispered to himself. He began to panic as the dread set in and didn't even notice that time had stopped. His laughter startled himself, "The-Boy-Who-Lived! HA! What a bunch of crap! So, this is how I die, huh?"</p><p>"Only if you want it to be," a higher pitched voice cut in from behind him, he yelped and tried to jump to the side but only succeeded in floating upside down.</p><p>"Wha-?" he questioned the foreign presence as he observed her. She had long raven hair that was an unearthly black, seemed to be a void that absorbed all the color around it, her skin pale white, however her body appeared healthy. He saw that her clothes were the same black, ripped and ragged, attached was an over-sized hood that covered the entirety of her back. She was smaller than him, a child, it disturbed him greatly. Her eyes were bright purple but held no light, a contradiction... </p><p>"You're not dead... I can see that you're a bit confused right now." When he nodded she continued, "Do you know who I might be?"</p><p>"Not a clue" shaking his head as he re-crossed his arms and legs. </p><p>"My name is Mortie but I go by many names, The One, Reaper, Grim, and... Death." </p><p>A toothy grin spread eerily across her face as a scythe bigger than her own body appeared in her hands, she didn't use it and that was a relief but she sat on it like a witch would on a broom.</p><p>He rested forehead in his palm and sighed, "uh, okay? Weirder things have happened," he was starting to have a headache and as a spirit he was positive that should be impossible. "Okay... if I'm not dead, then what in the bloody hell happened?"</p><p>She brought her hand up to her chin and smirked deviously, "I could tell you... but I happen to be a very busy lady and I don't have all day." </p><p>"What? But I kind of need help?" he questioned</p><p>"Hmm, not my problem... " The entity shrugged and her gaze seem to peer directly into his soul. "What do I get in return?" she held out her hand as if expecting a gift.</p><p>He groped his spirit-like body for any items and found none. "I don't have anything" </p><p>She laughed, "You have more than you know, how about for now, you give me your soul?"</p><p>"What? No, absolutely not!" Mortie pouted and made grabbing motions with her hands. The newly appointed spirit tried to float away but ended up struggling in mid air, resembling a fish out of water. The entity shouted in unrestrained laughter, howling at Harry's antics. </p><p>"I like you! For a master you're not half bad, alright, how about I just get to ask you for a favor later, a boon. How does that sound? Not too bad right?"</p><p>A favor? "What kind of favor would Death want from someone like me?" Irritatingly she just shrugged and stretched her offered hand further. </p><p>He gave her an odd look and shrugged, "I don't see why not," what's worse than being dead? </p><p>She grinned as he grasped her hand. </p><p>He glanced back over to his friends briefly and was pretty sure the exchange with Death took a few minutes at least, yet everything seemed to remain at a standstill and he brought his attention back to Mortie whom was also looking at the scene as her hand glowed blue for a moment and Harry's physical body was surrounded by the same blue aura.</p><p>"Hey! What did you just do?" narrowing his eyes in suspicion.</p><p>She rolled her eyes, slightly annoyed. "I am protecting and preserving your body... You're welcome by the way"</p><p>He eyed her still suspicious , "Thanks.. I guess. Can you tell me what happened now?" He gestured towards the scene.</p><p>She smiled, "Of course!" she grabbed for his wrist and moved him closer to his physical body with her. "To put it in simple terms, you're in a magically induced coma."</p><p>"But wasn't I hit by the killing curse?"</p><p>"Says The-Boy-who-didn't-die-from-it-last-time." she deadpanned then took a deep breath, "Okay, looks like I am going to have to spell everything out for you. When someone like you who follows blindly without asking for all the facts just happens to become the Master of Death, this sort of thing is to be expected. " </p><p>"I do not follow blindly..." But he kind of did... <em>It's odd being a spirit</em>, he thought, it's like the life he once knew was distant and he was looking on as a third party, disconnected from it all. </p><p>"I am the Master of death? What does that even mean? And Magical induced coma doesn't just happen, there were events that led to it happening, that is what I want to know. "</p><p>Mortie chuckled, "Things will be revealed to you in time, but let me explain the Magical coma I've placed you in. First off, you can't die, being the master of death you are immortal.</p><p>Second, I had to put you in the coma state because killing curses still have effects on you and this is the result. Your body is alive still, your heart beats but your soul has been removed forcefully and cannot be replaced by yourself. However not all is lost for you, your soul mate can essentially, stuff it back in... sort of. And they are the only one who can actually see you in this state-"</p><p>"What about Ron and Hermione?" Harry interjected, feeling far less distant, his body seemed to twitch in reaction to his spiritual turmoil. "I can't leave them now!  This will crush them, can I speak with them? I can't just abandon them to search for my- my soul mate!"</p><p>Her grey purple eyes flashed a sickly yellow, "Do not interrupt me," shocked to silence, she continued.</p><p>"There are conditions! First, the love between you and your soulmate must be mutual, any attempts to falsify love will prove to be fatal. Second, you must seek out the Truth. And third, your soul mate will have to go through many trials in order to recover your soul into your body. No one with malicious intent can touch your body. But I must warn you that you'll stay in this state if your soul mate wants nothing to do with you, you're in their mercy, otherwise you'll remain this way for all eternity."</p><p>He thought he was taking this rather well... oh who was he kidding, he was freaking out. He was stuck. Stuck with Mortie, these conditions, it was too much to take in. The room began to spin, or was he actually spinning in mid air? Everything didn't make much sense to him, he was immortal and master of death. Not that it was helpful having that knowledge.</p><p>If he was here and not in his physical body, then he was considered useless and Voldemort had won the war. Wasn't Harry supposed to be the key to <strong>everything</strong>? He was startled to feel a warm hand on his shoulder and looked up to Mortie whom was now floating above him.</p><p>"There is no need to panic, your friends will be alright, Dobby will protect them and the others are too shocked to move. You know that Voldemort was the one who wanted to kill you. They know they are in deep trouble for taking that pleasure away from him." She consoled him.</p><p>He took a few deep breaths and looked upon frozen scene in front of him to give him the distraction that he needed to sort his thoughts and feelings towards this whole ordeal. He looked at the horrified expression on Bellatrix's face and chuckled to himself knowing she would get hers soon. But his heart ached at the crestfallen look of his comrades and felt more motivated then ever. He needed to get back to them, to make sure they are safe and to save them from this war.</p><p>"What now?" He asked but she frowned.</p><p>"You need to ask me better questions than that." She poked his forehead right on where the scar should be. "Here, maybe you should look at yourself in the mirror?" </p><p>Confused, but did as was told and took the offered mirror. "Woah... Why are my eyes red? Where is my scar?" Absently, he rubbed his forehead, "and how can I see myself in a mirror if I'm a spirit? Oh hey! I don't have to wear glasses... Wicked. "</p><p>She rolled her eyes fondly, "The reason your eyes are red is actually a question that you're going to have to figure out yourself, however, you should know that Fate doesn't like you and never will," She shrugged, "I also won't dignify your idiotic questions with an answer."</p><p>Harry sat there for a moment and considered her words, his life had been an absolute shit show, so it made sense that Fate didn't like him. So this whole ordeal counted on his soul mate? He was doomed, considering who he is at this point in the war, people would be more willing to turn away from him than help him.  Problem was though, he didn't even know who his soul mate was!</p><p>He turned towards Death and carefully inquired, "Who is my soul mate?" </p><p>She cringed, she knew that question would come up, but she hoping to avoid the question. Death hesitated. </p><p>"Mortie... Please tell me." He begged, afraid to actually know the answer since even Death herself hesitated.</p><p>The reaper gave him pitiful look, "Tom Riddle"</p><p>Harry blinked and howled out in laughter, after a few moments he was finally able to manage a response, "Ahhh I didn't know Death had a sense of humor" he needed a good laugh and somehow felt lighter, until he saw that she was completely serious.</p>
