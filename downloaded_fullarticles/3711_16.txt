</p>
<p>It was busy in the shop with several young wizards and witches hoping to buy something from the famous, or rather infamous, Weasley twins—known pranksters and close friends of The Boy Who Lived, Harry Potter. Despite the crowd that formed in the shop, Fred and George Weasley could still hear whenever the doorbell chimes. They apparated to the door, ready to welcome their new guest with charming smiles.<br/>
<br/>
“Welcome to-” Fred began.<br/>
<br/>
“-the Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes!” George completed.<br/>
<br/>
The young woman standing right in front of them startled at their sudden appearance and let out a yelp, turning bright pink from embarrassment. She tucked her loose strand of blonde hair behind her ear and let her emerald green eyes glance at both ginger-haired twin. Then, she smiled at them.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s been a while, hasn’t it?” She managed to squeeze the words out before she was enveloped in a tight hug. She laughed, wrapping her arms around the young man’s neck. 

“George! Come on now, let me down!” George didn’t listen as he twirled her in a circle, making her laugh even harder. When he stopped, she leaned in and gave the younger twin a peck on the cheek.  “I missed you too, Georgie.”<br/>
<br/>
George released her from his arms and turned to look at the ever-changing expressions on his twin’s face. He gave the young woman a light push forward towards his brother and gave Fred a pointed look.<br/>
<br/>
“Fred?” The young woman tried, a nervous smile on her face. “I’m sorry for dropping in unexpectedly, but-”<br/>
<br/>
Fred pulled her into a hug, burying his face in the crook of her neck. “Natasha,” he whispered.<br/>
<br/>
Natasha smiled, hugging him back with as much strength as she could. “I missed you, Fred.” She ran her fingers through his hair. It was an oddly familiar feeling and yet, it felt so foreign to her as well. Perhaps, it was far too long since she had the chance to be in his arms again. The former Gryffindor witch gestured at George to go ahead; she didn’t mind keeping Fred company.<br/>
<br/>
George grinned back, and was about to leave when another voice stopped him. Fred looked up, staring into Natasha’s eyes as he addressed his twin. “George, call Ron and Harry. I have business to attend to.” Before George had the chance to reply, Natasha let out a yelp as Fred picked her up in his arms and apparated away.<br/>
<br/>
George turned to look at a young 11-year-old boy and grinned. “Guess I’ll be calling for reinforcements, eh?”</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>	Natasha found herself at the familiar Black Lake and she laughed, reaching out to hit Fred for dragging her so suddenly. Fred just grinned in return. Natasha took a seat on the grassy ground and patted the spot next to hers. It didn’t take long before Fred joined her on the ground, wrapping an arm around her shoulders as she leaned her head on his shoulder. It was peaceful and quiet, reminding her of their schooling days when he wasn’t pranking anyone, and she wasn’t having her nose stuck in a book. George knew where to find them and it was always by the Black Lake.<br/>
<br/>
“Remember when Hagrid would find us here and he would try to get us to get back to the castle before it gets too dark?” Natasha asked, reminiscing about their time at Hogwarts.<br/>
<br/>
Fred smirked, “and then we’ll sneak into the kitchens for the food we missed during dinner.”<br/>
<br/>
“We did do that! Then George will have that weird knowing smile like we did something <em>scandalous<em>.” She winked at him, laughing as he winked back.</em></em><br/>
“Maybe we should have,” he teased.<br/>
<br/>
Natasha smiled. “I’d like that.” She placed her hand on his, interlocking their fingers together.<br/>
<br/>
“How are your legs?” Fred asked.<br/>
<br/>
It was clear to Natasha that he was trying to change the topic, but she decided that it wasn’t the right moment to push him. She looked down at her legs. “Well, I can walk again, if that’s what you’re asking about. Some days it hurts, on others it’s fine. It’s not something I can’t deal with.” It was an unusual sight to see Fred Weasley frowning. Then again, she remembered his reaction when she had temporarily lost her ability to walk. She placed her hand on his cheek, patting him affectionately. “It’s not your fault, Fred. It was <em>Rockwood’s<em> fault.”</em></em><br/>
<br/>
“If I hadn’t joked with Perce-”<br/>
<br/>
“-you would have noticed the <em>sudden<em> curse?” She shook her head. “Fred Weasley, you wouldn’t have noticed it because you were busy with that other Death Eater. I noticed it and I took action- no, no, let me finish- I don’t regret it. You know,” she turned pink again, “I always notice you and everything that happens to and for you.”</em></em><br/>
<br/>
He huffed, turning to look at a weirdly-shaped rock to avoid looking at her. Natasha could have sworn she saw a hint of pink on the ginger-haired freckled cheeks, but she knew better than to bring it up.<br/>
<br/>
“Though, I hate that you didn’t visit.”<br/>
<br/>
“Figured you hated me actually,” he mumbled, pulling her closer to him.<br/>
<br/>
She rolled her eyes, hitting him on the arm. “Like I could ever hate the famous Fred Weasley! Where else would I get a pygmy puff then?”<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, you wound me, Natasha. You wound me so.” Fred dramatically pretended like he was shot in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
Natasha laughed, shaking her head. There was a comfortable lull in their conversation as Natasha leaned against Fred’s chest, listening to his steady heartbeat. She knew that he knew what would have happened if she hadn’t pushed him away in that fight. She didn’t want to think about it. Besides, losing the ability to walk for a couple of months was something she would gladly go through again for him. After all, she did love him. She yawned, pulling herself from Fred. “Alright, I should get back to St. Mungos.” She gave him a pleading look. “A little help getting up?”<br/>
<br/>
Fred stood up and pulled her up. “Come on then, I’ll take you back there.” Fred held onto her as she staggered to stand upright. “Wouldn’t want you to trip or fall, now would we?”<br/>
<br/>
“Hold on.” She placed her hands on his shoulders. “I almost forget.”<br/>
<br/>
“What is-” But he was stopped from completing his sentence as she stood on her toes to kiss his lips. It didn’t take long for Fred to respond as he wrapped his arms around her. “That was nice,” Fred commented as they pulled apart.<br/>
<br/>
The sudden applause made the couple turn around to see their close friends and family grinning at them. George elbowed Ron. “Told you Natasha will kiss him first. Now pay up.”<br/>
<br/>
Fred walked over to them with Natasha hiding her face in her hands, groaning about embarrassing herself. “Georgie, where’s my share in that?”<br/>
<br/>
Molly pulled Natasha into a hug. “Oh my dear girl, what a pleasant surprise!”<br/>
<br/>
“You needed reinforcements for this?” Harry asked, rolling his eyes with a smile on his lips.<br/>
<br/>
Natasha and Fred shared a look as they held hands. “Yes.” They apparated away, leaving the Weasleys and their close friends behind. Harry Potter shook his head as the ginger-haired family started talking about having another party.</p>
