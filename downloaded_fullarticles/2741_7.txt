    <p>Newt Scamander was worried. One of his niffler had escaped, again, and he had been chasing it for ten minutes without managing to grab him. He saw him turn left, obviously following an old lady who was wearing a golden, shiny watch. As the woman stopped before a buiding and looked in her bag, the niffler tried to steal the watch, and Newt approched them slowly before jumping on her to get his niffler. The woman gave him an odd look, and he muttered an apology before getting up, shaking his head at the niffler who struggled to break free.</p>
<p>As he turned around, though, he found himself facing a wand. At the other hand of the wand, Grindelwald looked smug. Newt gave a quick look around him, but the street was now empty, and Grindelwald wouldn't hesitate to cast a spell on him if he tried to get his own wand. Havng no other choice, he let Grindelwald grab him by the collar, his wand now on his neck.</p>
<p>“Well, Mr Scamander, you should be more cautious. Now, I want you to give me what you stole from me at the rally.”</p>
<p>“I have no idea what you're talking about” Newt lied.</p>
<p>“Give. Me. My. Pendant.”</p>
<p>“I don't have it.”</p>
<p>“Where is it ?”</p>
<p>“With the one person you will never be able to take it from” Newt said in what he hoped sounded brave and convincing.</p>
<p>Grindelwald held him even tighter and hissed angrily “You gave it to Dumbledore, didn't you?”</p>
<p>Newt didn't answer. </p>
<p>“Well then, we're about to see just how much Dumbledore cares about you. But first, we're gonna get out of here, we wouldn't want aurors to find us, now would we ?”</p>
<p>Newt knew what that meant. Grindelwald was going to take him in one of his secret places and keep him there until Dumbledore agreed to exchange the blood pact for his life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A moment later, they had indeed disappeared and reappeared someplace else, but Newt almost tripped out of shock. He couldn't fathom why Grindelwald would want to come here. At Hogwarts, of all places. Although something felt off, but he couldn't quite tell what. </p>
<p>Grindelwald had let go of his arm, so he immediately took his wand in his hand, the other one still holding the Niffler. Grindelwald seemed to be at least as surprised as he was, which was weird considering it was him who had chosen to apparate there. A second later, though, he also had his wand pointing at Newt, and they stared at each other defiantly, for a little while, until they heard footsteps. Newt had nothing to worry about, but Grindelwald knew he would have a hard time leaving the school if people found out he was there. He knew this was Hogwarts, because he had seen pictures of it years ago. </p>
<p>He tried to go for the nearest door to hide and try to understand how on Earth they could be at Hogwarts, but he wasn't quick enough and some students had already seen him. The students, a girl and a boy, gave both Newt and Grindelwald a weird look and kept going, but just a few moments later they stopped and started arguing. Newt could only hear some words, like “eater” and “skeptical” but couldn' make sense of that. Anyway, the boy was back. He eyed the two men suspiciously, </p>
<p>" Excuse me" he said,"but I've never seen you here and, no offense, but you're way too old to be students. Who exactly are you ?"</p>
<p>His friend punched his arm and shook her head. She gave them a shy smile but her hand was quite visibly near her wand, ready to use it if needed.</p>
<p>“Sorry about him” she said, 'It's just that we don't have a lot of external visitors these days, as I'm sure you understand, with what's going on”</p>
<p>Newt had no idea of what was happening, but Grindelwald seemed offended that he had not been recognized, even though he should have been grateful, so he decided to speak up before he could. </p>
<p>" Hi, hum... I'm Newt and that's uh... Whatever. Do you... Do you know where I could find Dumbledore ?"</p>
<p>The girl squinted her eyes and seemed even more suspicious, while Grindelwald huffed, but didn't say anything.</p>
<p>"Why ?"</p>
<p>"Because I want to speak to him ?" Newt said, but it sounded more like a question, and he honestly didn't want to speak to that girl anymore. If he could find Dumbledore, and<br/>
drag Grindelwald with him, then everything would be alright. But part of him couldn't help but feel that something was wrong. He didn't recognize any of the paintings hanging on the walls around him, and the fact that students that obviously weren't in their first year wouldn't recognize Grindelwald seemed a bit odd, especially with the latest events. The rally in Paris had been all over the newspapers and in every conversation for over a month. </p>
<p>The girl opened her mouth to answer, but Grindelwald decided he was bored with her, and talked before she could. He gave her a warm smile and clasped his hand on Newt's shoulder, who tried very hard not to flinch.</p>
<p>“Well, see, this is Newt Scamander. Surely you must know he's a very good friend of Dumbledore.”</p>
<p>The boy shrugged. “Yeah but that guy's way too young to be Scamander.”</p>
<p>If Grindelwald was surprised at this, he didn't show. </p>
<p>“That's the thing. He woke up like that, and as you said, that's not normal. That's why we need to see Dumbledore, so he can fix him up.”</p>
<p>The students didn't seem entirely convinced, so Grindelwald yanked Newt's hand from under his vest, showing the Niffler.</p>
<p>“Always with some animal, this one! If you still have doubts” he said as he leaned casually against the wall, being as charismatic as he could “ask him anything about any creatures, he knows them all any way.” </p>
<p>The girl took that literally, and asked Newt a bunch of very specific questions about animals and about himself. Newt found it very unsettling that she knew so much, but tried not to show it. He  seemed to have convinced her, because the two students took them to a huge wooden door. </p>
<p>“That's his office, but he's often away lately, so I don't know if he's in it.”</p>
<p>They entered the room, and Newt knew it wasn't Dumbledore's office. There was a huge statue that served as a door, and it was quite obvious that you needed a password to get in. However, a phoenix hovered over Grindelwald, sat on his shoulder and the door suddenly opened. Newt casted a suspicious look to his enemy, but he soon realised that Grindelwald didn't know what had happened either.</p>
<p>Newt realised they were in the Headmaster's office, and he couldn't see why they would find Dumbledore there. But when he took a closer look, he realised that once again, things weren't as he remembered. The desk was filled with many weird, funny objects of every sizes, there were what seemed to be yellow candies everywhere in the room, and, most of all, there was a picture of the current headmaster framed on the wall. Newt was pretty sure Dumbledore had once told him that the pictures hanging in that office were those of previous headmasters, but surely that couldn't be right. </p>
<p>Grindelwald was looking around in disdain,  his wand still firmly in his hand, obiously prepared to duel at any time if needed, but he didn't seem to be as dumbfounded as Newt. But then, he probably  never had been in Hogwarts before. </p>
<p>Suddenly, an old man appeared in the chair. He had a long white beard, long white hair, wore glasses and he was looking at his darkened hand, before picking up a ring that was placed on the desk, obviously not having seen them yet.<br/>
In less than a second, Grindelwald was in his face, with his wand pointed at him. The old man looked up, and didn't express his surprise in any way but with a raise of his eyebrow. His eyes shifted from Grindelwald to Newt, and then back to Grindelwald. He then put  the ring he had been looking at down, and calmly said:</p>
<p>"Well, that was unexpected". </p>
<p>Grindelwald held his wand in an even more threatening way and asked "Who are you?"</p>
<p>The old man had what sounded like a small chuckle and got up, obviously unbothered by the threat. </p>
<p>"I think you'd find it hard to believe, Gellert" he said as he grabbed some paper and a quill. He quickly wrote something down, an owl came in by the window and left a second later with the note. </p>
<p>Being called by his first name had been offputting for Grindelwald, who took way longer than he usually would have to react and demand that the old man stopped writing. The owl was gone before he could do anything.</p>
<p>"What did you write?"</p>
<p>"You'll find out real soon". That being said, the old man sat back down on his chair, apparently waiting for something. He did't occur another word, no matter how much Grindelwald tried to make him. Newt was checking out every corner of the room, trying to understand what was going on. He read every name under the pictures, looked at every object in the room, stared quite openly at the old man. Then, the owl came back. The man had apparently grown bored of Grindelwald's wand being so close to him, and he made for his own wand, before changing his mind and slapping the Dark Lord's hand, so hard Grindelwald actually dropped his wand. But when he picked it up, he was looking at the man with a very odd look. To Newt, he seemed to be angry, worried, and to have had an illumination  all at once. He didn't try to do anything more, though, and that in itself was enough to make Newt wonder what on Earth he had understood. </p>
<p>The old man read the note, then ripped it off and looked at both of them again.</p>
<p>"Very strange indeed" he muttered, more to himself than to them. "I wonder how that is."</p>
<p>Newt frowned, trying to make sense of everything he saw and heard. He thought of all the details that didn't add up with what he knew of the school, of all the objects he had seen, all the names and dates under the pictures... And that tiny little object he had found on one of the shelves, between two books, and that had looked familiar but he hadn't been able to get why until now. He looked at Grindelwald, who had taken a step back and stared at the man as if he was some sort of ghost that had come to haunt him. And suddenly, it all made sense.</p>
<p>"Professor Dumbledore"</p>
<p>Newt wasn't the one who had spoken. Actually, none of them were. They all turned around to face the newcomer.</p>
