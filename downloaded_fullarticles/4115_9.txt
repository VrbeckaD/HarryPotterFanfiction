    <p>Remus Lupin takes it upon himself to send Lily an owl with the news.</p><p>
“Oh, honestly! I can't believe it!”
</p><p>
“What's wrong, dear?” asks Lily's mum, without taking her eyes off the 'Headgirl!' cake she's frosting. “Did they change their mind? It's not too late to repurpose this, you know – just as long as you tell me <i>before</i> I have to attempt the cursive g.”
</p><p>
Lily grins.
</p><p>
“Nothing, Mum. A friend from school just wrote to tell me who the new Headboy is.”
</p><p>
“And...?”
</p><p>
“And he's pretty annoying.”
</p><p>
Lily's mum lifts one of her thin eyebrows.
</p><p>
“Is it...?”
</p><p>
“No, it's not Severus,” says Lily, her mouth twisting slightly. “It's James Potter.”
</p><p>
“James? I've met him, right?”
</p><p>
“No, Mum, you most definitely have not met James Potter.”
</p><p>
“Pretty sure I have. You introduced us a couple of years ago at the train station.” 
</p><p>
“Mum, you're making stuff up <i>again</i>.”
</p><p>
“Well, you probably don't remember. We had a very pleasant chat, too – his mother was also there, lovely woman, I think she's from Cardiff? Something like that.”
</p><p>
Lily closes her eyes for a second.
</p><p>
“Mum, trust me, that was not James Potter. I know this for sure. It sounds like you're describing the Lupins, but I don't remember introdu–”
</p><p>
“See? I told you you had just forgotten about it.”
</p><p>
**
</p><p>
Lily gets so frustrated with her mum's cheerful refusal to admit that she's <i>wrong</i> about having met James Potter that she goes upstairs and digs out a picture of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. 
</p><p>
“See?” she says, pointing to James' grinning figure. “<i>This</i> is James Potter. You have never met him.”
</p><p>
Lily's mum peers serenely at the moving photograph.
</p><p>
“Well, he's very fit,” she comments, taking off her reading glasses. “Exactly what level of 'annoying' are we talking about?”
</p><p>
“Mum!” 
</p><p>
Lily's mum grins.
</p><p>
“Well, dear, he is. I'm sorry I have eyes.”
</p><p>
“Even if he were,” says Lily, casting around for a good way to sum up James Potter's character, “that would be beside the point. He's always showing off. It gets tiresome. And he's Quidditch captain, too, which only makes things worse – people fawning over him, the works. I really don't see why the Headmaster would appoint him, he wasn't even a Prefect!”
</p><p>
Lily's mum goes back to her frosting.
</p><p>
“Maybe the Headmaster just wanted to set a perfect background to showcase your brilliance, dear.”
</p><p>
Lily laughs.
</p><p>
“Yeah, Mum, maybe.”
</p><p>
**
</p><p>
“Say, isn't that James Potter over there?”
</p><p>
Lily's mum's voice carries, it always has, but the fact has never stopped her from asking Lily embarassing questions in public. Sirius Black turns around, scanning the crowd for whoever it was that mentioned his friend's name, his usual cocky grin on lazy display – until he sees Lily and her mum, at which point he gets such a perfectly stunned expression on his face that the whole thing would actually be quite comical, if not for the fact that Lily is busy being completely and utterly mortified.
</p><p>
“Mum!” she whispers, crossly. “Don't <i>do</i> that.”
</p><p>
“Do what, dear?”
</p><p>
“Ask about people when they can hear– oh, goodness, no, I can't believe it. Quick, Mum, let's go.”
</p><p>
“Why? They're coming over to say hello. Don't be rude, Lily.”
</p><p>
It's too late anyway. Sirius Black, whom Lily once caught stuffing a Dungbomb inside Slytherin's Sunday roast, takes Lily's mum's hand in his and kisses it, the very picture of a perfect gentleman. 
</p><p>
“Ma'am,” he says, in an exceedingly charming voice, James standing dumbly by his side. “Delighted to finally make your aquaintance. Lily, always a pleasure.”
</p><p>
Lily glares at him.
</p><p>
“Mum, this is Sirius Black, and that is James Potter. They're from school.”
</p><p>
“Nice to meet you,” says Lily's mum, graciously, her hand still in Sirius' pale one. “And you, James. I've heard so much about you!”
</p><p>
James merely stands and blinks, his face a delicate shade of crimson, until Sirius elbows him.
</p><p>
“Hi, Evans. Nice to meet you, Mrs Evans,” he says, finally, in a weird choked voice. A brief pause – and then, improbably, to Lily's complete astonishment, “I've heard a lot about you, too.” 
</p><p>
Lily's mum turns to face Lily, amused.
</p><p>
“Really, dear? Is that so?”
</p><p>
Lily desperately wills the earth to just open up and swallow her. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
“My sources tell me that both my boyfriend and my best friend are considering running away with your mother, Evans,” says Remus, later that afternoon, slinging his arm around Lily's shoulders. “Please be advised that I will have to put up a small token fight over Sirius, at least – but the sooner she sends for James, frankly, the better. This whole Headboy thing really has gone to his head. Congratulations, by the way!”
</p><p>
“Oh, don't joke about it, it was a terrible spectacle. They came over and made me introduce them to her, and then my mum went on and on and <i>on</i> about how I keep talking about James...”
</p><p>
Remus snorts.
</p><p>
“Wait, do you really?”
</p><p>
“I do <i>not</i>!” says Lily, incensed. “The only reason she even knew he exists is that I was complaing about him being made Headboy, and I showed her a picture.”
</p><p>
“You keep pictures of James around the house? That's interesting.”
</p><p>
Lily shoves him.
</p><p>
“It was a picture of the whole Quidditch team, you twit.”
</p><p>
Remus shakes his head.
</p><p>
“Excuses, excuses...” he says, grinning. “Poor James, he's already shaken to his core by the fact that you were actually civil to him this morning – if I tell him that you keep <i>a picture</i> of him, he'll just go ahead and self-combust.”
</p><p>
Lily rolls her eyes.
</p><p>
“And to think that I used to think that you were the <i>least</i> annoying of the bunch.”
</p><p>
**
</p><p>
“So, Evans, about this morning...” says James, the moment they're out of the Headmaster office. “I'm sorry if we put you in an awkward situation. Sirius insisted that he had heard your mum talk about me, but from the look of you you didn't really want us to come over, did you? And then my brain completely shut off and I started spouting nonsense...”
</p><p>
He sounds very earnest. Lily realizes suddenly that this is probably the first time he has ever addressed her without Sirius standing by his side. 
</p><p>
“It's fine,” she says, vaguely endeared. “I know it wasn't you idea, and my mum is always thrilled about meeting my friends from school – she was <i>extremely</i> impressed with Sirius' manners, you can tell him that.”
</p><p>
“Your <i>friends</i>?”
</p><p>
“Well, that's what you are in my mum's head, at least, after your little stunt,” says Lily, but she gives James a little smile. James smiles back. He really is quite fit, Lily's mum wasn't wrong about that. Not that it matters.
</p><p>
“Fair enough,” says James, fiddling with his Headboy badge. “And maybe now that we have to spend so much time together we could, you know, become friends for real. If you want to.”
</p><p>
Lily smiles again. The idea does appeal to her, she finds, strangely enough.
</p><p>
“Maybe,” she agrees, over her shoulder, as she sets off to go find Alice. “Goodnight, Potter. See you tomorrow!”</p>
