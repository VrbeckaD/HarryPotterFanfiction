    <p>Harry had sequestered himself in his and Tom’s bedroom, having banished Tom to the guest quarters. Now, he was with Draco, plotting revenge against Tom.</p><p> </p><p>Tom had banned Harry from leaving the manor, declaring ‘you are too precious to lose. I cannot allow you to go out and about and risk your life and the life of our child!’</p><p> </p><p>In Harry’s mind, that meant Tom didn’t trust Harry with their baby - the baby he was carrying - and that was a problem.</p><p> </p><p>Draco had come in to help him devise a most evil plot.</p><p> </p><p>“No sex was a very good idea,” Draco said. “But you’ve got to make it worse. Make him want you more every day.”</p><p> </p><p>“How?” frowned Harry, looking at himself in the mirror. “I’m fat!”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not fat, Harry. You’re pregnant and that’s a beautiful thing and if he can’t see that he’s an idiot.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry giggled.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” asked Draco.</p><p> </p><p>“You called him an idiot!”</p><p> </p><p>Draco paled. “Oh. Don’t tell him, he’ll kill me!”</p><p> </p><p>“I won’t!” Harry was still giggling.</p><p> </p><p>“Down to business. He finds you sexy. Make yourself sexier, he’ll be begging your forgiveness. Then, you can negotiate.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right. Ideas?”</p><p> </p><p>An evil glint appeared in Draco’s eyes. “A bathrobe,” he whispered.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” </p><p> </p><p>“A bathrobe.” Draco repeated. “Pink. Fluffy. Show off your figure.”</p><p> </p><p>“I see,” said Harry.</p><p> </p><p>Draco conjured one such robe - it was soft and pink, and looked too big for Harry, but when he put it on he realized he needed the extra size to cover his nether regions.</p><p> </p><p>The robe stretched around Harry’s middle, accentuating his bump and pert arse, and was loose below that. It barely covered a quarter of his thighs, and the low v-neck descended to where his midriff bulged.</p><p> </p><p>“Perfect,” breathed Draco.</p><p> </p><p>Harry agreed when he looked in the mirror. “I really do see!”</p><p> </p><p>“Now, there’s a meeting in ten minutes, so if you go before he calls everyone… he’ll have to run into you…”</p><p> </p><p>Harry smirked, and hurried to the large room where Tom held his meetings, heaving himself onto Tom’s elegant throne, and tossing his legs over one of the armrests. Then, he waited, hands folded behind his head.</p><p> </p><p>The sound of footsteps alerted him to Tom’s imminent presence. Tom had applied his parsel-glamour so he looked like he had when he’d first emerged from the cauldron in Harry’s fourth year. </p><p> </p><p>The sudden intake of breath told him that Tom had noticed Harry’s new attire. </p><p> </p><p>“H-Harry,” said Tom.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello, dear,” said Harry, lazily stretching out a leg. The bathrobe slipped, becoming more indecent than it had been before.</p><p> </p><p>“Harry - I’m summoning my Death Eaters, you must leave,” said Tom stiffly, shifting his robes.</p><p> </p><p>Harry stifled a laugh, knowing exactly what Tom was hiding. “Sure,” he said, and slipped off the throne, brushing past Tom with his hips swaying. </p><p> </p><p>………………….</p><p> </p><p>“He couldn’t focus at all!” Draco said later. “He denied it but it was obvious!”</p>
