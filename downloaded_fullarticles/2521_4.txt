    <p>Chapter one- A chance meeting</p><p>Amy was just an ordinary muggle. Well, an ordinary girl, because she wasn’t even aware of the fact she was a muggle, that there even was such thing as a muggle (or a non-muggle). In some ways she felt she wasn’t “normal”- she didn’t always fit in and thought she did things differently to everyone else- but to an outsider, she was the depiction of normality. That though, was before she discovered a whole other world of “normality”, a whole other world of living, right under her nose.</p><p>It was a cold January day as Amy browsed the shelves in the London department store. It was already starting to get dark outside (not helped by the overcast grey sky blocking out most of what remained of the day’s sunlight) and she knew that soon she’d better face the bitter chill of the oncoming evening and make her way back to the train station. She hadn’t bought much, being on a student budget, but had decided to take the opportunity to catch the train down into London as she didn’t have any lectures that day and her work load was less than usual due to having just finished her post-Christmas exams. She was in her fifth year of a medical degree and had been quite looking forwards to having a relaxing day out. She’d had anything but that. The shops had been chaos, her feet were sore and her thighs were hurting as she had ended up pulling a muscle in them at her kickboxing class the previous day. She looked around for a sign directing her to the toilet- she was desperate for a wee. Eventually she located a floor plan. The toilets were on the fifth floor and she was on the first. Typical. She went over to wait for a lift.  Usually she avoided using lifts wherever possible. She hated them. She partly blamed this on the fact she had two brothers. At first this seems a strange explanation, but makes more sense when you consider that, when you grow up with two boys, you end up watching a lot of TV shows aimed at boys. These generally feature hero types- Thunderbirds, Fireman Sam and the like- and hero types need things to be heroic and save people from. Sometimes these are fires where the people requiring rescuing have managed to get stuck in a lift (obviously oblivious to the fact that you shouldn’t use a lift in the case of a fire) and these episodes had had a profound effect on Amy’s trust of lifts. On this day however, she was willing to put her dislike aside as she did not want to walk up all those stairs to get to the loo. A lift arrived and she stepped in, closely followed by a man. He pressed the button for floor five, the doors closed and they started to ascend. </p><p>Amy started to inspect her fellow lift occupant. He was quite tall, around her age (maybe a little older) and had spiky ginger hair sticking out of the front of a black woolly hat, placed wonkily on his head. He was dressed in a pair of slightly faded jeans and a black jacket which was left unzipped, revealing a green knitted jumper with a “G” on in red (probably a Christmas jumper). Strung on his arms were a couple of bags of shopping, with what looked like a toy magic set protruding from the top of one of them. He turned and smiled at her. It was a kind smile, slightly cheeky looking, but there was something in his face that made him look worn, tired, older than his years. Amy smiled shyly back, trying to think of something to say to start a conversation. </p><p>Just as she plucked up the courage to start with a “hi”, the whole lift shook. She screwed her eyes shut, just managing to keep a squeal of terror from escaping her mouth. The lift stopped with a jerk, causing her to fall sideways but the guy’s gentle grip caught her arms and steadied her. Amy slowly opened her eyes and found herself gazing into his face, looking down on her with a look of caring but also reasonable calm.<br/>“You OK?” he asked her, slowly letting go of her arms now that the lift was stationary.<br/>“Yeah” she muttered back. “Thanks”. <br/>“No problem” he replied, smiling the same cheeky smile that he did before, “I’m George by the way”. <br/>“I’m Amy”<br/>“Well, it’s nice to meet you Amy”<br/>“You too” Amy smiled, gaining in confidence and starting to get over the shock of the lift stopping. They started to discuss what they should do next. “Any clue what’s up with it?” she asked George, who was jabbing at all the buttons for the different floors. It didn’t seem to be making any difference.<br/>“Nope,” he replied “I’ve never been any good with mug… with technology.” He tried out the alarm button at the bottom of the controls but received no reply. “Guess we’ll just have to wait for someone to come and fix it.” He sat himself down on the floor. Amy looked round warily before doing the same.<br/>“I hope they come soon”<br/>“Why?” asked George, “Is there somewhere you need to be?”<br/>“Not really but… well I’m not the greatest fan of lifts and I kind of really need a wee”<br/>“Awks” he replied. “Well I guess there’s not much we can do. We’ll just have to wait. I’m sure they won’t be long. They’ll have systems to tell them that the lift has got stuck.”<br/>“Hopefully, yeah” said Amy, relaxing slightly.<br/>“What brings you here anyway?”<br/>Amy told him about having come down from uni. They chatted about their day. Amy peered at George’s shopping bags, trying to guess about his life.  <br/>“That for… for a relative?” Amy asked, pointing at the magic set which was now practically falling out of its bag.<br/>“Erm… no. It’s for… market research. I own a… joke shop you see.” He tried to stuff the magic set bag down into the carrier bag. In doing so, he tore the side of the bag slightly and a mascara rolled out onto the floor.<br/>“Oh” sighed Amy, looking disappointed “Is that for your girlfriend?” George quickly grabbed the mascara and shoved it back in the bag.<br/>“No!” he exclaimed “No, it’s for market research again. I’m working on… items disguised as other items so I’ve bought a few things to use for ideas. I don’t have a girlfriend. Not at the minute…” He saw Amy smile at this and they both turned away, blushing.<br/>“So…” Amy started after a short, awkward silence “Where abouts is this joke shop of yours then?”<br/>“It’s down a little back street just out of the centre” answered George, looking slightly awkward and attempting to be vague.<br/>“Family business?”<br/>“Erm… well I set it up with my twin brother” he mumbled quietly, avoiding her gaze.<br/>“You have a twin? Cool!” she enquired excitedly then stopped suddenly when seeing the look on his face.<br/>“Had a twin. Fred. He… he died” <br/>“Oh. I’m so sorry. What happened to him?”<br/>“He was killed in… in an explosion. Five years ago this May”<br/>“An explosion?”<br/>“Yeah. I’m sorry but I’d rather not talk about it”<br/>“Yeah of course. I’m sorry”<br/>“It’s ok. It’s just that I really miss him. He was always there and it still seems weird being on my own.”</p><p>Neither of the two said anything for a while. George suddenly stuck his hand into his pocket.<br/>“Sorry for dampening the mood.” He held out a handful of brightly coloured sweets. “Want one?”<br/>“Thanks” replied Amy, taking a yellow one. She was just starting to unwrap it when George shouted “Wait!”<br/>“What is it?” she asked, startled.<br/>“Erm… you don’t want that one, it… those ones taste funny. Here, have one of these” he said, taking the yellow one back and passing her an orange one.<br/>“Thanks…” Amy replied, sounding unsure now. She watched him unwrap his chosen blue sweet and put it in his mouth before doing the same with hers. It tasted nice, but like nothing she’d tasted before. Definitely not of orange.<br/>They both sat there on the floor of the lift, sucking at their sweets. Amy was trying to think of something else to say when her sweet slipped down into her throat and she started choking. George was quick to start patting her on the back and soon enough the sweet shot back up into her mouth.<br/>“You OK?”<br/>“Yeah” panted Amy, trying to get her breath back.  She cringed to herself. Here she was, sat with a good-looking guy and already she had managed to choke on a sweet and upset him by asking about his dead twin. Could it be possible to embarrass herself further? She looked at the floor, trying to hide her blushing and carefully sucked at her sweet, trying to prevent a repeat incident. George saw her blush and giggled quietly to himself, absent-mindedly brushing his ginger hair backwards. Amy looked up at the sound of his giggling and suddenly sat motionless in shock. He had slightly displaced his hat, revealing a gap where his left ear should be.<br/>“What… what happened to your ear?” she gasped<br/>“Oh yeah…” he started, realising what it was that had startled her. “I’d forgotten about that…”<br/>“Forgotten?” Amy exclaimed<br/>“Yeah, well you know what they say, ear today, gone tomorrow” he joked, cracking her a cheeky smile. Amy said nothing at first, too shocked to laugh at his pun.<br/>“What… what happened to it?” she eventually managed to stutter.<br/>“It’s kind of a long story…” Amy waited for him to finish his sentence but as the seconds passed, gathered he wasn’t going to and changed the angle of her questions.<br/>“Well, didn’t you get offered a prosthetic one?”<br/>“Prosthetic?”<br/>“Yeah, you know, like a plastic one?”<br/>“I don’t think there’s much they can do. Besides, I’ve got quite used to it now. It’d seem weird having two ears again after five years of only having one.”<br/>“Was it…” Amy began, starting to ask him whether it was connected to Fred’s death but then thinking better of it.</p><p>Once again they both sat in silence, sucking at the remains of their sweets. George looked at his watch.<br/>“What time does this shop close?” he asked.<br/>“5:30pm I think. Why?”<br/>“Because it’s past twenty-to-six and I haven’t heard any sound of anyone trying to sort the lift yet.” Amy had almost forgotten about the lift and started to panic all over again.<br/>“What happens if no one knows we’re here? They’ll be packing up now and might all be leaving soon!”<br/>“Surely someone will have noticed the lift isn’t working. Don’t worry, we’ll be fine.” Amy didn’t look too confident about that. Suddenly her face lit up.<br/>“I know” she exclaimed, rooting through her bag, “We’ll ring for help. Like the police or something. They’ll help us!” Her face fell as she pulled her phone from her bag and started pressing buttons on it. “Oh no! I’m out of battery again! I knew I should have charged it before I left!” She looked at George. “What about your phone?”<br/>“I err… I left it at home” George stammered, unwilling to point out the fact that truthfully, he didn’t own a mobile phone. <br/>“Great. We’re screwed then. What are we going to do?”<br/>“I’ll try the alarm button again” suggested George. “Hello. Anyone there?”  Still no reply.<br/>They both sat in silent despair. Amy slowly began to cry and George wrapped his arm round her. <br/>“It’ll be OK. I’ll get us out of here, I promise.” She huddled closer to him as her tears continued to drip down her cheeks.</p><p>All of a sudden the lights in the lift went out, leaving the pair just illuminated by the pale glow from the lift buttons. George felt Amy tense in his arm.<br/>“Don’t worry, I think I’ve got a torch around here somewhere”. He unwrapped his arm from around her in order to search through the pockets on the inside on his jacket. “Got it!” he exclaimed, pulling out a set of keys with a little torch attached. In doing so he also displaced a thin stick-like object from his pocket.<br/>“What’s that?” Amy inquired, picking it up and starting to examine it in the dim light before George had had a chance to pick it up. “It’s a magic wand!” The look of horror and surprise on George’s face was hidden by the dark. “Is it a toy from your shop?” <br/>“Erm… yes. Yes it is” George instantly retorted, visibly relaxing after that close call. He gently took it off her and put it away before turning on his little torch and shining it around. Amy watched in silence for a few minutes as he examined the lift, not wanting to break the chain of thought he appeared to be quite deep in.<br/>“Well I guess no one’s coming to rescue us then,” he stated “so we’d better start making our own way out.” With that, he stood up and started inspecting the roof tiles. “I reckon we could probably push them up and climb out onto the top of the lift. From there, hopefully they’ll be a ladder for us to climb up the lift shaft to a door so we can get out.” He helped Amy to her feet then tried to push one of the roof tiles to one side. With a bit of difficulty, he managed it and shone the torch up through the gap. <br/>“Look, like I said, a ladder. Do you want to go first or would you rather I did?” he asked a nervous looking Amy.<br/>“Erm… you go first…” she murmured warily. George jumped up and started to pull himself through the gap, assisted by Amy and climbed out onto the top of the lift. He lent back down through the hole.<br/>“Pass me the stuff up.” Amy passed his shopping up into his reaching arms, followed by her stuff. With a bit of difficulty, he then succeeded to pull her up through the gap and replaced the roof tile. They sat together, catching their breath for a moment.<br/>“Stay here” George instructed Amy. “I’ll climb up and see if I can get those doors open.” He pointed with the torch to some metal doors near the top of the shaft then passed her the torch so she could light the way for him. He clambered up the ladder then peered around, calculating the best way to reach the doors on the other side of the lift shaft. He edged his way onto a beam which ran round the edge of the shaft and slowly crept round it as Amy screwed her eyes closed, too scared to watch. When he got round to the doors, he squeezed his fingers into the gap between them and slowly prised them open, stepping out onto the shop floor.<br/>“Right,” he called down to Amy “climb up the ladder and I’ll help you across then I’ll go back down to get our stuff”. Amy was reluctant to climb up the ladder but was now beyond desperate to use the loo so plucked up the courage and began to climb, putting the torch in her mouth to leave both her hands free to grip the ladder. She was almost opposite the doors when the torch fell from her mouth. She leant over to try and catch it and in doing so lost her footing and began to fall. She screamed as she came closer and closer to the lift below then, when she was just inches from hitting it, gravity appeared to reverse and she was flying upwards. She reached the top of the lift shaft (having just avoided all the lift cables) and hung upside down, seemingly attached to the surface by her right foot. She’d stopped screaming now, too stunned to even make a sound. She slowly opened her eyes (she couldn’t even remember closing them, but must have done at some point) and looked down to see George stood in the opened doorway, pointing the wand at her and looking a mixture of shocked, nervous, suspensive and a whole spectrum of other emotions encapsulated. Neither of them uttered a word or moved a muscle. Slowly she felt dampness dripping downwards towards her head and realised to her horror that she must have wet herself.<br/>“What… what… what…” was all she managed to say. </p><p>George managed to come to himself and lowered the wand for a moment. <br/>“Don’t worry, I’ll get you down” he shouted. He muttered a few words and she began to rotate right way up and hover down, guided by his wand. He reached out his other hand, pulled her through the doorway and sat her down next to him. <br/>“How… how did you do that?” Amy managed to gasp. George said nothing for a few moments.<br/>“I’d best tell you the truth. I’m a wizard. I can do magic. Really magic, not just muggle party tricks magic like those toys.” He pointed down in the direction of their shopping, now in darkness since the torch had gone out when it fell.<br/>“That’s… that’s… that’s a real wand?” Amy stuttered<br/>“Yes and my shop isn’t just an ordinary muggle joke shop, it’s a magic joke shop, selling tricks and novelty items with spells put on them. All kinds of magic things. That’s why I couldn’t tell you where it was, so you wouldn’t go.”<br/>“Oh” blinked Amy, trying to take it all in.<br/>“And that’s why I took back the yellow sweet. It was one of the ones from the shop, a Yellow Yeller to be precise.”<br/>“Was… was what happened to your ear magic related… was that why you couldn’t tell me?” Amy inquired, regaining her voice slightly.<br/>“Yes.” Amy waited for him to continue but again he didn’t<br/>“And… and… Fred?” she asked timidly, not sure whether to bring it up again. This time George said nothing at all, just nodded. They both sat, engulfed in their own thoughts.</p><p>"Well, we'd better be getting out of here then" George said abruptly, standing up and holding out his hand to help Amy to her feet.<br/>“But how?” Amy asked. “If we step any further out of the doorway then we’ll probably set the alarms off and it’ll be chaos!”<br/>“We don’t have to. Technically I could have got us out of here ages ago but didn’t because it would involve using magic and we’re not allowed to use magic in front of muggles.”<br/>“Muggles?”<br/>“Non-magic people; people who aren’t wizards”<br/>“Like me?”<br/>“Yeah.”<br/>Amy thought about this for a while. “Muggle”. Did she like the sound of being referred to as a “muggle”? Suddenly another thought came into her head.<br/>“You used magic in front of me. Will you get in trouble?”<br/>“Hopefully not.  I don’t know. I’ve never really been one for sticking to the rules anyway.” George smiled as he said this, thinking about old memories of school pranks, but the smile dropped slightly as he remembered his partner in crime. He shook the thoughts away, returning to the present.<br/>“Accio shopping!” he shouted, pointing his wand down the lift shaft. Both George and Amy’s shopping came flying up, almost bowling Amy over as she tried to catch it. George helped her set it all down on the ground and examined it, trying to determine what else there was still down the shaft.<br/>“Accio handbag! Accio keys!” This time Amy was slightly more prepared to catch the stuff. “Anything else?” George asked her.<br/>“Think that’s everything” she gasped, still getting over the shock of the flying bags.<br/>“Right, where do you live?” Amy robotically told him the address of her student flat, still too shocked and confused to question why he had asked. George picked up his shopping and Amy did the same with hers, not entirely sure what was going on. George grabbed hold of her hand. Suddenly everything seemed to spin. Amy felt like she was being squeezed into nothingness. She screwed her eyes closed and clung onto his hand like her life depended on it. </p><p>To be continued...</p>
