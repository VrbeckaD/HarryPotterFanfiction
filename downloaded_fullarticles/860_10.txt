    <p>The war left Europe in ruins.</p><p>It tore a gash across the continent: from the tyrant waves of the Atlantic and the English Channel to the merchant seas of the Mediterranean; from the rubblized streets of London to the cold beaches of Dunkerque; from the rattled coastline of Normandy — the late chancellor’s “Atlantic Wall” — through Paris, to the silent barricades of the Maginot Line; from the hell-burned city of Dresden to the ghostly, ruined villages that haunt Warsaw; from the dead shores of Sicily, to the wasted coast of Greece. The fracture spread all the way from Prague to Sarajevo and Kosovo. A wound in the earth was opened in the center of Berlin, sucking almost everything in and leaving nothing but dust and rubble. Leaving bodies in the streets, and buildings burned down, and in the heart of the fracture, the cracked and war-torn remains of the Reichstag.</p><p>It was here that the world was split in half. On the west side of the border, just meters of the Reichstag, rested the pyramidion balance of justice and liberty. To the east lurked untold horrors — a scourge burned from the frozen city of Stalingrad to the raped city’s capitol. Everything was spoiled. In the same way the Wehrmacht ravaged Europe with their brutal occupations and exterminations, the Soviets pillaged every square inch of Berlin: its townhouses, its schools, its stores, its pride — what sorrowful little remained of German pride — and its girls.</p><p>They starved.</p><p>The Soviets would do unto Berlin what it had dealt the Ukraine in 1932, who gave birth to a word that has no English counterpart, a word that refers to universal, artificial suffering — a word that means, simply, <em> to kill by starvation </em>. Perhaps the Germans considered it retributive justice for the transgressions of the Nazi Empire, but they would have been wrong: this was just another day for the Soviet Union. After all, war crimes make up for an integral tenet of the Soviet identity.</p><p>The Western Allies had two options: They could sit by and watch Berlin fall not once but twice to the Soviets, or they could do something.</p><p>George Marshall elected to act. The American Secretary of State put forward a plan that forever changed the world order. It was a mission to help collaboratively redevelop Europe — rebuild the economies, rebuild the countries, and re-establish the peoples’ sovereignty. It was the first step forward from a world gone to Hell. It was the first chance for everyone, together, to pick up the pieces.</p><p>Naturally, the Soviets did not go along with the European Recovery Program, later known as the Marshall Plan. They refused to take part in it and forbade their eastern European satellites to receive aid of any sort.</p><p>There was a dilemma to be had. Berlin was soon to be split right down the middle. The Soviets had claimed territory all across Germany, and where that line ended was just meters away from the Reichstag, and only ten years away from being enforced by a wall that ran the length of the country and sealed half its population to their fates under Soviet control. The message was clear: <em> You will not touch Berlin </em>. Yet at the same time, the Western Allies had claimed the western states of Germany and many parts of Berlin were under western control.</p><p>The Soviet Union, it seemed, was in dire need of an enemy; the Western European countries, similarly, were in dire need of allies — to form a shield against the iron curtain.</p><p>Five representatives met in Brussels to sign a treaty. An expansion of the Treaty of Dunkirk, it bound Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg to a military doctrine of collective defense — the first of many military alliances of the coming Cold War. In the event of Eastern European aggression — Soviet aggression — should any one of those countries see an invasion, they would all declare war to defend their allies. This was a force multiplier. It made these countries safer; it deterred the Soviets from encroaching on their territories in the same way the Nazis did.</p><p>The United Nations charter was a step in the right direction for the whole world, but it came at a cost to the West. The Soviet Union held a permanent seat on the Security Council, which meant veto power. It was a conflict of interest. There needed to be an organization associated with the U.N. but segregated from the conflicting interests of the Soviet Union. A new alliance was needed to protect the interests of all whom the Soviets threatened.</p><p>On April 4th, 1949, the wheels of history turned again. This time the cogs twisted and slaved away within the Oval Office. It was chilly and dull, yet nerves were as tense as tightrope. The men were about to make history right then and there, in the beating heart of American hegemony, overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue. In the office of President Truman, twelve men representing twenty-nine countries came to sign the Washington Treaty, better known as the North Atlantic Treaty. It had several articles, but the most important doctrine was detailed in Article 5:</p><p>Collective Defense. It was as clear and as brazen as the white compass rose embroidered on the flag, with the Navy-blue backdrop contrasting it.</p><p>War with any NATO-aligned country meant war with all NATO-aligned countries. Should the Soviets have challenged any one nation in a direct conflict, they would have to challenge them all — and until the Warsaw Pact, this proved very effective at deterring them from trying much of anything. The stage was set for the Cold War. The West had the advantage.</p><p>Ultimately, war never broke out between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The ironic threat of nuclear devastation protected the world from its own destruction. Instead, the United States simply outcompeted the USSR. They out-spent them and wasted the Soviet economy as it tried to keep up.</p><p>The 1990s saw the tail end of the Cold War with the decline and eventual dissolution of the USSR and, with it, the Warsaw Pact. NATO had no more enemies, no more foes to stand up to; no more stated reason to exist. The Western world entered a new era of the Long Peace, enjoying the quiet “after,” a long stride for a better tomorrow.</p><p>The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was now the sole dominant power of a unipolar world; until the turn of the century, it enjoyed a quiet and comfortable sovereignty. It didn’t take long for that to come to an end, too. A new conflict was waiting on the edge of the 90s, just looming under the ground that humanity stood on. It was an ancient hatred, left underground for millennia, only now festering to the top.</p><p> </p><p align="center">——</p><p> </p><p>August 14, 1992</p><p>RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire</p><p>14:31</p><p> </p><p>It was like any other afternoon in the ISTAR Operation Evaluation Center. The radar picked up very little out of the ordinary and the chatter was quiet. The skies were clear and watercolor-blue. No patrols were scheduled outbound from Waddington’s runways for two hours. There was no word from Heathrow’s controllers and very little communications from Brize Norton, Coningsby, and Marham. Then, suddenly, the radar picked up an anomalous signal.</p><p>Wing Commander Atkinson turned his head as Pilot Officer Greene spoke up from the radar terminal. “Sir, I’ve got something on my scopes.”</p><p>“What is it?” Atkinson said.</p><p>“New radar contact, bearing two-three-zero. Coming out of Surrey. Heading north, bearing ten.”</p><p>“Surrey?” Atkinson asked. “There’s no airport there. What’s its speed? Altitude?”</p><p>“Four hundred knots,” Greene said. “Altitude is… twelve thousand feet.”</p><p>Atkinson got up and walked over to the console, peeking over Greene’s shoulder. “That can’t be right,” he whispered. The radar screen was cluttered, covered in the usual air traffic on a usual Wednesday over England: mostly civilian, some RAF, some USAF out of Alconbury. Greene pointed to one crossing directly north towards the Scottish border, some six hundred miles southwest of the Waddington radar array. “Why are there no markings on it?”</p><p>“No squawk,” Greene said. “It doesn’t appear to have a transponder. At least, not one that responds to our code.”</p><p>“Mr. Frey,” Atkinson said slowly, “contact Heathrow and Alconbury. See if they’re picking up the same thing we are.”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Frey said and plugged in a new channel to his board. After a series of one-sided conversations, he put down his headset and turned to Atkinson. “They’ve got it, but Heathrow hasn’t launched any planes on that route and Alconbury is about to go to REDCON Three.”</p><p>“We should, too,” Atkinson said. “Contact Trimingham. Report what we found and request a QRA for intercept.”</p><p>The second-in-command, Squadron Leader Wilkesboro, looked up from the documents scattered around the main table. He stroked his chin thoughtfully. “They might not make it in time,” he said.</p><p>“I think you’re right,” Atkinson said. “If the contact is a stealth fighter, it could disappear from our scopes at any time. Send up the AWACS. We need more eyes localized over that route.”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Wilkesboro said. He hesitated, though. Atkinson knew that look.</p><p>“... What is it?”</p><p>“We’ve got Harriers,” Wilkesboro said. “I’ve seen the boys get ready in ten minutes.”</p><p>“They’d be going up with no support,” Atkinson said.</p><p>“Neither would the alert fighters from Trimingham,” Wilkesboro said. “But ours will get there sooner.”</p><p>Atkinson sighed, thinking about it for a moment. He didn’t want to admit that Wilkesboro was right. He didn’t want to put his fighters at risk, but if this was a prelude to an attack… “Squadron up,” he finally said. “Number Thirteen. Intercept the contact.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">——</p><p> </p><p>RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire</p><p>14:45</p><p> </p><p>Two AV-8Bs from the No. 13 Squadron launched from Runway 02, heading north. Pilot Officer John “Cheese” Raleigh retracted the landing gear as the tower removed No. 13’s altitude restrictions.</p><p>Mimic’s Harrier made it to Raleigh’s starboard side, flying in formation with him.</p><p>“Whiskey Romeo, this is Alpha Foxtrot Echo One-Eight-Niner. Requesting tasking, over,” Raleigh said. Some chatter and feedback played through before he got a response.</p><p>“This is Whiskey Romeo, Alpha Foxtrot Echo One-Eight-Niner, tasking as follows. You are now under my control. Head to bearing three-five-zero, speed six-zero-zero, angels two zero. Intercept in approximately ten minutes, over.”</p><p>“Roger,” Raleigh said. “Three-five-zero, six-zero-zero, angels two zero. Thank you, Control.”</p><p>“Be advised,” the combat controller said. “Two Eagles from Alconbury are already headed there. The squadron name is ‘Gorgon.’” The controller gave him the frequency that the Americans were using. “They’re going to make it two minutes earlier than you, over.”</p><p>“And the QRA?” Raleigh asked.</p><p>“Three Tornados. ‘November Five-Seven.’ They’ll make the intercept in eighteen minutes.”</p><p>“Roger,” Raleigh said. “We’ll fill them in.”</p><p>“ROE is strict; do not engage until fired upon,” the controller said. “Try to get them to follow you and land at Waddington. Out.”</p><p>On the No. 13 channel, Mimic said, “They just might miss the show.”</p><p>Raleigh corrected his course and headed for the intercept point. Mimic followed shortly behind.</p><p>After a few minutes, Gorgon should have made contact.</p><p>“Gorgon Squadron,” Raleigh said after switching to the American frequency, “this is November Thirteen out of Waddington. We’re to make the intercept in approximately three minutes.”</p><p>A voice as chilly as ice responded. He sounded like he was straight out of <em> Top Gun. </em> “Copy that, November Thirteen. We’ve made contact with the UFO, but overshot it. Didn’t get good eyes-on. Coming back around.”</p><p>
  <em> UFO? </em>
</p><p>“The Yanks are fucking cowboys,” Raleigh said under his breath. “Roger that, Gorgon. Do you have anything to go off of?”</p><p>“Uhh, negative,” Gorgon’s squadron leader answered. “I don’t think I recognize the plane. Doesn’t look like a MiG or a Flanker… or, really, like a plane.”</p><p>“Copy that,” Raleigh said. “We’re two minutes out. Try to get a better look, yeah?”</p><p>“Affirm,” Gorgon said. “See you at the intercept.”</p><p>Even thirty miles away, he could see the commotion. Two contrails were circling around a small silhouette from higher altitude like hawks circling prey. The Eagles danced over the English countryside like they owned the place.</p><p>“Eyes on,” Raleigh said. “Descend to angels one-five,” he said as he made his Harrier dive. Mimic followed closely behind. “Match heading, match speed, get eyes on.”</p><p>They closed in on the bogey. When they joined its formation, so to speak, Raleigh noticed a few of his instruments flicker. “Minor interference,” he reported.</p><p>“I’ve got the same,” Mimic said. “Still operational?”</p><p>“Aye. Proceed,” Raleigh said. He spoke on an open, unencrypted frequency. “This is November Thirteen of the Royal Air Force. Unidentified aircraft, you do not have authority to fly in this airspace. Identify yourself and turn back, or you will be fired upon.”</p><p>No response. Raleigh repeated himself.</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>“Gorgon Squadron,” Raleigh said, “how copy?”</p><p>“Solid copy,” Gorgon said. The Eagles swooped down, joining his bracket. “Any update?”</p><p>“Negative. Contact won’t answer my hails. On my authority, MASTER ARM on. Repeat, MASTER ARM on. Weapons hold. Close in and identify.”</p><p>“Roger,” Gorgon said. “Gorgon Squadron, MASTER ARM on, weapons holding.”</p><p>Raleigh armed his weapons and hovered his finger over the trigger. The holographic heads-up display briefly notified him in green letters: MASTERSAFE: OFF. He closed in on the silhouette, which seemed rather small for an aircraft moving at its speed.</p><p>“Be advised,” Mimic said, “bogey will be approaching Carlisle municipal area in two minutes.”</p><p>Raleigh swore under his breath. Once his plane caught up to the bogey, he saw something awfully peculiar. It wasn’t a plane at all — in fact, it wasn’t any kind of strange, otherworldly object, either. It was a sedan. A cyan Ford Anglia was flying ahead of a formation of AV-8B Harrier IIs and F-15C Eagles — and soon, Raleigh suspected, the Tornado F.2s.</p><p>“November Thirteen, this is Gorgon… what the <em> fuck </em> am I looking at?”</p><p>With a giggle to himself and a tone of utter disbelief, Raleigh replied: “I believe that is what you would call a flying car.”</p><p>He assessed the crew. Just two, a pilot and a copilot — or, rather, a driver and a passenger. Beyond that, there were no details he could see.</p><p>“I guess that would explain them having no squawk,” Raleigh said with a chuckle.</p><p>“I can’t believe what I’m seeing,” Mimic said. “You’re all seeing this, too, right?”</p><p>“Affirm,” Gorgon said.</p><p>“All squadrons, urgent, urgent,” a voice called on their frequency. “This is AWACS Red Eye. Do not engage. Weapons safe. New intel came in on Russian observed posts, troop movements, and missile silos. No activity. We have no reason to believe the bogey represents a first strike scenario, break.</p><p>“We’ve also called off the QRA,” Red Eye continued. “November Five-Seven’s status is RTB; the situation is in your hands. Over.”</p><p>“We can see that, Red Eye,” Raleigh said. “Nice of you to join the fold.”</p><p>“Nice to be up in the sky,” Red Eye said. “You are now under my control. Authorization code one-one-Echo-one. Read back and comply.”</p><p>“Roger,” Raleigh said. “Authorization accepted. We’re under your control, over.”</p><p>Gorgon replied in tune.</p><p>“November Thirteen, we are bogey dope. No further intel on the UFO. Do you have visual?”</p><p>“November Thirteen has visual,” Raleigh said. “Bogey appears to be a flying car. Method of propulsion is unknown. Flight appears to be highly unstable, not by wire. Speed and altitude is relatively low, producing a lot of drag. Since it’s flying at a lower speed it seems to be capable of much sharper turns. Bogey does not appear to be armed, and has no squawk. Over.”</p><p>“Negative copy,” Red Eye said. “Did you say… <em> flying car </em>?”</p><p>“Affirmative,” Raleigh said.</p><p>There was a pause. “... Understood,” Red Eye said. “Our scopes have you over Carlisle now. You cannot engage unless as a last resort. Any way you can, get them to land at Waddington. Await further instructions. Out.”</p><p>The passenger looked out the window of the sedan and lifted his hands up defensively. Raleigh wagged the wings of the Harrier and waited for some sort of response. When he drifted away, the sedan didn’t follow. He adjusted his course again to where it was before, and wondered what to do.</p><p>Suddenly, the sedan decelerated rapidly into a descent and hover.</p><p>“Whoa!” Mimic yelped as Raleigh pulled around, leading his squadmate.</p><p>“Gorgon, break off, climb to angels two-two. Loiter and keep your radars on.”</p><p>“Roger,” Gorgon said. The F-15Cs ascended higher, leaving Raleigh’s bracket.</p><p>“Mimic, come back around and switch to vertical flight,” Raleigh said. “Bleed speed and altitude to match with them. We’re gonna show them not to fuck with us.”</p><p>“I like where your head’s at, Cheese.”</p><p>They pulled around and Raleigh flipped a few switches to activate the Harrier’s vertical flight mode. The four thrusters slowly shifted straight downwards, allowing the jump jet to float and strafe until, after half a minute, they were nose-to-nose with the UFO, six hundred feet above a church deep within Carlisle. This was a challenge.</p><p>After a few seconds of staring each other down, Raleigh waved in the direction of south and twirled his finger, indicating to follow him. The driver of the car nodded enthusiastically with noticeably boyish terror in his eyes. When they moved south, the UFO followed finally.</p><p>
  <em> Success! </em>
</p><p>“November Thirteen to Red Eye,” Raleigh said. “Task complete. Returning to RAF Waddington with the UFO.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">——</p><p> </p><p>RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire</p><p>15:32</p><p> </p><p>The sedan, which the Royal Air Force and United States Air Force tandem operators were tentatively referring to as an unidentified flying object, landed gingerly in a grass clearing between the tarmac and Runway 02. Waiting for it was a pair of Land Rover Wolves armed with M240s and M2 Brownings backed by two trucks. A platoon of soldiers waited for the pilots of the UFO to disembark. L85A1s were leveled, rested, and propped against car doors, grass, and itchy trigger fingers. The No. 13 Harrier flight hovered over the base, watching carefully — and training 25mm guns on the landing zone.</p><p>Corporal Vickers approached the vehicle with Private Montag, weapons leveled. “Step out of the vehicle slowly,” he said. “Keep your hands up, where we can see them.”</p><p>The two operators of the UFO disembarked. They appeared to be young boys, no older than sixteen each. Their eyes glistened with terror.</p><p>“Montag,” Vickers ordered, “search the car.”</p><p>“Right,” Vickers said. He paced around the vehicle, his weapon now lowered, and went to the passenger door. He flung it open, weapon raised again, but was answered with a swift impact. A briefcase flew out at amazing speeds, knocking him onto the ground and spilling blood from his forehead. He didn’t even have time to shriek, out cold — or possibly dead — before he even hit the grass.</p><p>“Montag!” Vickers shouted. His voice was drowned out by the following gunfire. The .50 opened up, spraying heavy lead into the sedan. Vickers dove. The two kids dove. Sergeant Grayson sprinted over, tugging at the Land Rover Wolf’s gunner by the leg and screaming to cease fire.</p><p>“What’s gotten into you? Cease fire!” Grayson yelled.</p><p>The gunner looked down and slumped back after letting loose a solitary burst on the sedan. He swore. “I got spooked. I thought Montag was dead right there.”</p><p>Vickers sprinted over and grabbed Montag, lifting him over the shoulder and carrying him. The boys couldn’t help but flash him guilt-ridden expressions. Vickers checked Montag’s pulse with a medic by the truck. “He’s alive,” he said. “Probably quite concussed, but alive.”</p><p>The machine gunner sighed and slapped his gun, pivoting it skyward. Sergeant Grayson gave him a nasty look. “Take the fugitives in,” Grayson said. “Load them on the Land Rover and get them processed. When you’re back there, get a sapper up here.” He paused. “And a bomb squad.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">——</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“We have much to be proud of, today,” Wulf said. “The world may not know it — in fact, it will never know it — but today is where the fruits of centuries of labor finally come to bear.</p><p>“Yes,” Aurelius said. “Yes, of course.” He stood from his desk and looked up at the Massive Particle Accelerator’s nearly completed chassis through the glass. Ten super cranes lowered it to the geofront from the surface a hundred meters above, connecting it to a tunnel that spanned dozens of miles. It would take hours for the tremendous machine to safely reach the bottom of the manmade chasm. Alarms periodically sounded to keep the staffers clear of the grounding zone. The PA was very active at this time but merely muffled beyond Wulf’s office.</p><p>Baths of light seeped in from above, clashing with the catwalks, concrete floor, and industrial machinery. They supplemented the industrial halogen lamps that seemed to always be on.</p><p>“In three months, we will conduct the first test,” Wulf said. “And we’re ahead of schedule. We still have nine years to complete the plan.”</p><p>“Even so,” Aurelius said, “there’s something to be said about that scuffle in Northern England last week. It’s ruffled quite a few feathers.”</p><p>Wulf nodded, craning his neck back a little. “The tips of the world seem to think they’re about to make contact with aliens,” he said. He smiled dryly. “They’re not entirely wrong.”</p><p>Aurelius raised an eyebrow but remained silent.</p><p>“They call us ‘muggles,’ do they not?” Wulf said, turning to face Aurelius. “They call… all this… the ‘muggle world.’ They believe themselves separate from humanity itself. They think they’re safe from us.”</p><p>“Perhaps, in their hubris, they believe us to be safer without them.”</p><p>Wulf shook his head. “Many of them say that, but it is merely a justification. Empty words they tell themselves as they sleep easy. But their world is small — and their minds are smaller.”</p><p>“Some of them are quite academic scholars.”</p><p>“Of course,” Wulf said. “They occupy their minds with nothing but spells and incantations, of technique and witchcraft, and of romance and fear. How myopic. They don’t even have the spines to call the man they hate so much by his real name.”</p><p>“You are talking about Riddle,” Aurelius said, “are you not?”</p><p>Wulf nodded. “He is useful to us,” he contemplated. “But the name he has adopted is quite… hilarious. It’s hard to take him seriously. But those of his kind are even more absurd.”</p><p>“I do agree with you there,” Aurelius said. “Can you imagine how silly it’d be if we couldn’t even <em> utter </em> Hitler’s name? Or that of Stalin?”</p><p>Wulf paced up to the glass and peeked at either the MPA or his reflection. “It’s shameful,” he said. “To be so paralyzed with fear that it strangles your speech. Words are already so restrictive. The Father created language to limit the subjunctive testament of humanity. He segregated our will.”</p><p>“That won’t be a problem,” Aurelius said. “Soon.”</p><p>“Soon,” Wulf whispered. “We’ll let them play their little game with the Wizarding World. Indulge both sides; it won’t matter anyway. Nigh is the apotheosis.”</p>
