    <p>The faint disappointment James had felt at Lily storming off had been somewhat mollified by the fact that he still had Severus easily in his power. Remus, for his part, felt a slight twinge of guilt, recognising that having his pants exposed in front of the whole school would be a humiliating experience he would hate to have himself, not to mention the idea of having them removed. But he got over it. Severus had after all called Lily a mudblood, which pretty much justified everything. He had proved himself to be unworthy of basic human decency, like all Slytherins ultimately were.</p>
<p>As one, the Marauders felt a slight hint of delight spread through them. Not only were Severus’s pants clearly old, the colour long since faded to grey with countless washes, but they seemed almost lacking. Exposing someone else’s penis in front of the whole school was probably cruel, though given that it was Severus it was more a case of being funny. It would be humiliating. Showing the whole school that not only was Severus too poor to afford to buy new underwear but also that he had a small penis to boot was really just the icing on the cake. James felt a wave of pleasure rush through him, grinning as he removed the baggy pants positioned neatly in front of his face, tossing them to the ground with a dramatic flourish.</p>
<p>All of the Marauders found their smiles faltering, confusion and uncertainty striking. It was the first time any of them had actually seen the female genitalia up close, and they weren’t expecting it. It occurred to James that he had accidentally had his fingers incredibly close to a girl’s private parts, and that he had removed her knickers in front of the school. Severus was still snarling, unable to speak or move, clearly distressed. The Marauders backed away, cancelling their spells to leave Severus a heap on the floor. No one was laughing, instead there seemed to be a variety of confused mutterings going round their audience. It was not the reaction they were used to, normally they did something awful to humiliate Severus and the whole school laughed uproariously at their pranks.</p>
<p>“Let’s go play Quidditch,” Remus suggested, something he knew would be fun. It would probably be the kind of thing that would get the rest of the good parts of the school, the Gryffindors and some of the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws, playing as well, bringing back the good cheer that Severus had churlishly killed.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” James agreed, flashing a grin, “Good idea!”</p>
<p>It was later that evening, in the Gryffindor Common Room, that they noticed Lily. James sauntered over, seeing an opportunity. She would be hurt by having been insulted by her friend who he had finally managed to reveal as being as prejudiced and innately evil as any other Slytherin. He had done the world a favour in that respect. The fact that Severus was a girl still confused him, and made a lot of his efforts over the last year a waste. He had thought Severus was a threat, to be a boy who in some way had designs on the girl he considered to be his, but knowing that he was a she changed everything.</p>
<p>Mary McDonald had just entered the Common Room, making a beeline for Lily, but James wasn’t particularly interested in her tale of how Severus was outside the Common Room, wanting to speak to Lily. He smiled at her, hopefully. She glared at his approach, as well as at Sirius who had followed him. Remus and Peter shuffled after them, slightly more intimidated by her seeming anger.</p>
<p>“I heard what you did, you cockwomble,” she said angrily.</p>
<p>James rolled his eyes uncomfortably. Maybe stripping a girl of her underwear in public wasn’t a very chivalrous thing to do, even if it was a Slytherin. Even if it was Severus Snape.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have done it if I’d have known Snape was a girl,” he protested, which was true. He didn’t see how he could be at fault for that. Had Severus been a boy then it would have been hilarious. Humiliating and memorable, but really funny for the whole school. A great ending to their OWLs. The sort of memory everyone could giggle over all summer. Lily stared at him, not looking in the least bit impressed.</p>
<p>“To be fair,” Mary said, “It kind of is Snape’s fault. I mean, look at the way he, well, she, looks. No one thinks she’s a girl, no one knew. She acts like a boy. It’s her own fault that people treat her like a boy,”</p>
<p>Lily turned her gaze to her friend, looking almost shocked, “So, it would be completely alright to just strip and grope someone if they were a boy? Or that it’s alright to do things to people because you never bothered to notice that Severus has always been a girl and has been sleeping in the girls’ dorms in Slytherin since first year?”</p>
<p>“Oh come off it Evans,” Sirius snapped, annoyed at her, “We’d never have done half the stuff we did to Snape if we knew he was a she,”</p>
<p>Lily flung her book at him, leaping up and storming out. She nearly tripped over Severus, who was sitting curled up on the floor by the Fat Lady. Severus had never cried prettily. She had never really done anything prettily. When Lily had first met her, Petunia had judged her to be a dirty little boy, as surely nothing that scruffy could be a girl. She hadn’t had long hair like a girl. But then again, Lily had reasoned, she hadn’t had short hair like a boy. She hadn’t worn clothes like a normal girl but she hadn’t dressed like a normal boy either. She had just been extremely, uniquely Severus.</p>
<p>So Lily had asked, after a while, wondering. She had after all grown up reading <i>The Famous Five</i>, and she knew that George was a girl called Georgina, a tomboy who liked to have adventures like the boys did. And Severus had smiled her slightly crooked smile and said, “I’m a girl,”</p>
<p>Lily had never corrected anyone who assumed differently. George had always put effort into pretending to be a boy, at least in the first few books. George had always been pleased when people mistook her for a boy. Lily had always rather wanted to be like George, brave and strong, but her mother had never let her cut off all her hair. Her name was uncompromisingly girly. She had reluctantly accepted that just like Severus was George, brave, stubborn and liable to do things however she wanted regardless of anyone else, Lily was Anne, kind, sweet and patient. She had wondered initially if Severus really was Severus’s name, or if it was like the way George had always gone by George, a masculinised name, but she’d never asked. It didn’t make any difference to her. If Severus wanted to be called Severus then that was what Lily would call her, only Lily had mostly called her Sev. But the name that had been read out at the sorting had been Severus Snape, so she had just accepted it. It wasn’t a normal name for a girl, but Severus wasn’t a normal girl. Severus wasn’t a normal name for a boy either. Severus was a witch with a mind of her own, though maybe for too long Lily had assumed that Severus could exist unchanging in a world that demanded conformity. </p>
<p>Lily started crying too, slumping down against the wall to sit by Severus. She’d realised as they grew up that Severus wasn’t George and she wasn’t Anne. Severus was Severus and she was Lily. Lily didn’t know where that left them. Two girls crying on the hard stone floor, together and alone at the same time.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Severus sniffled, words that were obvious. Lily wanted to hear them, but more than that she wanted to unhear her saying the word <i>mudblood</i>. Sorry couldn’t undo that, couldn’t take back what had been said. It helped though. Not much, but it was something. Better than nothing. Lily hoped that Severus was sorry, truly sorry, for everything the word contained, all the connotations and prejudice that it managed to reduce to those two, hurtful syllables. She hoped she wasn’t just sorry that Lily was hurt and angry, that those two syllables had potentially shattered their friendship forever. </p>
<p>It might have, Lily thought sadly. It might still. But she had precious little else left. Maybe had the girls and boys of Gryffindor not upset her, then she could have simply given up and transferred her affections elsewhere. But she was not sitting in her Common Room, surrounded by friends comforting her, consoling her over the shock at being called a slur by her long-term best friend. She was sitting on the floor of the corridor, crying beside her best friend who she was unsure she could remain friends with, unsure if she could remain friends with anyone.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I can forgive you,” she choked out. She had never been one for crying prettily either, the way people seemed to manage in books and films, beautiful women with dainty tears elegantly tracing a trail down immaculate cheeks. There was too much snot, too much shuddering of breath and too much ugly vocalisations for crying to ever be anything other than a deep expulsion of emotion in her experience.</p>
<p>“I’ll be better,” Severus sniffed. Neither of them had tissues or handkerchiefs, their tears dripping freely, sniffling unglamorously, occasionally swiping away at drips with robe sleeves. Two outcast teenage girls sitting on the floor, just as they had once been two odd little girls playing on the ground back in Cokeworth. It was just the way things had always been, Severus saying things with her sharp tongue and Lily becoming angry, upset, hurt by the words. Lily had always forgiven her, but those cruel words had never been directed towards her before. In some ways, Lily found herself suspecting that she might prefer the devil she knew to the ones she didn’t. There was a certainty with trying to mend bridges with Severus. She did take on board all of Lily’s lectures about what was too mean.</p>
<p>“Is that how you really see me?” Lily asked, tears still falling. It was important to her to know.</p>
<p>Severus shook her head vigorously, greasy black hair flying. Girls were supposed to care about their hair, keeping it clean and pretty. But Lily had rolled her eyes at James’s constant styling of his hair, the way he had always taunted Severus for her lack of interest in such matters. That was all just Severus, her tendency to focus on other things. In exam season it made sense to Lily that Severus would be too distracted to remember to wash her hair as often as it really required. She was better for most of the rest of the year. It had never bothered Lily. She too would play with her hair incessantly whilst revising, which she knew made it greasy much faster than normal. She just tended to wash it more at those times, indulging in the relaxing sensation of massaging shampoo into the skull that was being filled up with information she had to remember, whereas Severus would emerge from the haze of exam times with the slightly confused realisation that her hair seemed greasy. In some ways, it was adorable, so Lily rarely said anything. She loved those moments of utter confusion, as if Severus had spent the last little while so entirely consumed with the thoughts in her head that she had failed to noticed such basic human functions. Lily was more careful to remind her to eat and sleep, though, as that was important. She never really knew if Severus did remember to go to bed once she sent her off to Slytherin after one of their study sessions, but food at the very least she could poke in her face.</p>
<p>And yet it had started to irritate her somewhat at the same time. She couldn’t understand how someone could be both so clever and so stupid at the same time. Severus could so easily learn anything, create new spells and improve potions with so little effort, a talent that seemed as straightforward to her as breathing. The innate motor skills of walking, placing one foot in front of the other, seemed to be the same ones Severus used to comprehend magic, teasing out the complexities behind spells to form her own. Lily couldn’t understand how despite this, Severus was still at times so barely able to take care of herself. Prone to becoming so wrapped up in the world inside her head that she would forget to care for the body that bore her brain. Lily wondered suddenly, annoyed, if that idiocy was present too in her inability to see that Dark magic was dangerous and that the direction that many of the Slytherins seemed to be heading in was definitely bad news. </p>
<p>They sat in silence, though it wasn’t very silent. They were both still sniffling, the sounds echoing through the lonely corridor. Lily was glad no one else seemed to be coming or going from the Common Room. They really should move somewhere different, but that seemed like a commitment that she wasn’t sure if she wanted to make. A false promise of false hope to Severus. So they stayed there, cold stone underneath them. Cold, empty air around them.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Severus said again, eventually. It was cold, for all that it was supposed to be summer. Castles tended to be cold, even magical ones. Corridors weren’t designed for people to spend a lot of time in them, especially not sitting on the floor. Lily hoped she was sincere, but sincerity didn’t change the past. Sincerity didn’t fix things. It could be a start, but Lily was unsure if she could trust Severus. She looked at her friend sadly. </p>
<p>“If I do forgive you,” Lily said eventually, “I don’t think I’ll be able to do it again. I don’t know if I can, but I guess we can try. Maybe. I don’t know if I know you anymore…”</p>
<p>“I promise I’ll do whatever you want, just tell me,” Severus begged, and Lily wondered how someone could be so strong, so confident, so unapologetically themselves and simultaneously so pathetic and desperate. She wondered if it was fair, to ask Severus to steer away from dark magic, to avoid the Slytherins she mistrusted, to follow a path that Lily approved of. She wondered if it was fair to not say anything, to walk away and leave. Neither option seemed right. She sighed.</p>
<p>“It’ll take time,” she said realistically, because healing always took time. Magic could fix cuts and broken bones, but emotional wounds healed the same way in the wizarding world as they did in the muggle one. Slowly, painfully, leaving scars. A part of life and a part of growing up. Sometimes the wounds never did heal properly, rotting and festering away under the surface. Sometimes they cauterised, burning away all that had existed, the blood flow stopped but leaving a vivid scar. She had thought, for a brief while, that that was what had happened to their friendship. A wound that had been growing, a small cut torn open and ignited by their tempers. They both had tempers. In that they were both like George, a comparison that no longer meant anything to Lily. They were Lily and Severus, girls from Cokeworth that had never quite belonged there and who didn’t quite belong in Hogwarts either. </p>
<p>There were tears in Severus’s black eyes, overflowing and dripping past black eyelashes down already tear streaked cheeks. Her eyes were red, and Lily imagined her own were too. They felt like they should be red and puffy. Severus rarely cried, it was one of those things Lily had always found admirable. Tough and strong. It also gave her a sense of honour, that she had seen Severus cry on the few, rare occasions that tears did gush forth. Severus had always seemed to hate crying, an act that more often than not was a complex mix of emotions rather than just a clean, clear reaction to pain or sadness. Severus cried with anger and humiliation, with bitter misery and desperate hatred, feelings crashing into each other and welling forth in ugly, all consuming sobs that shook her whole body. </p>
<p>This time it was just pure misery. Guilt and sorrow, no anger or the usual attempts to hide. It was almost as if it was too deep a devastation to be overwhelmed with the other mix of emotions that surely must lurk beneath the surface, as if the embarrassment and anger at the Marauders had been swept to one side as irrelevant. In some ways that scared Lily, the most clear and obvious sign of love that Severus could give, and yet it was provided almost subconsciously. She’d always known, deep down, that their fragile friendship mattered to Severus. She’d never given it much thought really, beyond the casual reassurance that they were best friends and would remain that way. Now it seemed to occupy her mind, burrowing deep down inside of her. Now the potential loss mattered to her more than she had thought it would.</p>
