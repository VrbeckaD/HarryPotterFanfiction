          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry threw a witty jeer while Draco flashed a wicked sneer.</p><p>All across the bullpen, maddened Aurors’ eyes did roll;</p><p>Bent their heads over the papers ‘bout the latest evil capers</p><p>Hoping that this quarrel tapers, ends before they lose control.</p><p>Tempers hot and bothered never mixed well as a whole,</p><p>And their patience took a toll.</p><p> </p><p>For, like clockwork, the two fought, and this time ‘bout the coffee pot.</p><p>Aurors sighed and grumbled as another clash they bore.</p><p>“Why do those two always bicker? They’re good partners—that’s the kicker!”</p><p>Stated Ronald with a snicker. “All this shouting’s uncalled for.”</p><p>They continued working as the yelling they ignored;</p><p>Tried, at least, though ‘twas a chore.</p><p> </p><p>With an irritated huff, Dean Thomas screamed, “I’ve had enough!</p><p>How do I get work done when those two are being such fools?</p><p>Though with anger they have acted, we all know they’re just attracted.</p><p>We have all been quite impacted ever since we were in school.</p><p>Time for us to act like Cupids, though it’s only Yule.</p><p>That, or turn them into ghouls.”</p><p> </p><p>Neville spoke up with a snort, “Leave murder as a last resort.</p><p>Fighting always stops when one of them turns shades of blue.”</p><p>“I can’t stand much more this squalling,” said Zabini, slowly drawling.</p><p>“All of this is so appalling—time to go to someplace new.</p><p>Maybe I’ll take Granger up on that job o’er at Spew.”</p><p>And, with that, he bid adieu.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh,” said Dean without a fuss, “That’s no surprise—it’s up to us.</p><p>Let us make those pricks confess how much they want to bone.”</p><p>Ronald jumped up with a posit, “Let’s shove them both in a closet!</p><p>Jam the handle—we will cause it so that they can be alone.</p><p>Time to be alone to hash it out; perhaps atone.</p><p>Else, my best friend I’ll disown.”</p><p> </p><p>All agreed to this great plan; and, quickly, down the hall they ran,</p><p>Found an empty closet, then they set their foolproof plot.</p><p>Ronald wrung his hands while crying, “Harry, oh, how terrifying!</p><p>Here a monster’s surely lying—tried to maim me, but I fought.</p><p>Slithered to the dark when I gave it a hearty swat.</p><p>Kill the beast, ‘cause I cannot!”</p><p> </p><p>Harry hurried to their place with Draco Malfoy keeping pace.</p><p>(All the rest were hiding sniggers up their Auror sleeves.)</p><p>“Everybody, stand aside!” the fearless Harry Potter cried.</p><p>Everyone, of course, complied, though Draco was extremely peeved.</p><p>“You are not invincible, as much as you believe.</p><p>I’m afraid you’re quite deceived.”</p><p> </p><p>“Shut it, Malfoy,” Harry said. “Without me, likely you’d be dead.</p><p>I’ll go in there by myself, and you can kiss my ass.”</p><p>“Bet he would,” Dean Thomas muttered. Ron’s expression swiftly shuttered.</p><p>To the side they promptly scuttered, let the duo bustle past.</p><p>Shortly, Neville shut the door ‘fore Ron said something crass;</p><p>Fixed the lock on the door brass.</p><p> </p><p>“What the hell is going on here?” Harry yelled, “It seems as if we’re</p><p>Stuck inside this closet. Can you all help get us out?”</p><p>“Promise, that’s what we are trying. Harry, please, just stop denying</p><p>That you have been simply dying, dying to snog that git’s pout—</p><p>Though I’m sure that it’s like making out with a cold trout,”</p><p>Ron said, wrinkling his own snout.</p><p> </p><p>“Potter, you must be embarrassed! I know I must be the fairest</p><p>Being you’ve seen with your four eyes.” How Draco Malfoy cocked!</p><p>“Malfoy, you can quit your crooning. You are just as guilty swooning.</p><p>I have caught you often mooning Harry like your head was knocked.”</p><p>Much more gently, Dean said, “No more lies you need concoct.</p><p>Speak, and this will be unlocked!”</p><p> </p><p>Neither talked at first; the three anticipated so much worse.</p><p>Suddenly, a heavy thud fell hard against the door.</p><p>“Merlin, did they kill each other? What will we tell Malfoy’s mother?”</p><p>Neville whispered with a shudder. “Hope they tripped and nothing more.”</p><p>Muffled sounds then scuffed along the dirty marble floor—</p><p>Noises they could not ignore.</p><p> </p><p>For, across the threshold, were alarming sounds of smacking flesh.</p><p>Rhythmic pounding, pounding right against the wooden door.</p><p>Rowdily, they both were moaning. Oh, the two were clearly boning;</p><p>Least, that’s what they were intoning—one released a raucous roar.</p><p>Ronald reasoned, “Maybe they’re just building new rapport.</p><p>Just a kiss and nothing more.”</p><p> </p><p>Sounds of pleasure boldly came across the heavy wooden door.</p><p>Ronald, Dean, and Neville ran away, and this they swore—</p><p>“Just a kiss and nothing more.”</p><p> </p></div>
