The color of his potion was just a smidge off, and even though the other Griffindors were doing worse than him, he just knew Snape was going to pick on him. He started to pack up his stuff, seeing as he couldn't do anything to his potion to make it better. As he was putting the last of his books away, the bad feeling he had all day started to grow, making him look up and around the room nervously. He turned around last and saw that Neville's cauldron was smoking and spitting the potion up and out. Harry watched with no small amount of dread as dozens of the drops from Neville's spoiled potion mixed with his. Everyone stared at Harry's cauldron, waiting for something to happen, and when nothing did, they all breathed a sigh of relief and relaxed. Harry turned around when he heard his name get called. Snape was berating Neville, and telling Harry to vanish his potion. As he was turning around to do just that, he noticed that the potion and the cauldron were glowing an princess pink color. Panicked, Harry threw a shield up around him and the cauldron, just as it exploded, drenching Harry in the potion. And with a bright flash of blinding light, Harry was gone.</p>
