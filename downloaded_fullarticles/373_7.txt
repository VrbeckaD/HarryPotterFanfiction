    <p>Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy had two children. On January 15, 1978, two years before Draco was born, Anala was conceived.<br/> Anala was obviously different from other children. Not only mentally, but physically. She had indigo blue hair that led into red which then led into orange that led into yellow. She had Heterochromia, Anala had one red eye and one grey eye. <br/>Some wizards were confused by her appearance. How could Lucius and Narcissa create such a. . . nevermind.<br/>Anala had quite the fix with fire, more so then fire itself. At any random time she would burst into flames. It didn’t matter if she was sad, happy, or mad. Anala was doing wandless magic before she could even walk, and that was the turning point in her life.<br/>Narcissa and Lucius had seen Analas’ power and knew she would be better in a different school. She started in school much younger than most witches, at age seven.<br/>Anala had missed her brother, of course she had, but she was busy with studies and embracing her full power. Anala came home on holidays and summer vacations, she would catch up with her family. <br/>Soon enough, the school Anala was attending was destroyed, so in Dracos third year, she started attending Hogwarts. <br/>Draco had been excited. He had a skip in his step, and he would smile at the professors. Most of the students noticed, while others remained clueless. Pansy asked him what he was so excited about. Draco wouldn’t answer, he would just smile.<br/>It took 2 days for Anala to pack, say goodbye to her friends, and travel back to the Malfoy manor. Her parents were waiting for her with open arms. And whoever said Lucius and Narcissa were bad parents lied.<br/>Severus Snape has been waiting for his goddaughter as well. He had called in sick and flooed to the Malfoy manor. Unfortunately, Draco had to stay at Hogwarts. <br/>Dumbledore had sent his regards to Anala after she arrived but didn’t come to greet her.<br/>Narcissa stood in her daughters doorway. “Are you settled?”<br/>Anala gave a toothy grin. “Yup.” She ran a hand through her colorful hair. “When can I see Draco?”<br/>Lucius walked into the room with an envelope. “Draco sent you this.” He handed the envelope to Anala and kissed her forehead. “Goodnight, sweetheart.”<br/>Anala smiled. “Goodnight, Father.”<br/>Narcissa kissed her daughter on the forehead, said her Goodnight, and closed the door. Anala sat down on her sheets and pulled the covers over her legs. She was going to miss her friends, that much was definite. Anala had felt the effects of the past week weigh down on her.<br/>Anala knew she would have to go to Hogwarts. Probably tomorrow. She just wondered what house she would be sorted into, or if the Dumbledore would even let her into Hogwarts.<br/>Anala let her head loll to the pillow and promptly passed out.</p>
