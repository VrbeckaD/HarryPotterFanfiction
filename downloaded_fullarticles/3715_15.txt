  <em>Red + Feathers = Chicken</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Why has James dressed up as a chicken?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Does he think she has a fetish for drumsticks, or something equally ridiculous?</em>
</p><p>No he doesn't, for James, in all his chickeniness, waves his arms and crows, "I'm the devil!"</p><hr/><p>Three minutes later, Lily and James are standing on the other side of the Leaky Cauldron's wall.</p><p>Namely, the side with no roof and a never ending downpour of rain.</p><p>And of<em> course, </em>James A.K.A "the one in the chicken/devil suit" starts the conversation as they trudge their way to the first house on their list.</p><p><em>"</em>That bartender bloke was just plain unreasonable."</p><p>"Well, who's brilliant idea was it to yell, 'Make way for the devil and his wife!', while standing on a table shooting sparks from the end of his wand?"</p><p>"How should I have known that the roof would catch fire from the sparks!?"</p><p>"Wood + Sparks from idiotic idiots = Fire that gets us kicked out of a pub. Just so you know, the Leaky Cauldron has a history of <em>never </em>kicking people out, even with that time of the raging vampire. What possessed you to even dress up as a chicken- err, devil in the first place?"</p><p>"Oy! My awesome suit <em>does not </em>look like a chicken! Sirius and I just thought it'd be nice to show some Gryffindor pride and to get to know the neighbors."</p><p>At this, Lily suddenly stops and turns, before remarking in a disbelieving voice, "And you thought dressing up as the <em>devil </em>would help improve neighbor relationships?"</p><p>"It did <em>that </em>time, thought it really wasn't about <em>neighbor </em>relationships."</p><p>Although a cold wind is blowing, and there isn't a hint of sun, Lily's face heats up.</p><p>"I'd tell you to go to hell, but you'd probably just feel at home there."</p><p>Grinning slyly at her, James opened his mouth again, "Well, now that you say it, there was something i also rem-"</p><p>Looking very frazzled, and not just by the rain, Lily could only say, "Okay okay, but you're only allowed to wear it to once house, alright?"</p><p>"Alright, but trust me, this suit will grow on you."</p><p>"i'd like to see that."</p><hr/><p>In the end, first it was one house, then two, until they had visited all the houses on their list, without James changing out of the ridiculous suit even once.</p><p>Though Lily would never admit it, the devil suit with the skirt of feathers did grow on her.</p><p>
  <em>James + Lily = Red Devil Suit</em>

  <em>End.</em>
