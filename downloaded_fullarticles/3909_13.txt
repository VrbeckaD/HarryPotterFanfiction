</p><p>There was nothing more humiliating than standing up in front of the class while Severus Snape, resident Potions Master, criticized the work you spent all period doing. It wasn't like he was going to need potions, so why you ask did Harry Potter subject himself to the constant railing of his Potion's Professor? Well the answer was simple of course. Harry <em>desired</em> him, that was the only way to put it. Harry wanted him, but even though he'd come back to repeat his eighth year, Harry knew he couldn't have him. Harry knew that what he felt for the Potions Master was something more akin to lust then any love he could ever feel; sort of like how he felt for a certain Blonde Malfoy that liked to taunt him. So, naturally it only be fitting that he stood in front of the class of seventh years, most of which were students that should have been a year below him had he graduated, and fidgeted with his fingers. All the eyes on him as Snape circled him was unnerving, but he stood brave like any Gryffindor would and awaited the verdict. </p><p> </p><p>"Pathetic as usual, Potter. In the eight years that I have taught you, have you learned nothing," he harped and Harry sighed, thinking it was going to be one of those times where Snape picked on him for every tiny aspect of his life. </p><p> </p><p>"You mean before or during the defeat of the Dark Lord sir? I was pretty busy most of the time, you know, surviving," he questioned, looking Snape in the eye seriously and waiting for the explosive rant to ensue.</p><p> </p><p>"Don't patronize me, boy," Snape growled and Harry had to contain his body's reaction to have his bits standing at attention at the sound of that chocolate voice when it was irritated. "You think this is a joke. You think I care that you had more than your fair share to focus on. I have news for you Potter, all of us in this room and thousands, if not millions of others had to worry about far more than what you did," he harped and then thrusted the bottle into Harry's hands. "Here, for your self-centeredness. You can test this botched potion you so pathetically produced and show your fellow classmates exactly what happens when it's made wrong," he said, a smug smile on his lips and some of the Slytherin's and Gryffindor's alike chuckled at Harry's expense. </p><p> </p><p>Harry sighed again, knowing already that it was coming when Snape had singled him out and made him stand up in front of the class. Harry glared at the man, not liking this vindictive side of the man, but knowing that it was part of the package that was his charm. He huffed and downed the potion. Everyone waited with bated breath for something to happen but nothing did. Nothing at all. </p><p> </p><p>"Let this be a lesson to you all," Snape started to say, but one student bold enough to interrupt him, pointed at Harry. "What's wrong with him, sir," the brave Gryffindor asked, earning himself a glare as Snape turned to look at Harry, his eyes now glazed and a dazed faraway look on his face. </p><p> </p><p>Snape couldn't help but think that this couldn't be more perfect. "It seems the potion is in perfect working order after all," he said almost to gleefully. He wondered if this potion would humiliate Harry. Would it have him spewing his greatest desires or running around the classroom singing some off-tune song that would clearly be muggle and the kids, not to mention himself, would have a field day with it. Or would it have him act on a desire that was not as innocent as Snape was thinking. The vindictive man couldn’t wait to find out.</p><p> </p><p>Snape recognized the first stage of this potion; stage one: the discussion stage. He could already see the second stage slowly bleeding through in Harry's eyes as they were turning a light blue, the acceptance stage. And, finally, his eyes were back to normal color and his body released itself from its trance like state: the granted stage. Snape watched him for a moment but Harry still didn't move. It looked as if he was fighting every fiber of his being to not comply with this potion and Snape thought that was great. He felt great for this petty, vindictive victory as he smirked at Harry. </p><p> </p><p>"You can't fight it Potter, this potion will force you to comply so you might as well get it over with," he said, watching Harry's eyes for the sign of darkened green they were supposed to be now that the potion accepted Harry's desire. When it didn't change, and Harry's body seemed to be shaking with the effort to keep it at bay, Snape turned and barked, "back to work."</p><p> </p><p>Harry couldn't move. He was frozen to the spot. He didn't want to act on his desire. He didn't want the class to know what it was that he desired. His body was taunt against his skin, beads of sweat from concentration slowly trickling down his face. He could feel the Potion push at his system more, acting like a certain spell in making him do what it wanted. Harry was slowly losing the fight, his eyes slowly darkening to the deepest of forest green before his head snapped up, causing the few brave enough to defy Severus Snape to gasp audibly and flinch in their seat. The noise brought multiple eyes up to look at the boy hero, wondering what it was the potion did. </p><p> </p><p>Snape turned at the collective gasp, wondering why those few brave individuals felt confident enough to talk in his class. He got the surprise of his life when Harry suddenly wound up in his arms, his body pressed flushed against Snape's and his lips crushed against his own. Snape wretched his lips away from Harry. </p><p> </p><p>"Potter what the hell do you think you're..." but Harry didn't seem to hear him, cutting him off again with the much harsher kiss to his lips. Harry even held the back of his head as he ravished the Potion's Master mouth. There was a collective sound in the room. Surprise, disgust and gasps of shock mingling together to create one infernal noise. Snape managed to yank himself away from Harry to bark, "Class dismissed! Ms. Granger please get the head-," but his lips were claimed again, a frustrated growl leaving Harry's lips as Snape pulled his lips from his yet again.</p><p> </p><p>The poor boy didn't seem to be aware of himself as he thoroughly ravishing his Professor's mouth, not giving either of them room to relent, let alone breath. Most of the class was already gone, for the exception of a few stragglers who were both disgusted and fascinated with this impromptu make out session. Snape could see then, but as his lips were currently busy, he couldn't yell at them. Harry wouldn't let him go this time, growling just slightly whenever Snape tried to pull away. </p><p> </p><p>The blonde boy watched from a distance as his Potion's Master made out with a student, a student that he too <em>desired</em>. He sighed, thinking that those bastards had all the luck and turned to leave when a thick shiny gold chain clamped around his waist, successfully trapping him in place. </p><p> </p><p>The blonde looked down at it, wondering what the hell was going on as the chain started to reel itself in, making the distance between the couple become almost non-existent in a matter of seconds. </p><p> </p><p>In the angle he was in, Snape couldn't see the chain. It only looked as if this blonde was curious enough to get a better look at this travesty. Snape glared at him, his cheeks slightly flushed from this make out session as he had never been trapped in such a long, soft kiss in his life. When Draco was only a few centimeters away from them, Harry broke the kiss and started to trail his kisses lower, nibbling on a pale neck; sensitive from Nagini's bite and lavishing the skin with kisses. </p><p> </p><p>"Mr. Malfoy, didn't I dismiss you," he got out, completely composed as he glared the young Slytherin down.</p><p> </p><p>"I don't want to watch this any more than you want to do it, but you see I have this pesky problem around my waist," he said gesturing to the chain that Snape could now see the top of. </p><p> </p><p>"What the bloody hell is that,” he asked as he tried hard not to react to the soft sucking at his neck that was sure going to leave a bruise on his neck and his pride as he already felt himself responding to Harry's attention. "At least close your eyes, Draco," Snape requested, embarrassed to the roots of his hair. As if on cue to his name, Harry turned to Draco, an apologetic smile on his lips because he had gotten lost in the moment before he pressed his lip to Draco's tasting him fervently.  </p><p> </p><p>Snape was shocked, relieved and upset that he could be dumped like a sack of potatoes with no thought, and Draco was shocked to suddenly have soft lips against his that it took him a full 2 minutes before he started to respond. Snape sighed in relief that he could breathe again, but he couldn't move as Harry had suddenly bent himself just slightly and was pressing himself against Snape's erection. Snape hissed at the sudden attention and jumped when he saw Albus in the door way, giving him a cold yet surprised stare. </p><p> </p><p>"What is going on here," Albus asked in a chilling voice, no hint of a twinkle in his eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Draco hummed in embarrassment, having been caught like this; but Harry wouldn't release his mouth so that he could complain to the Headmaster. </p><p> </p><p>"I had Potter test one of his potions. It seems he made it right, even if the color was just slightly off," he said as he bit back a groan of pleasure as harry pressed against him wantonly. He removed himself from Harry’s bottom, revealing to the headmaster that what he first thought was going on was not going on at all.  </p><p> </p><p>"Can you do something Albus? I have a class in the next half hour as I'm sure Mr. Malfoy does," he said gesturing to the occupied male who hummed his agreement, but was kissing Harry back just as hungrily as Harry was kissing him. </p><p> </p><p>"What potion was it, Severus," Albus asked, watching the way Harry wiggled his bottom in search of Snape and whined just softly when he couldn't find him. </p><p> </p><p>"Poculum Cupit," he said and Albus eyes widened. </p><p> </p><p>"You know as well as I do that that particular potion has to run its course. "Why don't you let Mr. Malfoy take care of him and you remove yourself from the situation," Albus suggested. </p><p> </p><p>Snape nodded, not actually liking that he had to remove himself but knowing that this would be for the best. He moved to walk around Albus to go out the door, but another gold chain encircled him, yanking him back into the room. Snape looked down at himself, and then followed the chain to Harry and looked at Albus like he'd grown two heads. </p><p> </p><p>A twinkle came back into Albus' eyes as he watched Snape slowly be dragged back to the kissing couple. "It seems that Mr. Potter has decided both you and Mr. Malfoy are the subjects of his desire. "I'm afraid my hands are tied Severus," he said, a hint of amusement behind the twinkle in his eye. </p><p> </p><p>"Albus! He's a student," Snape tried to protest, but Albus only shrugged. </p><p> </p><p>"He should have graduated last year, Severus. He is the age of legal consent and as long as that potion is in his system, you and Mr. Malfoy will be the subjects of his fulfillment. You should know all about this Severus, after all you assigned the potion and made him drink it in the first place," he said and Snape glared at him before turning and walking to the couple, the chain stopping it's pull at his sudden willingness. </p><p> </p><p>"Fine, but if you’re not going to help, then leave," he said harshly. "This is embarrassing enough without you being here to witness just how far I am about to fall," he complained.</p><p> </p><p>Albus was just a sparkling ball of amusement, but he did nod indicating that he was indeed going to leave. He wanted to catch a glimpse of Harry, just to make sure this wasn't a spell cast by the blonde currently getting his mouth plundered. Harry seemed to sense this and pulled away from Draco to take in much need air," he also looked past him to see Snape, just coming back to them, and groaned involuntarily. Albus caught the dark forest green of his eyes, but they were diverted to Harry hands as they hastily unbuttoned his robes and yanked them and his school shirt off followed swiftly by his pants revealing that he was commando and needy; his erection standing proud.</p><p> </p><p>"Right," Albus said, a light blush ruining his plump apple cheeks as he hastily backed out of the room. "I will put a sign on your door, Severus, to cancel your classes. Come see me when you’re finished," he said and made a hasty exit. </p><p> </p><p>Snape acknowledged Albus with a nod of his head, his eyes glued to the young man stripping before him. He stood next to Draco, his eyes wide as he caught the blue gaze of the youngest Malfoy. </p><p> </p><p>"Why us," Draco asked softly, thinking for some reason that if he talked low enough Harry wouldn't hear them.</p><p> </p><p>"I have no idea, Draco," Snape admitted, taking a chance to glance at his star pupil before Harry stepped closer to him and started in on his many buttons. </p><p> </p><p>There was a growing frustrated frown on his face at the number of buttons before his desire to have Snape naked was fulfilled by his wish magic and all of Snape’s clothes melted away, leaving slightly calloused hands on smooth skin. The groan that left Harry's mouth at the feeling caused the other two to groan as well in response and Harry took that as permission to explore the naked body beneath his touch. Hands, lips, and his own body meshed up to Snape’s, as Draco stood beside them and watched. He could see that Snape was enjoying himself, as he was hard and Draco swallowed realizing he was just as hard, if not harder and coughed. Harry seemed to realize that he was giving Snape most of his attention and turned them so that his bare ass was pressed against Draco, rubbing himself on the blonde just as he'd done to Snape just minutes ago. Draco swallowed thickly as Harry rubbed himself against him, groaning heavily and wishing he was naked to feel him better. He never imagined that Harry had the same thought as Draco's clothes melted and Harry was suddenly pressed flush again him. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh Merlin," Draco breathed out, looking up at Snape, whose eyes had started to darken in lust. Draco's echoed his, and both stared at one another, not realizing that Harry had had enough of touching flesh and wanted to taste it instead. He bent himself, grasping Snape's erection and drawing it to his mouth. Snape was shocked enough to hiss and look down at him, his eyes wide as he saw only his tip in Harry's mouth. A deep, lust filled groan left his mouth, Harry responding to it with one of his own as he grabbed Snape by the cheeks, and dropped down to his knees. Draco groaned in disappointment when Harry moved away from him, but he needn't have as Harry reached out blindly for him and caught his erection. Draco thought that he was going to stroke him, but Harry was tugging him forward, so Draco waddled awkwardly closer, hissing at the pleasure pain as it zinged through his entire body. When he was where Harry desired him, Harry released him, turning back to Snape and placing his hand back on his taunt buttock, pressing Snape into his mouth and sucking him up greedily. Snape didn't have anything but Harry to grip to keep his balance, so he wound up digging his fingers into the younger males’ shoulders, hissing at the heat surrounding all of him. Snape wasn't tiny, and most people only sucked hungrily on his head, but Harry had him resting in his throat, swallowing slightly only when it felt like Snape was slipping out of him. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh, Sweet Merlin," he said, throwing his head back and groaning as Harry started to bod his head, pushing Snape's ass in encouragement so the older male would thrust into him. </p><p> </p><p>Snape complied, lightly rocking his hips and making Harry moan in pure delight. Snape soon discovered that Harry didn't have a gag reflex as his hips sprung forward in pleasure. Draco watched, stroking himself, never thinking that the sight of this man so debauched could make him so hard: so <em><u>horny</u></em>. He gave a soft groan of pleasure and Harry seemed to remember he was there at the sound. He reached for him, pulling Snape out of his throat so that he could give Draco the same attention. Draco had never had anyone blow him before, so the sensation left him weak in the knees and twitching as he caught the eyes of their Potion's Professor, </p><p>staring with his black soulless eyes glued to the pair. His eyes went completely unfocused; however, as Harry's hand had never left his erection. He still stroked Snape, all the while encouraging Draco to slam into him too, which Draco complied with because he was young and thrusting just seemed like a natural thing for him to do. Draco was not as big as Snape, so Harry's mouth would close around him as he swallowed, causing the blonde to groan, brushing Harry’s hair back in hopes of getting a glimpse of those forest green eyes.</p><p> </p><p>After what seemed like forever to Draco, Harry pulled back and turned back to Snape, looking up at him with his forest green eyes. Snape forgot the cursing of his stupidity in his head at the sight of those eyes, all of his thoughts vanishing from his head as Harry drew both him and Draco into his mouth at the same time. He looked up at them, just suckling slightly, seeming to be waiting for something and frowning when he didn't get it. Both felt a slight nudge of the back of their heads towards each other and Draco's eyes widened, thinking that he figured out what Harry wanted. He looked up at the Potion's Master, who was frowning in confusion until Draco tilted his head upward and realization clicked in his eyes. Snape was going to protest, except that the soft hum from Harry had him looking at the boy and realizing that this was what Harry was waiting for. Snape took a moment to take in the sight of young male, forest green eyes pinned to them both, mouth stuffed with cock, drool slowly creeping down the corner of his mouth at his mouthful. He suddenly wished he could ravish those kiss swollen lips, stretched taunt with the shape of two cocks sticking from his mouth. He groaned heavily turning to Draco and crushed their lips together, giving Draco all the hunger he got from the sight alone as Draco groaned and struggled to keep up with the intensity of the kiss. </p><p> </p><p>Harry seemed pleased as he watched and then started to suck on them, pushing at Snape so he'd pull out and pulling at Draco so he pushed in, and then doing the opposite to them when they paused like they were being positioned. Snape only let go of those lips when a burning need to breath hit him and he pulled back to gasp at their new rhythm. Draco felt himself getting close. He was just getting ready to throw his own head back and scream his release when Harry's mouth disappeared from around him. He looked down at the young man and realized that Harry had stood up and turned around, laying the top half of his body on Snape's desk and presenting his bottom. </p><p> </p><p>No one moved, and Harry soon grew impatient, reaching around himself to start to prepare himself as both of the others didn't seem to want too. A soft moan left his lips as he played with himself, rocking against Snape's desk for friction and moaning again just as softly as he pushed his hips back on his own fingers. </p><p> </p><p>Draco swallowed audibly, stepping forward, but his intention was to see the type of face Harry was making as his loins had calmed down enough for him to walk. Green eyes met his, and Harry took it as both had made their decision. The chain started to tug both of them, Draco at his front and Snape at his ass.</p><p> </p><p>Snape looked like he would pass out, but it was just sheer surprise on his face as he recognized that Harry wanted Snape to penetrate him. Snape couldn't believe it. Harry groaned in impatience when no one moved. He pulled his fingers from himself when Snape got close enough and wiggled his bottom, mewling when Severus stopped the chain from pulling him any closer by gripping both sides of Harry's hips and willing himself to stop. </p><p> </p><p>"Potter, I can't," he tried to convey, but Harry would have none of that. The chain jerked suddenly, making Snape press himself firmly between his slightly rounded cheeks. Snape groaned involuntarily and Harry reached behind himself grasping Snape and positioning himself. </p><p> </p><p>Realizing that this was going to happen, whether he wanted it too or not, Snape cast a hasty nonverbal lubrication spell and was amazed when he slid right into Harry who moaned heavily and made sure to keep himself still. </p><p> </p><p>Draco watched as Snape tried his best to keep himself composed, but he wasn't a saint, as soon as Harry stared to move, those narrow hips snapped forward, causing a lust induced moan to leave Harry's lips. Draco watched, fascinated with the power Snape seemed to be pumping into Harry. He was so caught up in watching that he didn't realize Harry had turned his attention to him. Before he noticed, Harry had lifted and engulfed him in one sweet move. Draco cried out in surprise, his eyes leaving Snape’s face and going down to the green eyes that were locked with his as his mouth was full of cock again. </p><p> </p><p>"Shit! Fuck Potter," he cursed, running a hand through Harry's hair and tightening a fist in the soft dark locks. Draco lifted Harry's head a little to thrust better into his mouth, not as powerful as Snape seemed to be pumping his hips, but just as vigorously. Harry was in heaven, moaning and swallowing, sucking and groaning. He was lost in this haze of pleasure for a while, before something tugged at him and he remembered this wasn't what he wanted. He pulled Draco away from him, and though he had a hard time getting Snape to stop his thrusting he managed, with the help of the chain, to make him pull off. Snape seems to come back to himself at the loss of contact, looking down at Harry in horror, but the male didn't seem distressed. He'd be sore when this was over, but not distressed, in fact he had other plans that were probably worse than the powerful thrust the Potion's Professor had done to him. Harry got to his knees, and reaching for Draco and Snape realized that Harry probably wanted them to switch now. Harry pulled Draco around the desk so he was standing in front of the desk. He circled them so he was now facing them and reached behind Draco, having every intention of preparing him, but Draco slapped his hand away. He wasn't going to do that, not while Harry seemed so out of it. Harry hummed in disappointment and Draco flinched at the sound, but he was firm. Harry could tell that he wouldn't yield and sighed just a little before climbing from the desk and forcing him to lay down instead. Draco fought for a moment before Snape rested a hand on his shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>"He's going to do something else Draco," he assured the male, seeing that being penetrated by Potter was not something he wanted. "The potion is designed to fill his desire, since you have expressed a dislike for this activity, it will default to a different desire. It isn't meant for rape you see," he lectured as he watched Harry spread Draco out on the desk. He swallowed thickly at the sight of his taunt chest and heavy erection. He looked away, but his cock had already agreed with his head that they liked the sight. </p><p> </p><p>Sesnape shifted nervously, thinking that he would be the one penetrated now. He didn't particularly mind but he preferred not to bottom for the same reasons as Draco did, thinking Harry was far too drugged on potion to have any grasp of how to fuck properly. He was surprised when Harry walked around the desk and climbed up, turning so he too was facing Snape. Snape looked up again at the movement and watched as Harry lifted Draco and sank down on his erection. Harry didn't feel as full as he did when Snape was pressing into him, but he did let out a soft moan as he stilled himself and seemed to wait again. </p><p> </p><p>The chain started to tug at Snape again when it seemed he wouldn't move and Snape was shocked to see that Harry had lifted his leg, so when Snape got close enough harry rested it on his shoulder and tilted his already full ass in invitation.</p><p> </p><p>"Sweet merciful Merlin," Snape exclaimed when he realized what Harry wanted. "P-potter, this is illogical," he tried to protest, making Draco thrust his hips upward so he could lift his head to find out what the hell was going on. Harry didn't seem to hear, nor did he seem to care as he grasped Snape by his erection and guided him inside of himself, right beside Draco. </p><p> </p><p>For the second time that night, Snape found himself hastily casting a lubrication spell as his girth inched inside and rested beside Draco’s, deep inside Harry. Harry couldn’t seem to take the pleasure as his head fell back against Draco's chest, a deep moan that seemed to strengthen and drawl out came from his mouth. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, m-move Pleeaassee," Harry spoke up, for the first time since they started, indicating what his true desire was all along. Snape realized that he did have his right sense of mind in that moment, but he didn't move his hips. He wondered what position was Harry's concrete desire if this one made him sing vocally in pleasure. He was also afraid of hurting the male, so he stayed as still as possible, Draco following his example, but for an entirely different reason. Draco was way too close to the edge and he didn't want to embarrass himself, so he stayed still and willed some sense into his erection as he watched Snape with bated breath. </p><p> </p><p>When no one complied with his plea, Harry started to rock his hips, gently at first, the sensation too much for him too quick before the thrusting of his hips picked up and he moaned at the feeling. He was rocking his hips so hard that his erection was bouncing and spinning between then at the force. </p><p> </p><p>"Yes, fuck, yes," he chanted rocking harshly forward before drawing back and groaning heavily. Draco sucked in a harsh breath, feeling himself too close to the edge to stop. Unconsciously he reached for Harry, stopping his erection as it bounced and started to pump it in time with the way he was moving his hips. Snape's eyes widened as a pure pleasure swept across Harry's face at being touched and he suddenly sank a little deeper in beside the young male as some sort of worry in the back of Harry’s mind evaporated at Draco's action. Snape watched as Harry's face changed to pure bliss as he and Draco started to thrust, taking turns pressing constantly against his prostate. Harry locked eyes with Ssnape and then shouted out a wail as he came not stopping his bouncing as he came undone wailing his pleasure for the world to hear. </p><p> </p><p>Harry clenched as he came and immediately sent Draco over the edge. He thrusted into him, cuming deeply inside the young male and also coating Snape from the inside. Snape felt the heat and the contractions and roared his own orgasm, starting to thrust at the end, vigorously, as he rode out his own pleasure. Harry gave a litany of moaning pleasure as he allowed Snape his run. When it was all over, Snape carefully pulled from Harry, not noticing that the other was limp. Unintentionally, he pulled Draco out with him and the male gave a soft groan at suddenly being released. The gold chains didn’t fade but neither Snape nor Draco seemed to notice.</p><p> </p><p>"Your heavy Potter," Draco complained but Harry didn't answer and Snape looked up at him to see why.</p><p> </p><p>Harry had passed out from the intensity of his pleasure. </p><p> </p><p>Harry came too lying on something soft. He wasn't sure what happened exactly as the last thing he remembered was trying desperately to fight the potion of desire that coursed through his veins. His eyes snapped open as he realized that he must have failed and his desire must have taken over. It was confirmed when a head appeared in his vision. The face was blurry, but looked concerned, and slightly angry, curtained in black hair and staring down at him.</p><p> </p><p>"Mr. Potter," the face said and Harry recognized that it was Snape, and his eyes widened a blush of embarrassment coming over his face and staining his cheeks. His embarrassment heightened as another head appeared in his vision, blurry like the other but with blonde hair, stark against his light skin. </p><p> </p><p>"You have a lot of explaining to do!"</p><p> </p><p>And Harry suddenly wished he'd stayed unconscious. </p>
