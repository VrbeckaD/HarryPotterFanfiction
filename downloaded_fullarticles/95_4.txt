We should go, you and me! I’ll find a good old spooky film. You’d love it. Getting lost in it, it’s just like magic, in a way. And sitting there in the dark next to your fella’s not so bad either.” </em></p><p>
  <em>Lily looked at him coyly and slid her hand into his. It was warm and soft and it felt like it was meant to be there. He squeezed it and felt a surge of bravery as he turned to pull her close to him, and then….</em>
</p><p>…Severus awoke to his darkened room, just as he had done every day since October. After that terrible Halloween night, he’d drawn the drapes tightly across the windows and then used a series of enchantments to block out all remaining light. He had just wanted to go to bed and sleep forever. He no longer cared about arbitrary things such as time or night or day. None of it mattered anymore.</p><p>She visited him in dreams often these days and he hated and loved those damned dreams in equal measure. It was like heaven to be in them and torture waking up from them. Lily was the only one he had ever truly loved, and she was gone. He had held out hope that it would all go wrong between her and that git husband of hers -- Potter. Potter had always been an overblown arse and maybe Lily would finally realize that, someday…. But now, "someday" would have no chance of happening.</p><p>He would have loved her and the baby. It wouldn’t have mattered that the baby wasn’t his. The baby was Lily’s, and anything Lily loved, he would love as well. </p><p>He rubbed his eyes in the darkness. He had no idea what time it was because he’d stopped all the clocks after that October night. He’d come very close to finishing himself off in the days after her death. He was more than fair at potion-making and he could easily have brewed up any number of draughts that would have put him gently out of his misery. But he hadn’t done it. He was ashamed to admit that in his grief, the denial phase had been strong and he had believed for a time that a witch as clever as Lily had somehow managed to escape unharmed; that the lifeless body that he had held in his arms and sobbed over that night was just a decoy, a fabrication, and the real Lily would come back when she believed it was safe. He would be there waiting for her, no matter how long it took.</p><p>He knew all along that he was being stupid, and now he knew she was truly gone. She would have come back by now for the baby if she were still alive. </p><p>And now, anything more than sleeping was simply too much effort.</p><p>As he slowly came into his senses, he acknowledged the reason he had been awakened: the basic need to use the toilet. Not only that, but the sensation had led to arousal, and he groaned as he rose from the bed and the fabric of his undergarments tightened across his groin.</p><p>He stumbled out of his room and into the corridor. His eyes immediately stung with the daylight that was filtering in from elsewhere in the house, and he squinted as he made his way into the bathroom and did his business…or attempted to, but his arousal seemed to be about more than answering nature’s call and was not easily abated. It was from that damned dream. Finally, after a lot of deep breaths and mentally reciting the list of magical properties of dragon vomit, things relaxed enough for him to empty his bladder. </p><p>He finished, washed his hands and splashed some cold water on his face before padding back to his bedroom. He sat on the edge of the bed willing himself to go back to sleep, but it soon became apparent that certain physical needs were making themselves known. </p><p>His mind flashed back to the dream and how soft her hand had felt. His cock twitched in his shorts as his brain immediately told him where it next wanted that hand to go. He put his elbows on his knees and held his head in his hands.</p><p>“FUCK!” Severus shouted, through gritted teeth. His voice sounded foreign in his ears, somehow. It had been the first word he’d said for a while. </p><p>He lay back down in bed and curled into a ball, willing himself to just fall asleep again. But he couldn’t. There was an old familiar urge, deep down in the pit of his stomach, sending the blood toward his manhood. There would be no sleep until this was dealt with. </p><p>He let out a sigh and rolled over onto his back, sliding his hand down the front of his shorts. He closed his eyes and immediately remembered the softness of Lily’s hand in that dream. </p><p><em>It’s her hand…hers. </em>His cock rapidly grew hard.</p><p>He squeezed gently and let out a softer sigh. Moisture had begun to escape from the tip already, so he brushed it with the palm of his hand and began to stroke himself, slowly.</p><p>“<em>Oh, Severus…”  </em>Her voice was low and raspy in his ear. He remembered her coy look from the dream. </p><p>
  <em>She’s lying here beside you. It’s Lily’s hand….</em>
</p><p>He couldn’t stop the words escaping his lips: <em>Oh, Lily, don’t stop….</em></p><p>Stroking faster now. Hips rocking, thighs clenching.</p><p>“<em>Severus, it feels so good when you do that to me,” </em>she moaned in his ear.</p><p>So close. </p><p>
  <em>You have no idea how badly I wanted this for us, Lily.</em>
</p><p>“<em>Me too, Severus, please, take me now!”</em></p><p>Back arched. Eyes squeezed shut, heart racing, gasping for air. In his mind's eye, he had become one with her, her body soft and warm beneath him. Where he ended and she began was indistinguishable. He cried out her name and in his ear she did the same for him.</p><p>He felt the rush of release and sunk down into the mattress as he finished. His pulse throbbed in his ears, and he longed more than anything to have been able to feel Lily envelop him as she came to her own climax. He felt a pang in his heart and became sharply aware of the fact that the room was empty and he was alone. </p><p>He felt absolutely pathetic at that moment. Lily was gone. You can't love what's gone. He wished he could convince himself of that. </p><p> </p>
