  <em> The Doctor sprinted across the room, trying to escape the gun blast. He wrenched the blue TARDIS door open and dove in, but he was still caught in the blast. Aware of the origin of the gun, the Doctor ran to the lab and began trying to mix an antidote. As he finished, he injected it into his neck. But the gun blast was already taking effect. It was a de-aging gun, a very clever weapon, as it left no trace of the victim. He felt the regeneration beginning, as he hurried to make another antidote, as the first one was only to preserve personality, as each regeneration had their own prefered way of creating chemical compositions. With a flash of energy, he was all big ears again. He continued to degenerate until he managed to complete his formula with only two regenerations to spare, but it took awhile for the composition to take effect. Before he knew it, he was on his last regeneration and aging down until he finally felt the effects stop. Running to the mirror, he looked at the reflection staring back. He looked seventeen, give or take. His hair was brown and he had pale blue-green eyes. Returning to his lab, he created another formula, trying to reage himself. Because his initial formula was rushed, he found that he had a while to wait before his new formula would take place. At least a year. He signed as the TARDIS groaned unhappily, there were too many paradoxes and she didn’t like it. She began to dematerializing, no, they were crashing. The TARDIS shook and crashed, smashing into who knows where. “Where have you taken me?” The Doctor asked, stroking the console as the TARDIS went silent. The she refused to tell him, so the only thing he could do was open the door.</em>
