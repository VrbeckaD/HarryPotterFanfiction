          <div class="userstuff"><p>The exams were fast approaching and Remus knew he had to study. Study, study, study. But, Remus also knew his boyfriend and he long ago noticed that the more he needed to focus on something, the more Sirius found it entertaining to tease him. And as Remus was <em>stupidly</em> attracted to him, Sirius almost always won. That’s why, Remus knew better than to test whether his will got any stronger. It was much easier to just avoid Sirius for a couple of days. Maybe not <em>much easier</em>, as they shared a dorm and some classes, but definitely easier than dealing with his puppy, silver eyes (how can a human even have silver eyes? it was certainly not natural and certainly not fair), the most adorably annoying pout in the world, and the worst pick up lines ever, which, he was embarrassed to admit even to himself, worked on him.</p><p>On the first day, he got up before the other boys, went to grab some toast and coffee from the kitchen, and then headed to the library. It was safe for now, although in the days to come, Sirius will most certainly start looking for him in there, so, after 3 productive hours, he borrowed as many books as he could carry and went to his classes. Fortunately, he didn’t share any with Sirius before the lunch. He skipped the meal, grabbing some food from the kitchen, again, and creeping into the Gryffindor Common Room, which was empty as everyone was still in the Great Hall, to look through his books.</p><p>He spent an hour curled into one of the softest armchairs, making notes and bookmarking the more useful pages. He checked the time and went to the dungeons for double potions. That’s where he finally met two of his friends for the first time this day. Well, for the first time with them being conscious.</p><p>’Moony! Where have you been all day!?’ James called from the other end of the corridor and Sirius looked up, his eyes lighting up, that little smile appearing on his face at the sight of his boyfriend. Remus’ chest clenched.</p><p>
  <em>No, no, no. Stop that right now.</em>
</p><p>When he was close enough to be able to answer without shouting, he said in a neutral tone ‘Library.’</p><p>He stopped close to them and Sirius momentarily grabbed Remus’ waist with his arms, nose nuzzling into his neck.</p><p>
  <em>Oh no.</em>
</p><p>‘I missed you Moony.’ he whispered, soft lips brushing against Remus’ skin, just above the collar of his crisp, white shirt.</p><p>
  <em>God how I missed you too. But, no, no, I have to study, I can’t get distracted.</em>
</p><p>Sirius looked up, placing his chin on Remus’ shoulder, and looking at him with those gorgeous, silver eyes. The amount of affection in his gaze making it hard not to blush. ‘All that time in the library? You didn’t come to lunch Remus! That’s bad, you need to eat.’ Sirius’ voice came a bit muffled.</p><p>'Yeah, I guess.’ Moony answered untangling himself gently from Sirius and looking away from those <em>evil</em> eyes, which could win him over in one second. While turning, he managed to notice Sirius' gaze changing into a pensive one.</p><p>‘You should have come Moony,<em> someone</em> put fireworks in Snivellus’ food and it exploded just on its way to his mouth.’ James laughed loudly, proud of his mischief making skills, gaining a quiet snort from Remus who was still trying hard not to look at his boy and keep his voice casual ‘I wonder who that <em>someone</em> was’. </p><hr/><p>As Remus was always rubbish at potions (of course, rubbish in Remus’ dictionary means <em>not as excellent as in everything else</em>) he, since year one, had sat with Sirius who, like Slughorn liked to describe it ‘had a natural knack and obviously inherited the talent from his famous ancestors’, and Sirius liked to grind his teeth at every mention of his family. Since their seventh year started they had been brewing <em>really</em> advanced potions, so they usually didn't talk much, to Remus’ relief, too focused. And that day was no different. After the period though, as they were packing, Sirius intertwined their fingers, startling the other boy.</p><p>'Let’s go to dinner. You have to eat properly.’ Voice a little concerned, he squeezed Remus’ hand smiling at him, nevertheless, with some kind of worry in his eyes. Remus looked at his face and smiled, quickly averting his gaze to their fingers.</p><p>'I'll meet you in the Great Hall. I have to check something quickly.’ he squeezed Sirius’ hand back and smiled at their hands, not daring to deal with his stare. He knew he would agree on everything, but he didn’t have time for that, he had to study. He rushed out of the classroom, before Sirius could ask him about anything.</p><p>'What’s with him?’ Sirius turned his face to meet James’ and Lily’s puzzled expressions. As Peter ditched Potions after their fifth year and Lily was becoming more fond of James, to his bliss, they started sharing a desk with the beginning of their seventh year.</p><p>'I dunno.’</p><hr/><p>Despite Remus’ promise, he did not show up at the dinner. Instead he went to the dorm, grabbed some books, parchment and other necessary things, took the Marauder’s Map, so the others couldn't find him, after all Sirius and James weren't the only mischief makers, and went to the top of the Astronomy Tower, as the library was no longer a safe spot. Sirius would probably go there right after dinner in a search.</p><p>He came back when everyone else was asleep, after a quick visit to the kitchen, took a hot shower and got into his bed as silently as he could.</p><hr/><p>The next days followed the pattern. He left the dorm and came back in when everyone else was asleep, skipped most of the meals and pretended to be too focused to talk during classes. His friends were becoming more and more uneasy, but the OWLs were coming, Remus was studying. Logical. He would die from exhaustion, but it was nothing new that Remus was a crazy nerd. The thing was, James and Peter hadn’t really noticed what Sirius, obviously, had the first day. Remus was running away from any physical contact with him. He dodged his arms when the boy tried to close him in an embrace during the short moments they actually saw each other, he stopped holding Sirius' hand during classes (and they had <em>always</em> held hands during classes), not to talk about kisses or different activities. And it wasn’t that <em>that</em> worried Sirius the most, but it was just very <em>weird</em>, it was yet another evidence (as if he needed any more) that something was wrong, and it was an evidence that this thing had to do with Sirius personally. But what the fuck did he do this time? He had no idea.</p><p>When a whole week had passed and Remus didn't seem to plan to explain anything at all, Sirius got fed up. Of course, he tried to wait for Remus in the evenings a couple of times, but he always dozed off before Remus came back (three times on Moony’s bed, making him sigh with affection at the view, and tempting to join his boyfriend there, because he missed this boy <em>so</em> much, but occupying Pads’ instead). He also tried getting up before Remus, but he gave up on the first day when he woke up at 5 A.M. and Remus wasn’t there.</p><p>So, after their double History of Magic on a Friday evening, he stood up, giving James and Peter a piercing gaze. ‘Go get some dinner, don't you dare come back to the dorm before I tell you so.’ Then, he gripped Remus’ wrist, hard enough that he couldn't escape without quite an effort, but not hard enough to hurt, and led him to their dorm as quickly as possible, not sparing a single glance at their things or the bewildered boys. He pulled Remus through the door, casting silencing and locking spells on them.</p><p>’Sirius, what the fuck?’</p><p>‘Yeah Remus, same question, <em>what the fuck</em>?’</p><p>Remus stared at his boyfriend.</p><p>After a heavy silence stretched between them, Sirius gave up.</p><p>‘Oh c'mon Remus! You haven't kissed me for a week, you haven't as much as touched me for a week, you haven't even talked to me.’ he said, losing his temper, voice rising. He paused to take a couple of steadying breaths and said in a much smaller, almost defeated tone. ‘Remus we’ve been friends for seven years and together for almost 8 months now, if I did something wrong just tell me. What is this about? Because I’ve honestly no idea, but I know I can be quite an asshole sometimes.’ he let out a quivering breath. ‘Or did I - I dont know, did I bore you? You want to end this? If you think it was a mistake just tell me, bloody hell, I don't want to hear that, but Remus I don't want to lose you. Just tell me what’s wrong so I can work on that and if not as your boyfriend anymore I'll take as a friend, that's okay too, well, no it’s fucking not, but I’ll deal with it. Just don't shut me out. You guys are my family, my only true family, I can’t lose any of you. And <em>you</em> especially. This week was- it was fucking hell, I can’t <em>be</em> like that. Just, just talk to me, <em>please.</em>’</p><p>He was begging, his voice was cracking and when Remus’ shock started to fade away and he slowly started to understand what Sirius was saying, he felt guilt flooding his whole body and he wanted to rip himself into pieces for how he made him feel. He would have never imagined Sirius could interpret it like that. He thought it was obvious. Sirius provided all the possible distractions when Remus studied, especially when Remus <em>had</em> to study, and Sirius knew, he had to know, that Remus wasn't able to tell him no, so if he wanted to study, he had to get away from Sirius for a bit. Logical. Simple. <em>Obvious</em>. How could Sirius <em>not know</em> that, how could he be scared. He was Sirius Black. Everyone wanted him (to Remus’ distaste). Even James once "joked", that if Sirius was interested... well. It was Remus Lupin who wasn’t good enough for Sirius, but, god knows why, that boy <em>wanted</em> him. And it was Remus who has been always scared, deep down, that Sirius will finally get bored of him.</p><p>But, he was silent. He was silent for too long, making it even worse, making Sirius positively freak out. Although he still wasn't able to process the concept of Sirius being scared that Remus would reject him, he closed the distance between them and cupped Sirius’ face gently in his hands.</p><p>'Bloody hell, Sirius you’re such a drama queen. You’re so stupid sometimes.’ his soft voice contradicted his words, but that didn't help in the slightest. The sight of Sirius' glassy eyes shattered Remus’ heart and the knowledge that it was all his fault made him think he was even more of a monster than he ever considered himself. ‘You did nothing wrong Sirius, I had to study and I can’t study when you’re around because, fuck, I can’t focus on anything when you stare at me with those eyes of yours, flip your hair and just- just do all the other stuff. That’s all. You’re too much of a distraction. I thought you knew that. I’ll never get fucking bored of you. I’ll never fucking leave you. I hate myself for making you this miserable, I really do! I had no idea I made you feel this way.' he stopped to give him an even fiercer look. ‘I love you Sirius.’</p><p>Although he was beginning to calm down a little throughout that short speech, and he was leaning slowly into Remus’ palms, he froze at the last four words and stared at Remus, face blank, eyes astonished.</p><p>‘Breathe.’ he didn't even notice he stopped until he heard Remus’ gentle whisper. He examined his face and despite the calm voice Remus was becoming uneasy. His eyebrows furrowed almost unnoticeable, nostrils widened, barely, but Sirius could still catch it, pupils thinned, mouth stiffened only just. He didn't really look worried, certainly not to others, Remus was good at keeping his face in check, but Sirius knew. Sirius knew he was dying inside from the uncertainty, maybe he said too much, maybe he shouldn’t have rushed it. But, oh, he so should have and it was so good he did.</p><p>Sirius placed his hands on Remus' nape, tangling his fingers into his hair, tousled and gold in the late, afternoon sun that was slipping through the window. He closed the distance between them, looking intently at Remus, waiting for his small nod, and when he got the approval, he placed his needy lips on Moony’s full, a bit rough, stress-bitten, <em>perfect</em> ones. It took Remus by surprise how he missed this boy and he wondered how could he have not realised it sooner. Their kiss was gentle but eager and soon enough Remus felt Sirius’ tongue caressing his lower lip, he smiled into the kiss, and gasped quietly when he felt slender fingers explore his back and pull him closer. After some indeterminate time, they broke apart, breathing heavily and Remus placed his forehead on Sirius’ shoulder.</p><p>’I'm so sorry Sirius, I-’</p><p>‘Shut up.’ Padfoot answered without any heat, Remus could hear him smiling. He leaned back and cupped Remus' chin in a silent request to look him in the eyes. Remus did, his mouth swollen and red, hair even messier than usually, all blushed, all <em>beautiful</em>, but still, with guilt in his eyes.</p><p>‘I love you Remus.’ A happiness so genuine, however still accompanied by disbelief, filled his eyes and flooded the rest of Monny’s face, which was an expression not at all often seen. ‘And don't you dare,<em> ever</em> again, say you hate yourself! We had the talk, I thought I got to you, but we can do that again.’ he sounded frighteningly similar to McGonagall and one corner of Remus’ lips twitched, but all that bliss quickly gave place to a much grimmer expression.</p><p>’I hurt you, I-’</p><p>‘No.’ he gave Remus a stern look. ‘No,’ with a sigh Sirius continued, never turning his eyes from Remus’ ‘you’re just an oblivious moron, but so am I.'</p><p>Remus snarled at it. 'I guess I should have just talked to you.'</p><p>'You should have, but it's also possible that I would still try to distract you' Sirius smirked. 'I guess I should have just asked you what's going on earlier on and not let myself overthink it all.'</p><p>'I'm sorry.'</p><p>'We're good.'</p><p>Remus let a smile climb onto his face, which gained him Sirius’ most beautiful grin in reward. They looked at each other with appreciation and fondness, leaning closer until their foreheads touched, lips brushing again.</p><p>THE DORM’S DOOR CRASHED OPEN AS JAMES HURLED IN WITH WORRIED LOOKS, WAND IN HAND AND PETER AT HIS BACK.</p><p>He scanned the room, then rolled his eyes hiding his wand and crossing arms.</p><p>’Honestly guys? We were fucking worried. I’ve been banging on the door and trying to open it for ages. Thought you two died or something.’</p><p>'I will fucking kill you Prongs.’ </p></div>
