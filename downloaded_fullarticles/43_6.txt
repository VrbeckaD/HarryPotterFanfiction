</p><p> </p><p>He had been such a fool.<br/><br/>How could he have ever allowed himself to dive into this ice cold pond with that damn locket around his neck?<br/><br/>He knew this adventure would be dangerous, but he expected to die at the wand of Lord Voldemort, not but while still hunting for his horcruxes.<br/><br/>The young wizard's heart pounded without remorse, so much so that it felt as though it would explode out of his chest.<br/><br/>This was it and he knew it; as he desperately thrusted his fists against the solid chuck of ice currently holding him captive.<br/><br/>It was useless and he knew it as another bubble of air left his struggling lungs.<br/><br/>He should have gotten Hermione, he should have told her; now no one knew he was here.<br/><br/>The young wizard lowered his gaze to sword.<br/><br/>His eyes half closed as fatigue began to eat him alive.<br/><br/>He was so close, yet so far as he began to no longer feel a part of this world.<br/> <br/>His eyes searched the murky depths one last time, trying to figure a way out, there must be something he had missed.<br/><br/>This couldn't be it.<br/><br/>His heart grew louder in his ears as hope continued to fade from his grasp.<br/> <br/>It was time, darkness began to consume his surroundings as he released what air remained in his lungs.<br/><br/>He closed his eyes, accepting his fate to become part of this frozen, still world. </p><p> </p><p align="center">~*~*~</p><p> </p><p>This wasn't working.<br/><br/>Snape clenched his jaw as he watched the hole in the ice begin reform, assuming it's original shape as a flawless sheet of ice.<br/><br/>He began to pace, knowing full well the act was dangerous and only increased his chance of being caught by the wrong group of people.</p><p>That was a fate he truly could not afford.<br/><br/>Either way it would no longer matter if Potter were to meet his fate at the bottom of that pond before he even had a chance to face off against the dark lord.<br/><br/>The new Hogwarts Headmaster muttered under his breath as he strode toward the pond with visible intent.<br/> <br/>Did he really have to do everything himself? Then again Dumbledore hadn't exactly given him much choice, nor had he given Potter much direction.<br/><br/>Snape shook the thoughts from his head as he approached the edge of the pond.<br/><br/>He wasted no time as he withdrew his wand before aiming it at the sheet of ice.<br/><br/>Within a fraction of a second, the ice was gone.<br/><br/>The headmaster searched the dark depths of the pond, quickly locating Potter's seemingly lifeless form as it floated towards the pond's depths.<br/><br/>Snape shook his head as he tore his robe off, not turning around to see where it landed before diving into the icy depths. <br/><br/>Perhaps he should have placed the sword in a more convenient location and spared himself this somewhat uncomfortable scenario.<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>He couldn't dwell on that now, at the end of the day, the sword still had to put in a secure place. <br/><br/></p><p> </p><p align="center">~*~*~</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry gasped as a surge of water jolted him into what awareness he could muster.<br/><br/>What was that? <br/><br/>A force tightened around his waist, almost threateningly as he felt his body being drawn upward.<br/><br/>He commanded his body to move, yet it failed to respond as the light of the moon grew stronger in his eyes.<br/><br/>What was this mysterious shadow saving him?<br/><br/>Harry didn't have time to dwell on it as his face broke the surface of the water. His lungs instinctively heaved as they desperately craved oxygen.<br/><br/>The young wizard struggled to fill his lungs as he felt himself being dragged from the water's edge.<br/><br/>He couldn't resist his curiosity any more as he summoned all the strength that remained in his body. He forced his gaze upward, soon locking eyes with the one man he least expected.<br/><br/>"S-Snape?" Harry spluttered as he attempted to expel the fluid violating his lungs.<br/><br/>"Potter." Snape spat, returning the greeting as he dragged his ex pupil through endless piles of dead leaves before finally plonking him down against the stump of a tree.<br/><br/>"What are you doing here?" Harry stammered, not making an effort to mask his surprise.<br/><br/>"What does it look like Potter." Snape's condescending drawl echoed through the cold night as he stood towering over his ex student.<br/><br/>Harry nodded, trying to process the events that had just occurred; did they even really happen?<br/><br/>He made no effort to mask the confusion in his eyes as he looked up at the man.<br/><br/>Why was Snape helping him?<br/><br/>The man had killed Dumbledore, his favorite headmaster without hesitation.<br/><br/>Why would he now dive into this frozen pond to rescue him?<br/><br/>The young wizard opened his mouth to speak, only his lips remained lost for words as his mind scrambled to formulate a sentence.<br/><br/>Harry gasped, suddenly instinctively sliding his arms around his wet form; it was a vein attempt to cover his exposed flesh.<br/><br/>How could he forget he was naked?<br/><br/>Especially right in front of his most despised Hogwarts teacher.<br/><br/>"Come on Potter." Snape growled, his voice low as he resisted the urge to roll his eyes.<br/><br/>He slid his fingers into the pocket of his robe, swiftly withdrawing his wand before aiming it directly at Harry's dripping chest.<br/><br/>The mere essence of a moment had past and the young wizard was surrounded by the warmth of a blanket.<br/><br/>The Headmaster's stern expression was unwavering as he glared down at the disheveled state of his ex pupil.</p><p>The headmaster effortlessly turned on his heel before stepping away from the chosen one.<br/><br/>"Snape wait!" Harry yelled, the desperation in his voice echoing through the otherwise silent forest. <br/><br/>Snape stalled at the summoning of his name, yet refused to turn around.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was the desperation that had truly stopped him in his step; or perhaps he wanted to see Lily's eyes one last time.<br/><br/>"Just answer me this, why did you save me?" Harry stumbled, trying desperately to climb to his feet as he held the blanket close to his bare groin.<br/><br/>"That's not really your concern now is it Potter?"<br/><br/>"How is it not my concern?" Harry all but spat as he rose to his feet.<br/><br/>Snape sighed before glaring at his surroundings; it didn't seem to matter were he was, he always felt as though someone were watching him.<br/><br/>It was risky enough just interacting with Potter for these mere moments, he couldn't afford to get caught by the dark lord; it would ruin every thing he had worked for these many years.<br/><br/>Damn it.<br/><br/>The draw was too strong as Snape turned on his heel, his eyes locking with the young wizard's.<br/><br/>It didn't matter how many times he had seen Potter's eyes, they always drew him back.<br/><br/>"You need to be more careful Potter." Snape spat, stating the obvious as his eyes drifted to the item dangling from the boy's neck.<br/><br/>"It is far too dangerous to have this item so close to you Potter."<br/><br/>"I know that, but how am I supposed to keep it safe until I can destroy it?" Harry all but whined as he pointed at the offending object.<br/><br/>Snape closed his lips before raising his wand toward the pond.<br/><br/>In a moment the sword was floating above the water.<br/><br/>"Destroy it, now." The older wizard commanded, leaving no doubt as to his desired intentions.<br/><br/>"Why do you want me to destroy it so badly for? I thought you were on his side. Why do you want him dead?"<br/><br/>"Damn it Potter, just do as I say." Snape spat as the sword hovered toward the pair before falling at the young wizard's feet.<br/><br/>Harry stared intently in to the man's eyes, searching for a truth he could believe.<br/><br/>What was this man's real motive? <br/><br/>Was he so sure he could trust him?<br/><br/>He did just save his life after all.<br/><br/>And hand him the sword of gryffindor.<br/><br/>Harry eyed the wizard before him dubiously, yet despite all the bad things Snape had done, a part of the young wizard felt as though he could trust him.<br/><br/>He was part of the Order at one point. <br/><br/>Harry yielded to the older wizard, nodding as he yanked the locket from around his neck and grasped the sword within fingers.<br/><br/>He proceeded to toss the locket into a pile of dead leaves a few metres away.<br/><br/>He grasped the sword tighter before drawing himself to his knees.<br/><br/>He felt his body stumble slightly in the process before feeling his body collide face first towards the earth before him.<br/><br/>He winced as he braced his body for impact, only, his face never seemed to hit the dirt. It took a moment for him to realise he was being supported by a firm grip around his wrist.<br/><br/>He didn't need to look up to know who it was this time, yet instinct told him to do so despite already knowing the answer.<br/><br/>"Come on Potter, this will only take a moment." Snape muttered as he lined the young wizard in front of the locket.<br/><br/>It seemed he really did have to do everything himself.<br/><br/>Harry could sense the frustration encapsulated within the Headmaster's voice.<br/><br/>But why was he so determined to have to locket destroyed right this minute?<br/><br/>Was it because he didn't want to get caught near the boy who lived?<br/><br/>Or was it because he wanted to make sure, beyond the shadow of a doubt that this horcrux was destroyed and wont fall into the wrong hands again.<br/><br/>"Dumbledore set you a difficult task." Snape stated, his tone slightly softer as he turned to the boy.<br/><br/>"Difficult, but not impossible." Harry reaffirmed, more to himself than Snape as he rose the sword into the air.<br/><br/>"Remember Potter, think about nothing but the task you are doing. The Dark Lord will try to penetrate your mind once you hit the locket. You cannot afford to give away your location."<br/><br/>Harry turned to the man.<br/><br/>Was he truly that concerned for him?<br/><br/>Or was he really only concerned about himself?<br/><br/>Of course he would not want the Dark Lord to know he was helping him, but if that was his only motivation, then why would he deliver the sword to him?<br/><br/>Harry shook his head, he couldn't afford to get distracted any more, he simply had to focus as he braced his mind for the impending assault.<br/>  <br/>"Now Potter."<br/><br/>The young wizard obeyed without question as he drove the sword into the locket without further hesitation.<br/><br/>Harry dropped the sword, a current of dark energy violated every fibre of his being.<br/><br/>A feeling so vile it made him fall to his knees. <br/><br/>All this time later and he was still allowing himself to be affected by the Dark Lord's magic.<br/><br/>Why did he never seem to grow any stronger against this darkness?<br/><br/>Where was his resistance?<br/><br/>"Are you alright Potter?" Snape whispered, almost as though he were attempting to soothe a child, instead of what Harry presumed was his most despised pupil.  <br/><br/>"Don't worry, it's over now." Snape continued before summoning the blanket, that now lay amongst the dead leaves before and wrapping it around the young wizard.<br/><br/>"Headmaster?" Harry whispered, still struggling to see Snape as anything more than his potions professor.<br/><br/>"What is it Potter?"<br/><br/>"Why do you hate me so much?"<br/><br/>Snape exhaled softly, as though taking the time to choose his words wisely.<br/><br/>"I don't hate you Harry."<br/><br/>The young wizard turned his gaze toward the man, a mixture of confusion and doubt was rife in his eyes.<br/><br/>"I never did."<br/><br/>The man's words still failed to clarify anything within Harry's heart as he pulled the blanket tighter around himself.<br/><br/>"Then why did you always single me out in class and-"<br/><br/>"So you believe I hated you?"<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"Then the Dark Lord would believe it also."<br/><br/>Harry turned to the man, his eyebrows furrowed in confusion; yet the light in his eyes suggested that the Headmaster's words were starting to make sense.<br/><br/>"But then why did you kill Dumbledore?"<br/><br/>The headmaster took a deep breath, as though using the moment to concentrate his thoughts.<br/><br/>"One of the horcruxes, the ring, inflicted a curse upon Albus. It would not be long before it would ultimately cause his death." Snape began, his voice barely above a whisper as his eyes simultaneously searched the horizon of the forest; as though anticipating the approach of an enemy.<br/><br/>"He asked me to kill him, he believed it was the only way the Dark Lord would trust me completely."<br/><br/>"And he was right." Snape added, turning his attention toward the young wizard.<br/><br/>A silence fell between the two, it seemed as though it would last the night, yet at the same moment, it seemed as though it evaded time itself.<br/><br/>Him and Snape, two souls that were world's apart, yet frighteningly similar.<br/><br/>"Harry, you have her eyes, how could I have ever hated you?" Snape drawled, doubting this opportunity would ever present itself again in his life time. <br/><br/>Either Harry or him would be long dead before this scenario ever played out again.<br/><br/>Harry was never alone.<br/><br/>Not to mention this vulnerable.<br/><br/>Only in this state would the young wizard have ever given him the time of day.<br/><br/>"You must be freezing." Snape murmured, his deep voice barely above a whisper as he drew the young wizard's blanket tighter still.<br/><br/>Harry slowly nodded, surprising himself at his own reaction.<br/><br/>Ordinarily he would have flinched at the contact, yet something had changed.<br/><br/>"You knew my mother?" Harry looked up at the man, surprised by the man's earlier words.<br/><br/>"Yes."<br/><br/>"How?"<br/><br/>"She grew up not far from me." The headmaster confided, leaning in closer to the young wizard, as though he wished solely for the young man to hear the words and no one else.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was shame binding him to his secrecy; or perhaps something personal, like a precious memory that will only relinquish it's beauty should it be shared.<br/><br/>A light grew in Harry's eyes as he pondered this thought, yet he suspected he already knew the answer.<br/><br/>"I miss her." Harry whispered, his heart not willing to release the words, yet his lips did so anyway.<br/><br/>"Strange, considering I hardly knew her, I know." The young wizard added, his eyes searching the endless expansive darkness.<br/><br/>"You're not the only one." Snape sighed before turning to the younger wizard.<br/><br/>"And it's not so strange."<br/><br/>Harry closed his eyes, his lips parted themselves, as though driven by instinct.<br/><br/>Snape could no longer ignore the suppleness of Harry's lips.<br/><br/>There wasn't time. <br/><br/>Surely he wasn't just going to have his way with Lily's son, the chosen one, in the middle of a forest. Each of them surrounded by endless piles of dead leaves.<br/><br/>But it had to be here, it had to be now or never.<br/><br/>"Harry, I-"<br/><br/>"It's okay." Harry whispered, as though already knowing what the headmaster would say.<br/><br/>The young wizard knew there was no coming back from what he was about to do, yet his heart wouldn't have it any other way.<br/><br/>It all made sense now, why Snape had to be verging on nasty to him, he had to appear convincing, so much so that if Harry believed it, the Dark Lord would also.<br/><br/>He offered Snape a gentle, yet encouraging smile as he allowed the blanket to fall from his bare body.<br/><br/>He sighed as the soft echo of scrunching leaves greeted his ears.<br/><br/>He knelt before the man who was once his professor, his naked body an offering to the man.<br/><br/>Snape's eyes locked with Harry's, searching their depths for any doubt, any sign that he didn't a hundred percent desire this. <br/><br/>He found nothing but desire lurking within the young wizard's orbs.<br/><br/>Harry drifted closer, until his face stood mere inches from the Headmaster's. <br/><br/>He admired Harry, though he would never admit that to the young wizard; but lately it had become more than that, perhaps he really was, dare he think it, developing feelings for Harry.<br/><br/>This whole time he had been reminiscing over Lily, yet Harry was now at the forefront of his desires.<br/><br/>But why?<br/><br/>The headmaster was jolted from his thoughts as warm, wet lips pressed against his.<br/><br/>He knew he should resist, push him away, move back at least, yet his body remained paralyzed. <br/><br/>"Thank you." Harry whispered, snaking his arm around the Headmaster's shoulder's.<br/><br/>"What for?" <br/><br/>"Saving me." The young wizard smiled as he pressed his bare chest against Snape's.<br/><br/>"Well, I cant have you dying before the climax now, can I?" The headmaster smirked, an expression that alluded to an alternative meaning.<br/><br/>"Speaking of climax." The alternative meaning was not lost on Harry as he pulled Snape on top of him in one swift movement.<br/><br/>Snape offered Harry the vague essence of a smile before planting a kiss on his still damp cheek.  <br/><br/>It didn't stop there as Snape continued to cover the young wizard's body in kisses until he reached the man's groin.<br/><br/>Harry watched the older wizard, wondering if he would stop, but praying he wouldn't.<br/><br/>His prayer was granted as a wet warmth engulfed his penis.<br/><br/>Harry gasped, unable to control his moans as they escaped his lips.<br/><br/>He grasped the back of Snape's head, sliding his fingers through what he assumed would be greasy hair; only he was surprised to find it was not greasy, but silky.<br/><br/>Harry felt any lingering resistance slipping away as he spread his leg wider, granting Snape easier access.<br/><br/>Harry had never felt anything even remotely like this before as he ground his hips; attempting to extract more pleasure from the man's lips.<br/><br/>He had no idea anything could feel this great as the warmth tightened around his cock.<br/><br/>He was as close to heaven as he had ever been, if only the remainder of his life could play out like this.<br/><br/>"What the bloody hell is going on here?!" A voiced yelled out from across the forest.<br/><br/>Harry gasped, his heart suddenly pounding as he instinctively pulled away from the Headmaster's grasp.<br/> <br/>Ron?<br/><br/>What the hell was he doing here?<br/><br/>"You get your dirty hands off of him, you hear?" Ron demanded as he instinctively ran towards his best friend.<br/><br/>Harry froze, panic consuming him as each footstep grew steadily louder.<br/><br/>"Fraternizing with the enemy are we? After all that stuff you told us he did." Ron began, his voice creeping steadily louder with every word that passed his lips.<br/><br/>It was too late now, what had been seen could never be unseen.<br/><br/>Snape turned to face the redhead, his eyes brimming with annoyance as he studied the unwelcome intruder.<br/><br/>In a moment Snape was gone, vanishing into a veil of darkness; as though he had never actually been there at all.<br/><br/>Harry closed his eyes, a mixture of desire to savor the memory and not wanting to meet the condescending gaze of his best friend.<br/><br/>"What the bloody hell were you thinking man?" Ron shook his head in disbelief, reaching down to retrieve the blanket before tossing it at his best friend.<br/><br/>"I know, did he use a spell on you? That has to be it, there's no way you would spread'em wide for that greasy git otherwise." <br/><br/>Ron's words would make sense in a sane world, however this was far from a sane world.<br/><br/>"Don't worry Harry, I'll get him back, that's what friends do for each other isn't it."<br/><br/>Harry leaned back, gathering the blanket Snape had conjured within his grasp.<br/><br/>"Come on, lets go." Harry sighed, using the blanket to hide his groin before standing up and turning for the tent. He knew there was no use explaining anything to Ron, the redhead had made up his mind a long time ago, albeit a lot of his opinions were formed by Harry's own words. <br/><br/>Perhaps it would be easier just to let Ron believe it was a spell. <br/><br/>"Hey mate, don't you even want to say hi? Ask me how I got here?" Ron's pitch increased, the concern and apprehension apparent in his voice.<br/><br/>A smile began to trail across Harry's lips.<br/><br/>"Look by your feet Ron." Harry smirked, not bothering to turn around as he started for the safety and warmth offered by the tent.<br/><br/>"Wait, whats that?" Ron screwed up his face as he knelt down, collecting the sword of Gryffindor, accompanied by the locket, within his grasp.<br/><br/>"How did you-?"<br/><br/>"You can thank the greasy git." Harry laughed before waltzing inside the tent.</p>
