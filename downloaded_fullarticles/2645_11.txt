    <p>It had been years since Newt had wandered down the halls of Hogwarts.</p><p>Little about them had changed. As Newt walked quickly through the corridors toward the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, he considered the same chipped bricks that he’d spent years running past, the dim candles that seemed to never run out, the residual scent of burning wood and old leaves. It was the familiarity of being back and falling into habits. In minutes he’d be rounding the corner of the classroom, not quite late to the lesson but kissing the line in a way that earned him <em> zero </em>favors.</p><p>He could imagine it easily. The soft sigh of admonishment before Dumbledore said, “Newt, how is it that <em> every day </em> you're late?”</p><p>Perhaps the simplest answer had always been that Newt liked routine. He gripped the handle of his case more tightly and thought about his beasts. He’d met his Niffler by accident; sitting in a park every evening for a month watching the muggles hurriedly go about their business. Just once, he had made the mistake of carrying around his mother’s old necklace (a Hippogriff relic from her time as a breeder) and it hadn’t taken more than once for Nelly to crawl her way out of her burrow and sneak into his pocket to take it. Three more trips in and he’d wrangled her into his case. They’d become quick companions after.</p><p>Newt had learned so much from his compulsive repetitions. He was only in this building because of them, and he’d gained more than he’d ever lost from following his impulses.</p><p>As he reached the room, Newt adjusted his large yellow and gray scarf around his neck and walked in. It was winter outside but the inside of the school was warm and cozy, the classroom exceptionally so. There was the smell of pine and the soft sound of music leaking from the back of the classroom, but Dumbledore was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>“<em> ...trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers. If you want the things you love, you must have showers. So when you hear it thunder, don’t run under a tree…” </em></p><p>Newt walked past the empty desks to the back of the room. He set his case down and removed his scarf timidly. He breifly wondered where his old professor had walked off to, but the distracting scribbles on the board that outlined the initial effects of lycanthropy caught Newt's eye and he moved closer to read what the board said, eyes squinted at Dumbledore’s terrible writing.</p><p>“Lycanthropy, or werewolfry, is highly contagious. The illness is spread via bodily fluids which must enter the bloodstream in order to be effective.  It is not genetically inherited and thus persons with direct relation to a lycanthrope will not be at risk for contracting the illness. There is no cure for Lycanthropy, though its effects can be mitigated by use of potions, spells, and otherwise. A werewolf will only harm humans. It is not uncommon then, and is in fact important for them to make friends with other animals that they encounter while transformed.”</p><p>“Why, I wonder?”</p><p>Newt sucked in a breath so sharply that his chest hurt. He spun around from the board, almost knocking it over in the process. Dumbledore was standing in the corner of the room with one hand in his pocket and the other cradling a small, glowing orb. Newt cleared his throat and looked down at his briefcase. He’d left it sitting between the two of them, rocking steadily from side to side.</p><p>“Because otherwise they attack themselves,” Newt answered. His voice was shaking but it felt impossible for him to not answer. Werewolves had always been one of his favorite subjects.</p><p>“Out of frustration, out of a lack of awareness, out of… loneliness. I assume that making friends with the other animals is a welcome distraction. Though correct me if I’m wrong; many animals are social by nature and so perhaps it’s none of the above.”</p><p>“It’s much easier to survive with larger numbers,” Newt agreed.</p><p>Dumbledore always seemed to exude tranquility. He walked towards Newt, rolling the orb in his hand as he closed the gap between them. He was smiling widely, his blue eyes creased around the edges, and Newt noticed that his hair had gotten just a bit longer. His beard had grown in, too. There were so many minute differences about Dumbledore that were noticeable, but none that had tampered with his charm.</p><p>“It is good to see you Newt. It’s been a bit of time, hasn’t it?”</p><p>“Three years,” Newt clarified. He watched as Dumbledore shoved his trinket in his pocket and then grabbed the handle of his briefcase and lifted the battered thing off of the ground. It lifted easily and Dumbledore raised his eyebrows, shocked. Newt quickly stuttered, “I’ve expanded the… the inside. I haven’t gotten rid of any creatures.”</p><p>“No. You wouldn’t, would you?”</p><p>Dumbledore considered the case for a long moment. Behind them, the music was still playing. The song had changed but the tinny sound of Bing Crosby’s voice was still playing over the gramophone in the corner.</p><p>“Do you want to know why I’ve called you here, Newt?” Dumbledore asked suddenly. He looked up from the case with such a familiar sense of endearment that Newt had to look away. He’d always struggled to say no to Dumbledore. Whatever that meant of the man’s motivations with Newt wasn’t clear, but the unfortunate truth was that there was little the man could ask him to do that he wouldn’t atleast <em> try </em>. Before he could say yes, Dumbledore continued, “I need your help. I don’t know any person more fitting for the job than you.”</p><p>“And what is the job?” Newt asked.</p><p>“The ministry is currently going through a split. The Beast and Being divisions are arguing about the placement of werewolves in their departments and so while I’ve asked for them to send a representative to help me, I’ve gotten little correspondence from them. They’re busy with categorizing our lycanthropic friends. I’ve decided to work this case of mine alone,” Dumbledore answered quietly. He held Newt’s suitcase out to him and said, “and I know how you love cases.”</p><p>“Only ones to do with creatures.”</p><p>“Beasts, humans, or otherwise. You’re a proponent for the fair treatment of living things. That’s why I need you.”</p><p>Newt took his suitcase and held it in front of himself. He wanted to think of himself as a just and righteous man like that, but it felt wrong. Dumbledore’s praises had always been too high. And yet Newt stood wondering if he could actually turn down an opportunity to work on a project like… this. Whatever it was.</p><p>“You didn’t mention the job.”</p><p>“Ah,” Dumbledore laughed. “Yes. I’ll explain briefly. There’s a man in the south of France who has recently given up years of scientific research. He’s a lot like you, Newt. He loves animals and anything that resembles them, but he stretched himself too thin and has now become overwhelmed by his circumstances. He has neglected his duties as a caretaker for these animals and they’re dying, scared, uncared for. They're creating issues that, if they aren't taken care of, might see the ministry put all of these creatures down. Foremost is providing the care they need to survive. If we can accomplish that then the ministry has no reason to tamper with them and we can... well we can take care of the rest.”</p><p>“The animals are sick. You need a magizoologist.”</p><p>Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “I have a magizoologist. If only he’d agree to accompany me.”</p><p>Newt looked down at his case. The handle was vibrating beneath his fingers. He’d spent years cultivating the reserve inside of it. Since he’d been a student at Hogwarts, his entire world had focused itself around the creatures that he’d read about in books. It was only after he went looking for trouble that they found their way into his arms, into his home, and into every second of his life. No matter what he did, he always found himself in a position like this. He wanted to go with Dumbledore. He wanted to follow the man to France and fix the broken things he knew he’d see when he got there. It was like a habit.</p><p>No, compulsion was truly a much more strongly suited word.</p><p>“There is nobody else?” Newt asked.</p><p>“Nobody else that I’d like to ask, no,” Dumbledore admitted. “You are ideal for this opportunity. I will travel there alone if you feel overwhelmed by it. I wouldn’t think any less of you for telling me no. But I know that you would thrive in this environment. Since years ago, when you were a student of mine, you’ve been sticking your hands into situations like these. You are more curious than anyone I’ve ever met and because of it, you’re stronger than you know.”</p><p>Newt was overwhelmed. He shook his head and turned back to the board. Dumbledore’s handwriting was spread wide across the surface, snippets of information that Newt had compartmentalized so long ago that he couldn’t remember when it’d even happened. God, he wanted to go.</p><p>He wanted to go.</p><p>“I want to go,” Newt whispered. “I want to go with you.”</p><p>“Then come with me,” Dumbledore suggested. “I need you.”</p><p>And it was the moment that the words left his mouth that Newt knew it was the right choice to make. His body thrummed with an energy he hadn’t felt since the days of crawling through the woods on his hands and knees, looking for injured Murtlaps and Bowtruckles. He remembered his mother giving him his first small sanctuary; it was a box made out of glass and had five baby Bowtruckles inside, all standing on the branches of their tiny trees and looking up at Newt expectantly. Waiting for him to care for them.</p><p>It was a non-issue. Newt would never have said no to something like this.</p><p>He nodded his head and then said as firmly as possible, "Yes. Of course I'll go. When should I be ready?" </p><p> </p>
