    <p><em> The pain </em>of the lightning bolt scar on his forehead was all that Harry felt after watching Cedric’s death. Professor Dumbledore had demanded that he tell him what happened in the maze, but his mind was going haywire and he couldn’t comprehend anything that had happened. He couldn’t get Fleur's screams out of his head, the veela in her coming out and forming a high pitched shriek. Watching faces that were turned up in smiles, turn into faces that were scared, frightened, and angry. He had even started crying when he saw Cedric’s father, Amos, yell and cry on the body of his dead son.</p><p> </p><p>After watching Professor Moody turn into Barty Crouch junior and hearing him confess his own crimes; Harry had been pulled out of the room after that. The hard eyes of Professor Snape that had seemed to soften and then get cold again, before the man turned and walked away. Harry was too caught up in the start of his own self-destruction to know that the Severus Snape actually felt bad for him.</p><p> </p><p>So here Harry was listening to the harmonic thumping of the rain on the windowpane in the Black library. He hadn’t kept up with the numbers of days he had been in that spot; he didn’t need to. No one was here to tell him that he needed to eat and sleep. He doubted the Dursley’s had informed Dumbledore that he had disappeared. They were probably celebrating the fact that they had finally been able to get rid of him. Harry nearly snarled at the thought of the Dursley's celebrating his departure. He was the only living relative of Petunia and she absolutely hated him.</p><p> </p><p>The aching feeling that he had felt earlier was back and spreading through his chest cavity. His raven colored hair fell over his face in soft waves; he hadn’t bothered to do anything with it. He liked the way it fell past his shoulders, splint ends and messy. He had been malnourished before he had even gone to Hogwarts and he still was. Getting away from the Dursley’s had been good for him, to say the least, but being alone in the Black family apartment was much worse. It was dark and depressing but Harry couldn't help feel somewhat comfortable in it. </p><p> </p><p>He had no problem being alone, in fact, he preferred being alone than being with Ron and Hermione. Ever since his name had come out of the goblet, his friendship with Ron and Hermione had started to deteriorate massively. He knows that Ron was, selfishly, still upset at him for putting his name in the cup. He knows that Hermione still thought that he purposely put his name in the cup somewhat. Hell, he wouldn’t be surprised if she thought that he had killed Cedric. He could survive with all of the students in Hogwarts thinking that he killed Cedric, but not his supposedly best friends.</p><p> </p><p>Feeling his eyes get heavy, Harry slumped in his chair; his back aching and legs cramped. He sighed when he felt the aching in his back and his legs disappear into oblivion. The dark green and black colored couch wasn’t as uncomfortable as it looked. The dully polished furniture glowed as a result of the hearth that was aflame in front of him. In the corner of the room was a decadent grandfather clock laced in an outline of shimmering gold. Listening to the lullaby of the ticking grandfather clock and pelting rain, Harry’s already hooded eyes, closed and he fell into a dreamless sleep.</p><p align="center">______________________</p><p>While Harry was sleeping in the library, Kreature nearly jumped when he felt the Black family magic envelop him. His eyes watered and with a click of his bony little fingers, he was in the main foyer. The whispering had started to get louder and louder; he had immediately identified them as male. He hadn’t felt magic like this since his old masters were alive which was a long time ago. He could sense the resemblance in the magic; dark, cold, dangerous, controlled and unforgiving.</p><p> </p><p>Kreature started as three boys stood in the foyer frozen in fear of waking the sleeping portrait in front of them. Their clothes were soaked with rain and their shoes were practically made of water. He couldn't help but snarl in disgust and took in the appearances of the boys. It was only until Kreature saw faces of the three teenage boys that his eyes shined with glee. They were not what Kreatue was expected but he didn't mind. </p><p> </p><p>“I fucking told you it would work didn't I. You know what I really don’t have time for your constant negativity,” A boy said crossing his arms and folding them over his chest. His wavy midnight black hair dripping on the freshly polished floor. There was something in the boy that reminded Kreature of his old blood traitor master. </p><p> </p><p>“My negativity, if I recall dear brother, you are the one always getting into trouble,” The shorter boy said giving his brother quite a nasty look that made Kreature nearly flinch. The ticking of a grandfather clock caught his attention and kept it until his brother spoke again.</p><p> </p><p>“I am not-” The boy from earlier said somehow utterly scandalized. He watched the sleeping portrait, hoping his voice didn’t wake the sleeping woman within it. He lowered his head in shame when the tallest boy glared at him.</p><p> </p><p>“I wish both of you would shut your mouth,” The tallest said to both of his brothers, his black hair falling into his face over his sharp cheekbones and square jaw. Kreature stared at the boy in a way that would make any other witch or wizard send him a nasty hex.</p><p> </p><p>“Young masters” Kreacher said, finally letting his presence be known. He watched as the three boys nearly jumped out of their own skin; clearly startled by the house-elf. </p><p> </p><p>“Who the bloody hell are you” All three boys had their wands pointed at the deranged looking elf. The elf obviously wasn’t fazed by the three wands that were pointing at him. Each one of the boys had distinct characteristics of the Black family.  </p><p> </p><p>“Kreacher be Kreacher and Kreature be masters elf,” Kreacher said with a slight smile that made the smaller brother grimace. The house-elf bowed and glared at the fact that three wands still pointed at him.  He had been waiting for the Black family magic to be restored; at last, it was. Finally, the Noble and Ancient House of Black could be put back to its former glory.  </p><p> </p><p>All three boys looked at each other and then back at the house-elf. They were immediately thankful for their father telling them how to enter the dingy townhouse. It was the only safe place that they had left in Europe. Their home in Italy had been compromised due to some unfortunate turn of events and they had to immediately evacuate.</p><p> </p><p>“Kreacher be showing masters to their rooms but Kreacher's master half-blood is sleeping in the family library” Alphard’s eyes widened and he looked at the elf with curiosity. Corvus smirked and looked at his brother's; eyes shining with childish glee.</p><p> </p><p>“A half-blood you say, what is his name” Polaris asked the elf in a demanding tone. He wanted to know who was in their family home; their newly discovered sanctuary. </p><p> </p><p>“Kreacher's half-blood master’s be Harry Potter”</p><p> </p><p align="center"> ________________________</p><p> </p><p><em> Kreacher </em>led the three boys to the infamous family library. They passed dimly lit hallways with sleeping portraits of passed on family members. So far, the townhouse was definitely unwelcoming and Alphard definitely had to fix this place up. He didn’t have a clue as to what happened to the real black manor, but he would definitely have to figure it out. There was no way this cramped apartment was the ancestral home of the Blacks.</p><p> </p><p>Polaris felt dark magic envelop him. It seemed to creep into his skin, it almost seemed to welcome him. He felt a buzzing feeling under his skin and shocks on the tip of his ears all the way down to the tip of his toes. His dark-colored eyes followed every nook and cranny they walked past; afraid someone or something was going to pop out at them.</p><p> </p><p>They approached the family library and all the three boys could do was stare in awe. The wide archway led to books in Astronomy, Dark Arts and Transfiguration. Alphard and his brothers had grown up on a vineyard in the Italian countryside, their house-elf, Dolly, had only gone into town for food. They had made sure that they never ventured into the muggle shopping areas and they never visited a place more than once. </p><p> </p><p>Their villa hadn’t been nearly as dark as the Black Ancestral home. Their home had been filled with handcrafted Italian furniture and beautiful painting of past Italian wizards. It was when they saw Kreautres ruddy little face scrunched up in disgust that they began to expect the worst. Alphard stared at the figure that laid on the beautiful dark wooden couch with curiosity. Whatever Kreature found seemingly disgusting was over Alphard’s head. The boy laying on the couch was anything but disgusting, half-blood and all.</p><p> </p><p>Polaris’ eyes widened in realization, the small body on the couch wasn’t just some disgusting little half-blood. The sickly looking boy, who laid on the couch, was no other than Harry Potter. It took some time for anyone to process this; seconds turned into minutes. Harry Potter was on their couch, in their ancestral home, for some odd reason.</p><p>“Kreacher can get rid of the blood traitor half-blood if master be wishing,” The house-elf said, his bony little fingers getting ready to snap the boy away.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait.. don’t,” Corvus said looking at the sleeping boy sadly. There was something that Corvus couldn't figure out about the figure lying in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>“Corvus,” Alphard said completely and absolutely appalled. His younger brother gave him a dark look and walked up to the boy. Alphard immediately got behind Corvus to ensure that the boy didn't get hurt. </p><p> </p><p>“Look at him, he looks like he hasn’t got a good sleep in months. look at his skin when was the last time you think he got proper food and a nice suntan,” Corvus said placing his hand on the boy's forehead. His wavy raven-colored hair stuck to his forehead like a slug stuck to the bottom of a potions cauldron.</p><p> </p><p>“Halfblood master hasn’t slept in two days,” Kreacher said not caring about the half-blood traitor that laid on his master's couch.</p><p> </p><p>Alphard just rolled his eyes and crossed his arms. He definitely didn’t this was a particularly good idea. Harboring the boy-who-lived in their ancestral home was not a good look for them, especially since they belonged to the Noble and Ancient House of Black.</p><p> </p><p>Corvus quickly took out his wand and muttered the words,”revelabit”. The boy’s jerked up, a blue aura surrounding him, then his body went completely still. Corvus swore and began to search his bag for parchment.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, Corvus what’s wrong with him,” Polaris asked nudging his brother, Alphard, to get closer. Alphard eyed the sleeping boy wearily, he didn’t think it was a good idea having the boy here. There was no doubt in his mind that as soon as Albus Dumbledore got the news that Harry was anywhere without his permission, there would definitely be a manhunt going on.</p><p> </p><p>“He’s severely malnourished and he’s got a temperature,” Corvus said taking the soft green blankets off of him.</p><p> </p><p>“Give him some potions and get him out of here,” Alphard said which caused both of his brothers giving him a look that clearly meant that he was an idiot. Kreacher smiled and nodded; agreeing with his master.</p><p> </p><p>“Why would we throw him out, he’s not well and he’s practically family,” Corvus said, slowly standing up and walking towards his brother.</p><p> </p><p>“Family, what loyalty does he have to us, he’s Dumbledore’s pet, his do boy, what do you think is going to happen when Dumbledore finds him; he will be right back in his grasp” Alphard yelled.</p><p> </p><p>“His grandmother was Dorea Black, he’s family Alphard” Corvus yelled back at his brother. Their shoulders bumping and their gazes locked on each other. To say that their personalities clashed was an understatement. Their personalities were so different that they had every opportunity to start an argument with each other.</p><p> </p><p>Polaris looked at the sleeping boy in panic. It would seem that he was the only one that noticed the boy waking up from his sleep. His panicked eyes just watched as the boy’s eyelashes fluttered and revealed beautiful unearthly green eyes. They boy gasped and stared at each and every one of them.</p><p> </p><p>Harry’s eyes stopped on the boy who was watching him and he nearly fell off of the couch. Who were they? Why were they in his godfather's house?. Harry jumped and grabbed his wand from under him; pointing at the three unknown males.</p><p> </p><p>“Who the hell are you and why are you at my godfather's house,” Harry said with his wand pointed as he summoned his Gryffindor courage.</p><p> </p><p>“Put your wand away Potter, we won’t hurt you,” Polaris said his hands up in surrender, walking slowly toward the boy.</p><p> </p><p>“I will lower my wand when you tell me who you are,” Harry said skeptically.</p><p> </p><p>“We are your cousins,” Corvus said to the boy with a slight smile. Harry shook his head and gave the boy a sneer.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t have any family,” Harry said with fierce eyes. Corvus looked at Polaris with pleading eyes. Alphard snorted and crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p> </p><p>“You're grandmother Dorea Potter was our relative,” Alphard said narrowing his eyes at Harry.</p><p> </p><p>“Black. The only Blacks that are alive are Sirius, Bellatrix, and Narcissa. Bellatrix is locked away, Narcissa is now married to Malfoy, and Sirius didn’t have any children” Harry said raising his wand.</p><p> </p><p>“Let us formally introduce ourselves to you cousin, I am Corvus Black, this is my brother Polaris Black, and that piece of muggle trash is Alphard Black,” Corvus said with a confident smile.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m Harry, Harry Potter”</p><p> </p><p align="center">__________________</p><p>On the other side of England, a pale skinned boy was sleeping on silk dark green sheets. His alluring waist length pale blonde hair fanned out on his dark green pillow cases. Moonlight peaked through the heavy dark curtains of his room making him look like he was wearing a halo. His body jerked from left and right, his magic lashing out around him. He whimpered while arching his back off of his bed.</p><p> </p><p>His night shirt was soaked with sweat and caked with blood. Tonight he would be turning fifteen. The essential age of every pureblood from an honorable and noble families. He had been waiting for this since he was a child. Tonight was the night he would be gaining his creature inheritance. The Malfoy line had once been home to many creatures and it had been that way since even before the founders. The Malfoy line had been home to fae, elves, veela, and even a few male naiads; which were extremely rare.</p><p> </p><p>His ancestors that had gone through their inheritance and became simple creatures like fae and elves were extremely lucky. He, unfortunately, was not lucky at all. He had never been a good child, per say, he had been bossy, stubborn, demanding, and even a bit rude. Even now, during his time at Hogwarts he still acted like he did when he was a child; if not worse.</p><p> </p><p>He cried out one last time and proceeded to wake up. His eyelids fluttered and opened trying to adjust to the moonlit room. His silver-gray eyes glowed and his magic lashed out across the room. He felt an aching pain in his back that seem to just get worse and worse. The soft humming of the bedroom walls and the scent of his warm bed sheets seemed to ease some of the pain he was having.</p><p> </p><p>He sat up in his bed and hissed, staring around the room with sharper eyes than he’d had the day before. He nearly jumped out of skin when he felt his hair brush against his waist. It had not been that long before he had gone into his inheritance. Before, it had been short just below his ears. He could tell that he looked different before even having a look in the mirror. His body ached and he could feel ancient magic humming within him.</p><p> </p><p>He walked on the cold tile floor of his bathroom, mentally preparing himself for what he might see. Lifting his eyes up his body slowly, he was shocked at what he saw. He had alway been good looking before his inheritance, but that was nothing compared to what he looked like now. The structure of his face was completely different now. Before he had a pointy nose, high cheekbones, and semi-broad shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>His veela inheritance had completely changed how he looked; if not for the better. He had often heard that the resemblance between him and his father was uncanny. His mother, if he could call her that, had only given him her petite body and her semi-pointy nose. The essence of his being, his magic, was completely different. He felt so much stronger than he had been in the past.</p><p> </p><p>He never realized how tired he was until he nearly fell asleep standing up while looking in the mirror. He let out a breathless yawn and proceeded back into his comfortable bed. When his back hit the bed sheets, he was out like a light.</p><p> </p><p align="center">______________________</p><p> </p><p>Draco stood outside of his father’s private study, shuffling slightly. This meeting could go one of two ways. His father could either embrace him or disinherit him. His father never wasted time telling him about his disowned family members and the Malfoy house had plenty of those. Draco could never imagine what it would be like if he got disinherited. He couldn’t imagine having house elves around him. He couldn’t imagine having his father’s wisdom or the comfort of his own room.</p><p> </p><p>Draco hissed as he felt a sharp pain in his back. The pain was unlike anything he had ever felt. It was like a thousand <em> verbera </em>all at once. He had never felt a pain like this and he sure as hell never wanted for someone else to go through this. He staggered backwards which only caused the aching pain in his back worsen. He cried out loudly, his head was pounding, and he felt like his heart was about to beat out of his chest. Painful tears ran down his face,now, flushed cheeks. It was only until he heard his father’s heavy footsteps.</p><p> </p><p>“Merlin dragon, what have you done to yourself” Lucius Malfoy gathered his son in his arms. He nuzzled his nose into his son’s neck and cooed. Draco was instantly comforted by his father’s warm embrace and parental smell. Lucius smiled when he felt his son focus on his scent instead of the pain.</p><p> </p><p>“Papa,” Draco said in a small wary voice. The hands of his father ran through his hair causing his to croon. He hadn’t felt his father embrace him like this since he was a child and Narcissa had sent him numerous amounts of cruccio's him for sucking his thumb.</p><p> </p><p>“I am here my dragon, papa’s here”</p><p align="center">________________</p><p> </p><p>“Okay Potter, now walk to me” Harry stumbled towards Polaris nearly tripping over his own two feet.</p><p> </p><p>It’s been a week since Harry met the three Black brothers and they had completely changed his life for the better. The three boys had been surprisingly easy to hang around, unlike Hermione and Ron. The three boys didn’t hassle him about school and he- who -must -not -be- named like Hermione and Ron did. They didn’t push him or scold him. They treated him like the family he’d never had; in different ways of course, but still like family.</p><p> </p><p>Each boy had different personalities and different ways of comforting. Alphard was stern, quiet, and guarded. Polaris reminded him a lot of his godfather, Sirius, he was loud and laid back. Corvus was gentle and mother like. The short  haired boy looked serious with his sharp cheekbones and dark eyes,but the boy was anything but. They were so much different than his friends from Hogwarts, that he sometimes didn’t know how to talk to them.</p><p> </p><p>“These trousers are way too tight” Harry complained trying to adjust himself. This was the fifth pair of trousers he’d try on. Each pair of trousers were tighter than the last.</p><p> </p><p>“They may be too tight but at least they are better than the clothes we found you in,” Alphard said from in the corner with crossed legs and a bored look on his face. His facial expression reminded him of a familiar potions master from Hogwarts.  </p><p> </p><p>Harry felt his face heat up in embarrassment. He didn’t know if he was embarrassed because Alphard had called him out or because all the stuff he was saying was true. Dudley’s hand-me-downs were still wearable so he never felt the need to go out and buy more robes. The three brothers had been disgusted at the jumpers and trousers in his trunk. They had burned all the stuff he got from Dudley, along with his school robes, and burned them.</p><p> </p><p>“I think you look really good Harry,” Corvus said with a small smile.</p><p> </p><p>Harry smiled and practically fell on his face when Polaris pushed him in front of a mirror. He looked at himself with wide green eyes. Earlier in the day, Alphard had demanded that he get a new haircut and all but ordered him to get rid of his glasses. He had gotten new robes and the ability to see without his glasses; all in one day. He looked the same and yet totally different at the same time. Everyone had always told him that he had his mother's eyes but yet all he saw was his father.</p><p> </p><p>“I look…”</p><p> </p><p>“Better than you did when we first saw you,” Polaris said with a clap of his hands. Harry couldn’t help but smile at the boy.</p><p><br/>Harry saw the three boys look at him with contempt. He had never seen someone look so proud of him in his life. He felt proud and grateful that these three boys had come into his life. He had gained more confidence in himself thanks to Polaris. Alphard had started to help him with studying and his summer work. Corvus listened to him and never judged anything that he said to him. The acted like true friends: like family. He felt like this would be a good year for him. Little did Harry know everything he knew and believed would change.</p>
