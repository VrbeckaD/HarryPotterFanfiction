    <p>There was no way of knowing what was ahead of him, that miserable first Christmas after the Battle, when everyone was back at Hogwarts for Eighth Year and Harry realised that this was the first of all the Christmasses he thought he was never going to get to see, and that he wasn't even all that glad about it.</p>
<p>He wondered when he was supposed to start feeling better.</p><hr/>
<p>It had all seemed so simple back in that first summer of freedom, with Voldemort dead—really dead, Harry could scarcely believe it—and every day long and indolent and sprawling (so much time! Time he’d never imagined getting when he’d walked out into the Forest with only love as his shield, knowing it was both not enough, and just what was needed). </p>
<p>He’d spent the summer at the Burrow, and <i>everyone</i> was there, most of the time. Every Weasley (except Fred, and how there could be such a sense of something so profoundly <i>missing</i> in a house that crowded, Harry didn’t know); Neville, showing off those sword-wielding arms in short-sleeved t-shirts, or topless and sweating rosily while helping Molly in the garden, but all the while casting blushing glances he thought no one would notice at Ginny; Seamus, who had gone back to Ireland after the Battle, but left again a few days later because no one there really gave a single shite about what had been going on across the water, and Seamus couldn’t bear it any more; half of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, who helped around the house, and ate huge heaping plates of Molly’s cooking, and organised dangerous impromptu five-a-sides which involved too few rules and too many reckless moves, because they’d been through the worst already, so nothing could harm them now, could it? Luna, paler than before, hair shorn close to the fine bones of her skull, brandishing a pack of Muggle Tarot cards like a weapon; Hermione, of course, who told everyone she was taking a break from studying to enjoy the summer, but spent hours honing her practical spellwork until she could cast faster than a spitting fire, her magic blazing hot though she herself was dulled by fatigue and grief. </p>
<p>So many of them, coming and going, Flooing to Hogwarts to help with the rebuilding, and then Flooing back to the Burrow every evening to eat and drink and make enough noise to drown out the horror of memories, until they could sleep. Often they all slept in the garden, on transfigured mattresses, under the same gazebo that they had danced and fought in the night of Bill and Fleur’s wedding. When they managed to sleep, they slept like pups, piled together in a jumble of warm skin and straying limbs and the shortness of shared breaths. But too many of them didn’t manage to sleep much. They did a lot of drinking.</p>
<p>The war had stripped something away from them—reserve maybe, the drive for privacy or the choice of a certain kind of intimacy. Bodies and touches were no longer sacred, but shared around easily, in reassurance or regret or a dim sort of curiosity. Whenever he walked anywhere, Harry found himself reaching for the hand of whoever was beside him. The usual personal charms went foregone—any magic that could be used as a substitute for touch was gone. Instead of Sunshield Charms, they applied Muggle suncream to each other’s sunglazed skin until they all glistened and smelled of coconuts and chemicals. They brushed each other’s hair with Arthur’s collection of Denman brushes, the weight of the moulded plastic handles reassuringly mundane—better than the Elder wand anyway—and the tug of the bristles just another distraction. </p>
<p>They all washed each other in the stream at the bottom of the garden, often, during that syrupy hot summer, sluicing away the dust and sweat of long days’ work. They used soaps that Luna had made herself by hand, cobbled together with herbs and magic; sweet almond oil to soothe; geranium for soul’s ease; basil for purification; angelica for protection; calendula for love. Harry thought love had probably already done enough, but he waded thigh-deep into the water with his friends anyway, let them plaster him with the soft soap, stood meekly while they dipped and rinsed him, though he knew no mundane magic in the water would be enough to wash away everything he had done. </p>
<p>It was comforting though, the medicinal tang of the herbs, the slow drag of incurious hands across the softest part of his belly, under his arms, through the trailing wet hair at his groin, the scrub of fingers through his hair, the bracing absolution of the rinse. It seemed to help, being clean, reciting the ingredients in his head like incantations. Sweet almond oil, geranium, basil, angelica. Calendula, for love. </p>
<p>It was in the midst of that spirit of togetherness, the communion of shared meals and hard labours divided, that they all decided to go back to Hogwarts, signed the letters to McGonagall over dinner. It just… felt like something they could do.</p>
<p>Being together like that felt less lonely, for a while, before that stopped working too.</p>
<p>Harry wasn’t sure when he tipped over from not minding things to really <i>not caring</i> about anything. Maybe it came with the change of seasons, when summer days stretched elastic and strange into the shortening gold of late August, and people began to talk about <i>when</i>, and <i>soon</i>, and <i>after</i>. <i>After</i> was pretty hard to fathom when you’d been dead, Harry thought, though he couldn’t reasonably expect the rest of them to understand that. But the trouble was, he didn’t feel like being reasonable. </p>
<p>His black mood spread—caught the kindling laid down by their shared past, crackled to life and blazed through them all.</p>
<p>They were all either fucking or fighting after that, it seemed. No one bothered to hide it, no one used magic to heal up spongey bruises across knuckles, or the proclamatory purpling blossom of a good black eye, or a line of darkening suckmarks running down a throat under a collar. It helped a bit, to feel things.</p>
<p>Harry did a lot of fighting. </p>
<p>He told Hermione to fuck off the third time she asked him when he wanted to go into Diagon to get his new books. She laid him low with a beautifully-executed Knockback jinx before picking him up again and crying messily into his neck (the first time she’d cried at all, since the Battle, and Harry knew it was probably a good thing). She and Ron went to Diagon without him.</p>
<p>Neville gave him a proper bloodnose when he told him to just go and fuck Ginny already—knocked him right down, nearly knocked him right <i>out</i>, and he’d probably have deserved it too. </p>
<p>And he probably should have spoken to Ginny about it before he’d said it (and probably Harry from before would have talked to her, would have gently broken things off with her, and wouldn't have said a word about how the whip of her hair in the wind reminded him of the shriek of the Fiendfyre, and how he wasn't even sure that he was into girls anymore, or if he ever had been. But then Harry from before wouldn't have felt those things, probably. Harry of <i>after</i> couldn't really remember what it was like to feel much of anything at all).</p>
<p>But Neville might as well fuck her—she was certainly interested, and it wasn't as if there was anything still going on between her and Harry. He’d barely been able to touch her since the Battle, and she didn’t seem to mind in the least. She hardly noticed him anymore, she certainly didn’t seem to <i>want</i> him to touch her, and so he hadn’t even tried. She wasn’t really interested in doing anything but raging and weeping, because she was probably about the only one who was as angry as Harry about how things had turned out (it seemed that she did have a favourite brother after all, and it was the one who'd died). </p>
<p>All in all, though, it was a shitty way to finalise things, and Harry thought he probably deserved the punch. Certainly it was the most emotion he’d seen from Neville since the day he’d cried like a small child, with the cold, sinuous coils of what had been Nagini slack at his feet, and his face upturned to the sky, gore-filmed and beseeching.</p>
<p>Ginny didn’t seem angry. Instead, she had stood over him where he lay stunned in the grass, shaking the ringing out of his ears, with blood licking hot down his cheek and into his hair, and she had laughed and laughed until he gave in and laughed with her, helpless and hysterical. Then she gave him the finger, grabbed Neville and kissed him hard and messily, with a fierce sort of promise in it, and that was that for them. </p>
<p>And from then on, Harry also did a lot of fucking. No one seemed shocked by anything he did, and Ginny was off with her hand down Neville’s trousers half the time, and Harry was so <i>sick</i> of pitying himself. Charlie Weasley had been back all summer, and had spent most of that seeing Harry get angrier and more fucked up, but even after it all, he still watched Harry with a sort of lazily amused speculation. He didn’t talk much since <i>Fred</i>, though by August he had a bit of colour in his cheeks again, and in the rich late-summer light, the velvet nap of his shaved hair (improbably soft over the curve of his skull) looked like a blazing helmet of hammered copper. And Harry <i>had</i> always liked a redhead.</p>
<p>It was as easy as he’d imagined it would be, going by how much Charlie watched him, and Harry wasn’t shy about what he wanted. He didn’t bother to wait for dark and drunkenness, the oblivion that came with night. It was midday, and the sun was at its highest, with no shadows cast to hide anything. They were all splashing in the river in various states of undress, but as Harry started to wade over to where Charlie floated alone, looking unseeingly up at the flat blue of the sky, everyone else filtered away back to the house. They could probably tell what Harry wanted, what he was going to take, just from the look on his face. He didn’t care.</p>
<p>Charlie started when he felt the wash and swell of Harry’s approach, dunked himself once and came up blinking, water-bejewelled. They were thigh-deep in the river, each of them appraising, each of them unguarded. </p>
<p>“Oh,” Charlie said.</p>
<p>Harry shrugged, then reached down and cupped himself briefly, either in display or in query, he wasn’t sure which. Charlie’s throat caught on a hard swallow, so Harry touched himself again, more deliberately this time, before releasing his thickening cock with a wet slap against the crease of his thigh. The water was as warm as skin, its touch like a shiver of silk over his balls. He kept watching Charlie, saw the flutter of his sandy lashes, diamond-tipped with droplets, saw the twitch of his cock against the push of the current. He was very touchable, Harry realised—nipples bronze and ridged from the whisper of a breeze (and arousal, Harry thought); the glint of bronze curls at his groin softened by the kiss of water; dragon-taming muscles lean and curving and lickable; scars and burns cast into sharp relief in the unforgiving glare of high sun, and all the more tempting for it.</p>
<p>When Harry had thought about sex before, he had imagined a bed, and a lot of kissing, and a sort of heady, gasping completion to the act of it. And it was surely Voldemort’s fault that he hadn’t got very far beyond the kissing part before (mostly with Ginny, plus a bit of really ill-advised grinding against Seamus one night after far too much Firewhiskey). He could certainly never have imagined that it would involve shamelessly working over his own cock in front of Charlie Weasley, while standing in a river; of biting down on a groan before realising that maybe he <i>liked</i> the way desire sounded coming from his own mouth; of letting himself gasp out what he wanted, just like that.</p>
<p>“I want to… can we… can we fuck?” he asked (as easy as that, just to say it) .</p>
<p>Charlie was already moving, manhandling him towards the riverbank, hands moving with a heavy, covetous weight over Harry’s hips, arse, hardening cock.</p>
<p>“Have you done this before?” he asked briskly. “Because it’s fine if you haven’t, but it wouldn’t do to make this into a big deal. I’m heading back in two weeks, and I’m not on the market for anything serious.” He cupped Harry’s face in his big, heat-scarred hands, looked at him with kindness and a sort of controlled want that had Harry itching to push back, make him frantic.</p>
<p>“I’m just asking for a fuck, Charlie. I won’t be pining for you, if that’s what you’re asking. It was Bill I always fancied, anyway, so either get on with it or fuck off.”</p>
<p>Charlie’s eyes sharpened with dark amusement, and a flare of desire that almost had Harry smiling back. “Bill could never suck you off the way I’m going to,” he said, and with the heel of his hand he pushed Harry back onto the sunwarmed grass of the riverside.</p>
<p>Harry hadn’t done it before, of course, not any of it, but he found it was very easy to enjoy when you don’t really care too much about anything. </p>
<p>He didn’t care how hard he fucked up into the slow sucking heat of Charlie’s mouth; he didn’t care that Charlie pinned him down with such casual ferocity that he had a dappling of smudgy bruises across both hips for the next week; he didn’t care that the dry questing nudge of Charlie’s broad index finger at his hole made him buck up so hard into Charlie’s throat that he felt the shocked flex of it around the head of his cock; he didn’t care that, when Charlie’s finger broached him, he made a noise so broken and aroused that he wondered at first where the sound of it had come from; he didn’t care that when he came, it was to Charlie’s tongue licking fast and greedy at his fluttering rim; he didn’t care that he was too fucked out and sated to even put a hand to Charlie as he wanked himself in short, desperate strokes until he jolted into an orgasm that splattered Harry’s softening cock with his come (though he did find enough energy to appreciate that Charlie <i>did</i> seem fairly frantic, by the end of it). </p>
<p>He didn’t care about any of of it, and it felt very fucking good to <i>not</i> care for once. They lay together on the riverbank afterwards, fragrant loam wedged under Harry’s fingernails from where his hands had dug heedlessly into the ground when he came, the air between them meadowsweet with grass crushed by their sweatslick rutting bodies.</p>
<p>He had two weeks before Charlie went back—two weeks of coming so hard, and so often, that it settled the crawling itch under his skin and let him sleep for more than a few hours at a time. Harry’s lips were permanently swollen from being kissed, and bitten, and kissing and biting back. The first few days, his jaw ached from learning to take the heft of Charlie’s cock, from sucking him off so many times, so relentlessly, that at the last, Charlie ended up groaning in near-despair as he fisted Harry’s hair hard and shuddered into a dry orgasm that looked almost painful. </p>
<p>And it was alright to like it all so much, but not to care about it—more than alright, really, because Charlie didn’t care either. He was already more than half gone in his heart, back to Romania, and his dragons, and someone called Valen who he talked about a lot without seeming to notice he was doing it. The night before he left, he and Harry slept in the little bedroom he had shared with Bill,  and Harry woke in the morning still wet with Charlie’s come, to the hammer of rain on the tiny casement window. He was alone. </p>
<p>The weather had turned.</p>
