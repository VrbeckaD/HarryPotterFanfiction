    <p>“I’m not putting that in my mouth.”</p><p>Teddy only waved the whistle more insistently with his chubby little arms, and Harry had to bite his lip for a moment not to laugh at Draco’s expression.</p><p>“Love, he wants to share,” he said, when he felt he could control his voice. “Don’t you Teddy?”</p><p>Teddy’s hair turned platinum blond as he made a happy sound and waved the whistle he’d just been chewing at Draco again.</p><p>Draco shuddered and accepted the rather wet and chewed up piece of plastic, wiping it on his robes and shooting Harry a dark expression.</p><p>When he blew the whistle, the sound was weak and wobbly, and his expression so disgusted that Harry couldn’t stop the laughter from escaping him.</p><p>Teddy clapped his little hands and laughed with him.</p>
