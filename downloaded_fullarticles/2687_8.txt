    <p>“Good work today, Healer Malfoy. We’ll see you tomorrow for an evening shift.” </p><p>Scorpius smiled beatifically, though even that movement felt as though it took endless amounts of energy. “Thank you, Healer Creed.” He almost sagged with the effort. “Is the schedule posted?”</p><p>“Same place as it always is,” Creed intoned gruffly. Scorpius nodded, taking care not to roll his eyes or scoff, and turned to exit down the hallway. He walked with his eyes closed; keeping them open felt like too much work. </p><p>Thankfully, no one was in the hallway at this hour. It was past three in the morning. The nurses were absent, most likely congregating in their breakroom, and no patient had hit their bell to signify that they needed something. Thankfully.</p><p>As he approached the end of the hallway, Scorpius blinked, desperately trying to keep his eyes open in the overly-saturated hallway. The paper he was searching for swam into focus. It took him a moment to decipher the letters, and when he did, he nearly collapsed.</p><p>Norwood - 9 AM-5 PM.<br/>
Malfoy - 6 PM-9 AM.<br/>
Montgomery - 12 PM-8 PM.</p><p>Another fifteen hour shift. Two days in a row! He practically had… He paused to count on his fingers. Sixteen hours to relax before another fifteen hour shift! That was ridiculous. No other new Healer had such ridiculous hours.</p><p>Sure, he grumbled to himself, when they had exited the Healer training program and became residents, the teachers informed the students that they would typically take odd hours and longer shifts to “gain experience.” Scorpius snorted. Gain experience, his arse. More like do the menial tasks older Healers hated and let them take all the credit. </p><p>But no other Healer from his program had worked even a twelve-hour shift, nevermind fifteen! Not even those working in the Emergency wing endured the grueling schedule that he had! Of course, Scorpius knew exactly why they were assigning him the worst hours. He kicked the ground as he walked to the assigned Apparition point, and then immediately felt like a child. </p><p>The reasonable voice in his head, which sounded a lot like a combination of his dad and Al, weirdly enough, reminded him: <i>No use moaning about things you can’t change at the moment.</i> </p><p>Finally, when he stumbled into the room, he had to pause for a long time before he could picture his and Al’s shared apartment. He raised his eyes skyward and pictured it as best he could, but his focus was swimming.</p><p>Scorpius screwed his eyes shut and forced himself to Apparate, picturing the vague outline of his lawn in his mind’s eye. Woozy, he sat down on a stoop the moment he arrived. And then furrowed his brow. Where were the hedges? “Oh, shoot,” he mumbled to himself. He was sitting on Rose Granger-Weasley’s stoop. Not his own.</p><p>“Sorry, Rosie,” he said. “Hope I didn’t wake you up.” This time, when he Apparated, he made sure to hold onto his focus. He landed in the hedges outside of his home, but he made it there, and that was the only thing that mattered. Honestly, it was probably ill-advised to Apparate after working for fifteen hours, anyway. It was a miracle he got home in one piece.</p><p>He extracted himself from the bushes and trudged up the stairs, picking leaves and twigs out of his Healer robes. On days like today, he wished that he and Al could remove the anti-Apparition wards surrounding their house so he could Apparate into his bedroom. </p><p>Scorpius briefly imagined a reporter from the Prophet or another gossipy newspaper getting a picture of him stuck in the bushes and splashing it across the headlines. MALFOY HEIR CAN’T APPARATE! He shivered and immediately took back his wish.</p><p>“<i>Accio</i> keys,” he whispered. There was no tell-tale rattling coming from his bag. He flicked his wand again, a little more panicked now. “<i>Accio</i> keys.” There was the sound of shattered glass, and his keys came zooming from his window.</p><p>He took a deep breath, reminded himself to repair that window the next morning, plucked his keys from the air, and unlocked the door. Scorpius shrugged off his outer robe halfway into the hallway and left it lying on the steps. He could deal with that tomorrow morning. There were more important things on his mind now, like sleeping immediately. </p><p>On the way to his room, he stopped twice on the stairs to rest and recuperate. It was a little after three-thirty in the morning, and he was crashing badly. Finally, he stumbled through the doorway of his room and collapsed on the bed. The mattress felt odd, he noted. Lumpy. Maybe he needed a new one. Merlin’s sake, he deserved one at this point. </p><p>“Fucking ow! GET OUT, INTRUDER!” The next thing he knows, Scorpius was in a full-body bind, hanging from the ceiling. Al, half-awake, pointed his wand at him threateningly. “STATE YOUR NAME OR I’LL FUCK YOU UP!”</p><p>“Scorpius Malfoy. Idiot.” The words leaked with affection. Al tilted his head to the side. Scorpius could practically feel him raising his eyebrows.</p><p>“<i>Lumos maxima.</i>” Scorpius squeezed his eyes shut; the brightness hurt his eyes. “Er, Scorpius? That’s really you?” </p><p>“Obviously, you dolt. Who else would break into your house at this hour?”</p><p>“I feel like there’s some crazy people who would go to some extremes,” Al muttered. Still, he blushed bright red and released him from his binds, causing Scorpius to fall right back onto the bed with a sound of discontent.</p><p>“Sorry, mate. I thought… you haven’t mixed up our rooms in awhile.” Al yawned, and his whole face moved with the motion. “Rough day?” He leaned his head on Scorpius’ shoulder. Scorpius patted his hair awkwardly.</p><p>“Tell you about it tomorrow.” Scorpius stood up and began shuffling back to his own room. Al made a whiny sound in Scorpius’ direction. He held up his hands and made grabby motions at Scorpius. Scorpius paused in the doorway and gave Al a cheery wave. He did not want to think about the implications of whatever that gesture was. Al was probably exhausted and out of it. It didn’t mean anything. “Night.”</p><p>“Night, Scorp.” He closed the door gently before racing to his own room this time. He didn’t even bother to brush his teeth or change; he simply laid flat on his bed, pulled off his shoes, and put his head on the pillow.</p><p>The next morning, he was awoken at six by a very cross shout. Scorpius sat straight up in bed and rubbed at his eyes. “All right? Al?”</p><p>“You left your fucking coat on the steps again!” Scorpius shrunk down in his bed, even though Al couldn’t see him. "And did you break this window?" He pulled his covers over his body, feeling his face turn hot. </p><p>“Sorry!”</p><p>“S’alright,” Al called back. “I hung it up for you and I repaired the damage. I’ll be home at 4 today, all right?” Al consulted for the Ministry on potioneering work and worked part-time at an apothecary. Outside of that, he cooked meals for the two of them to take to work and to enjoy at home on the rare nights Scorpius wasn’t working strange shifts. Honestly, Scorpius had no idea how he got so lucky. Al’s meals were always insanely good. </p><p>“All right! See you then!” The door slammed shut, and Scorpius fell asleep immediately once more.</p><p>The next time he woke up, it was at three in the afternoon precisely. He stretched and hopped out of bed for a long, warm shower. The tension that had been building in his shoulders evaporated alongside the steam. Scorpius hummed to himself and even caught himself smiling a few times. The world always seemed a bit brighter after sleeping for twelve hours. </p><p>He pulled on pyjamas to eat a ridiculously late breakfast. Scorpius had to flip his eggs by hand, though, not with magic. The last time he had tried, he ended up with yolk on the ceiling and Al nearly pissing himself laughing. So he used a spatula and sang little songs to himself to keep himself on task.</p><p>After his meal, during which he only spilled a tiny amount of jam on his Puddlemere United pyjama pants, he washed up once more and changed into his Healing robes. Right as he finished dressing, the doorbell rang. </p><p>Scorpius grinned and raced down the steps to wait in the hall. Al opened the front door not a moment later. He had his own set of keys, but he liked to ring the doorbell to let Scorpius know he was home. “Hey, Scorp. How was sleeping in?” Scorpius held out his arms. Al rolled his eyes but good-naturedly hugged his friend anyway. “I thought we were too old for this.”</p><p>“Never!” Al secretly loved hugs; Scorpius knew this. Scorpius also knew that Al would never admit to anyone else how much he loved hugs, not even Scorpius. “How was work?”</p><p>“S’alright. Nothing big happened. We didn’t get any major breakthroughs in the case, but I found this new ingredient that seems to be cropping up more frequently in potions using Erumpent horn. Apparently it magnifies the explosive effects to make a dud-potion that explodes once past the esophagus. Fucked up, isn’t it?”</p><p>Scorpius nodded his agreement. Al slug an arm around his shoulder and steered them both into the living room. “I’m gonna put the kettle on. You hungry?”</p><p>“No, I ate breakfast right before you came,” Scorpius admitted.</p><p>“All right. I’m gonna heat up some pasta. Let me know if you want any.” Ten minutes later, Al returned with two mugs of tea and a plate of pasta hovering behind him. He scarfed his food down and turned towards Scorpius, absently flicking his wand to turn the telly on. “So. How was yesterday?”</p><p>“Awful, Al!” Scorpius exclaimed. “They’ve put me down for a second fifteen-hour shift! No one else is working more than eight. It’s absolutely ridiculous!”</p><p> Al fumed for a moment, gesturing wildly into the air as he searched for words. “That’s a load of bollocks and they know it. They can’t give you the short end of the stick- what, because the war happened? The war that you didn’t even fight in? The war finished nearly three decades ago!” Scorpius put a hand on his friend’s shoulder. Al turned bright red again and elbowed his tea violently, causing his mug to tip. Scorpius corrected it before any liquid could hit the ground.</p><p>“I appreciate it, Al. But don’t get all fired up on my behalf. There’s not much I can do about it.”</p><p>“Tell your dad about it. He’d certainly take a crack at the Ministry for you. Hell, he’d introduce a bill called the Protect Scorpius Malfoy Act if you asked him to.” Scorpius looked down at his hands. </p><p>“That’s precisely why I don’t want to ask him. I can… I can fight my own battles, can’t I?” Al grabbed Scorpius’ hand. </p><p>“Of course you can! I’m just saying… It’s easier when you have a bunch of people on your side, too. You don’t have to be all alone.” Al looked down at their clasped hands and quickly disentangled himself. “Uh, yeah.”</p><p>“Thanks, Al.”</p><p>They finished their meals, chatting about Al’s day at work and moving on to how funny Lily could be and then talking about potentially getting another owl, so that Cow (creatively named by Ruby, Teddy and Vic’s daughter, and then Scorpius had grown too attached to the name) would have some company.</p><p>They ended up sitting in front of the television and flicking through the reality shows, settling on a show about wedding planning. It was American, so it was incredibly overdone with drama. It was ridiculous. Scorpius loved it.</p><p>“Scorp, can’t we change the channel?” Al complained, but he was the one holding the remote. If he really wanted a different show, he would change it himself. Al loved watching these types of shows. He lived for the weirdness of it all. “Oh my God, I can’t believe they’re letting him choose burgundy.”</p><p>“I know, right? Burgundy velvet? Ew.” Something sad started to slosh around in Scorpius’ stomach. He wanted to get married one day. Preferably, he’d like to get married to Al, but that wasn’t a real possibility.</p><p>Al was gay, sure, but there was no way he could like Scorpius. They were best friends. They always had been. Al hadn’t dated anyone in awhile, but that meant he was probably looking for someone else. It wasn’t realistic, that they’d end up together. No matter how bad Scorpius wanted it.</p><p>“At my wedding, I want a chocolate cake,” Al declared, only to cause a scandal in the Potter-Malfoy household. Scorpius threw a tacky throw pillow at him that Lily bought for the two as a joke. It had sequins on it. It had to be a joke, at least. He refused to be friends with Lily if she seriously bought them a sequined pillow thinking that they’d like it.</p><p>They were silent for a moment, Al giggling at Scorpius’ expression. Scorpius softly said, “I want an ice cream cake at mine.”</p><p>"No!" Al shrieked at full volume and chucked the pillow back at Scorpius. Scorpius removed a couch cushion and began bashing Al over the head with it. It seemed that they were never too old for pillow fights, not even when they were twenty. </p><p>Eventually, Al seized Scorpius by the wrists and pinned him to the couch. There was a feather in his hair and a mad glint in his eye. “I’ve won!” he crowed. Scorpius tried to laugh, but it was getting stuck in his throat. </p><p>“Yeah, you did. Lucky you.” Scorpius tried not to enjoy the situation too much.</p><p>“Lucky me.” Al looked Scorpius up and down and laughed. Scorpius quirked his brow. Was Al laughing nervously? What for? They got into little tiffs all the time. He wriggled about; Al’s grip was a touch too tight for him to gain any traction, though. What a shame. He wanted to take Al by surprise and flip him over. It seemed that Al had become too strong for Scorpius to manage that, though.</p><p>They stayed there, Al over Scorpius, their bodies aligned. Scorpius swallowed thickly. He couldn’t be imagining this. Could he? Was there something more between him and Al? He thought he was crazy for having a crush all these years, but maybe… </p><p>“Lucky me,” Al repeated, very softly. Almost imperceptibly, he moved closer to Scorpius, whose mouth was agape. Rather unattractively, Scorpius thought. He shut it and tried to remember how these sorts of things worked. He hadn’t dated in Hogwarts, and while he’d had boyfriends and girlfriends after his time there, they never worked out. Merlin knows why. Probably because they weren’t the younger son of the Chosen One. Not that Harry had anything to do with his attraction to Al. Oh, bollocks. Scorpius managed to sound stupid even in his own head. </p><p>Scorpius’ watch chimed, signaling that he had to leave for work now, or else he’d be late. He almost groaned aloud, but then worried that Al would misinterpret that. Al released him immediately and returned to the far end of the couch. Scorpius couldn’t read his expression.</p><p>“Ugh, I have to go to work now. This sucks.” Al nodded and stood up when Scorpius moved to leave. They walked in silence to the front door. Scorpius felt itchy. They were never this quiet. Maybe they should talk about what just happened? Clear the air, or whatever? Al was fidgeting like nobody’s business. Scorpius decided to leave it up to him. If he did something, then whatever the hell that pillow fight was meant something. And if Al didn’t do anything, then Scorpius should cut his losses and move on. Slash cry and watch television in the wee hours of the morning so Al wouldn’t see him being embarrassing and heartbroken. </p><p>On the stoop, Scorpius turned to his friend. “I’ll be back really late tonight again, don’t bother staying up. I’ll try not to wake you up this time! Love you, bye!” Scorpius turned pink. He was supposed to wait for Al to do something, but apparently his brain had other ideas. Oh, to hell with it all. He took a step forward towards the edge of the wards. </p><p>The moment they crossed the line separating their house from where they could Apparate, Al’s hand caught his sleeve. “Aren’t you forgetting something?” Al asked, flushing but grinning. His lips were pouting out slightly. Scorpius blanched. Was Al asking what he thought he was asking? </p><p>It wasn’t that he didn’t want to. Merlin knows he did. But he always had Al by his side, and that felt like enough. Scorpius had grown to accept that Al would be his friend, his best friend, and nothing more. But now? Maybe his slip of the tongue had prompted something bigger. </p><p>Scorpius leaned forward and kissed Al’s cheek. That was safe, wasn’t it? If someone was asking for a kiss? Al was blushing something fierce now. He cleared his throat. “Er, thanks Scorp, but… I meant these.” He held out Scorpius’ house keys. </p><p>Scorpius squeaked, grabbed them from Al’s hands, and Disapparated without saying goodbye. </p><p>He ended up on his hands and knees in the Apparition point back at St. Mungo’s. Healer Creed stood in the doorway, putting his coat on. He fixed Scorpius with an odd look. “All right, Healer Malfoy!”</p><p>“Yes! Sir!” Scorpius said, standing to attention. His hand started to go up to his forehead, but he stopped himself before he could do a full-fledged salute, which resulted in his arm doing a funny, aborted motion at his side. Creed’s expression turned into that of pure confusion and slight judgment. Typical.</p><p>“Well. Healer Ascot will be your attending Healer this evening. I expect to see good results.” With that, the older Healer walked up to the Apparition point and promptly Disapparated. Scorpius, mortified beyond belief, rushed to shove his overcoat and keys into his cubby before running back out to the the Healer headquarters. </p><p>Panting slightly upon arrival, Scorpius attempted to surreptitiously lean against the wall but misjudged the distance and ended up crashing to the ground. He stood up again immediately, stiff as a board, and tried to ignore everyone’s eyes that were glued to him.</p><p>“Alright, everyone. Now that everyone’s here…” she said pointedly, looking in Scorpius’ direction, “I’m ready to give out rotation. Healer Adams and Healer Brown - you will be reporting to the nurses station today.” Scorpius grimaced. Working with the nurses always meant the grossest and most boring tasks. </p><p>Scorpius drifted off part way through the monologue - was Al mad at him? Was it forward? Merlin, it was so embarrassing that he misread the cues - that when Ascot called his name, he jerked to attention so violently that he hit his head against the wall. “Healer Malfoy,” she repeated, “you’ll be reporting to me. We’re visiting Spell Damage today.” </p><p>“Ma’am?” he said. His voice cracked after the first syllable. Scorpius started to sweat under her gaze. “Er, sorry. But I’m doing my training in…” He tugged at his collar when Ascot fixed him with a cool look. She raised an eyebrow before turning on her heel. </p><p>“Very well then.” She cast an incantation and her hair tied itself into a neat, curly bun. She strode purposefully towards restricted area doors. They flew open for her. Scorpius trailed behind, tapping a beat onto his thigh with his fingers.</p><p>Something told him this was going to be a longer shift than usual.</p>
