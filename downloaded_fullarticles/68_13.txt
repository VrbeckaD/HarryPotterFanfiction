          <div class="userstuff"><p>"This is pleasant," Harry says blandly. He's still a shit; nothing's changed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco hates it here. <em>Here</em> still hurts, aches, and he can't look at Harry without wanting to hex his balls off. <em>Relent</em>. He smooths slightly-shaking hands over the pale leather of the sofa arm. "Quite."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He can feel Harry turn to him. "I still can't look at that couch without thinking of Pansy and Neville." Harry laughs, forced. Fractured. "Or the time-" </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Don't." Draco interrupts, harsh. Pushes his fingers through his hair, looks away. "I didn't come here to reminisce."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry snorts, dismissive and patronising. "I'll just shut the fuck up, shall I?" Moody bint. "Said you could keep the fucking house. Take everything. I don't care."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"You think I can <em>stay</em>?" Draco's bordering on shrill. "After everything?" He can barely step foot in this place without drowning under the weight of shared history. He takes a shuddering breath. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry's silent. "You ended it, Draco," he eventually murmurs, soft. Pained. "You said we were over."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I was angry," Draco hisses, heart clenching. "I didn't think I'd come home the next morning to find my fucking <em>husband</em> in bed with <em>Ginny</em> fucking <em>Weasley</em>!" </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I've bloody apologised! I was drunk, you'd broken my heart. I wanted you to hurt. It didn't mean anything." Harry stops, lips tightening. "It didn't mean I'd stopped loving you."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco needs to leave. Now. Before he caves. He stands. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Draco." Harry grabs his wrist, goes down on his fucking <em>knees</em>. It's pitiful, gut-wrenching. "Look me in the eye and tell me you don't love me. That you want this divorce.<em> Us finished</em>." </p>
<p> </p>
<p>That's the thing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco can't. </p>
