    <hr/><hr/><p>The moment Dobby apparated into in her husband’s study, surreptitiously creeping around Lucius’ oversized mahogany desk, Narcissa attention was broken.</p><p>She smiled at her husband, dropped her arms to her sides and motioned for Dobby to leave.</p><p>The elf crooked his head sideways and regarded her with a strange look in his saucer-sized eyes.</p><p>Narcissa could have sworn that he was smirking at her.</p><p>She dismissed that thought as nonsense and turned her head back to look at her husband, forcing a sweet, and rather fake, smile to curl around her scarlet-red lips.</p><p>“Fascinating, dear,” she said, with a singsong voice.</p><p>Lucius frowned.</p><p>“Were you even―”</p><p>“Yes, of course, dear,” Narcissa interrupted her husband before he lost himself in yet another one of his speeches about this, that, or the other.</p><p>She hastily rounded his desk, and placing a hand on top of his, she stood on the tips of her toes and pressed a quick kiss to his smooth pale cheek.</p><p>“Absolutely fascinating, darling,” she whispered, then withdrew to tell her husband that she simply had to check on their son.</p><p>Lucius’ brow furrowed even further.</p><p>“We have elves for―”</p><p>Narcissa smiled.</p><p>“Yes, naturally, we do, dear, but the heir of the Malfoy line deserves to have his mother fawning over him, don’t you think, darling?”</p><p>Lucius’ expression softened a little.</p><p>“I have to go out. The Ministry―”</p><p>“Yes, you do that, dear, I trust your judgement.”</p><p>Narcissa expertly charmed her husband with another false smile, and practically ran from Lucius’ study. When he tried telling her that he mightn’t be back in time for supper, she merely waved her hand and smoothly reassured him that as the Master of Malfoy Manor, he was a free man and could come and go as he pleased.</p><p>The moment the heavy wooden doors to her husband’s sanctum fell closed, she exhaled, then gathered up her skirts and dashed down the corridor, through the entrance hall and up the grand staircase. She slowed when she reached the gallery, curtly nodded at the various members of Lucius’ family, looking down at her from their portraits, and with her head held up high, she graciously and soundlessly glided over the thick dark-green carpet beneath her feet. She climbed another set of flights and found Dobby waiting for her at the top.</p><p>He had a most curious expression on his face, and Narcissa rushed past him in her haste to get to Draco’s room.</p><p>“Have you got it?” she hissed.</p><p>“Certainly, Mistress.”</p><p>Dobby smiled at her, then bowed low, so low in fact, that his large, long ears, touched the floor.</p><p>Narcissa clicked her tongue, tsking at the elf.</p><p>“Where is it then?” she asked with mild impatience.</p><p>Dobby snapped his fingers and offered her the item; she’d asked him to fetch from a speciality shop in the heart of Muggle London, threatening to free him from his services if he as much as breathed a word about her request to another living soul. The intimidating remark had been terrifying enough to ensure Dobby’s utmost discretion.</p><p>“Dobby, for the love of Salazar, you imbecile!”</p><p>Annoyed that he’d procured the item in the middle of the hallway, where anyone could see it, Narcissa snatched the child-sized green-and-yellow dragon costume from Dobby’s grasp and made a beeline for Draco’s room. She pulled the door open strode inside, and drawing her wand, she threw several non-verbal locking charms at the door, then called out to her son, who sat on the floor, in the centre of his massive bedroom, and was busy playing with a large assortment of magical building blocks.</p><p>At the familiar sound of her voice, Draco immediately looked up and his face lid up. His silvery-grey eyes sparkled with joy and with a loud and delighted squeal, he hastily scrambled to his feet, and ran over to her.</p><p>“Mother! Mother! Mother!”</p><p>Crouching down, Narcissa opened her arms wide and welcomed her pride and joy.</p><p>She hugged him tightly and smothered him with kisses, then tickled him until he laughed and squirmed in her embrace, trying his hardest to wriggle away from her.</p><p>Narcissa paused her attack and wrapping her arms around Draco, she stood, lifting him up.</p><p>“My sweet little boy,” she whispered, pressing a soft kiss to his forehead. “Mummy loves you very much.”</p><p>“I love you too, Mummy.”</p><p>Draco wound his little arms around her neck, and when he gave her a slobbery kiss, Narcissa welled up but swallowed past the lump in her throat and instead of allowing herself to get overly emotional, she hugged her precious boy a little tighter and ruffled his soft, blond hair.</p><p>“Tell me, my sweet little dragon, would you like a present? Mummy got you a little surprise.”</p><p>Draco’s high-pitched squeal of pure excitement made Narcissa’s ears ring, but she ignored it.</p><p>She knelt on the floor, and putting her son down; she showed him the beautiful, hand-sewn dragon costume, Dobby had helped her to acquire.</p><p>“Still want to be a dragon, sweetheart?” she asked.</p><p>Draco’s eyes widened, and he stared at the costume for a full five seconds ― the longest she’d ever seen him hold out before reaching for a present. She didn’t blame him for his inability to show any sort of restraint or patience. He was only two, after all. Lucius disagreed, but Narcissa had long since mastered the art of ignoring anything and everything he said. It went in her left ear and out her right ear ― it was the only way of coping with his constant rants about the wizarding world.</p><p>“Mummy, mummy, mummy, I want to put it on now!”</p><p>Draco demanded her full attention and abandoning any and all thoughts about her husband, Narcissa focused on him.</p><p>“Yes, of course, darling,” she said with a smile.</p><p>It took a good ten minutes before she’d managed to wrestle Draco out of his tailormade little suit, mainly because he was trying to help but in doing so was actually being more unhelpful than helpful ― she didn’t have the heart to reprimand him and demand that he should keep still.</p><p>Once she’d stripped him down to his undershirt and pants, it took another fifteen minutes to wrangle him into the dragon costume and work out how to do it up. In the end, she had to ask Dobby for help to inform her that she simply had to pull up the zipper and be done with it. She frowned at him, then let him do it for her, and once that was done, she sat back, looked at her son, and smiled.</p><p>Draco’s tiny face was the only part of his body that was still visible; everything else was hidden by the costume. Narcissa reached out and tugged on his little tail, and Draco squealed and spun around. His dragon wings flapped, and he grinned from ear to ear.</p><p>“Mummy, I’m a dragon!” he said excitedly.</p><p>Narcissa smiled.</p><p>“Yes, dear, you’re my pretty green little dragon.”</p><p>Draco took a step forward, put his costume-clad tiny hands on her face and smiled.</p><p>“I keep you safe, Mummy.”</p><p>Narcissa blinked furiously.</p><p>“No, sweetheart, that’s my job. I’ll keep you safe, always. I promise you.”</p><p>Draco pouted but didn’t object.</p><p>Still sat on the floor of his room, Narcissa pulled him into her lap and wrapped her arms around her son.</p><p>“My fierce little dragon,” she whispered and shed a few silent tears. “Mummy loves you very much, my precious boy.”</p><p>Draco giggled into her chest, and turning her head, Narcissa looked at Dobby, who hadn’t disappeared from the room yet but hadn’t said anything either.</p><p>“Quick, find me a camera. I want to take a picture,” she told him.</p><p>Dobby nodded, bowed, and disappeared with a snap of his fingers.</p><p>Less than two minutes later, he returned with Lucius’ camera and handed it to her.</p><p>It took Narcissa a moment or two to find out how it worked, but once she had, she positioned Draco and snapped a photo of her green-and-yellow little dragon boy. She then handed Dobby the camera, informed him that he was to get the photograph developed immediately and return it to her, including the negative. She also made sure to let him know exactly what she would do if he ever told Lucius about any of this.</p><p>He nodded meekly, accepted the camera from her and disappeared from her son’s room.</p>
