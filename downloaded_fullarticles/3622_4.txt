    <p>Avoiding the troll had been an easy decision for the now child as she was once again small and not in any position to defeat a mountain troll if something had gone wrong, she’d just have to find a way to cement her friendship with Harry and Ron another way.</p><p>Before she could get very far a hand suddenly grabbed her and pulled her into an abandoned classroom while covering her mouth. Her heart was beating a mile a minute as she recalled the war but before she could panic too much her attacker spoke, “Calm down it’s just me.” It was a familiar voice, but Hermione couldn’t place it, then he let go and she spun around and saw him.</p><p>It was a Weasley twin, which one she wasn’t sure and currently, she was too upset to care. This hadn’t happened last time but maybe one change was all it took to be at the end of a Weasley twin prank.</p><p>“If you think you can get away with pranking the timid first year Weasley you have another thing coming!” Her voice was rather fierce for a first year and the witch knew she should probably tone it down but being grabbed like she had been was still affecting her ability to act.</p><p>“I wouldn’t dare, you know more hexes than even my sister though I guess right now that isn’t much to go on since she’s ten again…” The last part was said with less humor than he had started with.</p><p>Hermione’s eyes widen, “You,” She couldn’t believe it was she really not alone in this time, “Y-you’re Fred! Are you really- how did you know that I was-” The young witch was finding it hard to put all her thoughts into words but the redhead in front of her seemed to understand what she was trying to say even if she didn’t.</p><p>“I wasn’t sure at first but then you ignored Ron’s big insensitive mouth and didn’t keep your date with that mountain troll and I just knew it had to be you.” He smirked at the ‘date’ part but the bushy-haired girl ignored his subtle teasing.</p><p>“It makes sense you were right next to me when it happened.” Her brain was working a mile a minute, they had both been hit by the backlash of multiple spells, did that mean others could be back or just him? Fred was the closest what with her literally half laying on him as she brought up a shield with her left arm after her right was out of commission.</p><p>“Speaking of what do you remember?” Fred asks, “To be honest not a whole lot that can be useful.” The brown-eyed girl says with a sigh, she could recall more than one spell but wasn’t sure who all they came from seeing as her focus was on her own spell and that of the one she was trying to block.</p><p>“Same but I thought I’d ask, I’ve been reading everything I could get my hands on in regard to time travel whenever I can sneak away from George… he’s found me in the library more than once over the years… I think he thinks I’m a closet nerd or something.” He attempts to joke but Hermione doesn’t hear it, “Years, what do you mean years?” She paled, it wasn’t possible was it she wondered.</p><p>“Just what I’ve said…” Came the confused response, “Start at the beginning and tell me everything.” Hermione insisted.</p><p>“Alright, though I suppose I’ll leave all the hours spent in class out to save time or is that what you meant when you said everything.” He joked.</p><p>“Fred!” Hermione shouts in exasperation.</p><p>“Alright, sorry.” He raised his hands in surrender before telling her what he remembered from that day.</p><p>-</p><p>Fred narrowly avoids a stray flying spell to the head as the redhead dives behind some fallen debris. He had to stop to catch his breath it felt like he had been fighting for several hours straight when really it had probably been only half an hour. Glancing to his right he spots George and Percy fighting together, "That's not something you see every day." The redhead says while still trying to catch his breath.</p><p>Suddenly he’s not alone behind the broken stone, "None of this is." A voice he recognizes says to his left, "Hey Granger, been a while!" Fred says conversationally, "Now's not the time, have you seen Ron?" The teenager enquires.</p><p>Fred frowns and shakes his head, "Not today," the or for the last few months was silently tacked onto the end, his eyes continue to glance around, "We got separated..." The girl states and Fred looks to the witch that is his little brother's best friend, she was worn out looking, dirty, and more stressed than he's ever seen her before.</p><p>He probably looked the same only Fred was sure he hadn’t lost as much weight. It made him worry more about his brother and Harry seeing the state she was in close up but there was nothing he could do about them right now. Hermione, however, was right beside him, so he could at least try to take some of the weight on her shoulders and carry it himself. "Need someone to watch your back, you look like you've got a plan."</p><p>She nods, "I wouldn't call it a plan but... I need to get inside Hogwarts."</p><p>Fred looks at the once majestic castle and all the Death Eaters surrounding it, "That could be a problem..." Fred sees the look on her face and forces a smirk, "I love a challenge though, let's go." With that he leads the way running and firing at Death Eaters that get in the way, Hermione follows while evading spells and throwing some of her own, they almost make it only to get cut off by Bellatrix.</p><p>Hermione and Fred are clearly outmatched but holding their own while the mad woman cackles at them all Fred hears is 'mudblood' and 'blood traitors' nothing worth paying attention to until one of her nastier curses lands and Hermione lets out a scream distracting the wizard, "Hermione!"</p><p>"I'm fine! Pay attention-"</p><p>The next spell knocks Fred off of his feet, his hand goes to his side where he was hit and comes back covered in blood, "That smarts..." It was bad he was losing a lot of blood and fast, it was making it hard to focus and react.</p><p>"DIE BLOOD TRAITOR!" The scream reaches his ears, but the spell doesn't as Hermione knocks the both of them out of the way just in time as a green spell flies by. He grunts in pain but having seen the green light knows that despite the new wave of pain coursing through him it was only due to the girl half on top of him that he was feeling anything at all.</p><p>They're not out of the water though as both are now sprawled out defenseless on the ground. Hermione raises her wand with a shaking hand to cast a shield as Bellatrix casts another dark one of her own, but it doesn't hit the shield but another spell, looking to the source through glazed eyes Fred sees his twin and Percy.</p><p>They both cast a spell hitting Bellatrix's spell, the result was an explosion which hit Hermione's shield hard, it didn't hold. There was a huge explosion the noise made his hearing go for a few seconds before it came rushing back painfully along with all the other pain, his head was pounding, and his side was on fire.</p><p>Next thing Fred knew was darkness, he might have heard a scream and his name in there somewhere, but he couldn't be sure.</p><p>-</p><p>Coming to with a jolt Fred sat up in his bed. It was his childhood bed at the Burrow, "What?" His hand shoots up to his throat, that wasn't his voice.</p><p>Looking over again he sees the empty bed of his twin, getting out of bed he nearly trips feeling out of place. Fred stumbles out of the room feeling odd and into the bathroom ignoring the shout of 'Hey!' as he lets himself In and looks into the mirror. It’s his face, but it’s not him, it's a kid’s face.</p><p>He touches his face and the mirror before he lets forth a scream. Between that and who he will later realize is Percy who is complaining have the whole house shows up to try and cram themselves in the tiny bathroom seconds later. Now, normally Fred would find this moment hilarious like his twin did but he barely heard his twin's laughter or his parent’s inquiry on his wellbeing or even Percy's girly screams that they all get out of the bathroom.</p><p>He did hear his mum ask him if he was alright to go away for his first year of Hogwarts or not, she apparently seemed to think he was having a panic attack about leaving home to go to Hogwarts for the first time.</p><p>Fred would forever deny that hearing that it was his first day of Hogwarts all over again that caused him to faint in fact he didn't faint at all he tripped... yeah that's it he tripped and hit his head on the sink and knocked himself out. That sounded much better then fainting did so he’d go with that once he woke up.</p><p>-</p><p>"So, you ran into the bathroom so fast you tripped and knocked yourself out?" Hermione asks as Fred stumbled over the last part, "Yeah... and it took a lot to convince mum that I was ready for Hogwarts once I woke up. "</p><p>"...You really woke up on the day you left to come to Hogwarts..." Hermione mumbled more to herself than to Fred.</p><p>"Yeah, not ideal but at least it wasn't years before I started school that has gotta be a different kinda nightmare." He couldn’t imagine how she had been coping since coming back and not having any way to connect to the magical world.</p><p>Hermione shakes her head, "I wouldn't know, I only just woke up in the car on the way to the Hogwarts Express." Her first time around she hadn’t been able to sleep the night before Hogwarts because she was so excited and slightly nervous, so the little girl had fallen asleep on the drive to the train station and that was the moment in which she found herself awaken to after waking up in this timeline. Suffice to say she had a panic attack that almost had her parents turn the car right back around.</p><p>"You've only been back for just over a month?" Fred exclaims, "Yes." She nods grateful that she hadn’t come back when he did even if it made things even more confusing.</p><p>"So where were you this whole time I've been here?" The slightly older magical teenager asked, "I'm not sure." She wished she had a better answer not only for him but for herself as well, she hated not knowing and this was a topic in which she was far more lacking in information than she’d like to be.</p><p>"But you know more about all this time travel stuff." He waves his hands around in apparent frustration.</p><p>"This is nothing like the time travel I studied, so I don't think my knowledge on the subject will help us." It hurt her to admit that but right now wasn’t a time to be prideful.</p><p>"Why not?" He asked in annoyance, she frowns and thinks to herself didn’t he say that he read up on time travel shouldn’t he get what she’s talking about just from what the redhead himself was able to find or in this case not find. She doesn’t want to argue though and instead answers with, "Because it's not supposed to be possible to go this far back or to fuse with your past self!"</p><p>The freckled teen looks down at his shoes and grumbles, "Well it is…" He’s reminding her far too much of Ron at the moment not to infuriate her even more, "I know! You think I haven't tried to find more information since I got here, it's all the same... I can't find anything new about it."</p><p>Looking back up to meet her eyes with his he asks, "Have you tried the restricted section?"</p><p>"Even if Harry had his cloak right now I wouldn't be able to use it, so no I haven't checked it yet... what's your excuse?" She folds her arms defensively.</p><p>"You're not the only one missing a partner in crime." Fred frowns, "What are you talking about you have George." The brunette stated.</p><p>"I do... but I don't." Hermione looks confused and the young wizard just sighs, "He's my twin but at the same time he's a kid and I'm not... not really. I know you don't think we matured much over the years but now that I'm back here I can see how different I am now than I was before..."</p><p>Hermione's face falls, "I never really thought about it like that."</p><p>"Yeah... it makes breaking into the restricted section of the library difficult when you have to explain to your barely teenage twin why you want to... it's not easy lying to him and not because I can't lie but because I don’t want to and because George would see right through it."</p><p>Hermione blinks, "He can still read you then, isn't that good?"</p><p>Fred shrugs, "He can tell when I'm lying or hiding something, but he can't read me not really... truthfully my relationship with George isn't at the best place..." The words sound painful and even to the young witch it hurt to hear about their troubles and she was never all that close to them in the past… or future but something getting in the way of their bond just seemed wrong somehow.</p><p>"What?" She asks, hoping to get him to elaborate more on the subject.</p><p>"He knows something is different... I'm different and I can't tell him why." Fred sighs but before the once adult witch can try to comfort him he continues, "But enough of the family drama, what are we going to do about this war?"</p><p>Hermione doesn't look like she wants to drop it but after a minute decides to file it away for another time after all Weasley men don’t like to be pushed too hard all at once, "Well I thought I'd befriended Harry and Ron first but..." Now Hermione wonders if it’ll ever be what it once was, that thought scares her.</p><p>"It won't be the same..." Fred says as if reading her thoughts but she doesn’t dwell on it. "Yeah there's that, I was already prepared to do whatever needed to be done by myself for the most part, at least at first I know they’re too young to be of much help to the cause right now."</p><p>There’s an awkward pause before Fred speaks up, "Well I have plenty of free time if you need help sneaking into the restricted section."</p><p>"I could've done it myself before..." Hermione sighs, even without the invisibility cloak she could have managed it with her knowledge and magic, but everything was different now, harder.</p><p>He nods, "Lack of control and the smaller magically core is a hassle when you have knowledge that goes beyond what you’re currently capable of, I'm sure you've noticed."</p><p>"I have," The witch pouted making the redheaded teen grin, "Well it's a good thing that I've had the time to practice some. Meet you at midnight in the common room?"</p><p>Never would she had thought that she’d hear those words from someone other than Harry or Ron and from a Weasley twin no less, but she agrees, "First we'll look for time travel to see if there’s anything that could tell us about what happened and then something that could help with stabilizing a magical core, we need to be able to advance faster."</p><p>Fred nods, "You got it boss lady."</p><p>Hermione huffs, "You know I hate it when you call me that."</p><p>He laughs, "I know, why do you think I do it?"</p><p>Thus, Hermione became Fred’s partner in crime she only hoped it would be a temporary alliance as she could see this one being potentially much more hazardous to her health than her time as one-third of the golden trio ever was.</p><p>-</p><p>A/N: Thanks for reading please drop a review if you get a chance, also I have a Harry Potter crossover story if you would like to read more Harry Potter from me.</p>
