    <p>Shiskani looked over the southern lands, despondent at the reminders of the horrible war that her people had waged barely a century ago.  The land was still deeply affected as were the people of the land. Cities were scarce and those that still stood were full of bomb shelters and steel reinforced buildings. People didn't trust one another and especially distrusted the foreigners and those unlike them.</p><p>  And the Maja, her Maja, still bore the scars from the things that had been done to them during and directly after the war.  Numbers were small. Some of the young were kept from going on their traditional journey to find a clan to raise their own children in.  Southern Katheska's recovery was still so slow. Shiskani had never been a patient goddess.  </p><p>She wondered if anything could be done.  Her elders told her that one couldn't rush healing. </p><p>"They will recover, the Maja are strong.  Before long their number will increase to the number of stars in the sky.  Their troubles are only fertilizer to enrich them.". </p><p>As much as she hated to criticise her elders, Shiskani thought that view was foolish.  How could such pain and suffering be enriching? The war and the persecution they faced cut the number of Maja in half or more.  She was told she mustn't do anything rash.  </p><p>But Shiskani struggled at not being rash.  When she saw injustice she sought to correct it. With force if necessary.  The world wasn't fair, but it should be, in her opinion. </p><p>-----</p><p>Technically they weren't supposed to cross the veil.  </p><p>Shiskani did sometimes, when she needed room to breath from her war-torn lands.  Maybe it was to keep herself from acting out rashly. But this particular time, something she saw made that difficult.  </p><p>She found a little wizard child living in a house- a house but certainly not any kind of home- of muggles.  The muggles treated her atrociously, only calling her "freak" and "girl". The poor child lived in a cupboard under the stairs while their spoiled boy enjoyed <em> two </em> bedrooms. She was made to clean and cook like a servant as young as four years old.  She was beaten when she changed her appearance.</p><p>Shiskani was enraged.  She had always been especially vengeful when it came to children being harmed.  Many of those who had persecuted the young Maja children could attest to her curses.  She looked upon the history of the poor girl and saw who was also to blame for her plight.  Albus Dumbledore.  </p><p>He saw fit to place a child with these monsters did he?  Well...she'd see about him. But first the child and her relatives. After a particularly nasty beating, the walrus of a man retired to his bedroom.  Shiskani considered cursing him but thought of a better idea.  </p><p>His <em> son </em>.  The piglet adored his parents now. But when he knew what they'd done to his very own cousin...  And he'd know. She saw to that. No worse curse than for one's progeny to know of their worst sins and despise them. She then took the little girl and carried her across the veil.  </p><p>That night in the southern lands of Katheska, a young Maja couple were blessed with a daughter.  Shiskani was confident they were good people and would raise young Holly Potter with far more kindness than she had been afforded so far.  </p><p>------</p><p>Albus Dumbledore was left with regret.  The ethereal being that had haunted him had spared no fury while telling him exactly what became of the Girl Who Lived.  He had been wrong, so very wrong, about Petunia. He knew from the curse she placed upon him that he would be reliving the childs' plight in his dreams.  </p><p>The only thing she didn't tell him was where Holly was now.</p>
