  <strong>Darkness</strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>30 July 1991</strong>
</p><p>The darkness overshadowed the awakening town of Little Whinging, Surrey. At Number Four, Privet Drive, all the residents were sound asleep except for one boy.</p><p>This skinny, small, raven-haired boy, with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead, by the name of Harry Potter was awakening, feeling restless, edgy and jittery if you will, for some reason he couldn’t define. It wasn’t because of the soft anguish he felt in his whole body when he moved, it wasn’t the soreness of his muscles, not the bruises and wounds from yesterday’s punishment and definitely not the hungry stomach he almost got used to. No, it was something else. It almost felt as if something important was about to happen, something with a sense of foreboding, Harry thought.</p><p> </p><p>Harry moved his left hand under the small matrass and took his alarm clock, the one he salvaged from the damaged and broken contents box of his cousin Dudley’s second bedroom. He’d secretly repaired the clock, finding it more than useful to have a clock because he didn’t want to give his aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon any more reason to be mad at him, like being late for making breakfast.</p><p>It was only six, so Harry would have another twenty minutes before he needed to get up and get dressed. He put the alarm clock on the one shelf in his cupboard, where he could see the large hand of the clock moving every minute.</p><p> </p><p>Harry scratched the wound on his right upper arm unconsciously, because the itch was unbearable when he was awake and wondered about how nice it would be if he was allowed to have dinner today. Even though he really wanted to, he never really wished until it was his birthday, he didn’t want to use up all the wishing power throughout the year, so that he had none left for his birthday. Tomorrow was the 31<sup>st</sup> of July, tomorrow was his birthday.</p><p>And he would wish the same thing he wished ever since he could remember. That someone would take him away to a place where they did like him, not love and maybe not even like, just a place where people tolerated him.</p><p> </p><p>~~~~~~</p><p>
  <strong>Three-and-a-half hours later</strong>
</p><p>
  <u>Minerva </u>
</p><p>Every morning, when I entered my office, I walked over to my desk, sat down, cleaned my glasses with a cleansing spell, and looked at the IN mailbox and the OUT mailbox on both sides of my desk. The letters in the OUT mailbox weren’t written by me most of the time, they were automated Hogwarts letters to the 11-year-old children. As Deputy Headmistress, one of my tasks was reading the addressing to the young witch or wizard and sometimes make a house call if that 11-year-old was a muggleborn. The point with the automated letters was quite simple to understand, one day before the child would turn 11, I would receive a letter with that child’s name and address on it, and if everything seemed to be in order, I would call for my personal house elf Windy to send the letter away by owl.</p><p> </p><p>And that was just what I did this morning.</p><p>I knew I had a lot to do today; answering all the mail I received from parents and students and having to do many more things after that, I quickly checked the OUT box. Only one envelope was lying in the OUT box in contrast to IN box, which always seemed to be too small. I ignored the fact that the sky was darker than other mornings and took the envelope out of the OUT box and glanced over the letter.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Mr. H. Potter, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The Cupboard under the Stairs,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>4 Privet Drive, </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Little Whinging,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>SURREY</em>
</p><p> </p><p>I couldn’t believe I hadn’t thought of the date today or tomorrow and the importance it held. Tomorrow was Harry Potter’s birthday! James’ and Lily’s son would turn eleven. Sighing, I looked more closely at the letter, and while my eyes move over the letters on the envelope I thought of delivering it myself, but I knew that Albus would insist on trying it the ‘normal way’ first. My eyes rested on Surrey and I was about to call my Windy to send the letter when my brain caught up with what I’d read. I moved my eyes back to the second line, where the sleeping place of the child was written.</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The Cupboard under the Stairs,</em>
</p><p> </p><p>My eyes widened in disbelief. This was one of the reasons why someone needed to check the letters before they were sent off. To check the address for any abnormalities and a cupboard under the stairs was definitely an abnormality. And unwillingly, I thought back to a certain conversation between Albus and myself. On the doorstep of Harry’s family, where I had begged Albus not to send the little Potter to.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Flashback</em>
</p><p>“You don’t mean- you can’t mean the people who live here? Dumbledore, you can’t. You couldn’t find two people who are less like us,” I pleaded.</p><p>
  <em>End flashback</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore’s reasoning had been fair, of course Harry needed to be protected from the papers and You-Know-Who’s followers, but to send him away to that awful family… It had never felt right to me but I didn’t go against Dumbledore and his judgement of the situation. But this time I would. This time I definitely would.</p><p>Pertinent, I stood up and walked out of my office, on my way to Dumbledore’s office to ask permission to go to Surrey. With the envelope in my hand and already halfway to the Headmasters office, I changed my mind. In normal cases I wouldn’t have to ask Dumbledore’s permission to visit one of these ‘alleged abuse’ cases and I decided I didn’t want to ask for his permission now either. I decided to stop by Severus’ office in the dungeons. He would have to join me.</p><p> </p><p>When I entered the dungeons, I saw Severus standing with his back to me, at a table with four cauldrons, three of them empty and one that was filled with an orange liquid.</p><p>“Minerva, to what do I owe the pleasure this morning?” Severus drawled, with his back still to me.</p><p>“I have Mr. Potter’s Hogwarts letter,” I said, not knowing how to begin exactly.</p><p>Severus sighed deeply and turned away from his cauldron to send me a look of disbelief.</p><p>“What would you like me to do to it? Applaud it?” Severus asked sarcastically.</p><p>Inside of me the irritation rose almost instantly and I pressed the letter in front of his hooked nose.</p><p>“What is so special about that snotty little boy’s letter…-”</p><p>“Don’t you think that is an odd place to sleep in? A cupboard under the stairs?” I asked, ignoring his comment.</p><p>Severus’ face was unreadable. He was obviously thinking but there was no way to tell <em>what</em> he was thinking.</p><p>“You should check it then,” Severus hissed and turned back to his cauldron, where and opaque orange liquid was boiling now.</p><p>“But Albus will hold me off, tell me not to go there,” I said, my voice crystal clear.</p><p>“Then don’t stop by Albus,” Severus bit out.</p><p>“You know I need to have someone with me, if there is a chance it is an abuse case,” I said, hating the way my voice trembled.</p><p>“Ask someone else,” Severus bit out again.</p><p>“Severus, please,” it was an unspoken agreement that we didn’t talk about Severus’ abusive past. But he was the expert on abuse cases and every time an alleged abuse case arose with one of our students, Severus would join me and look for any of the signs. He had a trained eye for it.</p><p>“I’ll meet you in your office in half an hour. Tell Mrs. Figg that we’re coming through her floo.”</p><p>“Thank you, Severus,” I said and I meant it.</p><p> </p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p>
  <u>Harry </u>
</p><p>The darkness had faded away and with that, the jittery feeling I had waking up this morning. The Dursleys had eaten their breakfast together, which was odd, because on a normal day uncle Vernon wouldn’t have time to eat with aunt Petunia and Dudley. But today he had a meeting at 10:30 and decided to go in later than usual, because he worked so long last week.</p><p>While I was doing the dishes, I looked at the clock which almost stroke 10 when the doorbell rang.</p><p>“Go see who it is, Petunia, I’m almost late for work!” uncle Vernon shouted to aunt Petunia.</p><p>Uncle Vernon looked at me, moved his finger to the couch in the living room and continued to tie his tie. I followed uncle Vernon’s clue and quickly hid behind the couch in the farthest corner of the living room, not wanting to risk the guests seeing me and getting another beating from uncle Vernon tonight.</p><p>I shivered silently at the thought.</p><p>“Hello Mrs. Dursley, would you mind if we came in?” a female voice sounded friendly.</p><p>“What are you freaks doing here?!!” aunt Petunia shrieked and uncle Vernon hurried to the front door with his moustache trembling above his lip.</p><p>Dudley was upstairs, probably playing a video game behind his new game computer, but I guess even he’d heard aunt Petunia shriek.</p><p>“Hello to you too, Tuney,” a smooth male voice drawled.</p><p>I was curious to see who the people were but I didn’t dare to move away from my hiding place.</p><p>“Don’t point that thing at me!” aunt Petunia said indignant.</p><p>Then I heard footsteps and I saw uncle Vernon walking backwards into the living room with his hands up, followed by aunt Petunia, who had her hands raised a little as well.</p><p>They were followed by a black-haired man, completely dressed in black who pointed a black wooden stick towards the both of them.</p><p>“Severus, I really don’t think this is necessary,” the woman’s voice said stern.</p><p>The man pointed his stick to the couches where I was hiding behind and then I saw his eyes resting on me. I quickly hid behind the couch but I knew he had seen me. I still hadn’t seen the woman but I didn’t dare to start looking now.</p><p>“Why don’t you sit down on the couch and we will have a talk,” the man said in a tone as if he found this all very funny.</p><p>I heard one big plump and one small plump but didn’t feel the couch I was leaning against move, so I guessed that they’d sat down on the couch next to this one. I moved more backwards against the peach-coloured wall.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing here, freaks?” aunt Petunia shrieked again.</p><p>“We came here to ask you something about Harry Potter,” the woman’s voice said.</p><p>My eyes widened. They couldn’t be here for me, they couldn’t. And if they didn’t stop pissing off aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon I would get the worst beating of a lifetime tonight.</p><p>“You see, I was about to send his Hogwarts letter, when I noticed something concerning. We seem to believe that he sleeps in a cupboard under the stairs,” the woman’s voice sounded angry for some reason and I pressed myself fully against the wall, taking care that I didn’t touch the curtains on the other side of me.</p><p>“And what is so wrong about that?” uncle Vernon hissed angrily.</p><p>“Dudley, go back upstairs now!” aunt Petunia shrieked.</p><p>I quickly heard hard plumps going up the stairs again and a door slamming shut.</p><p>“It seems that your son is obese? Didn’t you know that that is child abuse? As well as locking children in a cupboard?” the woman’s voice sneered now.</p><p>“Take that back! Our son isn’t obese! He gets everything he deserves!” uncle Vernon snarled back.</p><p>“Yet, it is alright to lock your nephew in a cupboard?” the man’s voice sneered and even though I couldn’t see their faces, I could feel the anger loud and clear.</p><p>“That freak got what he deserved. He’s eating all our preciously earned food, getting all of Dudley’s old clothes and a roof over his head! That is more than that freak deserves!” aunt Petunia hissed back indignantly.</p><p>“And that purely out of the goodness of our hearts, because we wanted to put that little devil on the street so many times, but yet here he is, in our house, eating our food,” uncle Vernon said, obviously feeling proud of himself. Even though I disliked the Dursleys, they were right. I felt myself get nauseous and guilty, I really wasn’t worth all of this trouble.</p><p> </p><p>“So you wouldn’t mind if I called the authorities and showed them a picture of where he sleeps? Or show him a photo of his injuries? Or the clothes he is wearing? Or the doctors report that he is severely food deprived? You think that they would say that you are completely right in abusing this boy?” the man’s voice sounded soft but very, very dangerous.</p><p>His voice almost made me shiver out of fear, but I sat as still as I could and suppressed the shiver.</p><p>A high humourless shriek of aunt Petunia filled the room.</p><p>“Hah!”</p><p>“And why do you even care? He isn’t your kid, even though he is just as freaky as you are, but wake up Snape! She left you for Potter! Why do you care about…” aunt Petunia sounded triumphant but then silence filled the living room.</p><p>“Mr. Potter, would you be so kind to get away from behind the couch?” the man’s voice sounded not unfriendly.</p><p>My heart pounded in my chest. Uncle Vernon and aunt Petunia would kill me if the guests saw me, but they already did. I debated whether or not I should listen to the man’s question, but I guessed I was already in more trouble than ever. So let’s just get this over with.</p><p>I sighed and rose to my feet.</p><p>I saw aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon sitting on the couch and then I looked at the white man with black hair, also dressed in black. Then my eyes fell on a woman, dressed in green in the same weird type of clothing as the man was dressed in.</p><p>The woman had her hair tucked back in a bun and a square pair of glasses through which she looked at me incisively.</p><p> </p><p>
  <u>Minerva</u>
</p><p>When Harry rose, the first thing I saw were bruises on his arms. He was wearing a t-shirt that was at least four sizes too large, just like the pants and the left glass of his round glasses was broken, but he still wore them as if nothing was wrong.</p><p>Harry was shaking, I didn’t know if he knew he was shaking, but he seemed to be afraid, very very afraid.</p><p>His pale skin-colour and bruises seemed even more prominent because of the sharp contrast to the awful peach-coloured walls and the pink curtains.</p><p>I ignored the people on the couch who were talking, even though no sound was heard because of Severus’ silencing spell. They waved with their hands rather largely but Severus pointed his wand threatening at them and they stopped protesting and moving immediately.</p><p>I could only look at Harry, trembling in fear. I wanted to protect him, I needed to protect him.</p><p>“Hello, you must be Harry Potter,” I said softly, while smiling friendly at him.</p><p>Harry didn’t show any comfort after I smiled and I suppressed the urge to furrow my brows.</p><p>“Yes, I am Harry Potter,” he said shy, holding back and not stepping away from behind the couch.</p><p>“Mr. Potter, my name is Minerva McGonagall and I am a Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,” I said slowly, trying to keep my voice light and friendly.</p><p>Harry just stood there and said nothing. He seemed to freeze in his spot and said nothing.</p><p>“Minerva allow me; my name is Severus Snape. Have you ever heard of Hogwarts Mr. Potter?” Severus asked in a way friendlier tone than I’d ever hear him speak in.</p><p>Before I could think about what a weird question that is to ask Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry shook his head.</p><p>How could he not know about his ancestry? About what he’d done?</p><p>With a wave of his wand, Severus turned back to the people on the couch.</p><p>“You didn’t tell him anything?!” Severus hissed at the woman.</p><p>“When we took him in, we promised we would not tolerate that freakishness,” the fat man on the couch answered angrily.</p><p>I moved my hand in front of my mouth to hide my shock. How could they not tell him? How could they?</p><p>Before anyone could speak again, Harry’s stomach rumbled loud and I decided it was enough.</p><p>“Severus?” I said more than I asked.</p><p>“Yes,” he answered.</p><p>He pointed his wand at the man and the woman on the couch, walked into the hallway and opened the cupboard under the stairs.</p><p>“Is there anything you want to bring with you?” I asked Harry.</p><p>Harry didn’t seem to understand and furrowed his brows.</p><p>“Where are we going?” Harry asked so soft I had to listen closely to hear all of it.</p><p>“We are going to find you a new home,” I said pertinent.</p><p>This seemed to be a subject of protest for the man and woman on the couch, but I couldn’t hear them, seeing as Severus placed another silencing spell on them when he’d left the room.</p><p>“Is there anything you want to take with you?” I asked Harry again.</p><p>He shook his head and I nodded when Severus entered the living room again.</p><p>“We will be back to punish you accordingly. Don’t try to run or hide the evidence, you can’t change a single thing,” Severus voice sounded dangerous and he looked at the woman on the couch, who had gotten as pale as the white ceiling while the man was as coloured as the peach-coloured walls with purple spots on his neck and face.</p><p>I extended my hand to Harry but he flinched away almost instantly.</p><p>“Minerva, allow me. Mr. Potter, please follow us. Don’t get out of our sight, do you understand?” Severus said in a friendly tone.</p><p>Harry nodded and stayed silent.</p><p>When Severus removed the silencing charm I could hear the both of them cursing and shouting.</p><p>“Never come back here with that freak! Never! Do you hear me?!” Mr. Dursley shouted from behind us.</p><p>I looked back and saw him waving his fist at us, but all three of us ignored him.</p><p> </p><p>We walked over to Arabella Figg’s house to floo back to Hogwarts. When Arabella opened the door, with a cat on her arm, to let us in, she smiled melancholically at the three of us and let us in.</p><p>Severus stepped into the fireplace and took a hand of floo powder.</p><p>“Mr. Potter, please stand in front of me, with your back towards me,” Severus said solemn.</p><p>Harry obeyed quickly and just before Severed dropped the floo powder and said: Headmasters Office, Hogwarts, I saw a flash of panic across the young Potter’s face.</p><p>When they were gone, I thanked Arabella and told her that she would see me again soon, to handle all the unfinished business.</p><p>I stepped into the fireplace and flooed back to Hogwarts.</p><p>When I arrived in the Headmasters office, I knew that both Severus and I would be punished for going behind Albus’ back, but we had to. And Albus would understand, we would make him see. But apparently Severus had already explained a few things, or Albus already knew, because Albus said:</p><p>“Then I suggest you take young Mr. Potter here to Madam Pomfrey to have her take a look at him. When you return, I want to have a word with both of you.”</p><p>His eyes twinkling behind his half-round glasses.</p><p> </p><p>We headed towards the Hospital Wing in silence and I thought about how confusing everything must be for Harry. Just when I wanted to explain a few things, Severus started talking.</p><p>“Mr. Potter, I believe you have a lot of questions you want answers to, but let me start by explaining why we took you away from your family. You are a wizard Mr. Potter, just like I am and Professor Dumbledore is. A female wizard, like Professor McGonagall is called a witch. Here, at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, we teach young witches and wizards, such as yourself, various types of magic. Your aunt, uncle and cousin are not magical, that’s why we call them muggles, people who cannot do magic. Some muggles that know of wizards, hate them. Your aunt and uncle knew you were able to do magic, but they dislike magic and therefore you. But here at Hogwarts, you will be able to learn everything about the Wizarding World, but be careful, if you don’t follow the rules, you will be punished.”</p><p>We descended another flight of stairs and Harry said nothing.</p><p>“Feel free to ask questions now, Mr. Potter,” Severus said.</p><p>It was silent for a while and after half a minute, a soft voice sounded.</p><p>“I think you are mistaken. I can’t be a wizard. I’m a freak.”</p><p>Anger rose inside of me and the foremost thing I wanted to do is tell him that he is not a freak and curse the one whoever put that into his head, but I knew I had to be careful, not to scare him away.</p><p>“Mister Potter, let me make one thing clear: you are a wizard. If you don’t believe me, why don’t you think back of situations you couldn’t explain? When you were angry or upset?” Severus suggested, sounding stern.</p><p>Harry said nothing for a few minutes and when we were almost at the Hospital Wing, he spoke again.</p><p>“Do I have to go back to the Dursleys?” his voice sounded frightened and shaken as if he just realized something horrible.</p><p>“Mr. Potter, I promise you, you will never have to go back to that hellhole,” Severus said.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Hospital Wing</strong>
</p><p>When we explained to Harry why we wanted Poppy to examine him, he was hesitant at first, but after Severus talked to him for about twenty minutes he agreed to a few diagnostic spells. Meanwhile, Poppy had asked a house elf to bring Harry some food, Harry seemed to be very grateful but insisted that he didn’t want to be a burden to any of us. He had thanked the house elf and us so much that it was almost inappropriately sweet. But my truly heart broke when he told us where the wounds on his back came from, hit with a belt, over and over again for not finishing his chores or sometimes just because. He kept on explaining and why he’d deserved it, calling himself ‘freak’ all the time to much frustration from Severus, Poppy and myself. Poppy had explained that she would give him some potions against the pain and a potion that would make him a little sleepy, so that his body could rest. This also seemed to frighten him, but when Severus told him to drink it, he did so without protest. Not long after, Harry was sound asleep, Poppy was making a report and Severus and I headed to the Headmaster’s office.</p><p>
  <strong>~~~~~~~~~~~~~</strong>
</p><p>“He slept in a cupboard under the stairs! He was food deprived and wearing his cousin’s old rags. He was working there as a slave! And if he didn’t finish all his tasks in time, they’d beat him! Poppy has found proof of in total 37 wounds, bruises, hairlines and fractures of beatings and that are just the ones she can trace back! They have beaten him Albus!” I shouted furiously.</p><p>Without waiting for a response, I continued.</p><p>“You said to me he needed protection and that he would be safe there! You said you had people check in on him every once in a while. He was so thin I could almost see through him! He seems like an eight-year old, not an 11-year old! And he flinched away as soon as I extended my hand for him to take! You can’t tell me that he had a good home there, you can’t! THEY ABUSED HIM!”</p><p>I ignored the sudden wind around us and looked at Albus who still sat behind his desk. Tears streamed over my cheeks as well as over Albus’ cheeks. I couldn’t believe any of this. Albus sat up in his chair, just like Severus, while I was standing there, yelling at him.</p><p>“I didn’t know, I thought he was doing fine Minerva,” Albus said softly.</p><p>“I thought you checked in on him!” I hissed at Albus through my tears.</p><p>“Minerva…” Albus started but was interrupted by Severus.</p><p>“Not that I don’t agree that this needs to be discussed, but I suggest we start looking for a home for the boy as soon as possible. We need to make this right immediately,” Severus sounded so detached that it would almost be described as clinical.</p><p> </p><p>I regained my composure and straightened my robes.</p><p>“You are right Severus. Do you have any suggestions as to what he needs?” I asked him.</p><p>“He needs love, attention and food. Preferably a wizarding family who already has multiple children. It needs to be a good family,” Severus nothing but deadpanned.</p><p>“Why a family where they have more children already?” I asked him.</p><p>“Because he doesn’t like to be in the spotlight where everyone is watching him. I firmly believe he wants to be able to hide among the others, especially since he distrusts grown-ups in the first place. Now I know he needs to be here at Hogwarts in a month, he will be able to train for getting this much attention in a wizarding family. And this way, the children of this family are able to explain things and become his friend. He will feel more at ease with a family with children of his age. Also, when a family will take care of ‘The Boy-Who-Lived’ I believe he will get enough attention as it is. Especially when going to Diagon’ Alley to buy him robes school supplies and other belongings. Even though he will be here at Hogwarts in a month, where he will get all the attention he doesn’t want, he needs to be prepared, to know about magic, about wizarding families. Give him some time to recharge a little and he’ll be able to take on everything at Hogwarts, with the support of his new family.”</p><p>“I believe you are contradicting yourself, my dear Severus,” Albus spoke while pressing the tips of his long fingers together.</p><p>Severus narrowed his eyes at the Headmaster and clenched his jaws. Then, he took a deep breath in, as to calm himself before speaking.</p><p>“Essentially, we want to get him into a wizarding family with multiple children. Because he needs to be prepared for all the unexpected unrestraint questions of children, never mind how cruel or sweet they are intended, and to practice with the wanted and unwanted attention from the common wizard.”</p><p>After listening to Severus’ reasoning, I couldn’t say I agreed whole-heartedly. Wasn’t it better for him to go to a wizarding family without children? Where he would get all the attention and love he needed? I shook my head, Severus knew, like no other what was best for the young Harry.</p><p> </p><p>So, I nodded thoughtfully at Severus words and thought about a family where he could be placed. After thinking and rethinking for minutes, I could only come up with one family that seemed appropriate.</p><p>“The Weasleys?” Albus suggested.</p><p>“That was my guess too, Molly and Arthur would love to have him and they have friendly enough children for him to converse with,” I said, waiting for Severus’ reaction.</p><p>“Do you have any other options in mind Severus?” Albus asked him.</p><p>“None that would be a better fit, no. But there is the financial issue,” Severus said slowly.</p><p>“The funds the Dursleys were getting will be stopped and given to the Weasleys and if the money is the issue I use my own money,” I stated.</p><p>“When do you want to ask the Weasleys, Minerva?” Albus asked while he rubbed away his tears.</p><p>Before I could speak, Severus started talking.</p><p>“As soon as possible. Mr. Potter needs a real home as soon as possible.”</p><p>“I’ll go immediately,” I said and walked over to the fireplace.</p><p>“I will go to the Hospital Wing to see how far Madam Pomfrey is with healing him. I’ll start organizing and gathering all the facts for a case,” Severus said, talking faster than usual.</p><p>“Minerva, Severus, before you go, the Dursleys will get what they deserve, I can promise you that,” Albus said resolutely and nodded at the both of us.</p><p>“This discussion is <em>not</em> over Albus,” I warned him and looked sternly at the both of them before entering the fireplace to floo to the Burrow.</p><p>We were going to help Lily and James’ son. I was going to make sure he’d have a safe and loving home this time. I wouldn’t take anyone’s word for it this time.</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>The Burrow</strong>
</p><p>
  <u>Molly</u>
</p><p>When lunch was over I was glad to sit down for a little while, just before I had to start cooking dinner. The kids were all, relatively calm, busying themselves before they were allowed to fly on their broomsticks; Charlie was in his room, playing with his miniature dragons, Bill was playing Wizarding Chess with Ron while Ginny watched, Percy was reading a book on the couch and the twins were cleaning up the table from lunch.</p><p>I sat down for about two minutes when I accioed a cook book to see what I would make for dinner, when I suddenly heard the floo go off. I hurried myself to the fireplace and yelled for Arthur, who was already working in his shed in the garden. Percy, Ginny, Ron and Bill were all looking at the fireplace, because it wasn’t often someone just flooed into our home without announcing it first. Bill drew his wand immediately and pointed it at the fireplace.</p><p>A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes, stepped out of the fireplace. Her hair was covered by a pointed hat cocked to one side. The expression on her face was prim which was accentuated by her square glasses. I recognized the Deputy Headmistress immediately, sent her a questioning look, but Minerva McGonagall’s face betrayed nothing but seriousness and I furrowed my brows.</p><p>“Molly,” she said, sounding very serious.</p><p>“Minerva, is there something wrong?” I asked quickly, while the children in the room were silently watching now.</p><p>“Yes, I would like to speak with Arthur and you if that’s possible,” Minerva said and she looked at my children who were staring at the both of us and Bill who lowered his wand.</p><p>“Arthur!” I yelled again towards the shed.</p><p>Then I turned to my children, who were all looking at me curiously.</p><p>“Children, go upstairs and do not come back until I call you, do you understand? And tell your brothers!” I said seriously, hoping they wouldn’t protest.</p><p>Percy nodded immediately, and continued reading his book while walking up the stairs. Bill carefully carried the chessboard while Ron brought the knocked chess pieces and Ginny hurried to take a Witch Weekly magazine from the coffee table.</p><p>When Ginny went upstairs last, Arthur entered the living room with a black smear on his right cheek. I hurriedly polished it away with my thumb, to which Arthur smiled gratefully at me.</p><p>“Minerva, to what do we owe the pleasure?” Arthur asked and came to stand next to me after he had shaken Minerva’s hand.</p><p>Minerva smiled solemn and took out her wand, waved it in a circle around the room to place silencing spells, the sleeves of her robes swooshing with the movement. After that was finished, she put her wand back in her robes.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Minerva seemed to be struggling with what she wanted to say and I didn’t want to interrupt her by asking questions.</p><p>“Where are our manners? Minerva, please have a seat, would you like some tea?” Arthur suggested kindly and pointed to a brown fauteuil to her right.</p><p>“Yes,” she said, turned around to the brown-leathered fauteuil and sat down rather ragged.</p><p>Arthur wanted to walk to the kitchen to make the tea but I put my hand on his and walked to the kitchen myself. When the tea was done I placed the cups and tea pot on the small coffee table, removing two dragon figurines with my wand and poured the three of us a cup of tea. After I handed Minerva her plain-white cup, I sat down next to Arthur on our brown-leathered couch. Minerva pressed her lips together so a thin line appeared. After sighing deeply, she looked us in the eyes through her square pair of glasses. I leaned back into Arthurs arms and placed my hand on his leg.</p><p> </p><p>“Molly and Arthur, it will be very difficult for me to ask this of you, but trust me when I say that you are the best choice by far,” Minerva started hesitantly.</p><p>All kinds of thoughts went through my head and I wondered if my worst nightmare was about to come true. Was Minerva now going to tell us that You-Know-Who had returned? Her face didn’t betray the subject, but the worry was clear in her eyes. I suppressed a shiver and nodded at Minerva, to stimulate her to continue, not wanting to postpone any bad news.</p><p>“There is a child, raised by muggles, who was severely abused. This child, this boy, was beaten, starved and told that he was a freak,” Minerva’s voice faltered shortly, but she continued.</p><p>“The boy is very neat and very friendly. A little shy and reserved but that is to be expected when his aunt and uncle used to beat and starve him. He is very cautious around adults and constantly apologizing for everything he does or says, even when he’s answering our questions. Molly and Arthur, they treated him almost worse than a house elf,” the emotion was raw and palpable in her voice and I could feel a lump appear in my throat. On the inside, I felt myself get angry, furious even. How dare they treat a child like that!</p><p>“Arthur. Molly,” she said seriously and looked straight at us through her glasses.</p><p>“We, Albus, Severus and I were wondering, if you would consider taking him in. And before you say no, please allow me to explain. This is a special boy, with special needs, but his first need is food, attention and especially love. I know for a fact that that is what he will be able to get here from the both of you. But this is not just a question for the both of you because your children also need to be okay with this. This will take a toll on your whole family and we don’t want to search for another home after one week when this doesn’t work out. He doesn’t deserve all this fuss,” Minerva said.</p><p> </p><p>We were silent, all three of us were thinking. I thought about what it would mean for our children, what it would mean for us, financially as well. Would the boy fit in? What if I wasn’t able to control him, or able to connect with him? What if he was afraid of us? What if he would be unhappy here? What if they didn’t place him here and instead placed him somewhere else, would he be better off somewhere else? Even though Minerva, Severus and Albus thought about this thoroughly before even asking us.</p><p>“How old is he, Minerva?” Arthur asked, breaking the silence.</p><p>“This year he will be a first year at Hogwarts, I believe the same age as your son Ronald,” Minerva said smiling as she picked up her cup of tea.</p><p>“When would you like to hear the answer?” Arthur asked Minerva.</p><p>“As soon as possible. We will start searching for another family this afternoon if you decide not to take him, but please think hard about this,” Minerva pressed and furrowed her brows now.</p><p>She took a sip from her tea while Arthur turned to me.</p><p>He looked me straight in my eyes, almost with a pleading look.</p><p>“Molly, do you think it’s worth asking our children what they think? Or do you want to say no already?” he asked me.</p><p>I sighed deeply, wondering how we would ever manage it financially but nodded anyway. If Albus Dumbledore, Severus Snape and Minerva McGonagall thought it would be best for the boy to stay here, then I think we should give it a chance. We have to give him a chance.</p><p>I took a deep breath.</p><p>“I think we should ask the children. What do you think?”</p><p>His eyes softened and he placed a kiss on my cheek.</p><p>“I was thinking the exact same thing.”</p><p>I smiled broadly at him and squeezed his hand lightly.</p><p> </p><p>The sound of a cup being placed on the table, disrupted our thoughts.</p><p>“Before you are going to ask your children, I have something to tell you about the boy. Something else,” Minerva said and we turned back to look at her sitting in front of us.</p><p>“What is it, Minerva?” Arthur asked and took his cup of tea to take a sip.</p><p>“When I told you the boy is special, I wasn’t exaggerating. He will need much more protection than some young wizard, because the boy in question is… Harry Potter.”</p><p>I gasped and Arthur choked on his tea.</p><p>“I see,” my husband said simply after couching once.</p><p>“And you truly believe that he would fit here best?” I asked Minerva, just to be sure.</p><p>The Deputy Headmistress had just taken a sip of her tea and nodded. She put down her cup and swallowed.</p><p>“All three of us think so. Your children are friendly. Arthur will not be so intimidating for Harry as other fathers and Molly both of you are fair, able to explain why certain things are and aren’t allowed, good with healing spells, on top of that, your whole family will be able to provide him a loving family and a home.”</p><p>I nodded while thinking about what she had said and looked around the living room. It was a mess with all kinds of items from almost every child laying around. But even though it was a mess, it looked like a warm nest, a home of a family, at least that’s what I hoped it looked like.</p><p>“How is his physical and mental condition? Are there certain things we should or shouldn’t do?” Arthur wondered and sent Minerva a questioning look.</p><p>“When we arrived at Hogwarts we sent him to the Hospital Wing. Poppy gave him a potion against the pain, the Draught of Dreamless Sleep, treated his fresh wounds with Essence of Dittany and applied Healing Salve on the older bruises after that. The Healing Salve needs to be repeated every day until his injuries are completely healed.”</p><p>I clenched my jaws and my hand on Arthur’s leg was subconsciously squeezing his leg in anger. The poor boy shouldn’t have been treated like that. No child should ever be treated like that.</p><p>“Before I ask you if you are certain that you will discuss this with your children, I have to tell you one more thing. Just to be sure that you know what you are getting yourselves into…”</p><p>A pause and both Arthur and I waited patiently for Minerva’s next words.</p><p>“He doesn’t know anything about the wizarding world. Until a few hours ago he didn’t know about witches and wizards and he also doesn’t know how his parents died. He is pretty much alienated from the whole wizarding world and the ‘normal facts’ that the common wizard knows of. He doesn’t know he is special. He believed he didn’t deserve food before finishing a list of chores.”</p><p> </p><p>All three of us were silent.</p><p>I was thinking about having to tell a shy, distrustful, sensitive boy about the death of his parents, about the wizarding world. It would take a long time for him to be comfortable, I was sure of that.</p><p>“You will of course receive a sum of money every month, from the care-funds. I believe it is 232 galleons a month,” the witch in the green robes said suddenly.</p><p>My eyes were rested on Charlie’s miniature dragons on the coffee table and my eyes shot to Arthur as soon as I heard this. I’d expected Arthur to respond more enthusiastically but contrary to my expectations he just smiled at me, as if he already knew that we would receive this high amount of money when taking care of an orphan.</p><p> </p><p>More minutes passed and when Arthur took my hand, squeezed it softly and winked at me, I knew he had made a decision.</p><p>“I’m ready to ask the kids, what about you Molly?”</p><p>“I’m ready too,” I answered.</p><p>Then, without another word Minerva rose from her seat and sent us a warm smile. I quickly rose from my seat and I reciprocated her smile. Arthur followed my move and also smiled friendly at the deputy headmistress.</p><p>“Molly and Arthur, you can floo call the Headmaster’s office when you have made a decision.”</p><p>“Thank you, Minerva,” Arthur said and extended his hand.</p><p>The deputy headmistress shook both of our hands before taking a hand of floo powder and stepping into the fireplace.</p><p>“Are you ready, Mollywobbles?” the loving voice sounded, coming from my husband’s lips.</p><p>“I’m ready.”</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>It took all the children less than two minutes to gather around the living room. Arthur and I sat down on the brown-leather couch we sat on a few minutes ago and the children plumped down on the two fauteuils and the other two pale-red, worn couches.</p><p>“What did the Deputy Headmistress want, Mum?” Percy asked, sounding sincerely interested.</p><p>The other children didn’t say anything and looked at Arthur and me in full anticipation.</p><p>Arthur looked at me, as if silently asking who of us would tell them. I nodded towards him and he sent me a warm smile back.</p><p>“Children, Professor McGonagall came by to ask a favour. A huge favour. You see, she wanted to know if we would possible take care of an 11-year-old boy. At least until he goes to Hogwarts,” Arthur said calm, smiling at all the kids individually.</p><p>All of the children started to talk disorderly and I started to grin, before silencing them.</p><p>“Children, let your father explain please,” I said stern and all of them became silent.</p><p>“Your mother and I thought about this only for a short amount of time. But this situation is a pressing matter. The boy is an orphan and was abused by his aunt and uncle who were supposed to take care of him. Severely abused. And because his aunt and uncle were muggles, the boy didn’t know about magic until a few hours ago. Professor McGonagall told us that, Professor Dumbledore also found our family the best option for the boy. Simply because you are nice children, who could really make him feel welcome. But even though your mother and I really want to help this boy, your opinions also matter to us. So if you all think that the boy is not welcome here, the Headmaster needs to find another home for the boy.”</p><p>Ginny’s mouth was open and her eyes were wide, as were Ron’s. Charlie, like Bill, furrowed his brows, Percy pursed his lips, and the twins seemed conflicted.</p><p>When Ron’s mouth opened to say something I quickly said: “All of you will get a say in this, so wait your turn. Bill, you can start.”</p><p>Bill leaned back in the brown fauteuil and pulled his long hair into a ponytail before talking.</p><p>“I think that I should have little say in this, mum. In four days I have to get back to Egypt so I don’t think I’ll see much of the kid. I don’t have any objections though. If Dumbledore and McGonagall think that this is the best place for the kid to go, then I think we should consider it seriously, right?” Bill said.</p><p>“But what about-…” Ron started and I raised my finger warning at Ron, who sat on one of the pale-red couches.</p><p>“Ron, wait your turn. Bill, I indeed forgot you would leave so soon. But you will be back on the first to wave your brothers off, right?” I asked Bill, who nodded in response.</p><p>“Good. Charlie, what do you think?” I asked Charlie.</p><p>Charlie stopped playing with his miniature Romanian Longhorn and shrugged a little.</p><p>“Well, mum, I think I agree with Bill, I start in Romania at September 2<sup>nd</sup> so I guess I will only see him for a short month. I think it’s alright if he lives here until then,” Charlie said simply.</p><p>“Yes of course, Charlie. Percy, what do you think?”</p><p>Percy had his lips still pursed and furrowed his brows now too.</p><p>“I think that we should think hard about this, because if he’s abused he’d probably be afraid of most of the things we do around here; shouting, yelling, play fighting and Quidditch. And then there is the financial situation,” Percy said business-like.</p><p>I blinked once, sometimes still getting confused about Percy’s personality traits he didn’t seem to get from either Arthur or me.</p><p>“We will not think of this lightly, but we can manage the financial situation,” I said slowly.</p><p>Percy nodded at me and I turned to the twins at the second pale-red couch.</p><p>“Fred and George?” I asked.</p><p>“We don’t have any objections, but where will he sleep?” Fred asked curious.</p><p>“We haven’t thought about that yet. George do you agree with Fred’s opinion?”</p><p>“Yuppp,” George said, dragging out the p.</p><p>“Okay Ron, now you can say what you think,” I gestured to my youngest son and Arthur squeezed my hand lightly.</p><p>“Well uh, how long will he stay?” Ron asked, getting a little red in his neck.</p><p>Charlie stood up to sit back down immediately, now with his feet on the couch. But before I could answer Ron’s question, Arthur already said: “Ron, you can say and ask anything you want. We don’t know, but I think that if he feels at home here, Professor McGonagall and Dumbledore hope that he could stay here until he finishes Hogwarts.”</p><p>I nodded and sent Ron a nice smile.</p><p>“But what if we don’t like him? Will you send him away?” Ron asked softly.</p><p>“We will send him away if we find that necessary. When he is disrupting this family’s peace, we will send him away, but I really hope we can be the loving family for him, which he deserves,” I said clear, with a single shiver in my voice.</p><p>“Okay, I think that that will be alright,” Ron said hesitant.</p><p>“I have no objections, yet,” Ginny said immediately.</p><p> </p><p>When my daughter barged on, I looked at my youngest son, who seemed to be struggling with what he thought he should be thinking and saying. So I decided to talk to him alone after all of this was done.</p><p> </p><p>“Well… Then I think it is time for us to tell you what we know. But before we do that, is there anyone of you who has any objections? You can say whatever you think,” Arthur said, smiling at all of our children individually again.</p><p>None of them said anything.</p><p>“But Dad, what’s his name? And what does he look like?” George blurted out suddenly.</p><p>Arthur looked around to all of our children, and then inhaled slowly.</p><p>“The boy’s name is Harry Potter.”</p><p>Ginny gasped, the twins’ eyes widened, Percy looked baffled, Charlie just blinked and Bill furrowed his brows.</p><p>All my children, with the exception of Ron, were asking if we were serious, checking that we weren’t playing a joke on them.</p><p>“Harry Potter? <em>The </em>Harry Potter?” Ginny asked utterly surprised.</p><p>“Really Dad? This isn’t some joke?” Fred asked loudly now.</p><p>“Let me make one thing clear!” Arthur shouted over all the children’s’ questions and exclamations.</p><p>Everyone but Fred and George became silent and after sending them a stern look, they shut up as well.</p><p>“Your mother and I would never ever joke about serious business like this. If we are going to take care of Harry Potter, more safety measures will have to be placed around our house. And let’s not forget that he doesn’t know anything about magic, and especially about what happened,” Arthur said softly, yet stern.</p><p>All the children seemed flabbergasted at their Dad’s stern voice, so they knew we were dead serious.</p><p> </p><p>I looked at my youngest son, who seemed to be really struggling, because he repeatedly opened and closed his mouth.</p><p>“Ron, sweetheart, what is it you’d like to say? You can say anything,” I assured him.</p><p> “Well, it won’t be special when I go to Hogwarts anymore. You’ll only think about him!” Ron blurted out, voicing his concerns quite bluntly. I looked at Arthur, who sent me a warm smile before replying.</p><p>“Ron, come here,” I said and gestured to my lap.</p><p>Ron stood up, gruffly, and walked over to me, as if he still wasn’t sure he wanted to.</p><p>I took his hands into mine and looked him straight in the eye.</p><p>“Ronald Bilius Weasley,” I said, “you are our 6<sup>th</sup> son and nothing will ever change that. You are very special for both your father and I. And we love you all equally, nothing will change that.”</p><p>I paused for a second to make sure he listened carefully to every word I spoke before continuing.</p><p>“You are different from all your five older brothers and they are also all different from each other. You said that you felt a little nervous about going to Hogwarts a few weeks ago right?” a small nod was the only reaction, “Well, how do you think Harry must feel about all of this? Being abused and hurt and having to go to a school where there is magic for Godric’s sake! He’ll be very frightened. So maybe, you can go together? That way you can help each other, wouldn’t that be nice?” I asked, hoping that I’d said the right things.</p><p>“You really mean that?” Ron asked softly, his brows up high and so looking hopeful.</p><p>“Of course we do,” Arthur said.</p><p>“Yeah, you are special Ronnie!” George said and then Fred started laughing and soon the others joined in.</p><p>Ron wanted to give them an angry look, but when he saw a smile from his twin brothers, he laughed as well.</p><p>“Alright then. He can share my room,” Ron said, smiling up to me and Arthur.</p><p>“That’s really sweet of you, Ron,” I praised my youngest son.</p><p>Ron beamed at this praise and Arthur gave him a hard clap on his shoulder, smiling broad at our youngest son.</p><p>“Molly, do you think he knows the function of calling device? Maurice told me that he found a…”</p><p>“Arthur, I think that that is something you can ask once he is here,” I interrupted him half stern and half amused.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>The children sniggered and I sent all of them a look, not actually meaning it.</p><p>“When will he arrive here?” Percy asked seriously.</p><p>“I don’t know exactly. I will floo to Hogwarts. Maybe in the meantime Arthur, you can make a bed for him in Ron’s room? There is clean bedlinen in the cupboard,” I suggested.</p><p>Arthur nodded and placed a kiss on my cheek.</p><p>“What should we do?” Ginny wondered when I walked to the fireplace and took out a hand of floo powder.</p><p>“Well, when he comes here, we might want to give him a tour, so if you want to show him your room…”</p><p>Ginny jumped up and almost ran up the stairs. Fred and George shrugged, Arthur would join Ron to fix Ron’s room, and the older three boys had already fairly cleaned up rooms, so they just sat there.</p><p>“Are you going to place a Fidelius on our house, Mum?” Bill wondered just as I dropped the floo powder and said: “Hogwarts, Headmasters Office.”</p><p>But yes, maybe the Fidelius was a good idea.</p><p> </p><p>~~~~~~</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Hogwarts, Headmaster’s Office</strong>
</p><p>
  <u>Molly</u>
</p><p>When I stepped out of the fireplace, I looked around the beautiful circular room. The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames. The current Headmaster, Professor Albus Dumbledore, was seated behind an enormous claw-footed desk. The shelf behind it contained a shabby wizard’s hat. The Sorting Hat.</p><p>I looked back at the Headmaster, who was smiling friendly and me.</p><p>“Ah, my dear Molly, how are you?” the old man questioned.</p><p>“Albus,” I said, smiling back just as friendly.</p><p>A phoenix sat on its stick behind the Headmaster and it looked gorgeous. I had always been fascinated by phoenixes and to see one with my own eyes, always seemed to make me feel small around such beauty. The voice of the old man disrupted my thoughts.</p><p>“I think you have come to a conclusion?” Albus asked with a knowing smile playing around his lips.</p><p>“Yes, Albus. We have decided that will take him in. The children have all agreed and of course Arthur and I are willing to help him,” I said.</p><p>“Excellent!” the old man exclaimed happily.</p><p>“I am sure that he will love your home, my dear Molly.”</p><p>“I really hope so, when I’d heard what they did to him…” my voice faltered, not wanting to continue.</p><p>“Believe me, my dear Molly, that his former caretakers will be punished accordingly. I will try and make them pay back all the money they have received that was not spent on Harry’s wellbeing. I hope to be able to give you that money to make up for all the neglect the past few years,” the old man’s voice broke and he sounded so guilty that I immediately felt sorry for the old man.</p><p>The old man bowed his head, it was clear that he was deeply ashamed of himself and it made the Headmaster, almost, seem completely broken.</p><p>“Albus, it isn’t your fault that he was abused,” I said, the emotion overpowering my voice more than I wanted to.</p><p>“I should have checked in on him. It was my responsibility.”</p><p>A deafening silence filled the Headmaster’s office and I saw the regret and guilt radiating from his whole demeanour.</p><p>Not knowing what I should say, the Headmaster suddenly straightened his back and sent me a pained smile.</p><p>“You should go to the Hospital Wing; I think you can take him with you as soon as he is awake. Also, I believe Madam Pomfrey would like to have word with you about his medical care.”</p><p>“Of course,” I said.</p><p>I stood up, leaving an old, broken man behind me.</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Hogwarts, Hospital Wing             </strong>
</p><p>
  <u>Molly</u>
</p><p>When I entered the large white Hospital Wing, Madam Pomfrey, the matron of Hogwarts, walked up to me immediately with an extended hand, which I shook.</p><p>“Ah, Mrs. Weasley, there you are. I believe you being here means that you want to take care of the child?” the matron of Hogwarts said explicit.</p><p>“Yes, that is right Madam Pomfrey. I heard from Albus that you wanted to talk to me about his care? I would like to know how I should deal with his wounds,” I said seriously, rubbing my own hands out of sheer nervousness.</p><p>“Yes. Follow me,” the matron said with pursed lips.</p><p>I followed her into the Hospital Wing, where I saw Minerva McGonagall at a young, raven-haired boy’s bed. We stopped next to it and I could see that the sleeping boy was very, very skinny, and smaller than Ron in all ways. I saw the lightning-shaped scar on his forehead between his hair, but I was thankful that the only bruises I could see were the ones on his arm.  I had imagined far worse and was thankful that his face wasn’t covered in it. Though, I couldn’t know what he had under his clothing and blanket.</p><p>“Now,” the matron said matter-of-factly.</p><p>“He has had a potion against the pain, the Draught of Dreamless Sleep. And when he was asleep I treated his fresh wounds with Essence of Dittany and applied Healing Salve on the older bruises after that. The Healing Salve needs to be repeated every day until his injuries are completely healed.”</p><p>The matron looked at me with an incisive look, probably wanting to be sure I understood all of this, before continuing.</p><p>So I nodded curtly, after which she continued.</p><p>“He has several fractures in several different bones, but they were already healing correctly, so I didn’t have to break anything again, luckily for the boy.”</p><p>I nodded again and waited until she continued.</p><p>“As you might know, he can’t eat very much the first few times, because he’ll eat himself sick because his stomach is not used to so much food. Also I have found that his fractures are healed quicker than normal.”</p><p>And again the matron looked at me incisively.</p><p>“So you reckon he used his magic to heal it?” I asked softly.</p><p>“I’m almost a hundred percent sure.”</p><p> </p><p>“Any questions?” the matron said, again sounding very business-like.</p><p>“Yes. I know that he didn’t know about magic or anything else that the common wizarding world seems to know of. Do you have any recommendations or warnings of things which I should and should not mention?” I asked, and feared the answer to be no.</p><p>Now, Minerva McGonagall, who hadn’t spoken a word when I had entered, stood up and walked over to the other side of the boy’s bed and stood still next to us.</p><p>As I expected, Madam Pomfrey, shook her head, but Minerva seemed to have something to say about the matter.</p><p>“I believe that you should tell him everything that your children know as well. And, if he does remember and is traumatized, you can always ask for extra guidance from a trusted Healer from St. Mungo’s. I know a mental Healer we can trust, in case it’s necessary.”</p><p>I nodded and sent both of them a smile. I walked around the bed, and sat down in the chair Minerva had sat down in previously.</p><p>“I will sit with him until he wakes up. Then, I will take him home, if that is alright,” I said, taking the, cold, small boy’s hand into my own.</p><p>“Of course,” both witches said.</p><p>All three of us were looking at the boy in silence. His chest was moving up and down slowly and somehow I felt myself calming down. The nervousness faded and all three of us relaxed.</p><p> </p><p>Madam Pomfrey’s voice whispered on the background.</p><p>“I think he will wake up within the hour. Mrs. Weasley, do you have any clothing he can wear?”</p><p>“Yes, I have plenty of clothing that should fit him. As soon as we are able, we’ll take him to a store for new clothing,” I whispered back.</p><p>Both of the witches nodded, and turned their heads back at the boy.</p><p>I knew I had to warn Arthur that we would come so soon, so I stood up, walked to the entrance of the Hospital Wing and sent my husband a Patronus.  ~</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p> </p><p>
  <strong>Approximately one hour later</strong>
</p><p>
  <u>Molly</u>
</p><p>His clothing had been washed and dried by the house elves of Hogwarts, but even then they seemed like they were at least a few sizes too large for the small boy.</p><p>Meanwhile Madam Pomfrey had given me some advice about diagnostic spells. If I found that he was a bit slower than usual or dull in lack for a better word to describe it, I should contact her immediately. Madam Pomfrey hadn’t seen any signs of a concussion, but she was afraid that the boy was so severely deprived from food and water that he could get dizzy and slow because of it. Also, I shouldn’t hesitate to ask for her advice or help, should I encounter any problems, she’d said. And I told her that I was sincerely hoping that that wouldn’t be the case.</p><p>When Minerva had taken out another chair to sit beside me, Madam Pomfrey went back to her office and told us to call her when the boy woke up. Which was what happened at exactly 3:17 pm.</p><p>When the boy woke up, he rubbed his eyes before opening them. When he did open his eyes, his mouth opened in shock, and I saw him touch around his pillow to, probably, look for his glasses.</p><p>I quickly stood up from my chair, walked to his bedside table, picked up his repaired glasses and handed it to them.</p><p>Minerva softly called for Madam Pomfrey, who responded that she would be right with us.</p><p>“Thank you,” the boy croaked and he put them on immediately.</p><p>He then blinked, apparently wondering how his glasses were repaired, and looked at me, through his glasses and then he looked to Minerva. After he looked back to me, he looked around the hospital wing and I could see his memories returning to him. I wondered the boy would be filled with questions, but instead, he shut his opened mouth and said nothing. He just looked around and didn’t move or speak.</p><p>“Harry, I’d like you to meet Mrs. Weasley. She is kind enough to take care of you for the next month until you come back here at Hogwarts,” Minerva said kindly from behind me.</p><p>“Hello Harry, I’m Molly Weasley.”</p><p>He looked at me, in confusion I guessed, and I extended my hand to the boy. He doubtfully took my hand to shake it shortly.</p><p>He cleared his throat and softly said, “Hello Mrs. Weasley. My name is Harry Potter.”</p><p>Before I could say another word, the grey matron appeared next to the bed as well and placed her hand on his forehead.</p><p>Harry seemed to be startled by the gesture but it seemed he didn’t dare to move away.</p><p> </p><p>“And how are you feeling, Mr. Potter? How is the pain?” Madam Pomfrey asked in her matter-of-fact tone.</p><p>“Very well, Madam. Thank you very much for your good care. I hope you’ll allow me to do something in return for it?” Harry said hopeful.</p><p>“Nonsense, Mr Potter. You are in no debt to me except for one thing.”</p><p>“Anything, Madam.”</p><p>“This,” Madam Pomfrey pointed at me before continuing, “is your new guardian. And I want you to tell her whenever you don’t feel well or need something. Do you understand that, Mr Potter?”</p><p>“Yes, Madam.”</p><p>“Do you promise me to tell her whenever that is the case?” the matron asked stern, looking straight at Harry with her blue piercing eyes.</p><p>Harry gulped, but nodded directly after that.</p><p>“Yes, Madam.”</p><p>“Very well. Do you have any questions for me before you leave to your new home?” the matron asked.</p><p>“No, Madam.”</p><p>“Very well. Then you may get dressed behind the dressing shield, and come out when you are done.”</p><p> </p><p>Madam Pomfrey took out her wand and drew a dressing shield around Harry’s bed. I sent him a friendly smile before exiting the small confinement of the dressing shield. As did Minerva.</p><p>“Mrs. Weasley. I have a bag here with pain relieving potions, Healing Salve and Draught of Dreamless Sleep. As soon as there are problems, you can floo call to the Hospital Wing immediately and I will answer. Treat the bruises once every day with Healing Salve, and if he is in much pain, you can give him a pain relieving potion, only twice a day! You are allowed to give him the Draught of Dreamless Sleep if you deem that necessary. Any other questions?” the matron asked me.</p><p>“None, thank you very much for your good care,” I said grateful, shaking her hand.</p><p>“Very well.”</p><p> </p><p>Then, Harry came from behind the dressing shield, wearing his too large, clean clothes. He had a pair of neat folded clothing in his hand, and looked rather awkward. I could now see the bruises in his neck as well on both his arms, and tried not to give notice of my anger towards the child molesters.</p><p>“Mr Potter, I bid you farewell and I will see you on the first of September.”</p><p>The matron extended her hand which Harry shook just as short as he shook mine. She also took his neatly folded clothing and nodded before leaving to her office.</p><p>“Shall I escort you to the fireplace?” Minerva suggested to me.</p><p>I nodded and swallowed away my nervousness.</p><p>I extended my hand for Harry to hold and when I saw him flinch away, I wanted to get so angry at the ones who hurt him, but instead I said quietly, “Harry?”</p><p>He blinked before nodding quickly.</p><p>“I would like you to take my hand, so I can make sure I do not lose you on the way home, is that alright with you?” I asked calmly.</p><p>Harry didn’t say anything but he nodded and took my hand silently.</p><p>“Good,” I said.</p><p>“This way,” Minerva said while pointing the direction.</p><p> </p><p>When we arrived at the Headmaster’s office, the Headmaster himself wasn’t present. So the only one left to say goodbye to, was Minerva.</p><p>“Harry?” Minerva said.</p><p>“Yes, Madam?” Harry replied.</p><p>Minerva’s lips curled up in amusement but said nothing about the title she was addressed with.</p><p>“Professor Snape told me to say goodbye for him. He had other business to attend to. Though, he does wish you a nice stay with the Weasley family,” Minerva smiled warmly at the both of us and I shook her hand in thanks.</p><p>“Harry, I will see you on the first of September. Will you be nice to Mrs. Weasley until then?” Minerva asked Harry.</p><p>“Yes, Madam.”</p><p>“Have a nice summer then,” Minerva said to Harry, who only nodded in response.</p><p>“You too, Minerva,” I said.</p><p>I let go of Harry’s hand, so he could shake Minerva’s extended one. Which he did shortly. I stepped forwards to the fireplace and took a hand of floo powder. I extended my hand to Harry again, to which he flinched automatically, but this time he did take my extended hand almost instantly and stepped in front of me, with his back turned to me. I placed my free hand onto his shoulder and let go of the floo powder.</p><p>“The Burrow.”</p>
