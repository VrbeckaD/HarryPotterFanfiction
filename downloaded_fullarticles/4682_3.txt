          <div class="userstuff"><p align="left">Draco’s mouth falls open in a moan as Harry’s body covers his. Within seconds, Harry’s hand is clamped over Draco’s mouth, his breath warm and his voice low when he warns Draco to <em>keep quiet. </em></p><p>He doesn’t want to be heard. Dinner with the Malfoys had hardly gone according to plan, and Harry doubts getting caught like <em>this</em> is going to help.</p><p>Draco’s moans are even louder when Harry’s hand falls away, and with a frustrated groan, Harry pulls the tie from his dress-robe and shoves the fabric between Draco’s teeth, muffling the noise.</p><p>It’s not perfect, but it’ll do. </p></div>
