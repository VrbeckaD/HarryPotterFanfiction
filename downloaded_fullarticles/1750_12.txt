    <p>Everyone in the wizarding world couldn't wait to go to their wizarding school, so when Sam and Dean got their Ilvermorny and Hogwarts letters, they were very confused. You see, these two are American, so they should have only gotten a letter from Ilvermorny. So, when they got a Hogwarts letter, they were shocked. Right now, the two boys who just turned eleven have to decide which school to go to. The one in their country or the one with some of the strongest wizards. These two boys wanted to know why Hogwarts would want them, because that school rarely ever took someone that wasn’t from the UK. The twins looked at each other and walked over to their father.</p><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="quoted-text">
  <p>"Umm, Dad, we got our letters. We got one from Ilvermorny and one from Hogwarts," Sam said.</p>
  <p>"You got two letters," said John, "Well you should know that I don't care, so choose one and leave me alone, brats."</p>
  <p>The boys nodded and ran off to their room.</p>
  <p>"Dean?" Sam asked worriedly, "Why does Hogwarts want us?"</p>
  <p>"I don't know Sammy," Dean tried to smile, "Maybe it says in the letters."</p>
  <p>The two boys looked down at the letters. One was an off-white with their last names on it and the Ilvermorny seal. The boys walked over to Dean's bed and started to open the Ilvermorny letter.</p>
  <p align="center">
    <em>Dear Winchesters,</em>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <em>We are sorry to inform you that you are not expected into Ilvermorny.</em>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <em>-Headmaster Linemore</em>
  </p>
  <p>"So we didn't get into Ilvermorny. How about the Hogwarts one then?" Sam asked.</p>
  <p>When Dean finished reading the letter, he ripped open the Hogwarts one and read it.</p>
  <p align="center">
    <em>Dear Samuel and Dean Winchester,</em>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <em>We at Hogwarts gladly accept you to the school of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. We will be accommodating for your abilities. Dean will have a spare room if everything gets to be too much. The nurse, Madam Pomfrey, has also been told of Samuel's condition.</em>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <em>Sincerely,</em>
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    <em>Headmaster Albus Dumbledore</em>
  </p>
  <p>"How would he know about you being a seer and me being a legilimen?" asked Sam.</p>
</div><p>"I have no idea," Dean said, "but I bet it's pretty rare to have a legilimen and seer as twins.”</p><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="quoted-text">
  <p>"Yeah, I guess," Sam said and started to think about everything.</p>
  <p>"Sam, I don't know how we're supposed to get there, nor do I know whether or not people will be kind," Dean grumped.</p>
  <p>"Dean stop that!" yelled Sam.</p>
  <p>"Then stop thinking so loud!" exclaimed Dean.</p>
  <p>"Dean, I'll leave you here if you don't stop!" replied Sam.</p>
  <p>Right then, another owl screeched out letting the boys know that there was another letter.</p>
</div><p>"You idiot, get the letter," Dean said before his brother got any of the words. Sam ran out of the room. He then came running back into the room with another letter.</p><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="quoted-text">
  <p>"It's from Hogwarts." Sam couched out trying to breath.</p>
</div><p>"Sam give it to me, and take a breath." Dean said taking the letter from Sam. <em>How can he be out of breath he ran like 20 feet or less?!</em><strong> </strong>Dean thought.</p><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="quoted-text">
  <p>Sam just nods as his brother rips open the second letter from Hogwarts.</p>
  <p align="center">
    <em>Dear Samuel and Dean Winchester,</em>
  </p>
</div><p align="center"><em>You'll be being picked up by our new groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid. On the</em> <span class="m_7712019815977540658gmail-apple-converted-space"> <em> </em> </span> <span class="m_7712019815977540658gmail-aqj"> <em>30th of July,</em> </span> <span class="m_7712019815977540658gmail-apple-converted-space"> <em> </em> </span> <em>he will you'll help you to get everything you need.

<p></p><div class="quoted-text">
  <p align="center">
    <em>-Headmaster Dumbledore</em>
  </p>
  <p> "Okay so that's in a week." Dean said when he finished the letter.</p>
</div><p> In the next week, the two boys got ready for their departure from the U.S which was easy since they had lived on duffel bags their whole lives. On the morning of the 30th the two boys were sitting in their room talking.</p><p> "Dean, why do they want us there a month early and when is this Hagrid person supposed to be here?" Sam asked as he paced around the length of the room.</p><p>"I don't know Sam just sit down and wait," Dean gritted out. On the list of his brother's worst qualities, this was one of them. Around lunchtime Dean went across the street to get food. He got himself a bacon burger and Sam a healthy salad.</p><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="quoted-text">
  <p> "Sam food is here." Dean yelled. A few seconds later a slightly taller boy with long hair came in with a wild hazel eyes.</p>
</div><p>"Dean you are amazing." Sam said with a goofy smile. Dean smirked his bright green eyes lighting up with joy, "Just sit down and eat." Dean smiled. They sat in silence.</p><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="quoted-text">
  <p> A few minutes into eating their lunch the silence was broken by Sam saying "Dean" half-heartedly before falling on the floor Dean drops his burger and rushes over to him.</p>
</div><p> "It's okay Sammy," The short blond haired boy said, "I'll be here when you're done." Dean said.</p><p>Dean getting started to focus on his twin. He waited for his brother to wake up focusing all his energy on Sam's mind. When Sam had a vision, Dean couldn't get into his mind.</p><p>Dean's mind started to wander to the other people around them, most of his neighbors are at work for they were a few kids. Who Dean thinks is the Kid Next Door is thinking about how fun it would be to have a water balloon fight right now and the old lady somewhere is wondering when her next visit from her grandkids is going to be. But there is one person Dean doesn't know and the man sounds kind of funny, so Dean listens closer.</p><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="quoted-text">
  <p>"The Winchester twins wonder why I had to pick them up? What are they like? I hope don't scare them. This is the right room yep 66 Crossroad Inn. Okay here goes nothing Hagrid." The man thought in his head.</p>
  <p>Dean thought it was so funny and then there was a knock at the door.</p>
</div><p><em>This is Hagrid</em>, the blond thought while he walked to the door his focus still on Sam. Dean really hoped that Sam would wake up soon he didn't want to have to wait here for another hour or two. Once Dean opened the door, he saw an extraordinarily large man, at least eleven feet tall, with short curly hair and a beard big fluffy furry coat. The man was about to open his mouth but instead Dean started talking.</p><p> "I think I have an idea on why you're picking us up, we're like two weird kids. You don't scare me, and my twin’s name is Sam and I'm Dean." Dean finished by stretching out his small hand compared to the to the large man's.</p><p>Hagrid looks shocked just nodded and realized not even realizing Dean's hand was out to shake. Dean took his hand back and moved so Hagrid could come inside. Then he walked back to Sam to see that his eyes started opening. He could hear Sam's voice a little bit, but it was not that much. Dean knew from previous experiences that when he could hear Sam’s voice, he was starting to wake up but he was still deep in his vision.</p><p>"I'm going to go grab mine and Sam's bag and you can make yourself comfortable I guess. It might be a while, but not too long don't worry." Dean said out loud for both Sam and Hagrid. Dean raced off to his and Sam's room which is conjoined to the other room. In the middle of grabbing their bags Dean could hear a large amount of Sam's voice. And Sam starts conversing with Dean.</p><p>"Dean there's this girl we have to become friends with her name is Lily Evans. She's going to become a Gryffindor, but we're not going in that house. It's going to be a bit more difficult. She has bright red hair that should make a little bit easier and she's our grade." Sam rushed out excitedly. Dean hurried back into the other room to respond to his brother.</p><p>"Okay we'll find out when we get there." Sam nodded knowing that he wouldn't be able to talk to the next three days. Due to the visions because he's a seer he ends up not being able to talk after he has one. Sam went over to the sink to get Dean and himself some water and some painkillers he knew both of them would be getting headaches.</p><p>"Thanks for the drugs, you're right my head will be killing me later so will yours" Dean responded to his twin.</p><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="quoted-text">
  <p> "You're welcome by the way. Who is the tall large man?" Sam questioned.</p>
</div><p>"Sam that's Hagrid, Hagrid this is Sam okay. Hagrid, Sam will be unable to talk for the next three days. I'm just going to speak for him. Please don't be too weird about this when I say this okay, so I can read your mind dude and you're like racing all over and you're going to give me a headache if you don't shut up. So, you see my brother over there he is a seer and I’m a legilimen." Dean said.</p><p>"Really! He's a Seer and you’re a legilimen?!” Hagrif said wide-eyed and excitedly.</p><p> "Yes we are and could you please stop being so excited, you’re thinking too loudly from paying attention to me." Dean said exhausted, “Sam and I figured out at a young age that when people were thinking rather hard and when people were excited their minds project the sound a lot louder in his head.”</p><p>"Dean can you please leave I really, <em>really</em> don't want to be here when Dad gets back drunk." Sam said to dean.</p><p> Dean shook his head and then looked at Hagrid. "Hagrid, sir, could we please leave soon." Dean asked with a little concern showing in his voice.</p><p> Hagrid, still wide-eyed, nodded yes. The twins picked up their duffle bags and walked outside after Hagrid.</p><p>“How are you getting to London do you ask and where are we staying because we are arriving a month early. Why are we arriving a month early?” Dean asked in a serious voice.</p><p> "Well we are taking a port key. The port key is that rubber ducky by the tree." Hagrid said pointing to a large oak tree across the street from the end.</p><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="quoted-text">
  <p> The two twins looked at each other neither have been traveled by port key before. They followed Hagrid over to the rubber ducky.</p>
  <p>"So we all have to touch the ports key at the same time and we will be transported to the Leaky cauldron." Haggard said.</p>
  <p> Dean and Sam decided not to question it and just been a long and get at a good set at one point they were touching a rubber ducky the next thing they saw was a bar.</p>
</div><p>The Leaky cauldron is Hagrid what called it. It was dark and there were a few tables to the right, and there was a staircase to the left. The two boys looked around the only people in there were them and a middle-aged looking man with short curly hair. The man was taller than Sam who was five feet and two inches, but shorter than Hagrid. The man wore a green t-shirt and a white apron. In the lighting, it made his blue eyes look black. Both ways looked intern to Hagrid who looked extremely tired.</p><p> "This is the Leaky cauldron more you'll be staying for the next month.<span class="m_7712019815977540658gmail-apple-converted-space"> </span><span class="m_7712019815977540658gmail-aqj">Tomorrow</span><span class="m_7712019815977540658gmail-apple-converted-space"> </span>I will wake you up and be will go and get school supplies and then I will leave the next day you. The Leaky cauldron is where you'll be getting your food from for the next month on September first a woman named Alice will come to get you to bring you to platform nine and three quarters so you can catch the train to Hogwarts. Now I'm going to here's your room key and I am going to go to sleep." Hagrid said with a yawn.</p><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="quoted-text">
  <p>"Dean I'm hungry and I could use a glass of water." Sam said to Dean.</p>
</div><p> "Hagrid how’re we supposed to pay for our school supplies and our food and our stay here." Dean asked worriedly. The Winchesters did not have that much money and what they did have their dad spent on alcohol and hotel rooms as they moved from state to state and town to town.</p><p>"Well you see, Dumbledore's paying for it and the ministry." Hagrid said as if it was a known fact.</p><p> "But why are the ministry and the Headmaster of Hogwarts be paying for our school supplies and all that." Dean and Sam said at the same time but in different ways of communication.</p><p> "I didn't know until you told me Sam was a Seer and you are a legilimen. Those are the people that the ministry in Hogwarts likes to protect. And Dumbledore likes to help those who no one else will." Hagrid replied quietly so no would hear what the boys are.</p><p> Dean heard the bartender wondering why two Americans were with Hagrid. Apparently, this man new Hagrid very well. As Hagrid waved to him goodbye, Dean walked over to the bar and asked the mann. "Can I get two glasses of water and what kind of food do you have?”</p><p>" Yes I can get you water and we only have peanut butter jellies sandwiches if that's alright." The man said politely.</p><p> Both Dean and Sam nodded at the sandwiches. The man handed the twins their water and ran off to make some sandwiches. He could still hear the man thinking, <em>Americans! The Ministry wants them, so does Hogwarts they must be important but they don't seem to have money so I wonder what's going on. </em>The man keep going on and on this circle. Apparently, the man had not heard that Sam was a Seer and he was a legilimen which Dean would not lie and saying that he was happy to hear that. When the man came back Dean asked what his name was.</p><p> "My name is Mike Kelton. What is yours names and what year are you guys going into?" Mike asked intrigued by the Americans.</p><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="quoted-text">
  <p>"My name is Dean and this is my brother Sammy. We're going to be first years this year." Dean said. The look on makes face made him look confused. He forgets people that people think Sam is old then him, because how much taller he is.  "We are twins you see."</p>
</div><p> Mike just nodded. Dean and Sam finished up their water and sandwiches and then ran up to the room with their duffle and fell right to sleep.</p><p> The next day they had heard a knock on their door.</p><p> "Dean you have to get the door I can't talk for another two days remember. You idiot. " Sam shot at Dean after Dean told him to get the door and though a pillow at him. Dean mumbled something got up from his bed and open the door. Behind the door was Hagrid.</p><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="quoted-text">
  <p> "Thought you boys would like to get some breakfast and then we're going to head off and get your school supplies." Hagrid said before walking off.</p>
</div><p>Dean woke up Sam and got ready for their day they went down to breakfast which was simple, eggs and toast. Then they went down to Diagon Alley they found out as they were walking through they got their parchment, quills, books, robes, more books, and they got their wands. Dean's wand is dogwood with unicorn hair core 10 and three quarter inches slightly springy flexibility. Sam's was a phoenix feather core 12 and a half inches and slightly springy flexibility. They also had to get trunks because not everything would fit in their duffle bags anymore.</p><p> The next month went by quickly before they knew it the Twins were standing by the door of the Leaky cauldron waiting for Alice. Alice showed up right after breakfast. She had dark black hair and wore a tight sweater in blue jeans. She looked around and then caught sight of the two 11 year olds.</p><p> Dean could tell by her thoughts that she was a very excitable person. <em>Great,</em> Dean thought to himself. Alice walked over to the boys.</p><p> "You must be Dean and Sam Winchester." The girl said excitedly. "So we're going to take the underground to get to Kings Cross station so we can get the Platform 9 and 3/4. Doesn't that just sound fun?"</p><p> Dean and Sam just nodded and grab the trunks in followed Alice out of the Leaky cauldron. The underground as Alice called it was pretty fast to King's cross station in about 30 minutes they were there. The two boys grabbed a trolley and followed Alice. Then she started speaking.</p><p> "We're going to meet my sister Ella here because she’s a muggle born." Alice said stopping a platform 3. Dean looked at her confused.</p><p> </p>
<p></p><div class="quoted-text">
  <p>" What's a muggle?" Sam asked before Dean could. Now it was Alice's turn to look confused.</p>
  <p> "You know normal people non-magic their Muggles." Alice said matter-of-factly.</p>
  <p> "Oh so you mean no majs." Dean and Sam said in unison.</p>
</div><p> They stood and waited for a couple more minutes and then Alice ran up to another black haired girl roughly the same height that was being followed buy a red haired girl. Dean looked over to his brother whose eyes were wide and mouth gaped open Dean decide to see what he was staring at. He noticed it was the girl right then he knew the red headed girl was Lily Evans. This was his new best friend before she even knew it.</p>
