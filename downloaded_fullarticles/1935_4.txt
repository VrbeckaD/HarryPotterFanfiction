  <em>
    <span>Shots! Shots! Shots! Shots! </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That’s what they kept chanting over and over again, whether it be his head or the crowd. Regardless, that’s what he was doing. Shot after shot. He didn’t even know what he was drinking at this point; all he knew was that is was a liquid knife, making its way down his throat and into his bloodstream. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>From there it carved its way through his body, laying claim to the pathetic space that was Draco Malfoy. It warmed his bones with the heat only alcohol can possess. He looked down, hoping to see the glow of skin, to see the fire he could feel burning through him. He wanted to see his body alight from the inside out. He wanted to see the things he shouldn’t, the private things. The things everyone seemed to know about him but him. How his body moved, the way his mind ticked, the way his heart stopped when Potter died and never really started again properly after he was revived. </span>

  <em>
    <span>Shots! Shots! Shots! Shots! </span>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The red hot knives worked their way into his head, shattering against his skull, splintering apart into fragments of glass working away at the bone there. His head ached, it throbbed with a fury that he had hoped would banish his thought. Instead it only made them more prevalent. The pain and the shame sent him spinning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The bar was spinning. The ceiling was on the ground, there where people in the sky. They were spinning or maybe it was just him. Their drinks spilled in all their psychedelic glory, painting the clubbers in a Picasso of beauty. Gravity seemed to have ceased to exist, yet it still poured outside. The rain fell in a steady pattern, downdowndowndown. Lightning illuminated figures walking past, the streetlights filling in the blanks between flashes. </span>

    <span>Shots! Shots! Shots! Shots! </span>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco reached for another drink. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lighting cracked again, so loud Draco flinched even in his intoxicated state. He fell to the floor with a crash, or perhaps that was the door flying open, the drinks crashing to the floor, the bodies coming down with them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Figures in hooded cloaks surrounded him, wands alight and waving about in the complication Draco had just caused for them. One of them crouched in front of him, knees cracking as they came closer to the ground. Tanned, rough hands pulled back a rain soaked hood. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The impossibly messy, jet black hair beneath the hood had fared no better in the rain. It hung in front of a tan face with rain flecked glasses and the greenest eyes known to man and…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Potter? </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His smirk was the last thing Draco saw before something hooked him right behind his eyes, pulling him through time and space, stopping on hard floors and velvety rugs and couches level with his eyes before his head hit the ground, eyes shut and mind gone before it even touched. </span>
