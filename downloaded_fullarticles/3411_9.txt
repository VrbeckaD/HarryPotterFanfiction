          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry sank down into the hot bubbling water, sighing as he felt his muscles start to relax. It had been a long and strenuous school year. He enjoyed it most days, but sometimes being the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor had its setbacks; like the fact that he sometimes had to interact with the potions professor — Draco Malfoy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The rivalry had passed between the two men and Harry considered Draco to be a good friend. Remembering the way they were with each other at school made him shake his head. No, nowadays the only problem he had with Draco was wanting to push him up against the wall and kiss him senseless whenever he was in the same room as him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>That’s why this year for his birthday he’d planned a little getaway for himself. He’d found this spa through a muggle travel agent pamphlet from the muggle studies professor — one of the best spas in Ireland. Dromoland Castle was beautiful, relatively secluded, and had most everything he could ever hope to wish for<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to spend his birthday weekend away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Harry was more secluded that normal due to some muggle-repelling charms as well as renting one of the solitary bungalows. He was quite enjoying this little splurge of funds as it left him able to relax in his own private hot tub, nude. In fact, he thought about going nude the entire weekend.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>He was just solidifying the rest of his weekend plans - going with the nude theme - when there was a knock at the door. Dammit! Not even a full day goes by and someone from the wizarding community’s already found him. Well, whoever’s there is going to get the shock of their lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Come in!” he yelled, as he rose up from the water. High enough that anyone could see he was naked without showing them his bits. Smirking, arms crossed over his powerful chest, he waited.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Harry was grateful the hot water had already made his body flushed when he heard that voice from beyond the doorway.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I’m sorry to bother you. Just wondering who else was here when I detective the muggle-repelling char—“ Draco immediately cut himself off as he got a good look the the man in the water.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Harry felt they seemed to stare an eternity at each other when something rather interesting began to happen. He noticed Draco’s gaze linger over his naked body, and a becoming blush seemed to spread up his neck to stain his high cheekbones. It put Harry in mind of fresh strawberries and made him slightly bolder than was probably wise for a Gryffindor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Want to go in Draco?”</p>
<p>“What?” he gasped.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Inside, with me?”</p>
<p>Harry couldn’t help smiling at the double entendres he’d used as well as the hard swallow he saw Draco take. Draco’s next words wiped that smile off though.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Yes,” he murmured, “I think I will.”</p>
<p>It was Harry’s turn to swallow thickly as he watched Draco begin to undress himself. He watched his deft fingers quickly unbutton his shirt before dropping it to the floor. Harry’s breath caught in his throat as he watched a bare chested Draco step out of his unbuttoned trousers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Sweet Merlin, he wasn’t wearing any underpants.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It was Draco’s turn to smirk when an involuntary whimper escaped Harry as he stared transfixed at the erect cock in front of him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Stop,” Harry said, as Draco took a step towards him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>A look of vulnerable uncertainty crossed his features which made Harry’s heart ache.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I-I’m not sure you get my m-meaning,” he stammered. Completely flustered that what he had wanted most might actually be a possibility.</p>
<p>He gave a small smile as he continued to enter the hot tub and came to stand in front of Harry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I think this is something we both want,” he murmured. A question in his eyes as he reached a hand to cup his lightly stubbled cheek.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he sighed, before leaning in to kiss Draco’s pert mouth. Wrapping his arms around his waist and pulling him flush against his already overheated body.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>He could feel Draco’s other hand caress his lower back before reaching down to cup his arse and bring their groins even closer together.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It felt like an eternity and yet not long enough before a noise in the background broke through their haze of desire.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“...sure he came this way. See the door is—Oh!” She came to a sudden stop as she stared wide-eyed at the two men embracing in the hot tub.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Harry tried to retreat from Draco’s body, but he wouldn’t allow it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“What are you doing here Astoria? Shouldn’t you be walking through the gardens or something?” Draco said in a deceptively soft voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Harry stared, stunned, that Draco could be so calm in the face of his ex. He tried again to extract himself from Draco, but his only response was to reach a hand down his front and grab Harry’s cock in his luscious fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Harry made a strange choking groaning sound as Draco looked at him “You’re not going anywhere Potter,” he said silkily. “You and I have some unfinished business,” he murmured with a squeeze to Harry’s cock.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Smirking he turned back to Astoria. “Why are you here again?”</p>
<p>“I had wanted to get your opinion on the flowers for the garden ceremony.”</p>
<p>“Ah, what ceremony?” Harry asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The wedding of course.”</p>
<p>“Wedding!?”</p>
<p>“Yes, didn’t you know? Draco is helping me plan the wedding.”</p>
<p>He turned accusing eyes towards Draco, but before he could get a word out he leaned forward and placed a feather soft kiss to his lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“What this termagant neglected to inform you was that it’s <em>her</em> wedding to Viktor Krum I’m helping with; not her and me.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Sorry to tease you Harry,” she said laughing. “I just couldn’t resist when I saw the two of you together.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Ok,” he said a little weakly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Yes, well. I can see you’re busy,” she said smirking. “I’ll just lock the door on my way out.”</p>
<p>And she proceeded to do just that. There was a breath of silence before Draco spoke.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Her and I never really dated you know,” he said quietly. “It was for show for our parents. She’s only ever been a good friend.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I supposed even if it were real, it would have been difficult to hide the fact that you like cocks.”</p>
<p>Draco let out a surprised laughed, “I like <em>your</em> cock Harry.”</p>
<p>Hmmm, was all the reply Draco received before he was back in Harry’s arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Harry wrapped one arm around Draco’s back while his other hand removed Draco’s from his cock, nipping at Draco’s lips as he gave a little pout. Harry lifted up his and Draco’s cocks so they stood vertical against their stomachs before pulling him closer so he could feel his cock rub against Draco’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The friction was exquisite. The sensations entirely new as the water lapped at them in the tiny waves their grinding caused. Draco’s lips were pillow soft and firm, their thrusting tongues mimicking what they’d like to be doing to the other with their cocks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Harry felt hands squeeze his arse and knew he couldn’t last much longer. He gently parted Draco’s ass cheeks and stuck the tip of his finger inside his hole, making small thrusting movements. Draco moaned as he jerked against him and spasmed around his finger. The feel of Draco cumming against him was enough to send him over the edge and Harry came as well, groaning against Draco’s lips as he rode the crest of his orgasm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>They rested their heads on each other’s shoulders,panting, trying to catch their breaths. Harry shivered from cold and wondered when the water had gotten cold. Leaning back to look he was surprised to see the room filled with steam and the water level come only to mid-calf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I guess the two of us together are just too hot to handle,” he quipped.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Draco turned confused eyes at Harry then burst into laughter as he noticed the state of the room and hot tub.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Hmm. I guess we have the rest of the weekend to see just how hot this house can handle.”</p>
<p>“I like the sound of that,” he said softly, staring into the most beautiful eyes the color of molten silver.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Me too. Happy 25th birthday Harry.”</p>
<p>As they continued to hold and caress one another, all Harry could wish— hope for was to spend he next 25 years with this man.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p></div>
