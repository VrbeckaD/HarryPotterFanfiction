    <p>This year, 1995, would be Harry Potter’s fifth year of school. It was summer, and it was also the first year Hogwarts would accept transfer students from other magic schools. This year, they were inviting two schools, and the lucky fifth years would hopefully be learning at the other two schools for their sixth and seventh years.<br/>
It was a good thing that Harry Potter managed to defeat Voldemort after he figured out the Triwizard Tournament Cup was actually a Portkey. According to Harry, after Voldemort killed Harry, he had somehow come back alive, and his desire to protect his friends and anger at Voldemort for killing his parents allowed him to use the Killing Curse.<br/>
Apparently, Harry himself had been a Horcrux, and when he had supposedly killed Harry, Voldemort had in fact been removing his own Horcrux from Harry.<br/>
The summer of 1995 was spent celebrating the defeat of the greatest Dark Wizard of all time, but there were many rumors about secret dark organizations that were still around. It didn’t matter, yet; after such a large war, there weren’t many that opposed the government.<br/>
Perhaps this was also why Hogwarts decided to begin accepting transfers.</p>
