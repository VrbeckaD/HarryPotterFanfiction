      <em>Your little brother never tells you but he loves you so</em><br/>
<em>You said your mother only smiled on her tv show</em><br/>
<em>You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope</em><br/>
<em>I hope you make it to the day you're twenty-eight years old</em>
    </p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>Remus had always known that Sirius had a difficult childhood. They grew up together at school, and he saw the signs in his friend from a young age. He craved attention of any kind and would do anything to get it, but shied away from most affection as if it were unfamiliar. Eventually, he opened up on the details - a cold, uncaring mother and a father prone to violent outbursts. Remus agreed with Sirius that his parents were fairly terrible. They disagreed, many times, on his brother Regulus.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>Remus could see the admiration in Regulus' eyes when he looked at Sirius. He could see the love that the younger brother had never learned how to express. Sirius only saw the inaction in the face of their parents' misdeeds, and the fact that Regulus was the favored son. He didn't see that the favor of their parents, the expectations and conditional love, wore down Regulus just as thoroughly as the harsh words that Sirius faced.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>Remus and Sirius started dating when they were seventeen. Remus had been pining for Sirius for years at that point, and hoped that his attentions could heal Sirius in some way. Make him more focused on school, and on having somewhere to go when he left home, by giving him something good to hold onto. Looking back, Remus realizes that he wanted to fix Sirius with his love, and knows that it was never possible. Sirius just barely graduated high school, his limited success due in large part to the homework he copied from James. In one of his more foolish decisions, Remus put off college for a year to help Sirius prepare to retake his entrance exams. It was during that year that he realized Sirius was using.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>Remus, Sirius, and James had experimented a couple of times in school, but never with anything big. Pot and beer, mostly. There was that one time James got some acid, and they had all said they didn't want to do anything like that again. Remus was ashamed to say he didn't notice his friend's drug problem until Sirius stole his watch - and he definitely knew that it was the only thing Remus had from his grandfather and how important it was to him - in order to get money for drugs. Heroin. It was when he confronted him about the watch that he noticed his friend's weight loss, his intensified mood swings, the way he had pulled away from James and tried to pull away from Remus - all things he had previously attributed to stress, or the emotional upheaval of finally leaving his parents' house. When Sirius tried to brush off Remus' concerns, Remus left. If Sirius wanted to kill himself slowly, Remus didn't want to watch.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>
      <em>You're dripping like a saturated sunrise</em><br/>
<em>You're spilling like an overflowing sink</em><br/>
<em>You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece</em><br/>
<em>And now i'm tearing through the pages and the ink</em>
    </p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>The thing about Sirius was that he was just so much. He was beautiful and intense, blinding but you couldn't look away. Their separation lasted two weeks. Remus had tried to leave Sirius, hoping that he would see what the drugs were costing him, but he couldn't keep his distance. Looking back Remus isn't sure if Sirius would have changed had he truly left, but he is sure the whole affair would have hurt less. Their relationship continued on and off, Remus trying several different approaches to Sirius and his drug problem. Ultimatums, begging Sirius to get help, ignoring the issue, appealing to James and to Regulus, involving the police. The only thing it did was make Remus tired.</p></div><div><p> </p></div></div><div class="G1VCxe kno-fb-ctx">

      <em>You were a vision in the morning when the light came through</em><br/>
<em>I know I've only felt religion when I've lied with you</em><br/>
<em>You said you'll never be forgiven till your boys are too</em><br/>
<em>And I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you</em>
    </p></div><div class="iw7h9e"><p> </p></div><div class="iw7h9e"><p>Remus did go to college the following year, about an hour from their hometown. Tutoring sessions had long since been exchanged for conflicts, and at this point Remus didn't care if Sirius passed his entrance exams as long as he stayed alive. Whenever they texted Sirius would refuse to answer Remus' questions about his life, so Remus eventually stopped asking and their conversations became a one-sided account of Remus' adventures studying history. Remus visited his hometown most weekends. He cooked for Sirius and tried to force him to eat, and refused to leave his side in the hopes that for a couple of days he wouldn't get high. When Sirius came out of the bathroom with his pupils constricted to pinpricks, Remus swallowed his comments, swallowed his disappointment, and subtly monitored his boyfriend for signs of overdose.</p></div><div class="iw7h9e"><p> </p></div><div class="iw7h9e"><p>They finally broke up for good during Remus' winter break. It was Sirius who ended it. No surprise, since Remus had shown himself incapable of staying away. When Sirius blew up at him that last time, Remus found himself nursing bruises on his wrists and ribs for days afterwards. </p></div><div class="iw7h9e"><p> </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p>

<em>And now I'm tearing through the pages and the ink</em>
    </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p> </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p>It was in the wake of that explosion that Remus realized how destructive something beautiful could be. Like waters that eroded the earth until cliffs and canyons formed, or staring into the sun until your retinas burned. He realized this wasn't the first time Sirius had hurt him, even if it was the first time they had come to blows. He spent the rest of his break reconnecting with his family, and with James. When he went back to school he told himself he would focus on his studies and forming new relationships, only being careful to avoid anyone who was too intense - too like Sirius.</p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p> </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p>
      <em>Everything is blue</em><br/>
<em>His pills, his hands, his jeans</em><br/>
<em>And now I'm covered in the colors</em>
    </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p>
      <em>Pulled apart at the seams</em><br/>
<em>And it's blue</em><br/>
<em>And it's blue</em>
    </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p>
      <em>Everything is grey</em><br/>
<em>His hair, his smoke, his dreams</em><br/>
<em>And now he's so devoid of color</em><br/>
<em>He don't know what it means</em><br/>
<em>And he's blue</em><br/>
<em>And he's blue</em>
    </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p> </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p>At first, Remus saw Sirius everywhere. He avoided parties, not wanting to risk coming into contact with the substances that were destroying his friend and ex-lover. He avoided the loud, exuberant types that he had gravitated towards in high school - luckily quiet thinkers like him were in no short supply in the history department. He avoided making connections deeper than acquaintances. Within months, he realized he was closing himself off entirely and becoming depressed. He wondered if Sirius had felt this way when they were in school. He had certainly seemed depressed from the outside. Remus did what Sirius never had, though, and sought out help from a counselor.</p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p> </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p>
      <em>You were red, and you liked me because I was blue</em><br/>
<em>But you touched me, and suddenly I was a lilac sky</em><br/>
<em>Then you decided purple just wasn't for you</em>
    </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p> </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p>"He told me I'd changed," Remus scoffed, "in the end. As if I was the one changing."</p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p>"Perhaps you did."</p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p> </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p>Remus considered his counselor's words. It was true, he decided, that he was a different person than he had been when they graduated high school. But those changes came from being worn and beaten down and from refusing to put his own needs first.</p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p> </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p>"If I changed, he was the one who changed me."</p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p> </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p>
      <em>Everything is blue</em><br/>
<em>His pills, his hands, his jeans</em><br/>
<em>And now I'm covered in the colors pull apart at the seams</em><br/>
<em>And it's blue</em><br/>
<em>And it's blue</em>
    </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p>
      <em>Everything is grey</em><br/>
<em>His hair, his smoke, his dreams</em><br/>
<em>And now he's so devoid of color</em><br/>
<em>He don't know what it means</em><br/>
<em>And he's blue</em><br/>
<em>And he's blue</em>
    </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p> </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p>Slowly, Remus worked his way out of the guilt and self-blame that followed the end of his relationship. He worked his way out of the world he had built where blues and grays melted together into a monochrome world. He didn't reach out to Sirius again, knowing that the friendship they had once had was too damaged to be saved, but he did watch his hometown's news carefully - the police blotter and the obituaries - for signs of his former friend. </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p> </p></div><div class="xpdxpnd"><p>
