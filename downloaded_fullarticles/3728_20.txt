<p>The midday sun was shining down on the first fine day in Little Whinging, Surrey, for over a week. For nine days they had had nothing but rain and fog. To many of the inhabitants at Privet Drive this change in weather did not matter as many had jobs to go to and houses to clean. In number four, however, there were two people who were quite delighted at the change in weather.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dudley Dursley, for reasons known to everyone but his doting parents, was eager to get outside again and go practice his boxing skills on a kid half his size with a bunch of his mates to back him up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The second person was Harry Potter. He, however, was just eager to get out of the house and away from his relatives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Having seen Dudley set off with four of his friends, Harry picked up his bag, and after checking that his Aunt Petunia was busy, crept out the back door and went and sat under the tree in the corner of the yard that was protected by a row of high hedges. The wet ground started to soak his trousers but he ignored it. He had peace at last.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Leaning against the tree trunk he reached into his bag and pulled out his first volume of <em>Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts</em>, that Sirius and Lupin had given him last Christmas. Opening the book he saw again on the first page the inscription they had written.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>          Dear Harry</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>                   Hope this helps with your D.A lessons. Good luck and Merry Christmas.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>                                                Love Sirius and Remus</strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Swallowing a lump in his throat, Harry turned to page ninety-four. Picking up a stick off the ground, for he didn’t want to risk using his wand, he practiced the movements illustrated and annunciating the spell properly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As he practiced he thought he heard a twig snap near him. Jerking his head around he looked to see if anyone was there. Seeing no one he relaxed against the tree again and continued practicing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Professor Snape, whose foot it was that had snapped the twig, watched as Harry practised. He was not in a particularly pleasant mood. As all other Members of the Order had other duties that day, Dumbledore had asked him to guard Harry until Tonks got back from the Ministry. Moody had lent him his invisibility cloak and he was now standing within a clump of bushes, wand in hand and eyes occasionally glancing around the area.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After about two hours Harry, having practising five other counter-jinxes, closed the book and got out his copy of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Halfway through reading the section on Lethifolds (or Living Shrouds) he heard the bush next to him rustle. Lowering his book he gazed intently into it, seeking to find the source of the noise. Seeing something long and black he tensed, and while groping for his wand in his sleeve he heard a hissing voice say, ‘now where do I go? Females. Never trust their directions.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry gave a start of surprise and leaned forward.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Snape, who was still watching, lifted his wand a little higher in case it was needed; the next moment he almost dropped it in shock as Harry started to make low hissing sounds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Glancing to where Harry was leaning Snape saw the long and black object. It was a snake. Suddenly, Snape understood. Potter was speaking parseltongue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Can I help you?’ Harry asked. There was a silence and then the snake slithered out of the bush.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Hello. Yesss, I’m trying to find my way to my sssisters. Says she livesss in a lovely compost heap near a pond in a backyard. A number 5 Privet Drive she sssaid.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry nodded and pointed. ‘It’s just across the street.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Thanksss mate.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The snake was about to slither away when the noise of several people shouting and laughing was heard coming nearer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘You’d better hide until they go past,’ Harry said, and the snake slithered back into the foliage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Snape, who had turned his head to see what the source of the noise was, saw six boys coming down the street, one of them the boy who had left before Harry had come out earlier. Snape had no trouble recognising him as Harry’s cousin as he had seen him in Harry’s memories the previous year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As he listened he heard Dudley say, ‘we’ll go round the back; my mum won’t see us there,’ and the next moment Dudley had come out to where Harry was still sitting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry had quickly pushed his books out of sight and was now leaning nonchalantly against the tree.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dudley stopped when he saw Harry. He had a cigarette in his hand, as did all his friends as they came round the corner. Turning quickly Dudley tried to get his friends to turn around again, but they had already seen Harry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Hey, Big D, isn’t that your cousin?’ A boy whom Harry knew as Piers said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Yeah, how about a bit of fun,’ said another. ‘You punch and we can hold him down.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dudley had a pale, sickly look on his face. Since last year he had left Harry alone and wouldn’t go near him. Before Dudley could say anything his friends started to walk over to Harry. Stopping a few feet away they leered down at him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Hey, Potter, how’d you like to play a game?’ jeered Piers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry looked contemptuously at him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘No thanks, the people I like to play with are people who have a higher IQ than three.’ He looked around at the group. ‘So I guess I’ll be playing with none of you.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dudley made a small noise that sounded like a whimper as his friends started to crack their knuckles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Snape pointed his wand at Piers who was still at the front. Despite his feelings, Dumbledore didn’t want Potter hurt or using magic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before either Snape or Piers could do anything, however, Harry started to make hissing noises. Snape frowned and the group now staring at Harry looked puzzled as well as scared for the noise sounded threatening, and Dudley, who suddenly remembered another occasion when Harry had made these noises, started to tremble.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Stop that,’ shouted Piers, who started to walk forward. ‘Trying to impersonate a snake are y-?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His voice broke off into a yell as the snake shot out of the bushes straight at him. Dudley and the others upon seeing the snake turned and ran yelling to the front of the house and down the footpath with the snake chasing after them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry leant back against the tree trunk and pulled out his books again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Well, that should keep them away for a while,’ he said aloud.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Snape lowered his wand; a muscle was twitching near his mouth. As he watched he saw the snake slithering back to where Harry was seated. He saw Harry grin and hiss something. The snake made a movement that looked as though he was shaking his head. Harry nodded and then hissed again. The snake turned and slithered away. Snape watched it go, the frown once again between his eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Maybe I should have told him to bite them.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Snape turned to look back at Harry who was speaking aloud to himself again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘It would certainly have stopped them from bullying ten year olds for a while.’ Looking back at his book he sighed. ‘Of course he’ll go running to Daddy so it’ll be another night of shouting and threats.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Drawing his knees up Harry rested his head against them and sighed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘I haven’t been able to let Lupin suspect what’s going on. He’d want to come and get me and I can’t take him away from his job for Dumbledore, or any of the others.’ Leaning his head back against the tree he stared up at the bright blue sky. ‘Guess I’ll just have to continue to put up with it.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry briefly closed his eyes and then reopening them he put down his book, reached into his bag and brought out his photo album. Opening it, he turned to the page of a photo that Fred had taken at Grimmauld Place last Christmas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry, standing with his arms around Ron and Hermione, was grinning at the camera. Behind him, his arms outstretched to envelope all three was a beaming Sirius. His black hair was falling over his forehead and his face was bright with laughter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry caught his breath on a sob, and reaching out a finger he traced Sirius’ face gently.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘I miss you,’ he whispered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Snape, who had been watching, suddenly turned away, his face tight. In his mind he was seeing another small boy, sitting in his lonely bedroom saying the same words to a picture of his mother who had just been buried.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry sat under the tree until the sky was turning a deep indigo blue. He was cold and his face was wet. After packing his books and album away he stood up and grabbed the tree as, his legs shaking, the blood rushed to flow freely through them once again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Walking unsteadily to the back door he opened it silently, and going quietly through the house he hurried up to his room where he lay down on his bed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>CRACK.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>CRACK.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jumping back up he rushed to the window and peered out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was no one there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pulling his wand from his sleeve he crossed to his door and went quickly out and down the stairs. Going into the lounge room he glanced out of the window at the street.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Walking into the dining room he looked out its window.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Frowning, Harry returned his wand to his sleeve just as Aunt Petunia came out of the laundry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘What are you doing?’ she snapped when she saw him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Nothing.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Well, then you can set the table for dinner.’ Turning, she stalked into the kitchen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry, after another glance out of the window, followed her and proceeded to get the things for the table.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few minutes later the front door opened with a bang and Uncle Vernon stormed in followed closely by Dudley.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘BOY,’ he roared, pointing at Harry, ‘WHAT DID YOU DO TO DUDLEY?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Aunt Petunia turned from the carrots she was peeling to rush over to Dudley.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘What happened, Popkin?’ she asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dudley then proceeded to tell his version of what had happened.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Listening to him anyone would think it was a Basilisk that had chased him,’ thought Harry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As Dudley finished Uncle Vernon rounded on Harry, spit flying from his mouth as he yelled, ‘SO! YOU TRIED TO GET A SNAKE TO KILL MY SON, DID YOU? TRIED TO GET IT TO BITE HIM AND HIS FRIENDS WHEN THEY WERE WALKING PAST, DID YOU? WELL, YOU CAN JUST GET OUT OF HERE AND INTO YOUR ROOM BOY. WE’LL SEE HOW YOU’RE FEELING AFTER TWO DAYS WITH NO MEALS.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry snorted, thinking of the pile of food under his floorboards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Bite him? I only told the snake to chase him and he ran away like a girl, him and his friends.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Uncle Vernon took a threatening step toward him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘HOW DARE YOU, BOY!’ he thundered. ‘SETTING A SNAKE ON MY SON <em>AGAIN</em>! I’M GOING TO –!’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But whatever Uncle Vernon was going to do they never found out, for suddenly with two loud CRACKS Fred and George Weasley appeared in the middle of the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Dursleys fell back with a cry of fright.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Hiya, Harry,’ George cried as he stepped forwards to clap him on the shoulder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Nice to see you again,’ Fred said grinning. Harry saw he was holding something wrapped up in a cloth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Fred, George,’ Harry looked from one to the other. ‘What are you doing here?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘What does it look like, Harry,’ Fred said, ‘we’ve come to take you away.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘But how?’ Harry asked frowning. ‘I can’t disapparate yet.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘That’s why Dumbledore gave us that,’ George said and he pointed to the object Fred was carrying.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘What is it?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Portkey,’ replied Fred grinning. He uncovered the object and revealed a silver teapot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before he could continue, Uncle Vernon, who had overcome his fear slightly upon seeing two boys instead of adult wizards, took another step forward, demanding, ‘who are you? Get out of my house, you useless, good-for-nothing –!’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Oh, shut up,’ said George lazily and he lifted his wand and pointed it at Uncle Vernon, ‘or I’ll have you sprouting tentacles.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Uncle Vernon shut up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Now, Harry,’ George continued, ‘you’re probably wondering why we’ve been sent to get you. Well, firstly, you were going to be picked up in three days’ time by Moody and Lupin, but when Dumbledore got his report off Snape today –’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Snape!’ Harry exclaimed surprised.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Yeah. Snape was on guard duty today as no one else was free. Anyway, after Snape had told him what had happened today and that he understood you had been having a difficult time here, Dumbledore said that you could be picked up this evening. At first he was going to get Kingsley and Dad to do it, but we asked could we go.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Begged more like,’ Fred interrupted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘All right, begged,’ conceded George. ‘So, Dumbledore said we could pick you up and that he’ll send someone to pick up your stuff later. So are you ready to go?’ Harry nodded. ‘Righto then.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Turning, both Fred and George grinned at the Dursleys.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Well, must dash. So sorry we couldn’t stay for tea,’ said Fred giving a mock bow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Yes,’ sniggered George, ‘so sorry and all that, maybe next time.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Dursleys looked horrified at the thought that they might see these two impudent, red-haired twins in their house again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Well, come on then, Harry,’ said Fred picking up the teapot by the lid.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry grasped the handle and George placed his hand on the spout and counted, ‘one...two...three.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry felt the familiar sensation of having his navel pulled backwards, and then the Dursleys kitchen was disappearing in a whirlwind of colour and sound.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The next moment his feet hit the solid stone floor of the kitchen in Grimmauld Place and he felt his knees buckle slightly. Letting go of the teapot Harry turned around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘HARRY!’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A pile of bushy hair suddenly obscured Harry’s vision and his lungs were being deprived of their last breath of air.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Oh, Harry, I’m so glad you’re here.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Harry, mate, good to see you.’ Harry felt a hand thump his back. ‘Come on, Hermione, let him breathe.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stepping back Harry looked into the faces of his two best friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before he could say anything Mrs Weasley came in and upon seeing him cried, ‘Harry, dear, I’m glad you’re here at last,’ and gave him a warm hug. Pulling back she looked at Fred and George who were now talking quietly in a corner.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Fred, George.’ Both twins looked up at their mother. ‘Did you tell Harry the news?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘No, Mum, you told us not to so we didn’t,’ said Fred.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Yeah, you know us, Mum,’ smiled George, ‘we’d never disobey you.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mrs Weasley gave what sounded like a snort.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Seriously though, Mum,’ continued Fred, ‘we haven’t told him.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry was looking from Fred and George to Mrs Weasley with a puzzled frown on his face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Tell me what?’ he asked. He glanced at Ron and Hermione who smiled ruefully. ‘Do you two know what it is?’ he demanded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Now don’t be mad, Harry, please,’ begged Hermione, ‘we only found out yesterday and we haven’t had time to write to you yet. Preparations you know.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Preparations for what?’ Harry cried exasperated. Honestly couldn’t any of them tell him what was going on?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione hesitated and then glanced at Mrs Weasley for permission to tell him. Mrs Weasley nodded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘You know how last year Bill was helping Fleur with her English?’ Hermione asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry nodded, after all Fred and George had laughed themselves silly about it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Well,’ Hermione continued, ‘they, um, they’re engaged.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry stood stunned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Engaged?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Yep, that’s right. Engaged, betrothed, plighted, affianced, leg-shackled, doomed, enslaved –’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Fred, that’s enough,’ snapped Mrs Weasley. Turning she smiled at Harry. ‘Yes, Harry, Bill told us yesterday just before dinner, so we’re holding a small party for them tonight.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Is there anything I can do to help,’ Harry asked looking around at the kitchen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Oh, no, dear, you go and talk to everybody, they’ve all been waiting to see you,’ and shooing all five out of the kitchen Mrs Weasley closed the door.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Where is Bill?’ Harry asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘He and Fleur won’t be coming for another half hour. Bank stuff I suppose,’ replied Ron.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Walking into the lounge room Harry saw Moody, Tonks, Kingsley, Lupin (who looked pale and tired, Harry remembered it had been the last of the full moon last night), also Charlie, Mr Weasley, Ginny, Hagrid and Professors Dumbledore and McGonagall. Everyone cried out in welcome as they saw him, and Lupin excused himself from his conversation with Kingsley and came over.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Hello, Professor Lupin,’ Harry said quietly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Hello, Harry.’ Lupin smiled at him and then, leading Harry over to a chair away from the crowd, continued, ‘I’ve been meaning to ask you something, Harry, for a while now.’ Lupin hesitated and Harry saw that he looked nervous.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wondering what could be wrong, Harry said, ‘what do you want to ask me?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lupin took a deep breath and said very quietly, ‘I’ve been meaning to ask whether you could call me Remus instead of Professor Lupin.’ Seeing Harry’s stunned face he said quickly, ‘of course if you don’t want to I’ll understand. It’s just that,’ he paused, ‘that I’d like to think you consider me more as a friend than your old teacher.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry looked at him and smiled. ‘I’d be happy to call you Remus,’ he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘What’s this?’ cried Ron’s voice. He and Hermione had come over to hear what they were talking about. Ron looked from Harry to Lupin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘You want Harry to call you Remus? Does that mean us as well?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry looked at Lupin who nodded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Excellent. Now I don’t have to keep calling you Professor Lupin. Not that I didn’t think you were a great professor,’ Ron added hurriedly. ‘It’s just Mum insists we call our teachers Professor so and so. Now I won’t have to. You will tell her won’t you?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron glanced anxiously at Lupin who gave a small grin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Of course I will. Now I’d best leave you three to go and have a word with Hagrid.’ Smiling he turned around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Bye, Remus,’ Harry, Ron and Hermione said together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lupin turned back to them and grinned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Don’t let your mum hear you until I tell her, Ron,’ he said, and then laughed as Ron glanced towards the door and seeing his mum wasn’t there gave a relieved sigh.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘You will tell her quickly, won’t you?’ Ron asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘As soon as she walks through the door,’ Lupin smiled. Then turning around again he walked over to where Hagrid was sitting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By the time Bill and Fleur appeared Ron and Hermione had brought Harry up to date on everything that had been happening.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘So, Snape was guarding me until Tonks could show up?’ Harry asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Yep. As soon as she apparated, Snape disapparated.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘So that explains the two loud bangs I heard. It was Snape and Tonks.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘That’s right.’ This time it was Hermione who answered. ‘And when Snape had told Dumbledore what had happened and what you had said Dumbledore ordered that you be brought tonight. Mrs Weasley contacted Bill and Fleur and arranged to have their party tonight, and Fred and George offered to go and get you.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘How do you know all this?’ Harry asked amazed. ‘Didn’t Snape give his report just to the Order and Dumbledore? How did Fred and George know I was to be picked up?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Firstly, Fred and George are in the Order. They joined at the end of last term. Secondly, Snape did give his report to just the Order, but in the lounge room and not the kitchen, which means that Extendable Ears could be used, as Fred and George so kindly told us,’ Ron added.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry grinned. Fred and George were always eager to help others to either break or bend a few rules.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="center">*</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Harry congratulated Bill and Fleur after they had arrived he noticed a woman walk in that he did not recognise. She was carrying what appeared to be a large, square object wrapped in paper. She also appeared nervous.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry watched as Dumbledore walked over to her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Andromeda, it’s good to see you.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Thank you, Dumbledore, it’s lovely to see you again too.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry suddenly realised who she was. She was Sirius’ cousin and Tonks’ mother. She had a beautiful face and her hair was black and hung over her eyes like Sirius’ used to. Harry winced at the memory.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘I wasn’t going to come at first,’ Andromeda was saying quietly to Dumbledore. ‘This house it’s too full of memories for me to be happy in. But I decided to come when Molly told me that Sirius’,’ her voice broke on the name, ‘that Sirius’ godson would be here, Harry Potter. I have something I thought he would like. It arrived yesterday. I had forgotten that Sirius and I had arranged for it to be done last term after Christmas.’ She held up the thing she was carrying and placed it on the table nearest to her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Looking up at Dumbledore she asked, ‘do you think I should give it to him now or later?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Later, Andromeda,’ Dumbledore said quietly. ‘For if it is what I suspect I believe Harry would prefer to be alone after he receives it.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Andromeda nodded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Of course. Where is he, Dumbledore? Could you introduce me to him?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry turned away quickly and pretended to be admiring Fleur’s ring with Hermione, who had been asking Fleur questions about when she and Bill were getting married and where they would go for their honeymoon. Hearing steps behind him he knew Dumbledore and Andromeda were approaching.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Harry.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dumbledore’s quiet voice made him turn around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Yes, sir?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Harry, I would like you to meet Andromeda Tonks.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Andromeda held out her hand. Harry shook it noticing how cold it was and also that it was trembling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘I’m very honoured to meet you, Harry,’ Andromeda said. Harry tried to smile.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Thanks, I’m very happy to meet you.’ He paused, not knowing what to say. Then, ‘your daughter was very kind to me last year,’ he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Oh, Nymphadora is a lovely girl,’ Andromeda replied, ‘she always has been.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A silence fell again and Harry glancing down at his shoes thought of something that he should already have said. Looking up at Andromeda he said chokily, ‘Mrs Tonks, I wanted to tell you how sorry I am about Sirius. He told me you were his favourite cousin, and I wanted to say I’m sorry –’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Sorry, my dear?’ Andromeda interrupted, her eyes bright. ‘You have done nothing for which you need to apologise. You did not kill Sirius; my sister,’ she said the word with a hard look on her face, ‘my sister killed him, no one else is to blame.’ Here she looked at both Harry and Dumbledore, her face gentle again. ‘Sirius was a kind man, he wouldn’t want any of you to torture yourselves with the idea that it was your fault he died.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Andromeda pulled out a dainty, white handkerchief and wiped her eyes and nose. Then determinedly smiling she looked from Harry to Hermione and Ron and said, ‘now, who’s going to introduce me to these other two? At a guess I would say you were a Weasley.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron nodded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘His name is Ron, Mrs Tonks,’ Harry said. ‘And this is Hermione Granger. They’re my best friends.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘So I understand.’ Andromeda smiled at the three who blushed when she added, ‘from what my daughter and Remus Lupin tell me you three are quite a force to be reckoned with.’ Then laughing as they continued to look embarrassed she reached out and patted Harry’s hand. ‘It’s nothing to be embarrassed about. They are quite proud of you and I can understand why.’ She smiled at them all and then said, ‘well I think I’ll go and have a word with Molly now. Are you coming, Dumbledore?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dumbledore inclined his head and with a genial smile at Harry, Ron and Hermione he turned and escorted Andromeda out of the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the rest of the evening Harry, although he smiled and talked to everyone there, couldn’t help but think of the object that Andromeda had brought. A few times Ron and Hermione asked if he was all right; he assured them he was fine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Bill and Fleur were opening their engagement presents, there was a lot of laughter over Fred and George’s gift – a gift voucher to the value of fifty Galleons for their joke shop.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Well, all marriages need a good laugh once in a while,’ said Fred.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once all the gifts had been opened Mrs Weasley called for silence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Now, I believe Bill has something to say to us all.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bill stood up and smiled at everyone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Thanks, Mum. I guess I just wanted to thank you all for coming, it really means a lot to Fleur and I that you came, especially considering what’s happening at the moment.’ He looked around the room and then drawing Fleur to her feet he put his arm around her and said, ‘so from both Fleur and I, thank you from the bottom of our hearts.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mrs Weasley immediately burst into tears. Harry looked around. All the females in the room were wiping their eyes, even McGonagall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Weasley stood up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Thank you, Bill. And may I say from all of us, we wish both you and Fleur all the happiness in the world.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Thanks, Dad.’ As Bill was embraced by his father, Harry saw Dumbledore look over at Andromeda and nod, and as she got up everyone looked in her direction. Harry saw her swallow hard before she began speaking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Bill and Fleur, I know that tonight was to celebrate your engagement and I do wish you every joy, but I must admit I also came for an entirely different reason as well. May I ask if it would be all right with you if I gave Harry something?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bill, Fleur and everyone else in the room, apart from Harry and Dumbledore looked puzzled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Sure, Mrs Tonks,’ replied Bill, ‘I don’t mind.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Thank you.’ Turning and walking to the table in the corner of the room, Andromeda picked up the object she had brought with her and turned and faced Harry nervously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Harry, last term after Christmas I asked Sirius if he would agree to do something for me. When he found out what I wanted he agreed to do it, but only if I had a copy made for you. I had forgotten all about them in the past few weeks as you could imagine. When they arrived yesterday, Harry, I must admit that I felt a little unsure at first if you would like to have yours, but then I felt you might find it a comfort in some small way.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everyone was staring at her as she walked closer to Harry and held out the package. ‘Here. I do hope that I’ve done the right thing.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry took the package with trembling hands and gazed at her for a few seconds. Then, lowering his eyes to the package, he began to peel away the paper.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Harry, what is it?’ Hermione leapt up in alarm as Harry’s face turned white.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rushing over to him Hermione after putting a hand on his shoulder looked down at what he was holding. Her gasp echoed throughout the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘What is wro–?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron’s sentence never was finished as he too appearing beside Harry looked down. He swallowed hard and grasped Harry’s other shoulder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lupin, Kingsley, Tonks, Moody, McGonagall, Hagrid, Fleur and all the other Weasleys were looking Harry with anxious, puzzled looks on their faces.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘My dears, what is wrong?’ said Mrs Weasley coming over slowly. ‘What –?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mrs Weasley was cut off as another voice said gently, ‘I’m sorry if I’ve upset you, Harry.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was a collective gasp in the room and then,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Sirius!’ yelled Fred and George. They rushed over and gazed down at the large portrait of Sirius that was looking anxiously at Harry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘I’m sorry, Harry, if this has hurt you. I’ll understand if you don’t want to keep it...’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Andromeda’s voice trailed off as Harry dragged his glance away from Sirius and looked at her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Not keep it?’ he whispered his voice choked and his tears now running freely down his cheeks. ‘This is – I never thought – I don’t –!’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry stopped and looked at the portrait again. ‘I can never thank you enough.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Andromeda came over to him and laid her hand on his cheek.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Sirius loved you more than anything in this world. At your Christening he was almost prouder than James was about you. He hardly let anyone else hold you and if he did he kept making noises like a mother hen worrying about her chicks. He told me he wanted you to have this portrait so that wherever you were you could ask his advice or just talk to him if you felt lonely, and since I’d have another copy he could take messages for you to the Order.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry raised a hand and caught hers as she went to draw it away. Gazing intently at her he whispered, ‘thank you, Mrs Tonks.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Andromeda smiled and bending down, kissed him on his forehead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Make it Andromeda,’ she said gently and turning she walked over to Dumbledore who assisted her into her chair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Harry.’ Dumbledore’s quite voice made Harry look up. ‘If you wish you may go and talk to Sirius in private.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Yes, dear,’ said Mrs Weasley drying her eyes for the second time. ‘We’ll understand, don’t worry.’ Harry nodded and got up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lupin, who had been standing apart from everyone else in a dark corner, suddenly came forward, and pausing in front of Harry he said jerkily, ‘Harry, may I see him?’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry silently turned the portrait round. Lupin stared at the face of his friend whose hair was falling over his forehead as usual and whose face resembled what it used to be like before his internment in Azkaban.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Hello, Padfoot, old friend,’ he whispered, and everyone in the room heard the pain in his voice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Hello, Moony.’ Sirius’ voice was quiet and also sounded full of anguish. ‘I’m so sorry.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘You have nothing to be sorry about,’ Lupin said. ‘You fought bravely whilst defending Harry, you did everything James could ever have asked of you.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius’ portrait nodded, but said, ‘I’m still sorry. Out of the four you are the only one of the Marauders left and I’m sorry about that.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Nonsense,’ said Lupin. ‘Anyway, I’ve still got you.’ He gave a small smile. ‘If you’re like your real self you’ll have me ready to scream in under five minutes of conversation.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius gave a rueful grin. ‘Guess I could be aggravating couldn’t I?’ he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Aggravating is hardly the word,’ Lupin said, then seeing Harry’s white face he said, ‘Sirius, I’ll let Harry talk to you now. I’ll talk to you later.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sirius nodded. ‘Bye, Moony.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘See you, Padfoot.’ Lupin looked back to Harry. ‘Harry, you can take as long as you like. If you don’t feel like coming back down we’ll understand.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry nodded and walked quickly out of the room. Ron was about to go after him but Hermione held him back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘No, Ron, leave him alone for a while. He needs it.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Hermione’s right, Ron,’ Lupin said quietly his voice raspy. ‘Harry needs time alone with Sirius.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron sighed and then nodded silently.</p>
