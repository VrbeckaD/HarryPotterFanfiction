    <em>Fiammetta</em>
  </strong>
</p><p>‘Look at the stars tonight, <em>piccino</em>,’ I murmur. ‘What do you think that one is?’</p><p>Giovanni cranes his head up to look, pulling away from me. His dæmon Rosalinda, in the form of a sheepdog, grumbles at the abrupt change in position. ‘I’m not sure. You’ve always been the astronomer, Fia.’ He pulls a strand of dark, wavy hair from his eyes.</p><p>‘I think it’s Leo tonight, <em>fratellino</em>,’ I reply. ‘Like your star sign.’</p><p>‘Ah,’ he says, returning to his spot huddled up next to me, Rosalinda burying her head into his chest. It is, at least, a warm night. ‘Then that is Regulus, the bright one I can see?’ As he points to it, I nod.</p><p>We sit there, slumped under the canopy of the <em>forno</em>, silent. My dæmon Neptunus is in the form of a black rabbit, and he crunches his pink nose at Rosalinda curiously. When the baker comes tomorrow morning he and his greyhound dæmon will chase us down the street, call us “dirty rats” like the tailor did when we slept under <em>his </em>canopy, but we hardly have a choice. We sleep wherever we can. There’s a thieves’ guild here, but they’re not friendly with us, won’t let us in, not with Giovanni being what he is. They’re afraid he’ll bring trouble.</p><p>He’s hardly a danger if you keep him calm, keep him safe, try not to scare him.</p><p>‘When d’you think Aurelia will let us train?’ Giovanni asks, his voice low and hushed.</p><p>A group of slightly disgusted tourists and their dæmons walk past us, and I wait until they’re out of earshot before I reply. ‘We’ve got to find the twins first, you know that. Aurelia said they were coming to Venice soon.’</p><p>‘Can it be tomorrow?’ yawns Giovanni.</p><p>‘I hope so,’ I reply.</p><p>I dream of the day when we will sleep under a roof, in warm beds, and with full bellies. The day we find those twins is the day we finally have somewhere safe to live, where we will get three meals a day and never have to worry about being chased for sleeping under someone’s canopy or getting sick because we slept out in the cold or the rain.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>‘Get out of here, dirty thieves!’</p><p>No sooner have I awoken, I feel the baker’s broom biting against my back. Giovanni is already halfway down the street, Rosalinda still in her sheepdog form, hot on his heels. Neptunus becomes a Siamese cat, spitting and hissing at the greyhound-dæmon.</p><p>‘Forget her,’ I hiss at him. ‘Let’s go!’</p><p>Neptunus relaxes slightly, following me as I hurry to catch up to Giovanni.</p><p>‘If I ever see you ‘round here again, I’ll call the guards and have them deal with you, <em>stronza</em>!’ the baker yells.</p><p>We turn a corner and lean against the wall to catch our breaths. ‘<em>Porca puttana</em>,’ I swear quietly.</p><p>Giovanni looks at me. ‘That was close,’ he whispers breathlessly. Rosalinda pants, and he reaches down to pet her. ‘But the guards, Fia …’</p><p>‘We can’t stay here,’ agrees Neptunus, in the form of a pigeon.</p><p>Rosalinda becomes a moth, and flies down the alleyway. ‘Three guards,’ she reports back. ‘An Agile and two Militia.’</p><p>‘If we act normally—’</p><p>I shush Giovanni. ‘I don’t like them. Best just wait until they pass.’</p><p>‘I’m hungry,’ murmurs Giovanni.</p><p>‘Oh, <em>vaffanculo</em>! So am I, but I’d rather be hungry than in prison!’</p><p>‘They’d feed us in prison.’ There is a cheeky grin on his face.</p><p>I scowl. ‘I’m going to punch that disgusting little smirk right off your face if you carry on.’</p><p>Wisely, he shuts up. I wouldn’t <em>actually</em> punch him, but he doesn’t need to know that right now. I’m more concerned about the three guards that are patrolling. The two Militia we could outrun, but the Agile is more of a concern.</p><p>As the name suggests, Agiles are the fastest guards there are here. They’re good free runners, too, so even if we managed to make it onto the roofs, he’d follow us.</p><p>The Militia are easy. They’re easily fought, easy to run away from, easy to fool, and they’re useless as shit at free running.</p><p>Then there’s the Elites, and although they’re not fast like the Agiles, they’ve got strong armour and I haven’t seen one run away from a fight yet. According to Niccolò, one of the Assassins we met at Aurelia’s hideout in Cittàsegreto, though, they’re not as strong as the Leaders, who have full-face armour like knights.</p><p>The strongest of all the guards are the Brutes and Seekers. They’ve both got a shit ton of armour, and Niccolò said they’re difficult to disarm. The Seekers carry long spears and if you’re hiding from them, you’ve gotta hide pretty well because they nearly always find you.</p><p>I thank Jesus, God, Ezio Auditore, and anyone else who’s listening that we only have an Agile and two Militia to deal with.</p><p>‘The roofs?’ I suggest. It’s the only thing I can think of.</p><p>I want to avoid a fight right now.</p><p>If we can make it to the Rialto, we can find Niccolò. He’ll buy us something to eat.</p><p>I start climbing first, Neptunus flying to the top to check for any Archers.</p><p>‘Clear,’ he murmurs, landing on my shoulder.</p><p>The roof provides a clear view towards the Rialto. Looking ahead, I see the large square in front, where the guards are patrolling. Both Militia are talking, and the Agile is pacing with his tabby cat-dæmon. Did the baker warn them?</p><p>I take a right across the rooftops, jumping across from the top of where a bar is underneath, to the roof of a souvenir shop, Giovanni hot on my heels. When I look back, Rosalinda is a seagull.</p><p>We bound—and, in Neptunus and Rosalinda’s case, fly—across the rooftops until we reach the Rialto. Our descent is relatively easy, and we walk across the bridge, the morning air fresh and crisp.</p><p>We sit on a bench, and wait.</p><hr/><p>6 a.m. he comes, sits on the bench with us for a while whilst fingering a tattered book, and at 7 a.m. he takes us for breakfast.</p><p>We go to some café north of the Rialto, and neither Giovanni nor I can read the menu, so Niccolò orders us some toast, sausages and bacon.</p><p>I can’t help but notice that we look horribly out of place.</p><p>Niccolò is wearing a dark suit, his little coatimundi-dæmon curled around his neck, with a golden pocket-watch in his breast pocket. Meanwhile, Giovanni and I are clad in rags.</p><p>Niccolò must notice how uncomfortable we look, for he says, ‘Any news on the twins?’</p><p>‘No,’ I reply softly. ‘Must we find them before Aurelia will accept us?’</p><p>Niccolò purses his lips. ‘I’m afraid so. But it shouldn’t be long now. Hold on just a little longer, <em>bambini</em>.’ He pulls out a small vial from his pocket, shakes up the purple-blue liquid inside, and hands it to Giovanni. ‘Take a little before you eat, and the rest after lunch, <em>aquilotto</em>. That should contain the Obscurus for a little while.’</p><p>‘<em>Grazie</em>,’ murmurs Giovanni, unscrewing the cap and taking a small gulp. Rosalinda, in her blue-tit form, seems to relax the second the liquid touches Giovanni’s tongue.</p><p>We eat heartily, and when we are finished it is nearing 9 a.m. Niccolò and the coatimundi-dæmon retreat over the Rialto, and Giovanni and I take quiet steps to the east.</p><p>Guards are patrolling now, but they pay no attention to us.</p><p>‘Something’s going on,’ says a goose-dæmon to her Brute. ‘I can feel it.’</p><p align="center"> </p>
