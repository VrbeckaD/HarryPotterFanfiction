<p>It's a perfect wedding.</p>
<p>The ceremony, officiated by the Minister herself, is emotional, affectionate, and truly beautiful. The happy couple agreed to only invite their closest relatives and friends to their ceremony and thus, no more than 25 people gather around the Ministry's wedding chamber for a private handfasting ritual.</p>
<p>"Dear Scorpius, dear Albus, we are all here today to stand witness as you join hands and are bound together through your love – and by wizarding law - now and forever." The grooms only have eyes for each other as the Minister asks them to join their hands.</p>
<p>As Hermione speaks the traditional 7 blessings - one for every band that is magically fastened around the couple's hands - Harry is constantly handing either Ron or Ginny a tissue, tears glistening in his eyes as he watches his son bond with the love of his life. Though he'll deny it later, Ron is in tears the moment Hermione raises her wand, eyes on his wife as he remembers the day they were bonded. Lily is clinging to her father, her camera all but forgotten hanging around her neck. Draco, standing between Narcissa and Molly, is experiencing a similar problem to Harry. Hermione's wand flicks through the air with finality, and a golden rope beginnings to wrap itself around Scorpius and Albus' hands. It flares brightly seven times before fading away. The grooms' hands now fastened, Hermione continues to bless their bonding.</p>
<p>"These are the hands of your best friend, young and strong and full of love for you, that are holding yours on your wedding day, as you promise to love each other today, tomorrow, and forever. These are the hands that will work alongside yours, as you build your future together. These are the hands that will love you and cherish you through the years and comfort you like no other. These are the hands that will hold you in fear or grief, in joy and bliss. These are the hands that will countless times wipe the tears from your eyes, tears of sorrow and tears of joy. These are the hands that will tenderly hold your children, the hands that will join your family as one. These are the hands that will give you strength when you need it, support and encouragement to pursue your dreams, and comfort you through difficult times."</p>
<p>By now, Lily has moved into her Uncle Charlie's arms as Harry hasGinny engulfed in a hug. Victoire dries her tears on Teddy's dress shirt as he gives her a kiss behind her ear. Neville is whispering into his wife's ear, causing Hannah to blush furiously at the promises he makes.</p>
<p>"And lastly, these are the hands that, even when wrinkled and aged, will still be reaching for yours, still giving you the same unspoken tenderness with just a touch."</p>
<p>Arthur touches his lips against Molly's cheek, rubbing her aching hip. James is trying to shush all three of the Potter granddaughters somewhere in the back as they are discussing rather loudly about wanting to be married just like their uncles.</p>
<p>In front of their loved ones, Scorpius and Albus share a smile that Rose would pretend to gag at if she wasn't too busy smiling at the idiots that are her best friends. Scorpius' best man — and cousin — Tomag gives her wink, almost making her sob out loud. Meanwhile, Grandma Molly has, in fact, succumbed to sobs.</p>
<p>"Scorpius, your vows please."</p>
<p>Scorpius doesn't seem to hear Hermione and simply continues to stare into Albus' eyes, smiling happily. Rose rolls her eyes and Harry gives a little cough from Scorpius' right.</p>
<p>"Scorpius?"</p>
<p>A blush creeping across his porcelain cheek, Scorpius turns to Hermione and gives her an apologetic smile. The Minister bites back a chuckle before motioning towards Albus with a smile.</p>
<p>"Your vows, please."</p>
<p>"Right, yes." Scorpius takes a visible, shaky breath before he turns back to his groom. "Albus. You have been my best friend since we were 11, you have been my love since we were 16. You have been my safety blanket, you have been my rock. You have been my entertainer, you have been my cheerleader."</p>
<p>There are tears threatening to spill across Albus' cheek as he hiccups a laugh.</p>
<p>"You have pushed me into trouble, you have pulled me out of despair. You were there for me through everything, and you were by my side always. Today, I promise to cheer you up when you are down, to make you smile when you are grumpy, to hold your hand through hard times, to nurse you through sickness. I promise to be your best friend, your greatest support, your partner, and accomplice. I promise to be everything you need me to be for you, now and forever."</p>
<p>A few stray tears roll down Albus' face now, which he would swipe away if he wouldn't have to clamp his lips shut to keep from sobbing like his grandmother does in the back. Scorpius smiles his adorable, kind smile and leans over to brush the tear away with his manicured thumb. On impulse, Albus grabs his groom's face in his hands and kisses the man passionately.</p>
<p>Again, Harry coughs rather loudly. The couple scoot apart, both blushing madly but blissful smiles on their faces. Hermione takes a moment to allow them collect themselves before continuing.</p>
<p>"Albus, your vows please."</p>
<p>Albus grins sheepishly as Rose hands him a parchment. He clears his throat before reading from the parchment.</p>
<p>"You, Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy, are my best friend and my one true love. There is still a part of me today that cannot believe that you agreed to marry me. You know me better than anyone else in this world and somehow still you manage to love me." Albus glances at Scorpius and finds his groom giving an affirmative nod. "So, I promise this to you. I promise that I will not drink all the coffee in the morning. I promise that I will try to put down the toilet seat. I promise that I will not complain about your classical music – too much. I promise that I will open all the jars for you – although you could use magic. I promise to listen to all your history facts and poorly told jokes. I promise to make you pancakes the muggle way everyday – or, well, maybe every valentine's day. I promise to let you win at chess. I even promise to let you dress me. Because most of all, I promise I will love and cherish you throughout the good times and bad times – if you will let me."</p>
<p>Scorpius' whispered "yes" gets lost in another kiss between the two grooms. Hermione finds Ron's eyes on her and they share a smile across the room.</p>
<p>"May you ever be mindful and strive to keep the vows you have spoken. May you ever be as your hearts have always known you to be,<br/>Husband and Husband."</p>
<p>Everyone around them is applauding, but neither of the grooms can be bothered to take in the moment as Albus pulls his husband's head down, presses his lips against Scorpius' soft mouth and they share their first kiss as a Mr and Mr Malfoy-Potter.</p>
<p>.</p>
