Lucius Malfoy was weak. In fact, he determined as he felt fear course through his body, the last generations of Malfoys were weak. Very skilled in the political arena, extremely agile in the corporate environment, but useless in battle.</p><p>The fearsome and powerful warriors of the old times had adapted to restricting their wars to the Wizengamot. Every member of the parliament knew better than to mess with a Malfoy: they would be bribed, blackmailed or threatened into appropriate behaviour. Yes, they were very accomplished politicians; especially considering the harsh blow the Family Name had received when his Father was accused of being a Death Eater.</p><p>Their talent wasn’t just restricted to politics, they knew how to identify stalkers, kidnappers, hired mercenaries, all sorts of poisons and dispose of possible threats. However, what was needed now was a strong leader, a warrior. Someone who could become the Paterfamilias, look at the Dark Lord in the eye and proclaim that Malfoys weren’t followers but allies, someone to protect the Family and the honour of the line.</p><p>Draco knew he wasn’t that person. But he could become that person. It was in his blood, he just had to find a connection to the generations of ruthless mages who had destroyed entire cities and conquered countless lands. So while his whole family whimpered and grovelled at the Dark Lord’s feet, he holed up in the library.</p><p>The Malfoy Heir was nothing if not perseverant as his long time obsession with Potter could confirm. When his Ancestral Family Manor became the Dark Lord’s headquarters, he stayed in the library. When his dungeons were used to house prisoners who were in his same year at school, he stayed in the library. When the Death Eaters who had invaded his home mocked him calling him weak and coward, he stayed in the library.</p><p>Once he found what he had been looking for, he informed his parents he was going to France to not raise suspicions since he did spend a month in France every year. His mother looked particularly relieved at the announcement. So the young Slytherin ordered the house-elves to fill the black trunk with all his things, he worded it with care making sure they would pack all his things but if someone pointed it out, he could say the house-elves had been overzealous.</p><p>The same afternoon, he went to Gringotts and drained his account which consisted on his Trust Fund, his Black vault and his Malfoy Heir vault, putting all the money, jewels and heirlooms in the last compartment of his trunk. Once back in the Manor, he made sure all his belongings were in the trunk; every book, every trinket and every robe. He pressed the button that made it shrink until it was no bigger than a nail and he hid it inside his medallion, which had a secret compartment inside.</p><p>Then he headed downstairs to speak with his Father in his office. His Patriarch was studying some documents on his enormous desk with a focused expression. Since the Dark Lord had come into their home, his father, who was young for a wizard, seemed to have aged two decades. Although, Draco supposed it wasn’t only the constant worry that aged the Death Eater, the numerous punishments from the Dark Lord had probably damaged his Father’s body.</p><p>“Father”, he greeted his diminished Patriarch respectfully, after all, he had been raised in the Old Ways.</p><p>“Draco”, responded Father, raising his silver eyes from the papers on his desk.</p><p>“I wished to speak with you in private”, he explained simply, letting his father know to cast the necessary spells to avoid their conversation being overheard.</p><p>Father's severe eyes narrowed and he discreetly waved his dark wand, casting complicated wordless spells that would lead anyone listening in to think they were chattering about inane matters. The Malfoy Heir approached his Paterfamilias eagerly, until he stood in front of the enormous Victorian desk.</p><p>“What is this, Draco? You know we can't take any risks right now”, the adult wizard scolded him sternly.</p><p>“I know, Father, but I wish to take some of the heirlooms with me”, he stated simply, his face impassive as he had been taught from a young age.</p><p>Lord Malfoy's eyes widened almost unperceptively at the bold request, “Do you believe it wise?” the wizard questioned, scepticism clear in his voice.</p><p>Jeopardising the safety of their heirlooms was, indeed, generally an unwise course. Even so, Draco believed the circumstances merited it. The Dark Lord relied heavily on the Malfoys’ fortune and he was a threat to the heirlooms the Family had accumulated for thousands of years. He wouldn’t let that wizard touch any other heirloom of their family.</p><p>“Their safety isn’t assured in Malfoy Manor anymore. This war is already dilapidating our vaults at Gringotts and he's already found use to some of our heirlooms, how long do you think it will take him to squander all of them? The heirlooms you choose shall be transported to a… safer venue”, Draco answered calmly.</p><p>“What makes you believe that you could protect them better than I would?” inquired icily his Patriarch.</p><p>“I'll hide them in Malfoy Fortress”, he replied, his confidence in the hiding place clear in his posture.</p><p>His Paterfamilias stilled, staring at him seriously, “Are your plans to spend this month in Malfoy Fortress instead of France?”</p><p>“Yes, Father”, the young blond, answered.</p><p>There was a pause of silence in the conversation. His Father was contemplating Draco’s proposal. In most cases, it would be unthinkable to trust such important items to a young, unprepared member of House Malfoy. Such desperate courses of action were only taken as extreme measures; when they were invaded. But hadn’t their ally, the Dark Lord, betrayed them and invaded their home?</p><p>“Draco, there's a reason our family moved to Malfoy Manor two hundred of years ago. Malfoy Fortress is rather... temperamental. It's a violent semi sentient building. Is it truly your wish to spend your summer there?” questioned coldly the Death Eater.</p><p>“Yes, Father. Malfoy Fortress would never be invaded”, he responded, knowing Father would complete the sentence with 'it would never be breached by Death Eaters; the Fortress would kill them first. Not like Malfoy Manor which has surrendered to the Dark Lord'.</p><p>The Malfoy Patriarch thought in silence for some long seconds, weighting the pros and cons of this decision. Finally, he nodded decisively and stood to lead his Heir into the secret chamber that held the most important heirlooms of the Malfoy Family. Draco had only been there thrice in his life, when he was six and the magic accepted him as the Malfoy Heir, when he was eleven since it was the age their magic started to define and grow and when he was fourteen which was when he could be emancipated.</p><p>They passed numerous wards and a confusing array of secret passages to get to the huge chamber. The experience had never been agreeable with Draco. The different wards made the entire way seem hazy and undefined, so as to prevent mind intruders learning of the chamber’s location. To Draco’s well-constructed mind, it was a most upsetting experience.</p><p>Inside the secret chamber, the most incredible heirlooms of their line resided; amulets with strong undetectable glamour spells that changed your appearance completely, rings that protected the mind from invasion, gems that amplified all sorts of magicks, armours that could resist the deadliest spells, ancient books... For a few minutes, the blond pureblood just stood in awe of the quantity of magical items his family had amassed over the years.</p><p>As a pureblood of the Old Ways, Draco had been raised learning of his House’s prowess. His fairy tales had been stories of his ancestors and his lullabies songs of ancient Malfoy love stories or war stories. However, his House’s age and strength was never more evident than when he looked at the amassed treasures his Family had gathered through the centuries.</p><p>Draco took out his white gold medallion, which pictured the Family Crest of the House of Malfoy. At least, it had the last renovated version that came from the eighteenth century. Through the years, the dragon in their coat of arms had become more and more serpentine until the eighteenth century dragon looked more like a winged snake.</p><p>He opened the locket’s secret compartment, taking out a second trunk he had prepared hoping Lord Malfoy would allow him to take away some of their heirlooms. As his Father pointed out heirlooms, he was slightly surprised by the sheer amount his Patriarch wanted him to hide away. After all, most of these items were priceless and it was strange to be trusted with objects so valuable. Nevertheless, he supposed his Paterfamilias didn't have much choice. It was either trust him to carry them to safety or eventually relinquishing them to the Dark Lord. A decision that no pureblood proud of their legacy wished to ever do.</p><p>Once he had gathered all the heirlooms to be spirited away, they returned to Father's office. It was with fascination as Draco watched his Patriarch erase his memory of the heirlooms they had chosen. It took high skill in Occlumency for a wizard to safely delete memories. It was necessary to delete those memories to avoid the Dark Lord ever learning of their existence, even if the Dark Lord raped his Father’s mind, he would never know of them.</p><p>As soon as his Father was finished dabbling with his memories, Draco was allowed to leave the office. He made sure to prepare well for the trip to Malfoy Fortress and gave a heartfelt farewell to his parents as he left Malfoy Manor.</p><p> </p><p>Malfoy Fortress was as unwelcoming as he had expected. The wards recognized his blood and let him pass; yet Draco had the distinct impression that they considered him unworthy of being the Heir of the Family. It wasn't odd, though, considering Malfoy Fortress appreciated warriors and Draco was no warrior.</p><p>The blond wizard quickly went to one of the ritual chambers; he knew he was cutting it close having only four hours to prepare the ritual. But the discovery of the spell, devising the ritual and defining the ideal time to complete it had taken hours upon hours of research. Furthermore, the best next date was one month and a half later.</p><p>He cleaned the chamber using as little magic as possible to avoid the contamination of the magic of the ritual. Draco quickly made the potion he used later to draw the pertinent symbols. He placed the seven crystals that would amplify the power of the ritual, in order to reduce the amount of magic it would demand from him. He put the three offerings in their appropriate places. He bathed with the correct potion to purge himself of foreign magic and dressed himself in an expensive set of traditional robes, finding it fitting.</p><p>Once it was time, he stood in his place readying himself to start the ritual. In his research, he had discovered a spell that allowed someone to have impressions of his ancestors. Draco had gone a step further and devised a whole ritual that would allow him to turn those impressions into blocks of memories that would be transmitted to him. Of course, he had limited which memories since his brain didn't have the capacity to remember hundreds of lives. His objective was to receive the memories of how their offensive and defensive magicks were done to gain an edge over Voldemort. Even the Dark Lord wouldn't know about wards or curses from hundreds of years ago.</p><p>His medallion heated against his porcelain skin, alerting him that it was time to begin. Draco undid the alarm spell and inhaled deeply before starting the spell. He didn't know what would happen if he were to mess it up. He started chanting, his eyes closed as he focused on the flux of magic he could feel. Everything was going as planed when the Malfoy Heir felt foreign magic intruding in the ritual.</p><p>The magic was from the Malfoy Fortress. It wasn’t unusual for the ritual to use ambient magic. In fact, he had planned to use this location because the magic of the Fortress would power up his own spell. Yet, this wasn’t ambient magic, this magic had intent. He couldn't recognize its purpose, although he knew it wasn't harmful. He bit his lower lip; he couldn't stop now. If he stopped the magic of the ritual would turn against him and he didn't want to become a squib. He only hoped that the foreign magic wouldn't muck up the ritual, he had no wish to end up dead.</p><p>The magic flow started to accelerate, circling Draco and growing in girth. The blond started to pant as he continued chanting, the ritual was leeching more magic from him than expected which made no sense because it had taken more than expected from the Fortress too.</p><p>He could feel his body growing weak while his magical reserves were rapidly consumed. He started to feel lightheaded and his body started to sway. He opened his silver eyes to try to focus, but the stream of colours from the magic flow only made him dizzy. Small dots of black appeared in his vision. His knees bucked and he fell to the hard floor. Finally, he lost consciousness.</p><p> </p>
