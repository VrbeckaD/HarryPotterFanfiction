    <p>
  <span>It was a calm afternoon in the Gryffindor tower. James Potter and Peter Pettigrew were down in the common room, enjoying their free time before dinner playing Exploding Snaps. Remus Lupin was on his way up to the boys' 6-year dormitory, looking for his boyfriend.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When Remus got up, he smiled brightly at what he saw. There Sirius Black was. In Remus’s bed and wearing Remus’s favourite sweater, clearly trying and failing to take a nap.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, don’t you look cuddly?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius looked up at the werewolf and smiled. The tired boy mumbled, “Come here, Rem. I have a raging headache and need cuddles.” Remus jokingly sighed annoyed and walked over to the shorter boy.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Scoot over.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius moved a bit over and stretched his arms out like a toddler. Remus laid down and held the grey-eyed boy in his arms.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, in my bed and wearing my sweater and now you got me here with you, what's up about that?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You make me feel happy and safe, why wouldn’t I want to cover myself in your scent?” Sirius smirked and looked up at Remus as he spoke. Said boy got a happy possessive feeling over his boyfriend. The wolf within was happy at Sirius’s response and was at ease.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus kissed Sirius’s forehead. “I love you, Pads.” “I love you too, Moons,” Sirius mumbled back, already half asleep.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius woke up feeling cold, confused he noticed that his boyfriend wasn’t in bed anymore. Just as he was about to go, Remus came in. Sirius wasn’t sure if his mouth was dry or if he was drooling because there was his gorgeous boyfriend Remus Lupin wearing his leather jacket. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When he finally got his senses back he realized he kept checking him out without saying anything.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, damn Moons. Please wear my leather jacket any day.”  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus smirked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, I couldn’t help burrowing it when I saw how cute you were in my sweater, Pads. Now come on, you woke up just in time for dinner.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius quickly took on pants before they walked down to dinner hand in hand, Sirius in Remus’s sweater and Remus in Sirius's leather jacket.</span>
