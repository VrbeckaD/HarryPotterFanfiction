  <em> 15 October 1977</em>
</p><p>            Snow fell softly outside the windows of the master bedroom as Bellatrix Lyra Lestrange nee Black gazed at the sleeping newborn baby, Agatha (the name that she decided on and was given approval for if the child was ever going to be a girl), in her arms. Counting the infant’s fingers as she beamed at this new creation in her arms.</p><p>            “Oh, Cissy, isn’t she lovely?” Bellatrix whispered to her sister. <em>And maybe exceptionally powerful when she grows up, with the Dark Lord’s and my own powers combined</em>, she finishes pridefully in her mind.</p><p>            “She is,” her sister said in reply, though Bella suspected a slight unease in her tone. Giving away that she was not comfortable with her parentage.</p><p>            Bella frowned at her sister. “You have a problem?” she demanded. “Her father is the most powerful wizard on this planet, a heritage that should make anyone proud. An honor that anyone would covet.”</p><p>            “Of course not,” Narcissa answered, frowning at her sister. “It’s a honor, Bella. I would be lying if I said it wasn’t.”</p><p>            Bella opened her mouth, about to point out how she detected unease in her tone.</p><p>            “How is our child, dear Bella?” his voice punctured the air that was beginning to fill with tension. She looked up to see the Dark Lord start towards the bed. Excited anticipation filling her at the prospect of presenting their child to him. There was no doubt that he wouldn’t be entirely displeased.</p><p>            “Well, My Lord,” she answered, holding up the bundle up towards him. “Your daughter, My Lord.”</p><p>            She watched as the Dark Lord takes the bundle from her hands and regards Agatha with his crimson eyes. Watching as he analyzes the child as if it were a piece of art. “I would have preferred a boy in these circumstances, but she will certainly most do.”</p><p>            Bellatrix watched as he continued analyzing his child. His mouth curling into a smile as he gazed at her like he found himself an epic accomplishment. It was, for he had chosen her to the vessel for continuation of Salazar Slytherin’s lineage.</p><p>            As Agatha’s hair changed from a medium blonde to a bright shade of red, his eyes widened in surprise before curling his lips in a smirk. “And it seems that she is a metamorphmagi,” he mused. “Something that might come in handy for my cause.</p><p>            “Agatha Cassiopeia Lestrange will serve me as my faithful right-hand,” he declared. “Her name as with Lord Voldemort’s shall fill every heart with fear. So much that even Albus Dumbledore and his Order will be compelled to cower in fear.”</p><p>            Bellatrix wasn’t surprised that their daughter would be given her surname that she acquired from her dear husband. There was no reason why he would taint her with that filthy Muggle surname. It would also not draw attention to the old-coot.</p><p>            The Dark Lord turns to her. The command in his red eyes was unmissable. “Only a select people will know her parentage,” he hissed. “Everyone else will think that she is the daughter of you and your husband and that is what is expected of them.”</p><p>            “Of course, My Lord,” she concurred. “If anyone else finds out who her father is, I’ll kill them before they could think to spread it.”</p><p>            Bellatrix would take it to the grave if she had to. For if word spread about her sweet Agatha’s parentage, it will derail the plans that the Dark Lord had for her. Not to mention that the old-coot would intervene and think he was doing her baby girl a favor by ripping her from them.</p><p>           </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>            Bellatrix was soon woken up in the middle of the night. The nursery was across the hall, and she could hear Agatha faintly cry. She had to thank Cissy for placing charms in the nursery to notify them when Agatha woke up.</p><p>            “I’ll get up,” Rody grunted, ready to get up from the bed.</p><p>            “No, I’ll do it,” she said, tossing the covers off her body. “Go back to sleep, Rody.”</p><p>            She apparates from the master bedroom to the nursery, and immediately, she sees what the problem was. “Oh, Ickle Aggie has a smelly nappy?” she asks in her baby voice, one that she usually used when torturing her subjects. Not this time. “Mummy is here.”</p><p>            With a flick of her wand, she cleans her nappy before picking up from her crib. Bouncing her on her shoulder as she whispered in her ear. If anyone else had seen her like this, she’d Cruciate them, to remind them to take her seriously.</p><p>            It had been six months since Agatha was born, and she was growing. She was even starting to babble!</p><p>            “Can you say mama?” Bellatrix would ask her as the infant would tug on her strands of dark hair. In some of her free time, she would entertain her and play with her toys. When she was dispatched on missions for the Dark Lord, she and Rodolphus would leave her to the nursemaid. And Bellatrix made sure that her milk would be in bottles beforehand.</p><p>            It wasn’t unusual for the Dark Lord to see his daughter and hold at times when she wasn’t crying. When she does –</p><p>            “Take her,” he would order. “It is unsettling to the ears.”</p><p>            The Dark Lord never had the patience for infants, as stated by himself many times. He had made the plan to start control of her life by the time that she was seven, as by that time, “She’d be more manageable.”</p><p>            A plan, that even if Bellatrix had some private reservations, would make sense as she’d be able to absorb everything better. It wasn’t like the Dark Lord was the paternal type anyway. Not like Rodolphus, who’d sit on the rocking chair and rock her to sleep.</p>

  <em>23<sup>rd</sup> December 1981</em>
</p><p>            Narcissa Eridani Malfoy nee Black was bouncing her one-year-old son on her shoulder. Humming him to sleep when she had heard a pop. Even if she knew who it would be, she’d turned to see Bellatrix in the room, holding four-year-old Agatha in her arms.</p><p>            “I suppose you don’t have reservations for watching your niece for a few hours while Rod, Rab, Barty, and I have some work to do?” said Bella.</p><p>            Work to do. Ever since Bellatrix had devoted herself to Voldemort’s cause, she had witnessed her loyalty evolve to the point of fanaticism. Narcissa could very well guess the thoughts running through her head regarding the rumors of the Dark Lord’s fall.</p><p>            “They are just rumors, Bella,” Narcissa tried to assure as Bella placed her niece on the floor. Anything to prevent her from doing anything drastic.</p><p>            “Exactly! Rumors,” Bella hissed. “Does one really believe that the Dark Lord would easily be stopped by a one-year-old baby? That a wizard as powerful as him would be wiped from the face of the earth by some Mudblood’s baby?”</p><p>            “You are considering risking capture and imprisonment?” Narcissa demanded, seeing Agatha toddle towards the black cat sitting on the couch. “You have a daughter. Have you ever considered –”</p><p>            “I have!” Bellatrix interrupted, nostrils flaring. “She would want me to find her father. To see that a filthy half-blood was not the result of his defeat. It would be something that he’d want as well. Even if she doesn’t like it, she’ll understand. Understand that her mother was trying to find her father, and if I fail, then I’ll leave it for her to avenge him.”</p><p>            And without another word, she apparated from the room, probably to where she was going to meet her husband, brother-in-law, and Barty. Narcissa sighed, trying to lull Draco to sleep.</p><p>            Bellatrix might have thought that it was for Agatha’s benefit. That she was doing this for her, but any sane mother would put their child first before the very cause that they devote themselves to.</p><p>            Narcissa gave her niece a sad smile as she watched her niece play with the cat. Bella said that she loved animals and that Rodolphus was planning on getting her a kitten for Christmas.</p><p>            It was too early to tell given her age, but her demeanor reminded her so much of Andromeda. Kind and sweet Dromeda who Narcissa had cut off from her family ever since her marriage to that Mudblood. A decision that was easy for Bella but a hard one for Narcissa, as the latter was closest to Dromeda.</p><p>            The Dark Lord considered kindness a weakness and he abhorred weakness. Something that he would have no doubt siphon away from her when she reached seven.</p><p>            Narcissa wasn’t surprised when custody of Agatha was transferred to her and Lucius upon Bella’s incarceration. Narcissa hoped that Agatha would be able to continue her childhood as normally as possible. With no one trying siphon away that kindness within her.</p><p>             </p><p>          </p>

  <em>5<sup>th</sup> March 1982</em>
</p><p>            Bellatrix was expecting this. Expecting that she’d be imprisoned for the incapacitation of those blood traitors. The only bad thing was that she’d not see her beautiful Aggie for a long time, but it was a sacrifice that she had to make. For Azkaban was merely a badge of honor for one that serves the Dark Lord.</p><p>            <em>I’d meet you again when your father sends for us</em>, she murmured in her heart.</p><p>            Even if Agatha would resent her for her choice at the start, she’d come to understand the sacrifice she made for her. Which was why she has no doubt that she would look for her father.</p><p>            Unfortunately for Bellatrix, searching for her father would be the furthest from Agatha’s mind in the coming years.</p>
