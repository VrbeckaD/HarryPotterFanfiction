  <strong>Chapter 1</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Hogwarts, 2453</strong>
</p>
<p>Harry sat on a rock looking over the Black Lake as she observed the ruins of Hogwarts. The Forbidden Forest has taken over most of the ground over the last 400 years since its destructing. It stood as a monument to the darkest time in magical history when war with the Muggles led to its destruction.</p>
<p>Harry as the Master of Death had watched her world crumble and change, and there had been many places of her youth that had been taken by Time, but neither Time nor Death would take her.  She had become the silent watcher looking on as Time passed around her but leaving her untouched, it was her curse to bear as the Master of Death. She watched as her Godson grew from the happy baby she raised, to the devoted Father that married his schoolyard sweetheart, to the Soldier that fought and died for the freedom of Magic. However, now that Teddy had died and his children and then their children she felt her ties to this world slowly break along with her heart.</p>
<p>However, Harry has not sat idly by as her world changed. She had fought in the two wars that had come due to the revelation of the Magical World, and it was those horrors that she had witnessed that had led her to find a way to leave her reality.</p>
<p>She had all her earthly possessions in a trunk that had been shrunk and sealing into a rune array that was inked into her skin. Her holly wand had finally been destroyed around 300 years ago in a fire that should have killed her, but as the Master of Death, she was forced to come back and pick up the pieces of her life. Magical technology had advanced in that last one hundred and fifty years due to the cooperation of the Magi, as her people were now known, and the Mundane, after the end of the last war. So now she used a clear Generator quartz crystal as her main foci. The crystal was attached to the silver bracelet and enhanced with runes. She still had the Deathly Hollows as they would never leave her side for long. She wore the stone on her right thumb, the wand was in a dragon hide holster on her left arm, and she had the cloak sealed into her left palm.</p>
<p>She wore a burgundy leather trench coat made from the Basilisk that she had slain, along with dragon hide boots that had been gifted to her by Charlie Weasley on her 23<sup>rd</sup> birthday, which had been that last day she had aged as she came into her magical inheritance. She wore a form-fitting magi-tech jumpsuit under her trench coat that allowed her cast magic from every part of her body. Her glasses were long gone; she had fixed her eyes centuries ago.</p>
<p>With a sigh, Harry rose from the rock and gave one last goodbye to the last reminder of her Time. She then turned on her foot and with a small pop Harry apparated to the entrance of the Department of Mysteries. The location had been lost to time, and only she knew where the original British Ministry was after its destruction and collapse in 2020, and that had been one of the opening salvos of the First Magi War.</p>
<p>Although Harry had been to Department of Mysteries before it was only a faint memory and she had to use her occumency to remember the way to the Death Chamber. While Harry had researched the effects of the Veil of Death, she was not completely sure what would happen when she went through, but there were only three options. Death, nothing, or it would transport her to another place.</p>
<p>As she came to the Death Chamber, she could hear the whispers from the Veil. They pulled her forwards and almost in a trance she walked up the platform. Harry came to the Veil, closed her eyes and left herself fall through.</p>
<p>What greeted her when she opened her eyes was a white version was King's Cross, it was her version of the crossroads to Death. However, the last time that she had been here she had been seventeen, and she had just let Voldemort kill her.</p>
<p>She looked around to find a man in a black suit sitting on a bench, and he was waving her over. She walked over and sat down next to him.</p>
<p>He was quite unnervingly beautiful with short, messy raven black hair and green eyes that matched her own. Everything was perfect about him, in fact, you could have folded him in half, and both sides would match. The man looked like her more beautiful, healthier twin. Harry would have mistaken him for her father if not for green eyes.</p>
<p>“Hello, Harriett.” The man greeted.</p>
<p>“Hello, Death.” Harry instinctively knowing who he was.</p>
<p>“Well, we are at a bit of an impasse here because normally I would just heal your body then shove your soul back in. In this case that would not work because the Veil completely destroyed your body.” Death said.</p>
<p>“So I’m finally dead.” The relief was palatable in her voice.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>And with that one word her hopes were dashed. Tears of frustration built up in her eyes.</p>
<p>“As you are my Master I cannot take your soul,” he explained “But as you have quite effectively destroyed your body I can’t send you back. So now you have a choice. I will be creating you a new body but where you go from now is up to you. I can send you back to your home reality, or I can send you somewhere new.”</p>
<p>Harry opened her mouth to answer but was cut off when Death raised his hand.</p>
<p>“Before you make your choice know that you will no longer be Human because your new body will be based off my own being and your first ancestors. This is a new experience for me, and I have no idea how this will affect you. Also if you do choose to leave you will be bound by the laws of that reality.”</p>
<p>Harry’s mind turned, but she already knew that she could never go back, so her choice was already made.</p>
<p>“I will go.” Her voice was resolute even if her mind was not. “I can’t go back not after everything that has happened.”</p>
<p>Death gave her a small smile. “Everything changes; you cannot escape nor run from that fact.”</p>
<p>“How can I stay with the people that essential exterminated my kind. The Magi as they call themselves are a pale shadow of the people that we once were. There is simply too much pain for me to stay, and if I were to stay, I would only be hunted.” Harry said with haunted eyes as she remembered the atrocity that had been committed in her 472 years.</p>
<p>“This new world may not be any better.” Death stated.</p>
<p>“But it would be new.”</p>
<p>Death looked into Harry’s matching eyes and found her determination. Then with a smile, he leaned forwards and kissed her forehead.</p>
<p>“My Master I will grant you your wish for a new start, and I will give you a boon. You will find happiness in this new world in the form of soulmates, but your journey will not be easy.”</p>
<p>Harry felt her body warms as Death’s magic started to flow through her body. She felt her soul begin to leave this realm. She threw her arms around Death’s neck and pulled him into a hug.</p>
<p>She smiled as she whispered into his ear. “Love is never easy, and thank you.”</p>
<p>Her body became pure energy as she was transported away to her new life.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Cardiff, 1902</strong>
</p>
<p>However, when she finally opened her eyes, she found herself in a cell and restrained.</p>
<p>Harry could only feel dread as footsteps approached.</p>
