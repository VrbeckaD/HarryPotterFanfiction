    <p>Strangely, the bees seemed to know something was happening before anyone else did. Early that morning, Aunt Tillie had gone to check on the hens when she noticed the furry, fizzing tree branch overhanging the lake. Up close, it was crawling with unsettled bees who had swarmed out of their wooden hive. She fetched her equipment and began to poke around, determined to figure out what the matter was.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in the house, Oliver had gotten up early and, seeing nobody else around, had begun to fry up breakfast. He set out a dish on the porch for the cat and was rather surprised when she didn't immediately present herself. He told Ormerod as much when Ormerod eventually stumped into the kitchen and propped himself up at the table. Ormerod mumbled irritably that wild cats go wherever they like and not to worry about it. Oliver responded by calling him <em>Roddy</em>, so Ormerod threw a spoon at him which missed extravagantly.</p><p>Already the day was bound to be strange because it was the day Sofi would finally be returning from school for the summer. After breakfast of fried eggs and tomatoes, the three of them—Aunt Tillie, Oliver, and Ormerod—piled into the old car for the long drive into town and to the train station. Aunt Tillie, who still hadn't found out what had happened to the bees even after ringing around for advice, was almost distracted enough to finally let Oliver drive when he insisted he was old enough to be allowed to. Ormerod, who preferred being chauferred anyways, was content to judge the resulting row from afar, leaning against the window and watching the landscape roll by. In the distance, heavy clouds were rolling in from the mountains and over the craggy hills, and the morning light had a subdued, green feel about it.</p><p>Sofi met them at the train station, beaming infectiously and dragging her enormous suitcase. Ormerod thought she <em>looked</em> the same as she had when she left nearly a year ago, her many beaded braids still flouncing as she ran, but she <em>showed</em> herself entirely differently. You could tell somehow that she had been away and seen things. She filled them in about some of the things on the ride back—obviously there had been occasional phone calls and letters, but hearing them in person was altogether more interesting.</p><p>"Headmistress de Witt really is a <em>complete</em> fanatic," Sofi gushed. (Aunt Tillie frowned slightly at this.) "Every Friday, she gives long speeches about the school's <em>pastoral duty toward the next generation</em> and she insists that everyone <em>demonstrate proficiency in swimming across the lake</em> because it demands <em>absolute unity of mind, body, and spirit</em>. Oh, and she <em>always</em> wears trouser suits but I don't think I've ever seen her wear the same one twice."</p><p>"Oh, oh, tell us again about the ghost!" Oliver whooped. "You swear it happened?"</p><p>"Yes, absolutely! So one of the other girls in Lycan House was sneaking out every few nights to see her boyfriend. We covered for her, of course. Anyways, one night she comes back absolutely shaken to pieces because her boyfriend turned out to be a <em>ghost</em>, poor thing!" Oliver laughed hugely. "And she broke it off right then! I don't see what the problem was, myself, honestly. He sounded sweet."</p><p>By the time they crunched back up the driveway that afternoon, the clouds had fully amassed over the house, turning the summer sky into a dazzling kaleidoscope of light and shadow. They brought in Sofi's things and the shopping they had picked up in town, then Aunt Tillie let them go free. To Ormerod's relief, they got a reprieve from varnishing the porch that afternoon on account of the unexpected weather. Oliver bounded off, presumably to look for trouble and/or the cat. Sofi waited until Aunt Tillie was busy with the telephone before wheeling on Ormerod. "We're still on, aren't we?" she hissed. Ormerod nodded determinedly.</p><p>"It's been driving me crazy just <em>thinking</em> about it." she added emphatically. "We have to find out who your parents are—this summer. It's just this great big mystery and <em>I have to know</em>. I don't care what Aunt Tillie says."</p><p>It was in this way that Sofi and Ormerod found themselves trekking and tromping through the tall grasses toward the edge of the woods where they believed Ormerod had first emerged some years ago. They had a base of operations there, of a sort. By implicit agreement, they had, over time, explored many of the nearby fields but never too far into the woods proper—certain things went beyond mere bravado. The base itself was marked by a lonely, agreeably mysterious pile of white stones, stacked in a loose pyramid half as tall as Ormerod himself. The stone pile squatted incongruous and ancient at the edge of the woods like an abandoned fort. It had probably sat there undisturbed for thousands of years.</p><p>Well, relatively undisturbed. Last summer, they had pried one of the stones loose, creating a cache where they could store various pieces of evidence relating to Ormerod's family. Based on Ormerod's dreams and admittedly fragmented memories, Sofi had pieced together that Ormerod was secretly a wealthy prince whose parents had sent him away for his safety during a war with a neighboring kindgom. Something had gone wrong—or perhaps they had magicked Ormerod's memory as an extra precaution—and now he needed to find his way back home, or prove himself worthy of the throne, or something similar in order to put things right. Having put together the history, the two of them had moved to assembling clues about Ormerod's lineage and where his kingdom was.</p><p>Opening the cache required the permission of the goddess who, as Sofi had explained, lived in the pile of stones and watched over it. In the usual way, Sofi produced a napkin wrapped around leftover sandwich crusts and laid it reverently on the pile of stones. "O great goddess Din, we have returned to humbly seek your divine succor!" She stepped backwards and began to make flinging gestures toward the pile of stones. Ormerod, somewhat less enthusiastically, made flinging gestures as well. The wind picked up and began whooshing through the boughs of the trees and across their arms and shimmering across the field. "Great goddess Din!" intoned Sofi, encouraged by the response, "we thank you for permitting us to, er, vouchsafe our treasures here and for guiding us on our noble quest. We ever remain your humble followers. Please accept our humble sacrifice of bread. Simply give us a sign if we are worthy." The wind gusted and flailed. Sofi nodded solemnly, at which point Ormerod pried the stone out of the pile, revealing a plastic bag containing their treasures.</p><p>It was a smaller collection than they would have wished for, but they were proud of what they had. Among some of the more exciting odds and ends were a weather-worn lantern they had salvaged from nearby, a glass vial full of what looked superficially like slug slime but had the potential to be much more, and a genuine old-fashioned piece of thick parchment with a warning intended to put them off the search. "Dear Sir," it read (Imagine someone referring to Ormerod as "Sir!") "I assure you that my work is proceeding quite well. I am grateful for your well-intended offers of assistance, but I must insist they are not necessary." There was no signature. The scrap of parchment positively thrummed with possibilities, and made the prospect of a royal plot all the more tangible. Faced with these quest items, Ormerod felt a renewed thrill of excitement. The two of them proceeded to talk and act out various scenarios, determined to shed new light on the mystery. They were so deeply involved in the game that they completely failed to notice how dark the storm clouds had become. More importantly, they very nearly failed to notice the man who was silently watching them from the woods.</p><p>Ormerod saw him first. He gave a great spasming intake of breath and scrambled backwards, clawing at Sofi to make her see. Sofi took one look at the man-shaped thing, grabbed at Ormerod, and the two of them were fleeing back toward the house, feeling evil pounding behind them, knowing how dreadfully far—too far—it was to run. As his lungs burned and his heart throbbed in his throat, all Ormerod could think about was the thing's awful stare. Even at a glance, and even at such an unlikely distance, he had seen its eyes were a shocking golden color.</p>
