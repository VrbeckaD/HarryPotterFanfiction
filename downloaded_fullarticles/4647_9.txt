  <span>“Merlin, I’m so in love with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco scowled up at him. “Can you be in love with me later? Maybe when I’m not being strangled by the curtains?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Being strangled was an exaggeration, he knew, but the curtains, charmed to lengthen and ensnare the next person who walked past them, were tightly wrapped around him. His left leg was bent backwards at a rather uncomfortable angle, and bound to his waist. His right ankle was held higher than the rest of his body, and his arms were tightly bound to his sides.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blaise only snickered at him. “It’s just...it’s so </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” he said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The curtains tugged, dragging Draco closer to the windows, and making him whack his head on the corner of the couch as he went past it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Blaise!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blaise only laughed harder, following him, but still not helping.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Trying to get one over on Potter, and getting your own prank turned around on you. It’s just like the golden years,” Blaise said, a wistful quality to his tone. “Just reminds me how much I love your stupid arse.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you love me, how about you help me?” Draco hissed, struggling again, but unable to do anything more than flop around on the floor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blaise crouched down and cupped his chin, turning his head to face him properly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I told you setting a prank in the common room was a bad idea. You are so lucky that it got you when the room was empty. You know that right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco’s face was burning. The longer Blaise talked, the more chance someone else would come in. He’d been lucky it was Blaise who had entered the room seconds after he’d accidentally triggered it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>If the Gryffindor’s saw this, he’d never live it down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m almost tempted to leave you,” Blaise continued, smirking down at him. “I keep telling you to cut it out with the pranking. You’re just not good at it like they are, you only end up embarrassing yourself when you try to match them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Blaise, I swear to—” Draco was cut off as the curtains tugged him closer to the windows again, and he yelped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What happens when you reach the windows?” Blaise asked curiously, taking a few steps to be beside him again, and looking down at him with more amusement than was appropriate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco wriggled, trying to get an arm free, but only managing to roll himself over onto his front. He made a defeated sound, muffled by the floor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blaise grabbed him by the shoulder, and turned him just enough so that his face wasn’t pressed into the floor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well?” he asked, still smirking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco settled for glaring at him. “It’ll hang me up by my feet. Or foot, as the case may be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That set Blaise off laughing again. Draco grit his teeth. Anyone could walk in, at any moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, Merlin, I do love you,” Blaise wheezed, finally drawing his wand to help. “I really do. You silly, silly twat.”</span>
