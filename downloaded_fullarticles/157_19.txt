          <div class="userstuff"><p>Trapped in a prison of<br/>
harsh words and false family,<br/>
you existed without love;<br/>
aching heart and tired soul,<br/>
no hope and a quiet pain.<br/>
You were old before your time,<br/>
little boy with old man's eyes,<br/>
defeated before you had words.<br/>
Did strangers stare at you?<br/>
(Old soul, tired soul, prisoner's soul.)<br/>
Did they stare at you and wonder?<br/>
Little boys should not wear old men's eyes -<br/>
Did they wonder at your eyes?<br/>
Old and quiet and still -<br/>
Prisons are not always bars;<br/>
sometimes they are cupboards too,<br/>
and a life of being loathed.<br/>
Old eyes and dark cupboard -<br/>
I weep.</p>
<p>Someone offered you hope -<br/>
you grasped it with both hands<br/>
and who could blame you?<br/>
Little boys need dreams, not prisons.<br/>
You flew, all wings and freedom<br/>
- fair and bright and proud -<br/>
and you were glorious.<br/>
You faced down death itself,<br/>
riding on bright hope's wings,<br/>
strong and brave and young -<br/>
Bright wings flashing in a clear sky.<br/>
You were born to fly, little boy,<br/>
you were born of the sky.<br/>
Did strangers stare at you?<br/>
Did they wonder at the light,<br/>
the light that lit your skin,<br/>
the light that blazed in your eyes?<br/>
Did they envy you your wings?<br/>
Wings that no prison could hold<br/>
for no one could match you.<br/>
You were glorious, little boy -<br/>
I weep.</p>
<p>They say you grew too proud.<br/>
They say you flew too high -<br/>
they say you reached the sun.<br/>
No, little boy, you were the sun.<br/>
You were life and love and wings,<br/>
but they couldn't understand that<br/>
and they pulled you down.<br/>
Small-minded and envious,<br/>
they broke your wings and<br/>
they tore you down from the sky;<br/>
You gave them all that you were,<br/>
and they took everything.<br/>
You gave them life and light,<br/>
love and freedom, peace and flight -<br/>
They should have loved you.<br/>
(I loved you, little boy,<br/>
so strong and brave and bright.)<br/>
You were the sun, little boy,<br/>
and you rode the skies,<br/>
but they tore you down,<br/>
they broke your wings,<br/>
they took more than you had.<br/>
They broke your wings, little boy,<br/>
and you fell. You fell.<br/>
Lost in the sea, little boy,<br/>
light gone, wings all gone -<br/>
I weep.</p>
