  <span>A podium was set up, a crowd gathered round, and the spokesperson grabbed the megaphone.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>*</span>
  <em></em>
  <span>Ah-hem!*</span><br/>
  <span>“Listen up, people of the ships! The United Kingdoms of Fandom have just one thing to say to you: </span>
  <span><strong>ACKNOWLEDGE THE SEXUAL TENSION ALREADY</strong>!!!!!!!!<br/></span>
  <span>Thank you. Have a nice day.”</span>
</p>
<p>And the crowd dispersed, and their audience started shouting.</p>
<p>John Watson crossed his arms and glared. “I think you'll find that's just the tabloids trying to drum up a story!”<br/><span>Sherlock smirked. “Need I remind you, I consider myself married to my job.”</span></p>
<p>Harry looked around, bewildered. “Excuse me, I'm married with three children!”<br/><span>Malfoy stormed off to go confront the spokesperson. “How dare you besmirch my noble family name!”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>"You do realize she's my step-grandmother, right?” Emma said sarcastically. <br/></span>
  <span>“I am no- holy </span>
  <em>
    <span>crap</span>
  </em>
  <span>, I am,” Regina said in disbelief. </span>
</p>
<p>Captain Kirk just laughed. “What? Me and that pointy-eared bastard?!”<br/><span>“I'm afraid there are some aspects of humanity I shall never understand,” Spock said, shaking his head. </span></p>
<p>
  <span>Davy blinked. “You must be joking!”</span><br/>
  <span>Peter produced a bottle from nowhere and went to smash it on Mike’s head. </span>
  <span>“The S.S. Mike Nesmith!” he shouted. </span><br/>
  <span>“Gah!” Mike ducked. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>I'm</span>
  </em>
  <span> not a ship, Peter! </span>
  <em>
    <span>We're</span>
  </em>
  <span> the ship! And the whole thing’s ridiculous anyway!”</span><br/>
  <span>“But they said -”<br/></span>
  <span>Micky shook his head. “Isn't that dumb?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah right! You think I’d go for that clodpol?” Merlin scoffed.</span><br/>
  <span>“Excuse me, I happen to be your king!” Arthur said indignantly. <br/></span>
  <span>“Of course, ‘your majesty.’”</span>
</p>
<p>Valkyrie’s jaw dropped. “Ew. Just… ew. He's like four hundred years old! And also a skeleton! Just… ew.”<br/><span>Skulduggery tilted his head. “Your reaction does my self-confidence a world of good, I hope you realize that.”<br/></span><span>“Shut up.”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Aziraphale looked at Crowley in confusion as the demon slowly collapsed to the floor, laughing. “I don't get it. What are we supposed to be doing? Crowley? Why are you laughing?”<br/></span>
  <span>The demon struggled to get his breath back. “Oh, angel,” he gasped. “It's probably better if you don't know.”</span>
