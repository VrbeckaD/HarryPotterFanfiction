    <p>“Come on, Hermione! Live a little!” Ginny was urging her to look at the dirty magazine she’d picked up for their girls’ night. They’d made frozen margaritas, a Muggle drink that Ginny said the wizarding world should definitely adopt.</p>
<p>“Oh, Gin! All those floosie, airheaded girls look at those. I hear they’re even more lewd than the Muggle version because the pictures move!”</p>
<p>“Hermione, you’re 20, you’re gorgeous and smart, and you’ve only been with my soft-headed brother! If you’re not gonna get out there to date, you might as well see what’s out there.”</p>
<p>Hermione rolled her eyes but relented. “Fine, fine, let me see that!” She blushed upon seeing Viktor Krum on the cover of Wicked Wizards. The Bulgarian wasn’t wearing a shirt, only Quidditch shorts and held a quaffle above his head. His muscles bulged as the picture flexed on a loop.</p>
<p>“So you never.... with him?” Ginny pried. Hermione shook her head.</p>
<p>“It was a very innocent crush, Gin.” She sighed a flipped to a random page. A second later, she thought her jaw had dropped clean to the floor.</p>
<p>There, on the centerfold, was Draco Malfoy. Platinum blonde hair sticking out haphazardly like a witch had run her hands through it, lying prone on a luxurious bed covered with silk cushions; he was completely naked besides a thin pair of briefs -- that left little of his package to the imagination -- with a golden snitch embroidered on the crotch.</p>
<p>When she saw the picture move, her mouth went dry. The smirk he was giving the camera was the same one Hermione saw a million times at Hogwarts, except now it was suggestive and lewd. Especially since one of his thumbs pulled the fabric down on the right side of the briefs to reveal his hip bone and the rest of the v-line of the muscle running right down to his… Hermione swallowed with difficulty.</p>
<p>She shifted in her silk pajama shorts but the fabric slid against her skin and gave little friction to the area that was throbbing. Ginny had luckily gone to refill their drinks so she didn’t see Hermione’s inappropriate reaction to her long-time bully cum Death Eater cum Quidditch agent.</p>
<p>While Ginny was still occupied, Hermione found herself admiring his torso. His lean muscles looked like they were carved from white marble except for the silvery scar that was barely visible running diagonally across his chest. Sectumsempra. A shudder ran through her.</p>
<p>Ginny returned and Hermione hastily flipped to another page with text on it. She took a large gulp of the margarita, which seemed to temporarily cool the burning in her veins. Perhaps Ginny was right, perhaps she really did need to get back out there.</p>
<p>“Leave it to you to seek out the articles in a nudy magazine!” Ginny nudged her. Hermione rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Be nice! I was just about to ask you to set me up with someone this week.” Ginny nearly tackled her at that.</p>
<p>“Seriously!? I’ve just got to narrow down my list now….” Hermione ignored her as she tried to flip through the magazine and not land on the page with Malfoy. “Maybe we should just go to a professional Quidditch game?” Ginny suggested, scanning the magazine with all the potential attractive wizards.</p>
<p>“Really, Gin? I mean, you know I’m not the biggest fan of Quidditch.” Ginny laughed.</p>
<p>“Oh come on, ‘Mione! You’re practically drooling over the players.”</p>
<p>“Am not! You are!” Hermione hit her with a pillow and dropped the magazine on the floor.</p>
<p align="center">~~~</p>
<p>Hermione woke up in her bed with a throbbing headache. Too many Muggle margaritas… She turned to her bedside table and saw the Wicked Wizards magazine. Need throbbed through her veins, pulsing through her breasts and down to her core. Just one peek couldn’t hurt.</p>
<p>Opening the centerfold spread, she cast a levitation spell on the magazine so it hovered in front of her face. Hermione felt so naughty and wanton, but since she and Ron had broken up a year ago, she’d thrown herself into working on her pro bono cases: house elves, werewolves, dragons, etc. She hadn’t had a man’s hands on her body in over twelve months, not since Ron had been so rough with her while he was drunk. Not that she’d told Ginny those details, but Hermione pushed that out of her mind.</p>
<p>Every smirk Malfoy gave loosened that knot below her navel, slowly coming undone. Her right hand slipped down into her satin shorts and felt how wet she’d become in a matter of moments. Stifling a moan as her fingers spread the moisture around, rubbing the sensitive bud with delicious intent. Muffliato, she mumbled. Just in case her roommate was awake.</p>
<p>Imagining his chiseled frame pressed against her soft one, her other hand massaged her breasts, sneaking beneath her flimsy camisole and giving each the pleasure it craved. All she wanted right now was those smirking lips, those lips that had hurled insult after insult, to pay homage to her nipples, softly sucking and licking and maybe a little nip here and there.</p>
<p>Hermione moaned, her eyes barely able to stay open to look at the Adonis spread out on the pages. She wanted to strip off those annoyingly tight briefs with the slight bulge and make those sexy, smirking lips groan as she teased his package.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she wished she’d taken Ginny’s advice on buying a vibrator after the break up. Hermione had thought it completely unnecessary, especially since she wasn’t even used to great sex, since Ron thought that rutting her like a pig was enjoyable for her. But what she wouldn’t give for a hard cock to tease her pussy lips open.</p>
<p>Her fingers did just that and then entered one and then two into her dripping pussy. Hermione keened at the sensation, imagining her fingers as his cock, entering her slowly enough to make her want more. Her fingers didn’t reach as far as she thought his cock would, but it would have to do for now. She’d already had a slow build up from the foreplay of seeing all those near-naked men in the magazine, especially him.</p>
<p>Hermione didn’t even care anymore about who he was or had been to her. She thought of him more as an archetype, as some model or celebrity she didn’t really know, a fantasy. Someone she'd never see again. Gasping, she felt herself come completely undone, her pussy gripping her fingers as she picked up her pace and let it all go.</p>
<p>Slumping against the wall, panting, she lowered the magazine back to the table and closed it. Hermione felt both satisfied and hornier than she’d been before. She really hoped the date Ginny was planning for her went well. Perhaps she’d let him take her home on the third date.</p>
<p>Despite her boss’s wishes for a relaxing weekend, Hermione went to the library later that day, Saturday. It was freezing in the draughty building and she swore her nipples could cut glass. Diving into research, she tried to ignore and further suppress her sexual desires.</p>
<p>An hour later, an owl landed on her table. Could she find anywhere that she could avoid disruption? Sighing, she took the note from the bird’s leg. She thought she recognized the owl before it flew off. Who did she know that had a great horned owl?</p>
<p>The envelope was more or less nondescript and she didn’t recognize the seal stamped on the back. It looked like an ‘M’ but didn’t think it was from the Ministry. Her boss couldn’t know that she was at the library. Opening it, she saw a beautiful script, great penmanship even though it was short.</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>I saw what you did this morning - D.M.</em>
</p>
<p>Hermione flushed and looked around. There was no one else in the area of the library. She thought back to her self-care session this morning and the magazine. “Oh Merlin,” she gasped and dropped the note, her hands shaking. ‘D.M’ stood for Draco Malfoy.</p>
<p>She hadn’t for a second thought about the possibility of Malfoy being able to move into the photograph. Hermione had thought it had only applied to portraits, but it did depend on the strength of the wizard and from she’d read in the papers, Malfoy had become quite distinguished in the wizarding world.</p>
<p>What was she supposed to do? It’s not like she was going to seek him out and she didn’t think he would tell anyone… or would he? He’d probably spied on a million witches doing the same thing. Hermione found that prospect disgusting and cringed.</p>
<p>Several hours went by as she ignored the note and even set it on fire to burn the evidence. She’d do the same to the magazine when she got home. Hermione almost broke her favorite quill from the pressure she was applying to it.</p>
<p>As the ink splattered, the same great horned owl flew in with another note. Exasperated, Hermione debated on reading the note. This time the envelope was fancier with gold lettering on the front with her full name -- Malfoy knew her full name?</p>
<p>Hermione opened it and saw it was an invitation of some sort.</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Miss Hermione Jean Granger,</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>You are cordially invited to dine with Mr. Draco Malfoy at Malfoy Manor at six-o’clock this evening. Required dress code: cocktail.</em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>The floo will be open at 17:58.</em>
</p>
<p>This had to be a sick joke, Hermione thought. Same old Malfoy. Then she saw the postscript:</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>P.S. This is not a joke.</em>
</p>
<p>“Oh for the love of Merlin!” she muttered to herself. Hermione couldn’t imagine going to the Malfoy Manor… Not after what had happened during the war. A bolt of fear shot through her. Then she realized she’d had just about every feeling about Draco Malfoy today.</p>
<p>After a few breaths, Hermione had decided to attend. After all, she had to defend her honor and at least he was willing to keep it private. Or so she hoped. She scrawled a note back to Malfoy and sent it with one of the library’s owls.</p>
<p>When she arrived home, she jumped in the shower. While she was drying her hair she remembered the dress code. Only Malfoy would require a dress code in his own home! Hate was another emotion she felt stirring with the others in regards to the former Slytherin.</p>
<p align="center">~~~</p>
<p>“Ginny!” Hermione called from her bedroom. She heard her roommate’s heavy footsteps. “Can you please zip this for me?”</p>
<p>“Merlin’s beard, ‘Mione! You look stunning! What’s the occasion?” Ginny cried as she zipped her up.</p>
<p>“Just a business dinner. There’s a dress code, of course,” Hermione said, trying not to blush. Ginny let out a whistle and winked.</p>
<p>Rolling her eyes, Hermione finished teasing her hair into a loose chignon. She’d just about used every pin she owned to get it to stay intact. Smoothing out her dark purple cocktail dress with the sweetheart neckline and the straps that sat on the edge of her shoulders, Hermione slipped into her highest pumps and headed to the living room.</p>
<p>Hermione was ready with a minute to spare. Taking a handful of floo powder, she was glad that Ginny was in her room, and then she said, “Malfoy Manor.”</p>
<p>“I knew you’d be punctual, Granger,” a voice drawled, the owner hidden from view as she arrived at her destination. She blinked away the ash that threatened to ruin her make up with tears as she stepped out of the fireplace into the grand foyer of Malfoy Manor.</p>
<p>“Your note was very specific on time, Malfoy,” Hermione said, automatically taking Malfoy’s hand that he offered. He wore a black button-down with the sleeves rolled up and slim-cut black slacks. She felt a twinge of shame since the only thing she’d recently seen him in was basically nothing.</p>
<p>She looked up and saw him smirking. Something about this felt odd but right, her hand in his, being lead through the manor as if it were a daily occurrence for him. It most likely was, if the tabloids were correct. As Malfoy steered her around the corner, his grip shifted to her elbow, his thumb creating mesmerising circles in the skin of her arm. Hermione fought the impulse to shiver at the sensation that he didn’t seem aware of creating.</p>
<p>“Ah, here we are,” Malfoy announced, stopping before a lavish dining room with a large table set for two. “I would give you the grand tour now, but I’m afraid dinner is ready for us.”</p>
<p>“Why exactly am I here, Malfoy?” Hermione said as he pushed in her chair as she sat.</p>
<p>“For dinner,” he said snapping his fingers. A salad appeared on her plate and white wine filled her glass. The wine was chilled already and soothed her dry throat.</p>
<p>“What you said in your note…” She saw his eyes flash, pale silver irises darkening to molten steel. “It was so…”</p>
<p>“Erotic?” His lip quirked into a grin.</p>
<p>“Voyeuristic,” she finished, taking a bite of a cucumber. Malfoy hadn’t touched his salad and seemed to prefer watching her. “How can you get away with doing that? Shouldn't there be some kind of law--”</p>
<p>“Calm down, Granger. Why do you think I invited you here?” At that, she stabbed a cherry tomato with her fork and left it there.</p>
<p>It was only natural for Hermione to jump to conclusions via her extended logic. “So this is some kind of bribery for my silence?” Her cheeks flushed as she glared at him. “Dinner in exchange for being a peeping tom?”</p>
<p>“You always manage to really hit the nail on the head, don’t you Granger? Got me all figured out?” Malfoy sneered. “The Ministry is really lucky to have the ‘Brightest Witch of Our Age’ working for them.”</p>
<p>Her eyes narrowed at him, her hand fisting around her fork still stuck in the tomato. “So you wanted me to come here so you could taunt me in person, Malfoy?”</p>
<p>Malfoy flinched at the way she was brandishing the fork with the tomato stuck to the end.</p>
<p>“Calm down, Granger, that’s a fork not a wand.” Hermione rolled her eyes at him and then ate the tomato violently, savoring the crushing of the small fruit between her teeth. He continued, “Why don’t you tell me why you accepted my invitation? Surely that says more about this situation than my invitation does.”</p>
<p>“I came here, Malfoy,” she said his name like a curse. “To make sure that you wouldn’t go spewing what you saw to the presses.”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t that make a wonderful headline: ‘Golden Girl Granger Gets Off’?” he drawled, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>The sound of her chair scraping the marble floor made a hideous sound. She could hear her heels’ clacking echo throughout the great house. Fighting tears, she attempted to make her way back to the floo. Her heels clicked faster when she heard Draco’s dragon leather shoes tapping behind her.</p>
<p>“You don’t know where you’re going, Granger,” Malfoy called smugly.</p>
<p>Hermione turned left, barely able to see through her tears. She couldn’t tell if they were angry or sad tears flowing down her face. However, what she saw as she went through the next doorway made her stop.</p>
<p>“Of course you’d end up here, the library.” Hermione didn’t even dignify him with a response.</p>
<p>This was the biggest library she’d ever seen in her life. Multiple stories and walls and walls of books. Her mouth hung open and her tears dried.</p>
<p>“If only I could get you to look at me like that,” Malfoy commented from the shadows, leaning against one of the ladders. Her eyes darted to him.</p>
<p>“Oh Malfoy, you’ll never be more than a perfect set of abs with a foul mouth to me.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see about that,” he purred and emerged like a wildcat from the shadows, stalking his prey.</p>
<p>Hermione studied him. “Is this why you brought me here?”</p>
<p>“You brought us here, pet. I merely followed,” he shrugged, but his eyes had changed to molten metal once again.</p>
<p>“Seriously, Malfoy.” She crossed her arms.</p>
<p>“Granger, I invited you here because I wanted to have dinner with you.”</p>
<p>“Because I p-pleasured myself to your picture?” Hermione sputtered as he took a step closer.</p>
<p>“No, love. That merely gave me an excuse to invite you. I’ve been thinking a lot about you recently.” Her mouth went dry again. “About why I was so nasty to you in school, why I constantly had to one up you and your little friends.”</p>
<p>“And?” she breathed.</p>
<p>“I was infatuated with you, Granger. It took me so long to realize what those feelings meant. I couldn’t fall for a Muggle-born.” She winced when she thought he was going to say Mudblood. “My parents, being who they were would have never even dreamed of it let alone let it happen. I had to fight all my instincts and went with an emotion that came to me naturally: hate. I hated you because I couldn’t have you. I hated Potter and Weasley because I was jealous that they got to be around you. Hell, I fucked half the pureblood women in Britain to get you out of my system!” Somehow, he’d gotten close enough for her to smell his cologne. It was heady and she felt like she was under a spell.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand… How did you all of the sudden reach this conclusion?” Her brain and heart seemed to be working in tandem, both firing as fast as they could.</p>
<p>“Have you heard of Occlumens therapy, Granger?” Hermione shook her head. “Well, it’s all the rage right now, after the war, especially if you’re as good as an Occlumens as I am.” She shuffled backwards as he inched towards her. “Sometimes you build too many walls, too many compartments when using Occlumency. By the time they released me from Azkaban, I’d pretty much packaged my entire life in neatly arranged boxes. Do you have any idea what kind of toll that can take on a wizard, especially after war and imprisonment?”</p>
<p>Hermione was too overwhelmed to say anything and shook her head.</p>
<p>“I was going insane, Granger. I couldn’t function. So I had help to break open each of those Pandora’s boxes before I ended up in St. Mungo’s.”</p>
<p>“When?” she gasped as she felt the bookshelves at her back. Malfoy towered over her and his eyebrows caved in at her question. “When did you-you open my box?”</p>
<p>“A few weeks ago,” he sighed. “I’d been planning on inviting you over but couldn’t think of how to do it. My therapist said it would only help me come to terms with what I’d done to you. The spying incident was just a perk, really.” Although he finished with his usual arrogant Malfoy attitude, she could see him intensify again.</p>
<p>Hermione could feel his warmth as he was only an inch from being pressed against her, something she’d fantasized about not eight hours ago. She looked into his eyes again. They were swimming with desire.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Sure about what?” Malfoy frowned.</p>
<p>“Sure that you like me? I mean--” He’d brought his pale thumb to her lips to stop her. There was nothing violent about it, simply a light brush of her lips with the pad of his finger. Hermione went a little weak at the knees. He was, after all, one of the most eligible bachelors in Wizarding Britain.</p>
<p>Since the war, he’d filled out, refining some of his sharply angled features -- the ones that earned him the nickname “ferret” from the Gryffindors -- so they were sculpted from the marble tone of his skin. Malfoy still had the same piercing eyes, though. Before, when they’d brimmed with malice, they were like sharpened crystal and cut through her like icicles, but now they were boiled down to pools of liquid mercury that threatened to drown her in desire.</p>
<p>“Can I show you?” he asked, bringing his same hand to cup her jaw as the same thumb continued to brush her bottom lip. She’d completely lost control of her faculties when he’d made his confession. All Hermione could simply do was close her eyes and tilt her head up to him. “I’m going to need verbal confirmation, Granger,” Malfoy clarified but she felt his warm breath on her lips.</p>
<p>“Yes, alright,” she whispered, her eyes still closed. He removed his thumb to stroke her cheek.</p>
<p>Malfoy’s lips pressed gently to hers. It was perhaps the sweetest kiss she’d ever received. Those cruel lips, the ones that had taunted her and used her blood status against her, were showing her what he’d wanted to use them for instead. She leaned into him and kissed him back in an equally soft manner.</p>
<p>She swallowed a small moan of his when she parted her lips for him. He pressed his lean frame against hers so that the bookshelf was digging into her spine. Hermione didn’t care, lost in the sensation of his mouth on hers and his body against hers, and her arms found there way around his neck and his other hand had found her hip.</p>
<p>Malfoy broke the kiss. He was panting and turned away from her. “Malfoy--” she said breathily.</p>
<p>“It’s Draco,” he croaked. “Please call me Draco, Hermione.” Confused, she walked around so she could see him again. In the moonlight filtering in through the library windows, she could see tears marking his porcelain cheekbones.</p>
<p>Hermione smiled at him, bringing her hands to his face, her fingers tracing the tear lines. He put his large hands over hers.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I--” he sputtered.</p>
<p>“Shhh, Draco,” Hermione said and he gave her a watery smile. “How about we finish dinner?”</p>
