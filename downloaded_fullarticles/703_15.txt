    <p>Harry yawned as he stepped from the shower, his longer hair now brushing his shoulders, reaching blindly his hand finally found the towel and pulled it to him drying off with the fluffy fabric. He had learned early that if he didn’t shower before they woke then he would have “help” in the shower. He supposed it wasn’t so bad though, often very enjoyable. Teeth brushed and clothes on he finally left the bathroom hanging the towel on the rack. Walking down the new hall he stretched and listened for the sounds of the others waking. His home had changed over the past months. They had added rooms, a back section and a new porch that wrapped around the whole house. The upstairs rooms were now for Remus and Godric, though Remus only stopped by when work let him. </p>
<p>The council had been very busy as of late. Several nests and packs had been attacked. None being left alive. Nothing left behind but a burned red symbol in the ground, a phoenix stabbed through the heart. An odd symbol but one that held a very striking realization. One of the changes they had done was add more wards. Runes now guarded every entrance, even onto the property. The only ones allowed here were those they knew. Along with those, the basement had been redone to only have two rooms and his potion lab got moved to one of the new rooms added onto the ground floor. A guest room had been added as well, and the kitchen increased in size. The largest change had been his own living space. Having given up his room to Remus he now slept in the basement with Sanguini and Andre with Abasi taking up the second room. </p>
<p>Looking around the living room he felt a little uneasy, the sun had set a while ago but none of the vampires had stirred yet. Looking out the window he noticed the large full moon and smiled, the boys would be out running with Remus tonight. They had moved the whole pack to live in the large farm across the way from him. They kept their own territory and knew of them. Remus kept them in line and had taught them things only an older wolf could. Right on cue the howls began and he chuckled shaking his head. They would be hungry in the morning he should probably make some food for them. It was not uncommon to wake up the next morning after a full moon to a living room full of passed out nude men. The first time it had happened Harry had been so startled he had jinxed them. It took awhile to realize the pack had followed Remus back here and passed out after shifting back. His normal residents had complained for days about the smell after. </p>
<p>Heading to the kitchen he downed his morning potions and started making himself some breakfast. He was hoping they were only late to rise. By the time he had finished up and cleaned the dishes he was starting to get worried. Grabbing his phone he went down the stairs and knocked on the door gently. “Sanguini? Andre?” he slowly opened the door and looked in to find them laying still as death. Just as they normally are when sleeping the day away. Walking up to them he gave Andre’s shoulder a gentle shake. When he didn’t wake he reached over and shook Sanguini next. Nothing, they were cold and still as death. Unwaking. Taking out his wand he casted a few charms and read the readouts. They appeared completely normal. </p>
<p>A soft knock had him looking up and meeting the sweet mint green of Abasi, “Your awake.”</p>
<p>Abasi nodded and slowly pointed to the other two walking closer, “They not?”</p>
<p>Harry shook his head, “No, They aren’t waking up at all. I don’t understand, it's well past sunset now.” </p>
<p>The older vampire came closer and sat on the bed and began to check them over when he caught something, slowly he raised Andre’s shirt to show thick yellow green lines threading up his stomach. “Hep V?”</p>
<p>The wizard touched the thick raised lines, “No, Hep V makes their skin warm. It wouldn’t keep them asleep either. This is something different. Abasi I need you to leave the room and sanitize your hands. Incase it can be spread through contact. We will have to quarantine them.”</p>
<p>They both left the room and Harry sealed and spelled it quickly before they both sanitized their hands were they touched the other vampires. Taking his phone he typed in Eric’s number. He waited not so patiently. Watching Abasi head upstairs to check on Godric as well. A soft click and an annoyed woman’s voice growled at him, “Pam, It’s Harry. I know it's early but we have a situation. I need to speak to Eric.”</p>
<p>Pam sneared, “You always have a situation. Eric is with his little human female. Can it wait?”</p>
<p>Harry looked at Abasi who didn’t look happy, “No… its about Godric.”</p>
<p>Pam didn’t have a chance to say anything there was a commotion and the warm nordic voice sounded, “Harry, What is wrong with Godric.”</p>
<p>The wizard winced, “He and two others of my nest aren’t waking. We checked on them and they have these… raised greenish yellow trails along their body. Almost like Hep-V but different. I don’t know what it is. I have quarantined them all but I need help.”</p>
<p>“I see. This is serious. I am on my way. I will bring a healer I know. She may know something as well.”</p>
<p>A click and Harry groaned turning to Abasi, “Okay, step one. Figure out why it is only infecting them? What has been different the past few days?”</p>
<p>Abasi thought a moment, “Godric was gone, Sanguini had patrol.”</p>
<p>He nodded and started writing it down, “They fed yesterday, you didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I was not hungry.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded and groaned, “Could I have missed something from the donors? I scan for Hep-V but if this is something new then I don’t know what to do.”</p>
<p>Abasi laid his hand gently on his shoulder, “This is not your fault.”</p>
<p>“I know, I am just worried.”</p>
<p>They both began to grab books to start researching about what it could possibly be. Maybe an older disease that was thought to be extinct? He didn’t know. It felt like hours before there was a knock on the door. He stood and quickly went to the door opening it and was a bit startled to see Eric with a small tiny figure that upon closer inspection had odd olive skin and a large nose, she seemed to be old but not so old as to be fragile. “Please come in. We moved them all to the same room to keep the quarantine tighter.”</p>
<p>He let them both in and saw Pam and two others step up and he held up a hand, “Not you three. If this is contagious the less exposure the better. I will not release an epidemic into Eric’s nest as well.” He looked to Eric and sighed with relief when he nodded his consent for them to stay behind and he shut the door, “My name is Hadrian, or Harry if you prefer. This is Abasi he is my khadim,” slipping into the very little arabic he had learned. Abasi prefered to be referred to as that in front of others. </p>
<p>The woman peered at him, “I am Dr. Ludwig. Smart containing the possible contagion. May I see those who are showing symptoms?”</p>
<p>Harry nodded and led her to the basement and lifted his wand and began to remove the runes and wards he had placed up. Once finished, he opened the door and opened it for her and she stepped in after eyeing him suspiciously. </p>
<p>Harry stood at the doorway as the woman poked and prodded each vampire, looking at the odd marks and when she rolled one over she found odd lesions along their back as well. Opening their mouths revealing it was black the fangs looking rotted. The wizard felt awful for them but judging by the care she took they weren't dead. </p>
<p>Dr.Ludwig grumbled to herself here and there before she settled them back down and stepped out of the room, removing her gloves, “It is not contagious unless you drink their blood. This seems to be a variant of Hep-V. One I have not seen before. It seems to be accelerated.”</p>
<p>Harry frowned, “I scan all donors for Hep-V.”</p>
<p>“I said a variant, do clean out your ears. Your magic may not be able to detect this variant.”</p>
<p>Eric did not look happy, “So… they are going to die. All of them?”</p>
<p>Dr.Ludwig shrugged, “No, this variant doesn’t seem lethal. It is rotting them from the inside out. We need Fairy blood. Pure, undiluted fairy blood. From a high fae preferably.” </p>
<p>“Where are we going to find a high fae willing to donate their blood for vampires?” Harry looked at her a bit skeptical. </p>
<p>Eric scoffed, “As if we have to ask. I know were some hang out. I will get the blood.”</p>
<p>Harry grabbed his arm, “Your not going to go killing fairies!”</p>
<p>The vampire turned on him and snarled pinning him to the wall with a sickening thud fangs flashing, “My maker needs fairy blood I WILL get him fairy blood.”</p>
<p>A blur and Eric was sent crashing through the door down the hall and cool arms wrapped about him checking his shoulder and neck. Green eyes glaring down Eric firmly, “لن تؤذيه“ The smooth words coming out, his own long fangs flashing. </p>
<p>The viking warrior dragged himself back up and met the other eye to eye. The hall seemed to get colder and colder as the two stared each other down like feral dogs on a turf war. </p>
<p>A smooth clearing of the throat had them both snarling in the doctor’s direction and she clicked her tongue unamused at the antics, “I require the fae alive Eric. I understand you are upset but the boy is right. Killing the fae over this may start a war, we are already in one if you kindly remember. So bring me a fae back here, alive and preferably unharmed yes?”</p>
<p>The wall of muscle seemed to tense at the implied orders but finally the shoulders relaxed, “Fine, I will be back shortly. Dr. Ludwig you will remain until they are healed. I will pay the fees.” Then just like that he was gone a rush of wind ruffling their hair. </p>
<p>Harry groaned and fell slack against Abasi, “owe… asshole.” He rolled his shoulder painfully, “Does he have to be so rough.”</p>
<p>Dr.Ludwig laughed, “You grabbed an enraged vampire and ordered him around, I'm surprised you are still among the living. Tell me were you raised to be an idiot? Or does it come naturally?”</p>
<p>Harry flushed with embarrassment and grumbled before heading up the stairs, “So there is nothing we can do till we get the fae blood.” </p>
<p>Abasi followed close behind and shook his head, “The donors.”</p>
<p>The wizard nodded and typed another phone number and called up the donor place and began speaking to the owner heading into the kitchen. This was not a good situation to be in. Hopefully the humans would be retired and not killed. It was not their fault. But the fact that they now knew the virus could mutate was not a good thing.</p>
