    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>I was always a bit impressionable. My brothers were all interested in dragons, or government, or pranking, and no matter how they arrived at these pursuits, generally they stuck to it and worked toward it in some way, but my attentions had more… fluctuation.</p>
<p>"I want to be a princess."</p>
<p>"I want to be an archaeologist."</p>
<p>"I want to be in the circus."</p>
<p>"I want to be a sheriff."</p>
<p>"I want to be an international superspy."</p>
<p>"I want to be a crocodile hunter."</p>
<p>"I want to be a private gumshoe, living off my wits, going paycheque to paycheque, so I can clean a little dirt off the streets."</p>
<p>My mum's response to these was usually the same. "Arthur, for the love of Merlin can you stop letting her into your workshop when you've got that blasted muggle thing working."</p>
<p>The others never really bothered with dad's work. A lot of it was sorting through papers and dealing with old wizards who don't know any better than to buy muggle goods in London, but not all of it was like that. He brought home some muggle items from time to time, altering them for wizarding purposes as a sort of private hobby. Usually, it was something like a car, or a rubber duck, but once he brought home a wondrous invention I  couldn't get enough of. He called it a 'telly,' and besides my family, it was my favorite thing in the entire world.</p>
<p>There were so many stories, so many places I'd never be, so much cunning and strength I'd never have. It was a little sad at times, but the joy I felt at watching them get through it at the end made it all worth it.</p>
<p>"I want to be them," was my true wish.</p>
<p>My name is Ginny Weasley, and I wanted to be the people on the telly. I don't think it was just that they were heroes. I liked the stories of Harry Potter and Gilderoy Lockhart, but I never wanted to be them. The people on the telly were different, though, I felt connected to them in a way I can't quite describe. It wasn't just the heroes, either: the villains, side characters, even the damsels in distress, I felt a kinship with. They were real to me, maybe more real than anything else.</p>
<p>Okay, so I'd never told my parents this, but sometimes I felt myself… slipping, like I was going to sleep but my eyes were still open. I would move on automatic, and it'd take someone bumping into me or shouting in my ear to wake me up.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would go to bed and lie awake for hours, and if I wanted to be at all functional in the morning, I had to steal some of mum's dreamless sleep potion. I would slip off to sleep, and wake up somewhere else, on the couch, on the front porch, making breakfast, and I'd tell everyone I wasn't tired.</p>
<p>I was tired. Always.</p>
<p>When everyone had gone off to Hogwarts was the worst of it. Mum paid a lot more attention to me, then, and when I could slip off to dad's workshop and watch the telly was the only time I could get any peace. I'd slip off, and pretend I was sleeping as the colors and sounds washed over me.</p>
<p>Ron didn't arrive on the Express with the students; he came later along with another handful of students. Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom, Draco Malfoy, and Harry Potter.</p>
<p>He called them all his friends, 'yes, mum, including Draco. No, mum, I'm not crazy,' though the ridiculous red and gold hat he wore seemed to suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>Draco, for his part, completely ignored the Weasleys, instead greeting his father and leaving without saying goodbye, but Ron said that was just for his dad's sake. I did get to meet the other's though, and yes, that includes Harry Potter.</p>
<p>He seemed, mouse-ish? It kind of felt like a loud sound would send him skittering under a cabinet, somewhere. He was polite, but not exactly the kind of brave hero stories about him built him up to be.</p>
<p>Neville seemed relieved, above all, like a weight had been lifted off his shoulders. He didn't say much, but that seemed normal for him, so I didn't take offense.</p>
<p>Hermione bugged me, somehow. Nothing she said struck me as particularly unpleasant or even weird, but I just got a feeling when she looked in my eyes like something was crawling up my arm. Gross.</p>
<p>We talked, and met with their parents briefly, and when I felt myself slipping, I pinched myself to stay awake. By the time we finally made it back to the Burrow, my left arm was covered in bruises, but I'd made it through without significantly embarrassing myself.</p>
<p>We only found out later that Luna Lovegood's mother had died that day. She was never really my friend, more my brother's, but it was still so strange to see Luna like that.</p>
<p>She was so… dead. She shambled from room to room like a corpse, eyes misted over with some remembered pain. No light, no laugh, no life was left in her being.</p>
<p>There was talk she wouldn't even get to go to Hogwarts, but her dad nixed that quickly enough. "I can't teach her at home. I don't have Pandora's skill in magic or instruction." He looked over at the despondent girl. "Besides, right now she needs friends. She needs support, more support than I can give her alone."</p>
<p>The funeral was quiet, but thankfully I didn't have any issues during it. I hoped I'd be able to have it somewhat under control by the time I got to Hogwarts, but there was no guarantee.</p>
<p>Ron was trying to get through to Luna, but the girl was still practically comatose. All through Summer, he still could barely get a few words out of her.</p>
<p>The end of Summer, however, brought with it a whole new host of troubles. All of our Defense Against the Dark Arts books were Gilderoy Lockhart, for all years. Yeah. By pure coincidence, I'm sure, the man himself was also at Flourish and Blotts when we arrived with Harry Potter in tow.</p>
<p>Over the Summer, he seemed to have gotten some color back in his face and his walk had evened into a more confident one, but his eyes still had an unsettling dart from side to side, like he expected to be attacked at any moment. Judging by Ron's description of what happened at the end of last year, though, I couldn't really blame him.</p>
<p>Lockhart was dazzling, I think that's the best way to describe him. His clothing was shiny, his movements were sweeping, it was like everything he did screamed 'look at me,' and everyone did. He cast a spell on the crowd without ever waving a wand.</p>
<p>I don't know much of what happened after that, since I couldn't stop myself from slipping and losing an hour to that strange half-sleep, but when I woke up, I had all my books so I guessed I hadn't missed much.</p>
<p>I didn't even notice until I was packing my trunk for Hogwarts that an extra book was slipped in. It was probably a mistake, but I wasn't about to report it to my mother. She'd insist we take it back, and I wasn't about to give up a free… diary? Well, whatever it was, I wasn't about to give up a free anything.</p>
<p>When I got back to my room, I opened the book and wetted a quill with ink, scrawling the first thing that came into my head in my messy, swirly, handwriting. 'Dear diary,' I'd seen people do that on the telly all the time. 'My name is Ginevra Weasley, but everyone calls me Ginny, except mum when she's really mad at me.' My quill stilled before I finally wrote another line. 'I don't have any friends.'</p>
<p>I bit my lip, looking at the line before hurriedly crossing it out. That's way too depressing.</p>
<p>The ink began to fade as my face morphed into a scowl. "Fred, George, did you switch my ink with the disappearing kind again?" I yelled down the stairs, but got two negative replies. I was about to pursue my inquiries further, but a smattering of ink left on the page caught my eye.</p>
<p>'Hello, Ginevra,' it read, 'my name is Tom.'</p>
<p>I read it once, then again, and a third time. Carefully, I retook my chair and wrote a response. 'Hello, Tom. Is this diary yours?' Was this like a muggle telephone, and he had another diary somewhere?</p>
<p>'In a manner of speaking…' he replied a few moments after my writing had once again disappeared. 'You could say this is something like my home.'</p>
<p>My eyebrows furrowed. 'You live inside a diary?'</p>
<p>'More or less,' he answered, enigmatically. 'What about you?'</p>
<p>I looked around my room, at the discarded laundry and various knick-knacks I had gotten as christmas presents over the years. 'I live in a house,' I began, not quite sure what to say now that I knew I was actually talking to someone. 'It's called the Burrow.'</p>
<p>'Do you like it?' He asked, his neat script slowly crawling across the page.</p>
<p>I shrugged even though I knew he couldn't see it. 'It's alright, I guess. We're kind of in the middle of nowhere. The only family close by only has one kid and even though she's a girl my age, she's friends with my brother.'</p>
<p>'Do you want to be her friend?' He asked, and I sighed thinking about it.</p>
<p>'She's kind of weird, but I'm not exactly swimming in choices. At this point, I'd want anyone to be my friend.' I scrunched up my nose, wondering if this might give him the wrong idea, so I hastily added, 'but I'm going to Hogwarts soon, so I'm bound to find someone to be friends with there.'</p>
<p>It took a minute before he responded, but finally his writing reappeared. 'I went to Hogwarts, you know.'</p>
<p>'Before you went to live in a book?' I asked, my eyebrows furrowed. 'Who'd want to live in a book, anyway?'</p>
<p>'There are worse places to live than a book, believe me,' and as far as comebacks went, that one was pretty ironclad. 'You think you'll make friends at Hogwarts?'</p>
<p>The way he asked it made me bite my lip as I wrote back. 'I thought so, why? Do you think I won't?'</p>
<p>'I think you're interesting and clever,' I blushed, 'but Hogwarts isn't always kind to the interesting and clever. I'm sure someone as smart as you can recognize that.'</p>
<p>Telly programs flitted through my head as I realized he was absolutely right. Hogwarts was a school, and I was a friendless loser. I'd seen the scenario play out dozens and dozens of times, and unless I traveled back in time to convince my father to stand up for himself or had a similar kind of life altering adventure, I'd be stuck in a sort of purgatory of knocked over book bags and pig's blood at prom.</p>
<p>"No. No. No. No. No." I mumbled to myself over and over as the horror of my situation dawned on me.</p>
<p>'You do have something that I didn't have when I went, though,' he wrote, and I clung to his words like a mast in a storm. 'You have me.'</p>
<p>Shakily, I penned out the word, 'you?'</p>
<p>'I know spells that can dazzle the coldest of Hogwarts students, I know secrets of the castle most wouldn't be able to find in a thousand years. I know how to make sure you'll never be mocked or bullied, no matter where you live or what your bloodline might be.' He paused, and I felt my breath catch at his final line. 'I can teach you.'</p>
<p>A tiny, niggling, thought wormed its way through the back of my mind. 'Why me? What do you want in return?'</p>
<p>'Do you believe in fate, Ginevra?' He asked, and I shrugged because I never gave it much thought.</p>
<p>'Like divination? I guess...' I answered, unsure.</p>
<p>'No one has written to me in decades, and suddenly I find myself conversing with an intelligent wizard of the perfect age to teach,' he wrote and I blushed again at the compliment. 'I believe that is fate. That I am destined to teach you, and you destined to become the greatest wizard in Hogwarts.'</p>
<p>'You think I could become the greatest wizard in Hogwarts?' I wrote, sitting back in my chair and imagining the possibilities.</p>
<p>'I think, given time, you could achieve that on your own. My offer is only to save some time and discomfort of being mistreated in the early years.' He paused again, considering, 'and besides, teaching has been my dream for some time now. I just never expected to find such a perfect student.'</p>
<p>I guessed if he said it like that, it really sounded like it would benefit us both. Who else would he talk to when I had the book, anyway?</p>
<p>'Well, I guess if it's fate…' I penned down, grinning. 'Teaching me sounds like a brilliant idea.'</p>
<p>Tom agreed.</p>
<p>So he taught me. He taught me how to move my wand in just such a way to get the most power. He taught me things on what magic is and how it's woven into spells I'd never have been able to find in a thousand years of searching. He taught me what people want, and how to make any friend I wanted.</p>
<p>But as time went on, I found my desire for friendship sated, somewhat. In between our lessons, I would tell him about me, my family, my life, my fears, and he would listen to me. Finally, I felt like someone was listening to what I said like I listened to those people on the telly.</p>
<p>It was nice.</p>
<p>It was a lie.</p>
<p>I had insomnia, getting more tired the more I spoke and trained with him was far too easy to miss. As he went from simply writing to me, to inviting me inside the book and the odd grayscale version of Hogwarts, I took it simply as the advancement of the training from theory to practice. When I felt my muscles ache and twinge as he drew power from me, I thought I was just exhausted from drills and exercises.</p>
<p>I think, at some point, my mind became fragile. I don't know when, in the teaching, or if it was even Tom's fault at all. Maybe too much time in front of the Telly had rotted away a part of my brain I needed, or maybe I was always like that, and all the slipping and connection to the people on the telly were symptoms of that. I don't know, maybe I just caught some of the madness of the Lovegood house nearby. No matter what caused it, it was there. It felt like my head was held together by little bits of string, and every time I turned, it shifted a little more out of place.</p>
<p>I don't think it would have taken much to disturb it, but Tom never did anything by halves. As I stepped onto the Hogwarts Express and found an empty compartment, Tom wriggled his way into my mind. I suppose it was a test, to see how simple possessing me would be, or how powerful he'd become. I'm not sure how powerful he was, but possessing me suddenly grew more complicated.</p>
<p>My mind shattered.</p>
