    <p>Chapter One: Diagon Alley<br/>With a small pop, Severus Apparated in a small alley near South Williams Street in Dublin, Ireland. Thankful that the trek would not be a long one, he strode up the street, looking for number 28. He was dressed in Muggle attire for the occasion—black trousers, black, plain button-up shirt, black leather jacket, and black boots. He looked very professional, and like a Muggle businessman, in his humble opinion, which was exactly his aim—to blend in.<br/>Spotting number 28, Severus peered at the house. The yard was very well kept. Flowers sat neatly inside large pots, lining the edges of the step leading up to the front door. Severus climbed the single step, and knocked briskly. A few moments passed, in which Severus tapped his foot impatiently, before the door opened to a middle-aged woman.<br/>"May I help you?" she asked, voice thick with an Irish brogue.<br/>"Severus Snape," Severus said, feeling it best to cut to the chase quickly. "Albus Dumbledore spoke with you yesterday, informing you of my arrival."<br/>"Oh yes!" the woman exclaimed, beaming. "Come right in. I will get my husband, Rowan, and Haley. My name is Miranda, by the way." She stepped back and allowed Severus to enter. She led the way and pointed Severus into a living room, before disappearing down a hallway off to the side.<br/>Severus peered around at the room he was led into. Two chairs sat next to the fireplace. Running parallel to the chairs, sat a plush couch. On either end of the couch, sat elegantly carved end tables. Off to the side, and down some steps, Severus spotted a polished baby grand piano.<br/>Severus took a seat on the chair closest to the fireplace, and continued surveying the room. The walls were lined with various pictures, accompanied with captions. The most prominent picture was of a little girl that looked like Miranda. She was seated on the couch, holding a puppy, who was squirming in her arms. She had a large grin on her face. The caption read "Amelia's eighth Christmas." Another picture was of the same little girl, now older, surrounded by piles of presents. In her hands, she held up a large box, which showed a dollhouse on the front. This caption read "Amelia's tenth birthday." Severus scanned the remaining pictures. All were of Amelia. He saw no other child in the pictures on the wall. Perhaps the Kent girl was camera shy.<br/>Severus' attention was drawn away from the pictures, as Miranda returned, followed by a tall man, and Trailing behind him, a little girl, whom Severus assumed to be Miss Kent.<br/>"Rowan Davis," the man said, stepping forward and extending his hand. Severus, not one for shaking hands, begrudgingly shook. "And this is Haley."<br/>Haley smiled. "Hello." she said, seeming unsure about where to look.<br/>Severus figured speaking would be a good idea. "Good afternoon, Miss Kent. My name is Professor Severus Snape. I am the Potions master at the school my colleague, Minerva McGonagall, spoke to you about yesterday."<br/>Haley nodded, finally looking towards Severus.<br/>"We were very surprised when she came," Rowan said. "I asked her to show Haley some magic. She wasn't entirely sure what she should do, since she can't see her, but she asked Haley to put her hand on her shoulder. She did, and the professor turned into a cat.?"<br/>"Can you do that, sir?" Haley asked, almost hesitantly, Severus noticed.<br/>Severus looked at the very excited child before him. This was going to be a long day. Good on her for using her manners though, He would give her that much.<br/>"I cannot turn into a cat, however, I can do magic, much like Professor McGonagall."<br/>"Can you show me something?" Haley asked, eyes glittering with excitement. "Please, Professor? It's all very new to me. If it's too much trouble though, I understand."<br/>Severus looked at the child before him. She was small for her age. She looked rather thin too, as Severus noted. She had beautiful chocolate brown eyes, and red hair that reminded Severus of one Lily Evans. The pure childish excitement on her face, combined with that red hair helped Severus to make up his mind, albeit begrudgingly.<br/>"Very well, Miss Kent," he said with a sigh. "Sit down."<br/>Severus watched the child move slowly, unsure of where to sit.<br/>"There's the other chair beside Professor Snape," Miranda said.<br/>Severus spared a glance at the Davis couple. Rowan sat, watching Haley, arms resting lazily at his sides. He was a tall, burley man with a rounded belly, and long beard. His wife, who sat next to him, was shorter, but also looked well fed. Severus tried, and failed, not to let that information sink in, as he returned his attention to the girl. He racked his brains, trying to figure out what to show a blind girl. What could he do that she could touch? Suddenly, inspiration hit.<br/>Severus flicked his wand at a stray napkin that sat on one of the end tables, summoning it to his hand, drawing curious looks from the Davises.<br/>"Hold out your hand," Severus said. When Haley obliged, he placed the napkin into her hand. With a flick of his wand, he transfigured the napkin into a soft, fluffy blanket.<br/>"Whoa," Haley breathed. She proffered the blanket out to Severus, who shook his head.<br/>"I have no use for a blanket," he said.<br/>Haley looked uncertain about taking the blanket. She looked to Severus, blanket still held out.<br/>"You should keep it," Rowan said. "It's nice. It looks like it will keep you warm and will last long."<br/>Haley looked to her uncle, before nodding slightly, and bringing the blanket back to her.<br/>"Um, Professor," again, Haley seemed hesitant to ask the question, "what color is it?"<br/>"It is an emerald green," Severus said. The same color as Lily Evan's eyes. He hadn't meant to make the blanket green, but he couldn't take it back now.<br/>"Thank you, Professor," Haley said, smiling. "I will put this in my room."<br/>Severus nodded, uncomfortable by the thanks. Not many people thanked him. And meant it.<br/>"Very well," he said, "return with the necessary items to travel. I will be escorting you to retrieve your books and other supplies."<br/>Haley nodded and rose from her seat. She walked past Severus and turned left before disappearing into the hallway she had come from.<br/>Miranda cleared her throat, bringing Severus' attention back to the Muggles to his left.<br/>"We cannot pay for Haley's equipment," she said. "We don't have a lot of money."<br/>Severus raised his eyebrows, looking around at the expensive furniture, and the piano on the other side of the room. Clearly, they could afford these luxuries, so why couldn't they afford Haley's things? Was everything donated to them? Were they really that poor? He highly doubted it, but didn't feel like pulling his hair out to argue with Muggles.<br/>"There are funds set aside for students who cannot afford to pay for the necessary items," he said, irritated.<br/>"Thank God," Miranda breathed looking relieved. "I wish we could afford it, but we don't have that kind of money."<br/>Again, Severus highly doubted that statement, but said nothing. He rose from his seat as he heard Haley returning. He didn't feel like spending more time with these Muggles more than he had to.<br/>"Ready, Professor."<br/>Haley stood there, holding an old-looking, battered, dirty white cane in her right hand. Her hair was pulled back into a low ponytail, and was sporting an old, grey coat that looked as if it had seen far better days.<br/>Severus took all of this in in a flash, his anger and irritation rising further. However, unless Haley herself said something was wrong, or unless there was very strong, sufficient evidence, nothing could be done. So far, all he knew was the family was refusing to pay for her supplies, and her things were old. Unfortunately, those weren't exactly crimes in the eyes of the Ministry.<br/>"Have fun," Rowan said, standing, and giving Haley a hug and a kiss on the forehead.<br/>"Be good," Miranda said, standing and hugging Haley briefly.<br/>"Very well," Severus said, moving towards Haley. "Your hand, Miss Kent."<br/>Haley stretched out her hand, and Severus took the much smaller hand into his own larger one. He walked with Haley to the now open door, courtesy of Miranda, and down the lone step. Turning left, he headed to the alley he had Apparated into. When he reached the spot, he stopped.<br/>"Hold tight to my hand, and do not let go, unless you wish to experience severe pain," Severus said seriously. Haley looked up at him, uncertain, but did as she was told. Once he was sure she was holding tight to his hand, Severus spun on his heel, and with a soft pop, disappeared.<br/>The two reappeared near the entrance to Diagon Alley. Severus looked down at the now pale girl and rummaged in his pocket.<br/>"Drink this. It will help."<br/>Letting go of Severus' hand, Haley took the vial, but struggled to uncork it. Severus relieved her of the vial, uncorked it, then handed it back to Haley, who looked sheepish, as she downed the potion. She made a face.<br/>"Better," she muttered. "Professor, what was that?"<br/>"What you just experienced was called Apparition," Severus explained. "Witches and wizards use it as a means of getting from one place to another. Most prefer to use other methods, as it can be very uncomfortable, and cause nausea, as you just experienced. What I just gave you, however, is an anti-nausea potion to counteract the effects of said nausea."<br/>Haley shuddered, but said nothing more on the subject, simply handing the vial back to Severus, who pocket it.<br/>"Where are we, sir?"<br/>"We are currently standing in the middle of Diagon Alley. It is a shopping center, lined with shops on either side. Here is where we will acquire your books, robes, wand and other items."<br/>"But I haven't got any money, sir." Haley said, clearly saddened by this fact.<br/>"There is a school fund available for students in your same predicament," Severus said, scowling at some witches and wizards who were staring at him, mouths agape. "Now," he said, once the witches and wizards had backed off. "We will be going to Madam Malkin's to purchase your robes, cloak, and gloves."<br/>Haley looked as if she wanted to speak, but said nothing.<br/>"Speak, if you have a question, Miss Kent. I cannot read your mind." Severus mentally snorted to himself. He could, but wouldn't.<br/>"Um," Haley hesitated. "What are robes? Are they like Muggle robes? Where they tie in front?"<br/>Severus mentally cursed Albus for making him do this. Not only did he have to take this girl to Diagon Alley, but he had to explain to her what everything was. Something better be in it for him when he returned, he thought.<br/>"I will take you to Madam Malkin's, and she will show you," Severus said. "Your hand."<br/>Haley reached out and Severus took her hand, and they were off. Once they reached Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions, Severus stepped inside.<br/>"Ah, Severus!" Madam Malkin exclaimed upon seeing the Potions master. "Here for some new robes?"<br/>Severus shook his head. "Not I, Madam." He gestured with his free hand to Haley.<br/>"Ah," Madam Malkin said. "Hello there, dear, my name is Madam Malkin. Who might you be?"<br/>Haley peered up at the woman and smiled slightly. "Haley Kent, ma'am," she said.<br/>"Pleased to meet you, dearie," Madam Malkins said. "Shall we get you fitted for your robes?"<br/>Haley nodded, and Severus released her hand.<br/>"Follow me," Madam Malkin said, starting to walk off.<br/>Haley looked around, then stepped forward, extending her white cane in front of her. Severus stepped back and looked on, as she hesitantly followed Madam Malkin.<br/>"This way, dear," Madam Malkin said, when Haley had paused at an intersection, looking around as if searching for the witch, unsure of where to go. Madam Malkin stared at Haley for a moment, before comprehension dawned on her face.<br/>"My apologies, dear," she said, stepping forward, "I did not know you could not see me."<br/>"It's okay," Haley replied, embarrassedly. "I'm used to it."<br/>"Can you see me at all?" Madam Malkins asked.<br/>"I can see light," Haley said.<br/>"Is that it?"<br/>Haley shook her head. "Outlines, shapes, and movement."<br/>Well, this was news to Severus. Apparently, the girl had some vision after all. That might aid her in her studies. He would have to speak with Albus when he returned.<br/>Madam Malkin walked off with Haley, giving Severus a questioning, disbelieving look. His responding expression advised her to keep her mouth shut, and so she did.<br/>"Oh! Professor Snape, is that you?"<br/>Severus turned to see Molly Weasley striding in, clutching the hand of her youngest daughter, Ginny.<br/>"Molly." Severus inclined his head to the older witch. "I am escorting a student to Diagon Alley to retrieve her supplies."<br/>"You?" Molly asked. "Forgive me for prying, Professor, but you don't seem like the type of person who would be willing to do that."<br/>Severus sighed. "I'm not," he stated matter-of-factly, "but Albus, on the other hand, feels that I am."<br/>"Ah, I see," Molly said, giving Severus a pitying look. "Well, good luck, Professor. Ginny and I are off to get Arthur another set of work robes."<br/>Severus nodded, as the two witches scampered off. Oh, he knew Molly's kids would hear about this encounter soon. Once they did, it would not be long before everyone in the entire school new. For the second time that day, Severus cursed Albus Dumbledore.<br/>Five minutes later, Madam Malkin returned with Haley, who was clutching her new robes in her cane arm, her now folded cane dangling from a strap on her wrist. Severus handed over the money, then took Haley's hand. Surely, there was a better way to guide the child? Perhaps not. Not in Diagon Alley, where it was crowded beyond belief and she would easily get lost.<br/>"Hand me your robes," Severus said. "I am sure you would like to be able to use your cane."<br/>Haley nodded, handing over her robes. Severus took them, and placed them into a bag. A few flicks of his wand, and the bag became expandable and lightweight. This meant that the bag could hold a lot, and could easily be carried.<br/>"now we must purchase your cloak," Severus said, turning to the selection of cloaks. He chose the standard, paid, then put the cloak in the bag. He did the same with the dragon hide gloves, handing each item to Haley so she could feel it, before placing in into the bag.<br/>"Where are we going next?" Haley asked.<br/>"To Flourish and Blotts to get your school books."<br/>"School books?" Haley asked, as they exited Madam Malkin's and headed towards Flourish and Blotts. "How will I read, sir? I read Braille. Um, do you know what Braille is, sir?"<br/>"Vaguely," Severus replied. "I believe it is what blind people read, but that is the extent of my knowledge on the subject."<br/>Haley nodded. "Yes," she said. "Each braille dot forms a letter or sign, and they create words and sentences. It's a bit hard to explain."<br/>Severus nodded. "indeed, it is. And how do you write currently?"<br/>"I use a Brailler," Haley explained.<br/>"And what is that?"<br/>Haley paused for a moment. "It's a metal device you feed paper into. Once it's locked in, you use the keys to write the Braille. It can be loud though."<br/>"No electronics are allowed at Hogwarts," Severus said. "Magic interferes with them."<br/>"it's not electronic," Haley said. "Just loud. And heavy."<br/>"Bring it with you," Severus said. "We will see if anything can be done to allow you to continue to use what you are most accustom to using. It will not do you any good to start you fresh on writing, if you have never written in your life. We will have a way for you to read and write by the time you begin your classes."<br/>"Okay," Haley said.<br/>The two soon reached Flourish and Blotts. Severus spoke briefly to the proprietor of the shop, before they walked out five minutes later, the books now inside the magical bag. Next, they made their way to the Apothecary to gather the supplies that Haley would need for her first year of Potions.<br/>"Professor?" Haley asked. "What supplies do I need?"<br/>Severus was only too happy to answer the Potions question. "You will need a pewter cauldron, brass scales, and glass or crystal vials."<br/>"Scales?" Haley looked uneasy. "I won't be able to read the scales, Professor."<br/>"That will be taken care of by the time you arrive, Severus said, as they left the shop.<br/>"How?"<br/>"I don't know," Severus said honestly. "but I will see to it myself that you will have the necessary accommodations made. I do teach Potions, as I explained earlier. As such, you will need a level playing field, if you do at all attempt to succeed in my class."<br/>"Potions sounds interesting," Haley said, as they continued walking. "What can you do with them?"<br/>Severus began to delve into the many uses of potions as they walked along. He didn't even bother to glare at the many students and their families, who stopped to stare at him. So engrossed was in the conversation, that he almost forgot where they were heading.<br/>"… here we are, Ollivanders. To purchase your wand."<br/>"my wand?" Haley asked.<br/>"What did you expect to do magic with?" Severus asked. "A finger?"<br/>Haley shook her head as they entered the small, quiet shop. A few moments passed before Mr. Ollivander himself stepped out of the shadows. "Ah," he said. "Another first year. With"—he blinked rapidly—"Severus Snape?"<br/>Severus merely nodded to him.<br/>"I still remember the wand you bought many years ago with Miss Lily Evans."<br/>"Wonderful," Severus said sarcastically. "I am not your customer, Ollivander."<br/>Mr. Ollivander's eyes drifted to Haley. He stared at her cane, then at Haley herself. He raised an eyebrow, then looked confusedly to Severus, who scowled.<br/>"Focus, old man," Severus snapped. "I do not have time to stand here, watching you gawk and gape at a blind girl. Get on with it."<br/>Mr. Ollivander blinked, then looked back to Haley, mouthing the word "blind". "I apologize," he said. "However, you must understand that it is not every day that a … blind student walks in to my shop, intent on attending Hogwarts. Extraordinary indeed."<br/>Haley looked uncomfortable at this statement. She looked to Severus, before returning her gaze to Mr. Ollivander.<br/>"Now," the wandmaker said. "Let us get started on matching you with your wand. Which is your wand hand?"<br/>Haley looked uncertain.<br/>"The hand you use most," Mr. Ollivander clarified.<br/>"My right," Haley said, moving her cane to her left arm.<br/>Mr. Ollivander pulled a long tape measurer from his pocket and moved around the shop, collecting boxes. The tape measurer began measuring Haley of its own accord, before Mr. Ollivander snapped his fingers and it stopped, crumpling to the ground.<br/>"Try this one," Mr. Ollivander said, handing a box to Haley.<br/>Haley opened the box and drew out a wand.<br/>"Wave it about," Mr. Ollivander instructed, eyes full of curious delight.<br/>Haley did as she was told, and the shelf behind her exploded. She jumped at the noise, and quickly stuck the wand back into the box, apologizing profusely to the elderly wandmaker for breaking his things.<br/>"Not to worry," Mr. Ollivander said. "Things can be repaired. Try this one."<br/>Haley tried. And tried. And tried. Finally, Ollivander handed Haley an older box.<br/>"it is not a common combination," he explained, "but I wonder…"<br/>Haley took the wand and waved it about. Almost instantly, green sparks shot from the end of the wand, illuminating Mr. Ollivander's excited features.<br/>"Brilliant!" he exclaimed, clapping his hands together. "Absolutely brilliant! Looks like Hogwarts can be expecting a very talented witch indeed. Willow and phoenix feather. Fifteen and a half inches. Very flexible. A very rare and unique combination."<br/>"Why?" Haley asked.<br/>"Willow is particularly picky about who it chooses to bond with," Mr. Ollivander explained, taking the wand from Haley and packing it up. "The phoenix feather core is also unique for such a wand. The phoenix itself is a very stubborn bird. However, once it finds a loyal companion, it will be loyal to no end. I do expect to hear about how this wand fairs you. I must admit, I am very curious, what with you not being able to see and all."<br/>Haley shuffled her feet, took the bag from Mr. Ollivander, and offered the bag to Severus.<br/>"Hold it," he told her. "That is your wand, and you will do well to remember to keep it on your person at all times."<br/>Haley nodded and waved to Mr. Ollivander, who smiled and waved back, before forgetting she couldn't see him.<br/>"Farewell," he called. "Do keep in touch, won't you?"<br/>"I will," Haley called.<br/>Mr. Ollivander watched the pair go before turning to fix the mess that had been made by his most intriguing customer. </p><p> </p><p> </p>
