    <p>Â To be honest, I felt so inspired to write this out and start fresh in the summer, all in one sitting!</p><p>(Like, literally woke up 2 hours ago, read the fic that inspired me, and decided to write.)</p><p>However, it is absolutely a bitch to write on mobile. I will come back soon with the first chapter. To be less confused, any chapters that just has my updates will be labeled as such so y'all can skip without destroying your flow of reading. :)</p>
