    <p>To some, it's called a Soul Mark while others see it as a kind of soul tattoo. The image pointing a person toward their other half. Others see it more as an ever-detailing picture of a person that is too good to be true. However, regardless of belief in the soul mark or how the rest of the world sees them: a villain, hero, alien, werewolf, women, men everyone has one in the end.</p><p>The placing of the image is different for everyone forming near a shoulder blade, curving along a hip, running down or up or across the back, over the stomach (hits the growing popularity in the use of title "Soul Tattoo").</p><p>The ledged of the soul marker is that from the day it appears the details grow more intricate the closer two intendeds get to meeting their other half.</p><p>Most think it's crazy letting some "Magical" drawing point them to a total stranger yet they are the same ones that are alright with there being two kinds of people in the world as well.</p><p>The "Choicer"s and the "Crosser"s</p><p>Those that have to wait for their marks until they reach their teenage years or even adulthood are often referred to as "Choicer"s. This because it was just assumed that those were the one's fate hadn't gotten around to yet while the kinder souls proposed the idea that those without markers just meant that fate just hadn't worked out exactly how to get the intended couple together yet.</p><p>Thus, a choice has to be made by one or the other of the unmarked paring that sets them on the path to finding their other half.</p><p>Those who are lucky enough to have a soul mark appear as soon as they come of age are known as "Crosser"s seeing as the universe has already planned out how they will be finding their other half just like the star-crossed lovers of the olden age just know when they found 'the one'.</p>
