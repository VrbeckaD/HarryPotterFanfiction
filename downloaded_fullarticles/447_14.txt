    <p>
  <span>Parallel universes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everybody knows about them. Some believe, some don't. Some just couldn't care less.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>You see, there lives a girl. An exceptionally ordinary girl, with an exceptionally ordinary life. Nothing even remotely interesting ever happens to her. She just sits in her house, watching tv or reading a book. Anything to pass the time. She goes to work at her boring job and comes home to her boring house. Only to do it all over again tomorrow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She dreams of something fun, some exciting adventure. Unlike the Holmes boy, she believes. She believes in parallel universes, she believes in aliens and supernatural beings, she believes in heroes and villains.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She goes to bed at night and dreams of impossible things, travelling through space and time with the Doctor, solving crimes with Sherlock or hunting things with the Winchesters and their angel friend. Sometimes she hangs out with the Marauders, sometimes the Avengers. Onetime she spent time with the Mystic falls, gang. All in her dreams of course. Because there is absolutely no way any of that could actually happen, no matter how much she wished it could.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her day starts the same as any other. She wakes up around 7 am, has her breakfast and watches some tv for ten minutes before going to work. When she comes home she does the usual routine, changing clothes and starting to cook her dinner, which she then sits and eats whilst watching the tv.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She rests comfortably on the couch, her eyes stuck on the tv, watching Sherlock and John chase after a murderer. She lifts her fork, eyes so focused on the show that she doesn't realise all the food has fallen off of her fork and onto her lap. She looks down, putting the fork back onto the half-empty plate and picks up a small pile of mashed potatoes that had landed in her lap. She puts the potatoes back on her plate and goes back to eating. A small, Fluffy black cat jumps up onto the sofa, meowing softly. The cat hits the girl in the arm with its paw, still meowing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Stop meowing, Pur'trude, I'm not giving you any." She says, moving the plate away from the cat. The cat meows louder and hits the girl harder than before. Digging its claws into her leg at the same time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Dude Ow!" She lifts the cat's paw and carefully moves it away from her, she picks up her plate and puts it onto the glass coffee table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"How about, I get you some of the leftover chicken that's in the fridge and you let me eat in peace." The cat meows happily and jumps off of the sofa, running into the kitchen. The girl follows behind her cat and opens the fridge door. She pulls out the chicken and tears off a couple of small pieces to feed to Pur'trude.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Sometimes I swear you do this on purpose." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She crouches down and holds out a piece of the chicken, the cat grabs it as quick as she possibly can, nipping a bit of the girl's finger in the process, before looking expectantly at the girl again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That hurt." She says, inspecting her finger. The cat bops its head against her hand and she hands it the last bit of chicken before standing up and walking back into the living room. The cat wondering off to do her own thing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sits back down on her sofa, turning on her tv and picking up her plate, only to find out that her food had gone cold. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She groans, putting her plate back onto the table, she lays back on the sofa, throwing her legs up onto the sofa and laying the length of it. She grabs the tv remote and presses play, continuing with the episode she's on. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With her head resting on the arm of the sofa, a fluffy blanket wrapped around her, and one of her favourite shows on tv. She falls asleep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hours later, she wakes up. Still on a sofa, still in a living room. Only it's not </span>
  <em>
    <span>her </span>
  </em>
  <span>living room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The walls are painted black, with pastel-coloured decorations scattered around the place. A tv is mounted on the wall in front of her and next to it stand two tall bookshelves filled with all kinds of books and DVDs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pushes herself up, sitting on the sofa instead of laying on it. Her hands squeak against the black leather and she swings her legs around, putting her bare feet onto the cold hardwood floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay, well this isn't my house." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stands up, seeing a pastel blue blanket fall off of the sofa. Slowly she walks around the living room, trying to make as little noise as possible. She walks down a hallway, opening one of the doors, then closing it when she notices its a bathroom. Turning to her left, she opens a different door, seeing a bed, wardrobe and a desk. Several other things are neatly placed around the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She walks in and heads over to the dest, a laptop rests in the centre of the desk, multiple pieces of paper are scattered across the desk, a pen cup is resting on the right-hand side of the desk. Multiple fancy-looking pens arranged neatly inside the cup. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the left-hand side is a lamp, its just a simple lamp, but it goes with the bedroom decore. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She walks over to the wardrobe and opens the door, the clothes inside are neatly arranged. She reaches up to the top of the wardrobe and pulls out a big black box. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pulls the lid off the box, inside are dozens of photographs. All containing a girl that looks exactly like her. Some from when she was younger, some from teenage years. But they </span>
  <em>
    <span>all </span>
  </em>
  <span>look exactly like her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That's, not possible" She whispers to herself, walking backwards and sitting on the bed. She pulls out more photos, placing them down next to her. Her hands touch a velvet bag. It's small, soft, square and kind of heavy. She opens the bag, pulling out a small black box. Opening it she sees a gold ring, with quite a large diamond on top. Her eyes widen and she slams the box shut. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay, getting weirder by the minute."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She puts all the pictures back and goes back to the wardrobe, putting the box back. Her eyes wander across the clothes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Good sense of style." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Going back over too the desk, she opens the laptop, wiggling her index finger on the mousepad. The laptop turns on. The login screen pops up, the background showing a picture of a family. she sees herself, or someone who looks exactly like her, standing next to a woman in a big white dress. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay, password. Pass-word. The word to let me pass. God, I would be such a sucky detective." She moves some of the papers around, opening some drawers and looking through them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Couldn't she have left me a cheat sheet or something." She crouches down and opens the bottom left drawer. "Ooh, a notebook." she picks it up and flips through the pages. Spotting a note at the end of the book.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Bingo! oh, I am so happy nobody heard me say that." She stands up and types the password into the computer. The screen takes a second to load, so she pulls her phone out of the back pocket of her jeans and sits down at the desk chair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Still got my phone, so that's good." She says, placing it down on the desk beside her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She starts looking through the laptop, going through all the saved files and photos. Trying to find anything she can on who's house she's in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a while, she slams the laptop closed. Pushing it further back on the desk and resting her head where the laptop used to be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay," she lifts her head, putting her elbows up on the desk and resting her head in her hands. " So, apparently the person who lives here has my face. My name. But we're different people? Oh, Jesus, I'm so confused."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A loud noise comes from in the kitchen and she quickly stands up, grabbing her phone and walking over to the bedroom door, she grabs an umbrella that's leaning against the wall and opens the door. She leaves the room, holding the umbrella as a weapon in front of her. The moment she reaches the kitchen, she sees the source of the noise. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A small, fluffy black cat is sat on the counter, it's paw ready to swipe a glass off the countertop. They lock eyes, the cat casually moves its paw, slowly pushing the glass off the counter. It crashes to the ground. She lowers her hand and lets the umbrella fall to the floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Pur'trude?" She walks forwards towards the cat, who lays down on the countertop, licking her left paw. "How are you here?" she strokes the cats head, reaching for the collar and looking at the name tag. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Salem? Like from Sabrina the teenage witch?" The cat attempts to bite her hand, making her pull it away. "Okay, so not Pur'trude, Salem. A black cat called Salem. Imaginative." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She walks away from the cat and towards the refrigerator, pulling open both doors and looking through. Trying to find something to eat, she hears a meow from behind her and she rolls her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yeah, yeah. I'll get you something." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pulls out a bit of salami, she rips it apart and gives the cat some. Eating the rest herself. She closes the fridge door and starts looking through the kitchen cupboards.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hears the cat jump off the counter and turns around just in time to see the cats tail around the corner. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Still using me for food then." </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Walking out of the kitchen after finding nothing special, she lets out a loud yawn and walks into the living room, laying back on the sofa and grabbing the blanket back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hopefully I'll wake up back home." She says, moving around to get comfortable, before falling asleep.</span>
