  <b>Draco’s Room ; Present Day</b>
</p>
<p>“I want you to kiss me”</p>
<p>Draco looked up from adjusting his pants as he exited his bathroom. If he was shocked from her presence in his room he didn’t show it. In fact, he just straightened up, seemingly squaring his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Did you follow me into my room Granger?” He crossed to his room in front of her, not acknowledging her statement at all. He could hear the dull thumping of the music that flooded his modest townhome from the party Pansy had insisted on throwing at his place in another attempt to worm her way into Potter’s pants again.He poured himself a glass of brandy off his nightstand, waiting for her response.</p>
<p>“I didn’t follow you, I guessed.” She wouldn’t look him in the eye, instead opting to gaze around his room in feigned interest. It reminded him of just a few weeks ago when he was doing the same in her room. He frowned, wondering why she would approach him now instead of when he saw her at the Leaky last Saturday.</p>
<p>“Why do you want me to kiss you?” He asked after he finished his brandy, the silence finally getting to him. Her head snapped to him, turning quizzically, as if she was confused as to why he would question her. Then her face grew red as she contemplated her answer, she almost looked like a Weasley.</p>
<p>“Because you didn’t before…” she said quietly, staring away from him.</p>
<p>The memories of that night came flooding back to him, the feel of her hair in his hand as she shook during her release. The way she moaned his name as she clenched around him, the soft skin of her hip and the way she just let him take what he needed from her. He felt himself get a little hard at the thought, and suddenly his room felt hot.</p>
<p>“Okay”</p>
<p>“Okay?” She turned to him full frontal now, a look of confusion on her face as he came closer to her. It was clear she expected him to say no.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yes Granger. Okay” He was fully in her space now, a hand rising to thread in that hair of hers again. He leaned into her, ghosting his lips over hers.</p>
<p>He could smell the firewhiskey from the party on her breath, and he could feel her warmth emanating from her body. Her heartbeat quickened as he hovered there for what seemed like forever.</p>
<p>Right as she was about to just yell at him to do it, his mouth lightly pressed against hers. It was so gentle compared to their previous encounter’s actions she wondered if this was even the same man kissing her. Yet as he slid his tongue along her lip she couldn’t help but grant him access, kissing him back firmly. As his tongue entered her mouth, he walked her back to his wall, roughly pushing her up it and moulding his body to hers.</p>

  <b>Two Weeks Earlier</b>
</p>
<p>Hermione left her shower to see Draco gone, probably having rejoined the party in order to avoid her. She returned her shorts and tshirt to her body heading back down the stairs to the party. She didn’t see him for the rest of the night, but she did run into Pansy following Harry around like a lost puppy. The girl even invited both of them to a party at Draco’s in a few weeks, something about a promotion that she got, supposedly announced around then.</p>
<p>Hermione spent the week perplexed. He had expressly done everything she didn’t ask him to do, namely touch her. But he made her cum more than she ever had before, and harder than ever. She always had wanted someone to take her the way Draco did. But someone she loved, someone she dated. Not Draco Fucking Malfoy during her monthly Saturday night party while her ex-boyfriend slobbered all over Lavendar Brown downstairs.</p>
<p>The work week was normal enough, new proposals to the Wizengamot that are mostly complete because she revised them 5 times already. The only thing that was exciting was her weekly lunch with Ginny that Friday, where she finally told her what happened.</p>
<p>“Wait so you just let him fuck you?” Ginny’s incredulous shriek of laughter followed her rather loud outburst in the relatively quiet cafe.</p>
<p>Hermione felt her face flush with the crude language and the wary looks from the other customers. Luckily it was a slow day for the cafe and there were only a sprinkling of people. She’d never so much as let a boy inside her before three dates and here she was letting Draco fucking Malfoy take not one, but two of her holes and she wasn’t even sure how to contact him outside of an owl, and she wouldn’t very well borrow the Weasley’s owl to ask him to talk about it. She couldn't even begin to write down broaching that subject with him.</p>
<p>Of course she thought about never talking to him again. But they ran in similar circles now thanks to Ginny dating Blaise Zabini. Even more so now that Pansy seemed to want to sink her claws into Harry, as oblivious as the Boy Wonder could be.<br/>“Well he was…”she lowered her voice even further, “he was rather large...and we’d already started.” The flush in her face was definitely full body now, as she wasn’t used to talking about these kinds of things but she needed to tell someone and it sure as hell wasn’t going to be Harry.</p>
<p>Ginny’s eyes were wide as saucers watching her best friend’s face. The redhead seemed to study her for a while,eyes searching frantically for a sign of something. What, exactly, Hermione didn’t know. Finally Ginny spoke, a lower volume now the initial shock had worn off.</p>
<p>“So he’s great in the sac, at least from your comments...but was he a good kisser?” If it was possible Hermione’s face would’ve gotten at least 3 shades redder.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t know”</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>She definitely had an answer now. Kissing Draco was like kissing euphoria. He consumed every inch of her thoughts with his kiss, the world around them fading into the background. He slowly started kissing his way down her neck, her breath hitching as his fingers deftly found their way into her panties. She felt herself let a small whimper out of her mouth as he touched her right where she wanted him to, pressing firmly against her clit.</p>
<p>She felt so dirty, he hadn’t even gotten her out of her pants, and here she was, withering from his touch. She wanted to keep quiet, but he slipped his finger inside her and she let out a small moan, which he quickly swallowed as he kissed her again. She rocked against his fingers, seeking her own relief, and then he showed just how evil he could be by pulling his fingers away.</p>
<p>“Draco…” She whispered, her eyes half lidded, her hands grasping his forearms in an attempt to not let him go too far away from her. The breath from his chuckle grazed her lips, he slowly peeled himself away from her.</p>
<p>“Getting a bit of deja vu here Granger,” he muttered, his eyes raking over her heaving form. His pupils were blown, she could tell in the low light. She leaned back away from him, trying to calm her breathing. She should’ve been angry with him, for what he did before, but now all she could think about was grabbing him and returning to how they were before. After a brief pause he looked back into her eyes, finishing his apparent assessment of her.</p>
<p>They were on each other in seconds. This time his kiss wasn’t slow and glorious, it was all passion and teeth, almost ugly as they stripped each other out of their clothes. He broke away only to pull her shirt off, quickly latching his mouth to hers again as his hands returned to her body, feeling the soft flesh of her breast through the lacy bra she was wearing. As one hand focused on caressing her breast and occasionally twisting her nipple, the other went back to her waist, this time shoving those shorts of hers down her legs, where she kicked them off in a rush, her hands preoccupied with tangling in his hair. The hand slipped deftly under her panties, feeling the wetness still there from moments ago. He growled against her lips before breaking the kiss and a little roughly shoving her to the bed. In an instant he was on top of her. Grinding purposefully on to her soaking core as his lips found hers again, her whimpers flooding into his mouth. He thumbed the band of her lace panties, lowering them slowly, taking his time.</p>
<p>Until, of course, the knock on the door.</p>
