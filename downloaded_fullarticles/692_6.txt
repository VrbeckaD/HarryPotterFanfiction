    <p>Draco shook out his umbrella before entering the café and pushed around some people before he joined the queue to order his coffee.</p><p><i>What a day!</i> he thought to himself.</p><p>It was worse enough he had to work in the Muggle world every day. But he also had to take the bus between the tube station and his office, and he wasn't even allowed to use a Shielding Charm against the downpour!</p><p>The bus driver had seen him coming. Heck, the man had seen Draco running but he hadn't bothered waiting for just five more seconds. Naturally, Draco had to wait for the next bus in the pouring rain and his umbrella wasn't even cooperating with him, or the wind.</p><p>Finally, as he approached the till to place his regular coffee order, Draco frowned at the man standing there. It wasn't Sheila, his usual barista but an all too familiar face.</p><p>"Potter?" he asked, incredulous. Because what if this was all just a nightmare and Draco was still sleeping on his bed?</p><p>"Malfoy," Potter said in a calm tone but looking surprised. "You're later than usual."</p><p>"Excuse me?"</p><p>"I mean, you usually get in about half eight, no?"</p><p>"Where's Sheila?" Draco asked, because honestly, that was the only thing he could think of then.</p><p>"She's on her break."</p><p>"And you work <i>here</i>, and you know that I come in here for coffee?"</p><p>Potter looked around to make sure no one was listening which confused Draco even further. "I'm undercover," he said.</p><p>Draco scowled at that ridiculous response and wanted to roll his eyes but he could feel the intense look the patrons behind him were probably giving him so he carried on with his order.</p><p><i>What a strange day, indeed</i>.</p><p>Now, Draco was going to have to find a new coffee shop. The last thing he wanted was to be seen by Potter again.</p><p>After the night they'd shared two months ago, Draco never wanted to see Potter again. Evidently, the London weather had other plans.</p><p>As Draco settled into the chair in his office and looked over the files, pretending to review them, the thought finally hit him. Potter was surprised to see Draco — but because Draco was late today. Potter knew Draco's schedule?</p><p>The thought didn't settle well with him at all. Potter said he was undercover. Naturally on an investigation? Was he spying on Draco?</p><p><i>Not again</i>!</p>
