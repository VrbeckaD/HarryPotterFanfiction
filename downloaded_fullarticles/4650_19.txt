    <p>Chapter 1:<br/>
The Outfit</p><p>Friday, 31 October 1975</p><p>"Lily, you've got to help me."</p><p>Remus pleaded in a hushed whisper to Lily while attempting to do Sirius' well known puppy-dog-eyes. It was past noon in the nearly empty Gryffindor common room and all students third years or older had got the afternoon free to have time to get ready for the Great Halloween Feast that was due later that evening. Most of Hogwarts population was now starting to get ready with dressing up in their costumes or applying makeup, or even beginning to transfigure part of their appearance instead of buying a costume. Thus most of the students were absent from the common room taking their time getting ready. </p><p>Remus however was not one of them. He had just started to panic and did what he usually did in that situation: went to his best non-marauder friend Lily. </p><p>"Remus, what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to get ready for the feast? Like almost, ehm, every other student at Hogwarts?" Lily asked looking very confused. She was holding a heap of clothes and something that looked like a dusty old hat and a sword. What was she going to be for the feast? Zorro? </p><p>"Well to be honest I really didn't want to go. For obvious reasons such as having to watch loud youths jumping around screaming at some band or the fact that I instead could enjoy a quiet evening in the common room or the dorm with a good book for that matter." Remus looked around dreamily at the common room as if he really could use of an evening in full serenity. But then he remembered his panic and looked helpless again. </p><p>"The thing is that Sirius kind of made me agree to go to the feast but now I have no clue what to do! I have nothing to wear and the fest starts in five hours!" Remus grabbed a fist of his hair as he breathed through his teeth. He looked desperate.</p><p>"Oh!" Lily's eyes widened a bit when she thought for a while, then she started to smile very smugly.</p><p>"He asked you to go with him, as in a date?" She asked Remus with a very suggestive glint in her eyes.</p><p>"No! Or, well he asked me to go with him but then James heard and proclaimed that we would all go together 'Marauder style'." Remus rolles hies eyes at that. "All for one and one for all or something. I don't really know what happened but one thing led to another and somehow James ended up planning pranks with Sirius and shouting reassuring words to anyone that would listen. 'We don't need no dates!' 'Come on mates, I'll make sure that this evening will be brilliant, I'm telling you, brilliant!' Then Peter piped something about how he really agreed with James, like he always does and well..." Remus babbled on while Lily tried to follow the conversation looking slightly disoriented.</p><p>"Anyway, I don't know if Sirius wanted to go only with med or not, but he probably didn't. I think I read too much into it, like always." Remus sighed and looked down at his shoes. </p><p>"No, don't say that Remus! Maybe he has finally opened his eyes and realized what an amazing, clever, smart, hot and sexy guy you are!" Lily patted Remus on the shoulder while she tried to give Remus some hope. He flushed scarlet at that but only mumbled something in response, something that sounded a lot like "I'm not hot and sexy…" while stepping away a bit from Lily's friendly shoulder patting that turned into slapping really quick.</p><p>"Oh, come on Remus, stop sulking now. Black probably meant to invite you as a date but then Potter had to ruin it like he ruins a lot of things. Like my reputation for one thing!" Lily rolled her eyes and waved her hands dramatically in the air. That made Remus laugh and he sobered up enough to bring up the main topic again.</p><p>"Thanks for your uplifting words Lily but we still have a serious matter on our hands, and no don't make that joke." Remus interrupted Lily with a fierce frown as she opened her lips as if to make a remark. </p><p>"I don't have anything to wear and that's a huge problem considering that Sirius have invited me to a kind-of-or-maybe-not-date! I will look like a total fool if I turn up at the feast looking like myself. And he will probably dress up as something really bad or cool, which will make me look even worse. Please help me?" Remus begged once more; although this time he grabbed Lily by the shoulders to make a bigger effect. "I need to look cool to make Sirius notice me!" Remus hissed quite desperately staring into her eyes.</p><p>Lily looked torn for a while but then she tore her gaze from Remus' amber eyes to her heap of clothes hanging on her arm. Maybe she could offer a couple of hours on Remus, her outfit was nearly done anyway. Remus let go of her shoulders to make a big sigh while he stared dramatically up the ceiling. Oh come on, how could Lily refuse to help someone that looked like that?</p><p>"Of course I'll help you Remus!" Lily exclaimed with a little laugh. "Follow me and I won't let you go until you look positively hot AND sexy!" Then she grabbed Remus by arm with the clothes-free arm and started yanking him up the girls' dormitories. </p><p>~</p><p>"Have you seen Moony?</p><p>Sirius looked around the great hall, looking for the missing marauder. They had been together all four for transfiguration that morning and then it had been only him and Remus for astronomy before noon. Now it was lunch and with that also the beginning of the weekend since all students over third year had gotten the last period free to be able to get themselves ready for the feast. </p><p>"I don't know mate, maybe in the library?" James suggested as he gave Sirius a sympathetic look. It didn't last long though as he almost immediately turned it back to his plate of food. Sirius looked at the empty seat at his immediate left. Remus' seat. </p><p>"Don't you think it's weird? I mean, how can he just disappear in what, fifteen minutes?" Sirius looked at James and Peter expectantly, as if he expected them to be as worried about Remus' absence as he was.</p><p>"Well, maybe he went to the loo?" Peter managed to spit in between huge bites of sausages, not even looking up from his third portion of lunch.</p><p>"Wormy's probably right Pads. I bet he will turn up here in a minute. Don't worry so much, yeah?" James said while giving Sirius an odd look. He looked like he knew something Sirius didn't and he didn't like it. </p><p>"Why do you worry so much anyway? Doesn't he always say that he can take care of himself anyway?" Asked Peter, finally looking up from his food. Although after meeting Sirius' angry grey eyes he quickly returned his gaze to his plate. </p><p>"No reason, just wonder where one of my best mates are is all. Isn't it normal to wonder that?" Sirius bit back rather fiercely. </p><p>Crossing his arms James leaned back in his chair. "But Sirius, last week Wormtail was absent from both lunch and dinner but you didn't ask where he was? Not even once? How do you explain that?" James asked Sirius with that odd quizzing look again. He looked like he was reading Sirius, calculating him. And the fact that James had used Sirius' birth name instead of his nickname also stated something. Like he was being unusually serious.</p><p>Determined to ignore James' unnecessary question Sirius looked away from James' calculating hazel eyes and instead turned his gaze around the great hall. His eyes locked on the Slytherin table where he spotted Regulus chatting with some pureblood girl and then getting up and leaving. Regulus was a fourth year now and was probably heading to the feast later, perhaps with the pureblood girl as company. </p><p>Following Regulus with his gaze Sirius saw greasy Snivellus Snape leaving the great hall heading to the dungeons as well. Watching all these people leaving made Sirius think about their own costumes and preparations for the masquerade. </p><p>"Shouldn't we head back to the dorm to get ready soon? Maybe Remus ate in the kitchen already and then went to the dorm to get ready before us." Sirius asked no one in particular as he continued to stare at leaving students. </p><p>James and Peter shared a look of confusion as they both noted that Sirius had avoided the question but then gathered their stuff and made to stand up and leave. "Sure mate, you lead the way." James said as he lifted his bag onto his right shoulder. Peter copied him and also lifted his bag to his right shoulder.</p><p>Finally looking away from the entrance Sirius made sure that he had gathered all his belongings and then swung his bag onto his left shoulder. He wouldn't give James the satisfaction of having two copycats.</p><p>"I bet I can reach the Fat Lady ten seconds before you ol' Prongs, wanna bet?" Sirius asked James with a challenging look in his eyes. James got an equally challenging look as he answered "I will reach it before you even have time to count to ten, granpa!" And then they both rushed out of the great hall as if their lives depended on it.</p><p>Peter was left to gape at them before he started to get out of the hall as well, hurrying on his steps as he heard an angry McGonagall from the head table. Before Peter made it out of the entrance he saw James push Snape on the way to the stairs. In the echo of James' and Sirius' laughter Peter sighed and concluded that firstly, he would never be able to keep up with them, and secondly that this was going to be a very long day. Sighing yet again he started up the stairs while shouting "Wait for me, you daft mutts!"</p><p>~</p><p>About two weeks prior, at Sunday October 19 the four boys that we know as the Marauders had been hanging around in the common room. Lazily reading a book in the couch by the fire place was Remus. Half asleep on his shoulder was Sirius and by the table playing exploding snap was James and Peter. It was the day before the full moon and they had all finished their homework in time for once. Although not without a lot of help and proofreading from Remus, at least when it comes to Peter's potions essay. </p><p>A bit restless as they were in anticipation of the next day's adventure in their newly concurred animagus forms they were bored and just wanted to waste time. Then all of a sudden McGonagall had appeared at the entrance looking prude and stern with a piece of parchment in her left hand. After greeting a few of the brave Gryffindor's she walked up to the billboard and with a flick of her wand enchanted the parchment to stay there. Then she turned around to face the students of her house and cleared her throat.</p><p>"Listen up boys and girls of Gryffindor house. I am here to present to you the official date and time of the Great Halloween Feast that has returned to Hogwarts this year. All students above third year will get the opportunity to attend an evening full of festivities such as music, dance and costumes. The Feast is a masquerade and just to have your notice there will be a costume competition held by headmaster professor Albus Dumbledore himself. The winner of the competition will gain fifty points to his or her house, so this is a great opportunity for you to show your loyalty to the Gryffindor house by winning it for us. </p><p>The feast will start at 6PM and end at midnight. To bring a date is optional, but if you are a third year or lower you will need a date older than fourteen to gain attendance to the ball. Classes will be dismissed at noon on Friday October 31 and to remind you yet again: It is a masquerade so therefore a costume is a must. </p><p>I hope that you will all behave and show your dignity to the Gryffindor house by acting accordingly and with respect. Good evening." Professor McGonagall gave a curt nod before walking out of the common room and exiting through the entrance. </p><p>For a while the common room was deadly silent. But then James jumped up from his chair and shouted "Wicked!" He looked almost crazy when he rushed forward to the billboard to read the details yet again. Peter followed him while Sirius woke up from his nap on Remus' shoulder. The chatting started up again and students started to crowd by the billboard, trying to get a glimpse of the parchment that was now hidden behind James frame. The Gryffindor third years started to look desperate when they realized they would need to find a date whilst others started to discuss what to wear with their friends. </p><p>"What's all this noise about, Moony?" Sirius mumbled against Remus' shoulder while he slowly came back to reality. </p><p>"Did you sleep through all that? Really? Are you serious?" Remus asked Sirius a bit surprised.</p><p>Sirius got a mischievous glint in his eyes. "Yes I'm-"</p><p>"No! Don't!" Remus hurriedly slapped his hand over Sirius's mouth. This close to the full moon he sometimes forgot about the fact that you could never speak the word 'serious' around any of the Marauders. And to be honest, that joke got old four years ago. </p><p>Momentarily Remus also seemed to forget his huge crush on Sirius and the fact that he always started to blush fiercely whenever Sirius as much as smiled at him. </p><p>Sirius' grey eyes looked surprised up at Remus' amber ones. Feeling his cheeks burn Remus quickly removed his hand from Sirius mouth and looked down at his lap. Had he looked up though he would have seen that he wasn't the only one blushing. </p><p>Before Sirius had time to say anything Remus began to explain that McGonagall had left a note about the upcoming masquerade feast. When he was done with the explanation James and Peter returned to their spots around the fireplace. Peter started packing away his game of exploding snap while James walked over towards Remus and Sirius.</p><p>"Brilliant! Isn't it? We can dress up as whatever we like! Come on mates, Wormy's packing up so we can go to the dorm and plan our outfits. It's going to be wicked!" James gave an almost impossible huge grin while he took one hand and ruffled his black messy hair. </p><p>The four boys then proceeded to walk to their dorm and then slumped on their beds. </p><p>"So, what are we going to dress up as?" Peter piped when the dorm had been silent for a couple of seconds. He directed the question mostly toward James, as usual.</p><p>"I don't know mate. Wouldn't it be cool though if we could dress up partly as our animagus forms? Like if I transfigured Prongs' antlers and stuff. I bet it would be mad because we would prank everyone to think it's only a costume while it's really a part of our animagus form." James explained with a huge grin.</p><p>"Yes, great idea Prongs, if we want to get ourselves expelled, or sent to Azkaban?" Sirius walked over to James' bed and shoved him on the shoulder. Then he gave Remus an apologetic look over his shoulder before he turned his gaze back to James. "It's illegal remember? And someone might realize the truth. A quarter of the school consists of Ravenclaws after all." He said with a sigh.</p><p>"Padfoot is right, it might be fun for a short while but then the reality would dawn upon us and it would only be a matter of time before someone put the pieces together Prongs. And we simply can't risk it. Not you, nor I." Remus looked bothered over at his bed and started fiddling with his bedspreads.</p><p>Sirius looked over at Remus again with a look, what was that look? James slowly analyzed Sirius' peculiar behavior until he heaved himself up from the bed and walked over to the window. "Yeah, maybe my idea had some flaws to it. But what should we dress up as then?" He leaned on the windowsill while crossing his arms and looked first at Remus, then Sirius and lastly Peter.</p><p>"Oi Prongs, you know what you should be? Frankenstein! Why? Because you look like the walking dead already!" Sirius shouted all of a sudden and then James ran towards him and they started a brotherly fight.</p><p>Remus sighed at the extent of the reach of that joke. But he didn't say anything about it and instead picked up a book and started to read. The fight could go on for a while.</p><p>~<br/>
Later that same evening James decided that he was going to dress up as Albus Dumbledore for the feast. But also that he would participate in the costume competition, which he would win. And after he had won Gryffindor fifty points Lily Evans would realize what a brave knight he is and then fail to resist kissing him. </p><p>After James persuaded Peter to dress up as professor Horace Slughorn to match him he was off to find said Lily to ask her to be 'The McGonagall to my Dumbledore.' Peter followed him out the door and Sirius and Remus was left in the dorm. Sirius didn't say what he was going to dress up as, nor did Remus. Remus also kept it a secret that he wasn't planning on going. </p><p>Although a week later it became clear that Lily would refuse to go with James to the feast even if he was the last man on the earth. It was also then Sirius would ask Remus to go to the feast with him, right before James and Peter came crashing through the door and decided it would be a great idea to go as a group. Not knowing what to do in that situation, or if the invitation still lasted Remus and Sirius simply changed topic and didn't speak about the invite again. None of them wanted to risk having to hear the other ask if it was a 'date'. </p><p>Because after all neither Remus nor Sirius knew that the other one was just as crazy about the other as they were.<br/>
~<br/>
"What is Black going to dress up as?" Lily asked Remus after she warned the other girls in the dormitories that she was bringing a boy up with her. When they reached the fifth years dorm Lily searched under her bed and then threw a couple of magazines on her matress while mumbling something under her breath.</p><p>"I don't know, I didn't ask. Why?" Remus miserably asked while he hopelessly slumped down at the end of Lily's bed. </p><p>"I thought that you could match. But it doesn't matter. I have another idea…" Lily trailed off as she looked through one of the magazines and then stopped when she came to a picture of a male model. Remus thought that she was looking for inspiration. </p><p>"Do you perhaps know what he fancies? Like for example if he likes colorful things, tight clothes, or just anything? Give me something to work with." Lily looked up from the magazine and her green eyes met Remus' amber ones. He felt his cheeks heat up as he answered.</p><p>"Ehm… Well, if he's style is anything to go by I guess he likes about anything in leather, black clothes, tight trousers…" Remus trailed of as he dreamily glanced in the distance.</p><p>"Hello? The world to Remus?" Lily laughed as she pinched Remus left cheek. "You've really got it bad, you know." She sang as Remus snapped back to reality. He started to look guilty and gave Lily an apologetic look as he rubbed his cheek. She smiled at him but then got a determined look on her face. </p><p>"Okay I know what we'll do. You said that Black likes dark things? Then perhaps something that oozes a bit of danger. How about a vampire?" She sat down on the bed next to Remus and took his hand. "Then I could help you transfigure your school robe into a long, black cape and maybe add a red lining. And I could help you style your hair, put on some eyeliner and transfigure a couple of fangs. If Black likes what you said he does he won't be able to take his eyes of you." She said confidently and looked quite proud of herself.</p><p>Remus got a troubled look on his face and frowned at Lily. "Well, wouldn't it be kind of odd though? I mean, a werewolf dressed up as a vampire. I don't know. It feels weird." Remus didn't look all too happy with the suggestion but Lily was known for her determination.</p><p>"Don't be silly Remus. First of all barely no one knows about your secret, and secondly you said yourself that you couldn't come dressed up as yourself. You know what? I hereby decide that you will dress up as a vampire and before you know it you will have Black wrapped around your little finger." Lily flashed him a wide grin while she winked at him. "Come on then, stand up and give me that robe of yours!"</p><p>Remus had no choice but to do as she said and handed her his robe. Then they started on his transformation from Hogwarts-prefect-Remus to badass-hot-and-sexy vampire-Remus. </p><p>After having to listen Remus go on about his more-than-a-crush on Sirius for months now Lily was determined to help him get what he want, even if it meant cutting her own time to get ready short. </p><p>She transfigured his school robe into a long black cape with red lining. Then she proceeded to transfigure his trousers into a tight pair of dark leather ones. Remus helped her transfigure his sweater into a tight white long sleeved shirt with gold buttons and ruffles at the end of the sleeves and at the front. According to Lily vampires were supposed to wear cravats and extremely tight clothes. Or she just said to stop him complaining about it. </p><p>Together they transfigured his vest into an aristocratic looking one, with fancy gold buttons and a perfect fit. The cape's lining and the vest were both blood red to fit the image. Remus admitted that those articles added to the vampire look but he didn't quite get what the skin tight leather pants had to do with it, nor his now transfigured pointy leather boots with a heel. But he knew better than to question Lily when she had her mind set on something so he kept quiet. </p><p>After Remus put on his transfigured clothes, with much struggle due to the tightness of the outfit, Lily led him over to the bathroom mirror where started on his hair. She combed it and then added a bit of hair product to make it lay slicked back. She left a couple of strands here and there to fall in his face and make him look slightly more dangerous. Looking in the mirror Remus could see his light brown hair looking proper but also a messy with the strands hanging out at the right places. For the first time he thought his hair actually looked good, and he didn't mind the few grey strands of hair that could be seen up front. </p><p>"Wow Lily, it looks amazing." He told her astonished. She smiled and replied that it was time for the makeup. She started to apply a thin layer of foundation on his skin, but not too much as she wanted Sirius to still be able to spot his many freckles. Smiling to herself Lily thought that Remus would have Sirius swooning over him in no time. She would make sure of that. </p><p>After contouring Remus' cheekbones, nose and under his jaw it was time for the eyes. After telling him to close them she started to create depth to them by filling in the crease with dark eyeshadow. Just a little bit so that the eyes would enhance. She then proceeded to line his amber eyes with dark eyeliner. Just a thin line to mark but not to take over. She then put a tiny bit of mascara over his already dark eyelashes and then she was done. "You can look now Remus" she said.</p><p>Remus opened his eyes and looked in the mirror. He couldn't help but let out a small gasp as he watched the person standing there. Was it really him? He lifted his hand and traced the side of his face, from his hair, to his chin and jaw. "Lily, I- I-" He started, staring at his reflection in the mirror.</p><p>"I know. You look good. Really good. I would actually even dare to say sexy!" She gave him a huge grin, laughed and patted him on the back. </p><p>"Thank you." Was all Remus managed to say as he tore his gaze from the hot man in the mirror and turned it toward Lily. "Thank you Lily, I don't know what I would do without you, you're the best!" </p><p>Remus gave Lily one of his rare hugs and then gave her a genuine smile. She could see the gratitude in his eyes and she smiled back. When he smiled with his teeth though she realized that they had forgot something. </p><p>"Wait Remus, we forgot the most important thing of the costume, the fangs!" While laughing Remus opened his mouth and Lily then transfigured two of his teeth in the upper jaw into great, white, piercing fangs and two in the lower jaw as well. "Watch out so you don't accidentally bite Black with those." Lily joked. Remus nudged her shoulder in response to the joke. "I wish." He said. </p><p>After thanking Lily yet again it was time for Remus to leave the girls dormitories, mostly because Lily had to get ready as well. After he left Lily and stated down his way to the common room he decided that he would take a walk to the usually empty boys bathroom at the sixth floor and practice some flirting. Remus figured that if he was going to make Sirius fall for him he would need some practice. </p><p>He did not want to return to his own dorm just yet since he guessed that it would be occupied by James, Peter and Sirius. For some reason Remus wanted his costume to be a surprise until the necessary reveal at the beginning of the feast. Remus decided that he wanted to surprise Sirius with his unusual hot, sexy, dangerous, leather look later. </p><p>It was still a couple of hours to kill before the feast though and Remus would need to occupy himself with something else in the meantime. The flirting practice was probably going to end faster than he thought so he needed to find something to do. Maybe daydream some about Sirius. That had always worked before. </p><p>As he made his way down the five stairs of the girl dormitories he heard many cat calls, wolf whistles and shouted words such as 'Hey bad boy!' 'Damn, you look fine!' or 'Wow, you sexy beast!'. It took a while until Remus realized that they were aimed at him. </p><p>Furiously blushing he walked even faster down the stairs until he reached the door to the common room. But before he opened it he tried to listen if any of his friends were at the other side. Remus thought it would only be awkward if he walked out of the girls dormitories and then had to explain what he had done there. </p><p>After making sure that it was safe to pass Remus opened the door and immediately stalked the few steps between the door and the portrait hole and then started down the moving staircases toward the abandoned boy's bathroom on the sixth floor. </p><p>In the meantime he thought about Sirius. He wondered what he would be dressed up as as he thought about his long, silky smooth black hair and his aristocratic features. Then he thought about his high cheekbones, stormy grey eyes and perfect skin. Unlike Remus Sirius barely had any scars at all and he looked perfect no matter what he was doing. He looked beautiful when he ate, slept, studied or played Quidditch. But he was the most beautiful when he was up to no good, with a mischievous glint in his eyes that oozed danger miles away. Remus felt his heart ache when he thought about how perfect Sirius was. Sirius was never going to like him back, but he still couldn't give up. </p><p>Remus decided that tonight would be the night. Tonight he would either see if Sirius liked him back and then they would live happily ever after, or he would realize that Sirius would never want to be with anyone like him. After all he was ugly, a werewolf and a male. Remus sighed at that realization. But even though Sirius was probably never going to like him back he still decided to hope for the first option. Lily had made a great job at making him look attractive after all. And if the cat calls were any to go after it wasn't just him and Lily that thought he looked good.</p><p>Remus reached the bathroom, opened the door and walked inside where he found it empty. Perfect. He walked to one of the mirrors and stared up at his reflection. Okay. So now he would practice. Flirting. Right. </p><p>He tried to blink his right eye in a flirty wink but it ended up looking like he got something stuck in his eye. Not very sexy. </p><p>He tried to smile smugly instead but ended up looking like some crazy killer since he somehow ended up staring at the same time. Next he tried to smile with his teeth, but that was almost the worst of it all. He looked positively psycho smiling with his teeth but not with his eyes. </p><p>"I can't do it! I give up!" Remus growled as he gripped the sink. He became frustrated on himself after minutes of staring at his reflection. He felt awkward, dumb and stupid. He couldn't flirt and it was too late to learn how to do it anyway. He would just have to accept that he was a lost cause.</p><p>Instead of practicing more Remus walked out of the bathroom and went to search for an empty classroom. There he could practice on their latest charms homework or maybe take a nap. Or daydream about Sirius again. </p><p>He would probably end up doing the latter.</p>
