    <p>Harry James Potter is born on July 31<sup>st</sup> with a head of black hair and blue eyes which occasionally look very green of which James Potter assumes is from his wife’s side of the family, doesn’t her sister have blue eyes he wonders? The point is nonetheless that Harry is a strange child by all accounts, wizarding ones included.</p><p>Rather than a quiet child Harry talks constantly, at first the simple nonsense of a baby but by the time he is six months old he has grasped onto language like a fish to water. He watches the magic his parents perform with wide wonderous eyes, but mostly curious eyes. It is his eyes that are perhaps the strangest things his young parents notice amidst the war; they are old eyes and contain some great sorrow.</p><p>“Those are the eyes of an old soul.”</p><p>Arabella Figg says to Lily as she rocks Harry in her arms, Lily who is familiar with the muggle term nods, but James who knows the rather more magical term peers at his son and wonders if Squibs have a way of knowing these things.</p><p>Unfortunately, Harry’s parents are unable to see whether the words hold true as by the time Harry is two, they are gone and he is abandoned on the doorstep of his Aunt and Uncle’s cookie cutter home one cold November morning.</p><p>Harry quickly learns under the forceful hand of his Uncle and the cold glare of his Aunt how to be a quiet child, one who doesn’t speak back, who does chores silently, one who becomes like a ghost with the only sign of life the bruises that amass on his skin and the space between his ribs.</p><p>Even amidst the silence of the house (not a home, anything but) there is some reprieve. There are the flashes of something absolutely, incredibly, <em>strange;</em> appearing on the roof top after running away from his cousin and his pack of bullies, the time he turns his teacher’s hair blue when she insults him, when he turns his hair red and then back to black just to see it.</p><p>There is also the library card which he tucks beneath his mattress along with the books he borrows and other such treasures. Harry reads all night and thinks of stories of his own, he reads fantasy and learns about the value of heart, he reads classic literature and learns about human morality, he reads about history and weeps bitter tears for things he cannot name.</p><p>When Harry is ten, he gets a fever.</p><p>It is a horrible fever, the kind that quickly becomes deadly. Harry’s guardians lock him in the cupboard under the stairs and decide to let fate deal with what they view as a nuisance that provides the occasional paycheck.</p><p>Perhaps, Harry dies there in that cupboard in his own sick, sweat cooling on his heated skin, like he is being flushed of all he has ever been and ever will be. Perhaps Harry’s heart stops in the middle of the night without anyone to see or hear but the spiders in their webs.</p><p>But what does happen is that Harry Potter wakes up and <em>remembers.</em></p><p>He remembers the taste of salt on his tongue and the ocean lapping at his feet, a father who left, a mother who died and she was holding him, remembers a hurricane, a war, love, death, duels, loss. He remembers Alexander Hamilton.</p><p>When he stumbles out of the cupboard the next morning, the one that was locked the night before, he views the world with new eyes, the paved roads, the phones, the cars, it is all so suddenly <em>new</em> once more. He feels sick with too much information, too much grief (they are gone, they are all gone) two minds trying to be one, two sets of memories trying to meet and meld. Is he Alexander? Is he Harry? Are they the same?</p><p>It is early in the morning and Harry? Alex? Stumbles from Number 4 Privet drive and to the library. It isn’t open but the door clicks open under his hands and his feet lead him to the history section, the shelves which he has browsed hour after hour and there. He pulls out a book on the American Revolution and flips until he finds a page on the aides-de camp of Washington, finger drifting down the page until it is there Alexander Hamilton. He reads a biography next, then one on the economic system, then one on Washington, and Jefferson, and Madison, and America until a librarian finds him sobbing into his knees at all he has lost.</p><p>Her hands are gentle on his shoulders but he cannot stop the instinctive reaction to flinch and she frowns and asks him if he’s okay. No. The answer is no. Alex, he settles on that because he has been Alex for far longer than he has been Harry, studies the woman and thinks of what he could say (he’s read about CSA) thinks about the abuse he will have to go back to, because it is abuse, or the foster system and shakes his head.</p><p>Alexander goes back to the Dursleys and listens to his Aunt scream and his Uncle lecture. He tilts his head up and narrows his eyes thinks of the army, blood and amputated limbs, of Valley Forge and says simply, “No.”</p><p>There is silence for a blissful moment before his Uncle begins to yell. Alex straightens his spine and continues, “No, you are going to give me the unused room upstairs or I am going to report you to child protective services where you will inevitably go to jail for both neglect and physical abuse which the neighbours could testify along with the teachers, Dudley, and the cupboard under the stairs.”</p><p>They concede and maybe it is because of the look in Alexander’s eyes but Vernon Dursley doesn’t raise a hand against him again.</p><p> </p><p>Life settles into a strange rhythm, he is allowed to succeed in school and does so with vigour, thoughts of law fill his head and maybe something even more ambitious if he is honest with himself. He writes and reads like he is running out of time and the librarian who had found him takes him under her wing and always gives him the new books first. The house becomes a strange in between but Alex has lived through worse and thinks if he can get a scholarship then he can get out and it will have to be enough.</p><p>When Alex is eleven, he receives a letter.</p><p>It is a thick parchment, one that reminds him of nights hunched over his desk with the ink pot. He opens it in the safety of his own room and stares at the words scrawled across the page for a long time. So, it’s magic he finally thinks, all of the strange happenings that followed him were not as he had begun to wonder the will of some strange deity, but honest to God magic.</p><p>There is no question as to what his answer will be.</p><p>He writes a response asking for a guide and goes outside where a tawny owl stares at him with wide unblinking eyes. Alexander stares back and has a sudden foreboding feeling as he glances from the parchment to the owl, he gives it to the owl who snatches it and flies away a moment later.</p><p>Over dinner he tells his guardians and watches the pale hue of his Aunt’s face as she says in a vitriolic tone, “I always knew you were like your mother, and your father, scum from a different country with his magic.”</p><p>She spits the words like they’re vinegar on her tongue and Alex glances at his darker skin and supposes that explains where he gets it from, is it funny that he is once more an orphan and maybe even a bastard?</p><p>Two days later a woman appears (quite literally) at 4 Privet drive. Alex opens the door; she has stern features that hide some great kindness and is wearing robes that remind him of the dressing gowns Eliza favoured.</p><p>“Mr. Potter?”</p><p>She says it like a question but from the way her eyes take him in like he is a familiar sight Alex gathers she probably knew his parents. It is weird to hear Potter rather than Hamilton. The woman, Professor McGonagall takes him to a pub and then through the pub with his head down to cover the scar that sprawls across most of his forehead in the shape of a lightning bolt, and into the back alley where she taps on the bricks.</p><p>They reveal Diagon Alley and it feels like stepping off the ship and onto America for the first time as he stares at the bustle of people, the cobbled streets, the old fashion style storefronts and Alexander is hit with a surge of nostalgia for what was.</p><p>McGonagall smiles at his wonder and directs him to the bank(!) which apparently Goblins are in charge of, McGonagall explains everything in a quiet but confident tone as she supplies his vault key and they file into the cart. She has already explained the societal structure including government, the existence of mythical creatures, currency, and she continues to patiently answer Alexander’s questions, of which there are many. To say the least Alexander is well, enchanted with the world he has opened with a letter even if he can tell that the shining surface, as with America, festers underneath.</p><p>When they stop at his vault Alexander cannot mask his surprise at the sheer amount of wealth in his vault. He has never been rich, not even well-off, and there is something utterly staggering about it. It is also a reminder of the state he left his family in when he died. Alexander’s fingers hover over his chest with a sombre air as he surveys the room before turning to speak to the Goblin, Griphook, about account management, estates, investments, interests, and so on.</p><p>McGonagall lets him speak to the Goblin with wide but amused eyes until Alexander has sorted everything he is able to until he is of legal majority (which is apparently seventeen) then collects the necessary funds for the rest of the trip. They stop at another vault and Alex watches with narrowed eyes as McGonagall removes a package from the vault.</p><p>“Apologies professor.”</p><p>“No worries Mr. Potter, your mother was just as curious about well, everything from Filius’ stories, another professor at Hogwarts.”</p><p>McGonagall replies as she guides him into Madam Malkin’s which is where they get their robes, he wonders if they tailor breeches? The words are wrapped in warmth and Alex glances at the woman as he stretches his arms out and asks, “You knew my mother professor?”</p><p>“Your mother and father were both in my house at school, Gryffindor.”</p><p>She says and there is pride in her voice, he recognises it and thinks of Philip, it is a heavy thought and he shakes it away with a frown and asks instead, “What were they like? The Dursleys refused to speak of them.”</p><p>Her face twists slightly at the mention of the Dursleys before she replies, “Lily was very intelligent, a prodigy at charms, she actually apprenticed under Filius so he would be best to ask about her, but she was kind if incredibly stubborn, quick to anger, she always held grudges. James was loyal, a prankster, brave, and a natural leader, even if he was also lazy and often arrogant at times.”</p><p>McGonagall describes them, faults and virtues, with the kind of fond remembrance only the dead receive. Alexander nods a lump in his throat as he thinks of the parents he never knew and responds, “Thanks professor.”</p><p>Madam Malkin finishes with the measurements and Alexander orders enough of a wardrobe to hopefully blend in well with wizarding society, it is eerily familiar to arriving in America and adjusting to the strange customs. But Alexander is nothing if not adaptive. Next, they visit the luggage store and Alex pays what he considers a decent price for a trunk with hidden compartments and a library, the feel and weight of it is familiar in his hands. After that is the potion supply shop, then the telescope store, the stationary story where there are quills and parchment (his hands itch to write), and then the wand store.</p><p>An old man shuffles out from behind the counter and narrows his eyes at Alex, he feels as if he is being seen, all of him.</p><p>“Interesting, very interesting, Mr. Potter I remember when your mother and father came here.”</p><p>He continues to ramble about wood and core types as he shuffles through the shelves before pulling out a long narrow box and setting it before Alex. Cautiously he reaches out and opens the box pulling out a long thin stick.</p><p>“Give it a wave Mr. Potter.”</p><p>Something shatters with the motion and the man shakes his head and says, “No definitely not that. Try this.”</p><p>Nothing shatters this time but nothing else happens either. They cycle through wand after wand, at one point Ollivander places a wand in front of him with a strange gleam to his eyes, Alex holds the wand and feels the hint of <em>something</em> but it doesn’t sit right and he shakes his head. Ollivander frowns and after a long few minutes in which Alexander begins to worry, he returns finally with a dusty box murmuring to himself, “I wonder.”</p><p>The wand is a pale white almost ivory in colour and is longer than the other wands he has been shown, the wand feels <em>right</em> in his hands as he gives it a swish and a small shower of sparks shoot from the wand.</p><p>“Interesting very interesting Mr. Potter.”</p><p>“What’s interesting sir?”</p><p>Alex asks as he holds the wand, it is a strange feeling something settling into his chest. Ollivander hums and says, “Thirteen inches, Aspen, with a Thestrel hair and Phoenix feather core. Very interesting Mr. Potter.”</p><p>He stares at his wand with narrowed eyes at the lack of explanation but decides that there is probably a book on wand lore somewhere.</p><p>“Thank you, Mr. Ollivander.”</p><p>Finally, they go to the bookstore.</p><p>“Harry I’ll be back in a moment will you be fine on your own?”</p><p>McGonagall asks and Alex glances up belatedly from the book he is peering at, already there is a small stack growing by his feet, everything from wizarding history to cuisine. Alex nods and replies, “I think I’ll manage Professor.”</p><p>“You are very much like your mother Mr. Potter I always thought she would have fit well in Ravenclaw. I’ll be off now do be careful not to spend all of your funds dear.”</p><p>She cautions with a fond smile and leaves. Alex grins and places the book, one on runes in the floating bin next to him, he browses the shelves plucking books on any subject that spikes his interest in the cart along with the required course books for both first and second year before making his way to the cash (he watches the slow-dawning horror in the cashier’s eyes somewhat apologetically).</p><p>After he has finished sorting the many books into his trunk (it’s a system that puzzled Eliza and everyone he knew) he stands up and scans the area for McGonagall. A voice calls out, “Are you lost?”</p><p>He turns and there is a man with his son who is a near carbon copy of him with platinum blond hair and cold eyes. Alex shakes his head instantly pegging them as what serves as upper class (nobles yay!) and replies, “No, just waiting thank you for your concern.”</p><p>“Lucius Malfoy and my son Draco.”</p><p>The man introduces and Alex shakes his hand as he replies, “Harry Potter.”</p><p>He watches the shock pour over both the man and the boy’s features and wonders at the whispers he has heard throughout the day surrounding his name. The people stare at him like he is a saint or a legend come to life, and his name is in one of the books he bought; it doesn’t bode well.</p><p>“A pleasure.”</p><p>Malfoy senior says making it sound like anything but, Alex’s eyes narrow and he smiles brightly at the man ignoring the insult. He reminds him of Jefferson with his stupid holier-than-thou attitude and his ridiculous purple suit.</p><p>“Mr. Potter there you are.”</p><p>McGonagall’s voice breaks the stilted silence and Alex turns and grins at the woman watching as Malfoy senior blanches slightly and says, “Professor McGonagall, good afternoon.”</p><p>“Good afternoon, Mr. Malfoy you must excuse us we are on a tight schedule.”</p><p>McGonagall replies with what could adequately be called a glare though it is too subtle for that, regardless Alex can feel the tension between the two adults and it’s obvious the younger Malfoy can as well. Interesting.</p><p>“Of course. Have a lovely day, Mr. Potter, Professor McGonagall.”</p><p>With that the man turns and sweeps off down the alleyway swinging his cane his son following behind him with a last glance over his shoulder and God the Jefferson vibes are real. Alex turns to face McGonagall and can’t help the delighted sound he makes as he sees the cage she is holding. Inside is a falcon, she has dark brown wings with a hint of red, and intelligent brown eyes which study Alex approvingly.</p><p>“Happy birthday Mr. Potter.”</p><p>McGonagall says with a small smile and Alex feels like his chest might burst with happiness. He glances at the bird and then at McGonagall before asking, “But I thought only the pets listed were accepted?”</p><p>“Your Head of House will make an exception if the pet is a familiar, one of my students has a tarantula.”</p><p>She winks and Alex grins as he takes the cage and stares at the bird reaching out through the cage to brush one finger against her beautiful plumage. McGonagall frowns glancing at her watch and says, “I’m sorry Mr. Potter but I really do need to go soon I’ll take you home and talk to your guardians but to get to Hogwarts through the muggle way is very simple, if you look at your ticket,” here she hands it to him as they walk through the pub once more, “it says platform 3/4 quarters, simply find the barrier between the two platforms and run through it, the train will be on the other side. If you need assistance other wizards will be there.”</p><p>“And they’re pretty obvious?”</p><p>Alex asks with a smile and McGonagall nods and as they arrive at 4 Privet drive, she says, “I look forward to seeing you at Hogwarts Mr. Potter.”</p><p>“I look forward to being there Professor.”</p><p>Alexander reads all night, he devours the books on the government (where the common people have no say unless you are of a noble line and the rights of the few are the only ones protected), the school books which leads to questions on everything from theory to how bastardized Latin actually works (intent, it’s all about intent but Alex thinks with his knowledge of Latin that spell crafting wouldn’t be that hard) and delving into even more of his books.</p><p>Around three am, Alex opens a book on famous figures of the Wizarding World. At around three thirty he reads about Harry Potter who as an infant destroyed the Dark Lord Voldemort. Oh, he thinks suddenly in realisation. Alexander carefully sets the book down staring at the picture of his mother and father holding him as a baby in their arms.</p><p>His parents died to protect him. His father didn’t abandon him, they weren’t drunks in a car crash, they died so he could live all because some homicidal maniac attacked their home (and his curiosity is peaked, what happened in the war, who was fighting for what?).</p><p>Alex glances out the window at the darkness only three am can bring and stumbles to his feet swaying until he collapses in his bed and flicks the light off with a twist of his fingers. He doesn’t sleep that night plagued by the image of bright green light and the thought of his family past and present.</p><p>That and the disturbing thought of the differences between regular schooling and magical schooling, no math unless its arithmancy, and how it might be difficult to get a regular law degree unless he wants to practice magical law.</p><p> </p><p>Getting to the station involves something similar to herding cats but it is the Dursleys. Vernon Dursley fumes the whole ride and mumurs about ungrateful children the whole way there, but in the end Alex gets there. The station is abuzz with people commuting to work as Vernon Dursley dumps his trunk on the ground and peels away with a squeal of rubber.</p><p>Alex glances from his trunk to the station for a long moment and wishes for Hercules who could lift both him and John at the same time with ease. Instead, he sighs and picks up his trunk braving the crowded station as he searches for platforms three and four.</p><p>Finding the correct platform is easy enough, he watches as two red-head twins go running through a barrier and the people around them walk on unaware. A woman with red hair is talking to a young girl and she turns and catches sight of Alex and smiles kindly as she asks, “Are you lost dear?”</p><p>“No, I think I’m at the right place. Hogwarts, right?</p><p>“Yes, it is. First year?”</p><p>She reminds him ever so slightly of Martha Washington who was always insistent on piling Alexander with her frankly delicious cooking. Alex blinks away memories of early mornings in George’s kitchen and nods.</p><p>“It’s my son Ron’s first year as well,” here she tugs a redhead with freckles splattered across his face and a mop of red hair forward, “It’s very simple dear you just run through the barrier. Ron can show you.”</p><p>Ron nods with an excited grin and grabs a hold of his cart and pushes it through the barrier disappearing with a pop. A young girl, also with ginger hair, pouts and says, “I want to go.”</p><p>“Next year Ginny.”</p><p>The woman turns to him with a smile and says, “After you…?”</p><p>“Harry, thank you Mrs.-”</p><p>“Molly Weasley.”</p><p>“Mrs. Weasley.”</p><p>Alex replies flashing a charming smile and grabbing a hold of the cart bracing himself. He is still acclimatizing to the twenty-first century and magic has not aided that in the slightest. The barrier feels cold against his skin and then he is on the other side where a train looms and families crowd the platform.</p><p>A pang lances through Alex’s heart as he watches families tearfully bid their children goodbye. It reminds him of Philip off to boarding school all their children in the front hall, Angelica clinging to Philip like a limpet, young Alex crying. He blinks away the heavy feeling filling his chest and makes his way onto the train trying to ignore the pervasive thought that he never got to see his children grow up.</p><p>He finds an empty compartment and stores his luggage before pulling out a book. At one point the train starts moving but Alex hardly notices as he continues to read about what is known about Goblin culture.</p><p>The door slides open and a voice says, “Oh there’s someone here.”</p><p>Alex blinks fuzzily and sets his book down before glancing up at the door, there is a girl with dark skin and a halo of bushy black hair around her head. She narrows her eyes at Harry and asks, “Have you seen a toad? Neville lost his.”</p><p>“Have you tried accio?”</p><p>Alex asks with a shrug. The girl’s face brightens and she steps inside the compartment and says, “I’ve read about that spell but I haven’t had the chance to practice it as we’re not allowed to do magic at home.”</p><p>“You could always ask an older student.”</p><p>Alex replies and the girl huffs as if he’s suggested she simply give up and Alex narrows his eyes. The girl’s eyes sweep over him, like she’s trying to dissect him before she extends her hand and says, “Hermione Granger.”</p><p>“Harry Potter,” Her eyes widen and he shakes his head and replies, “It’s really nothing like the books.”</p><p>“But.”</p><p>She protests almost desperately and Alexander raises a brow and says, “Just because you’ve read it doesn’t make it true, I can personally testify that no one asked me what happened that night. But in any case, I’m pretty sure it was all my mom and not me being frankly impossibly strong as a baby.”</p><p>Hermione frowns and looks like she might object once more when the door to the compartment slides open revealing a boy with a mop of brown hair and kind eyes, he waves awkwardly and then spots Hermione.</p><p>“There you are. Have you found Trevor yet?”</p><p>“No, but Harry here was suggesting having one of the older students use accio.”</p><p>“That sounds like a great idea.”</p><p>The boy says and grins at Harry as he steps inside the compartment and introduces himself, “I’m Neville Longbottom.”</p><p>“Harry Potter.”</p><p>Neville’s eyes widen but there’s thankfully none of the hero-worship that he had seen flash through Hermione’s eyes before he opened his mouth. Alex nods once and Neville smiles before Hermione interrupts, “Well we should be going, I heard we’ll be arriving soon. You’ll want to change into your robes.”</p><p>She says it as if she’s written the rulebook itself and Alex frowns but nods as the two students depart from his compartment leaving him alone once more. Maybe he’s just not used to socializing with children.</p><p>It is dark by the time the train slows to a halt and Alex feels the exhaustion of the past few days and sleepless nights tugging at him as he exits the train and is directed by what could only be a giant towards a secluded area. He pauses at the edge of the lake and stares at the boats hysterical laughter bubbling up in his throat as he clambers into the boat with a few other students.</p><p>Then the boats pass the rocks and Alexander’s jaw falls open as he stares at the castle, an actual castle, with spires and towers, and God it is perhaps one of the most gorgeous sights he has seen (and he knew all three Schuyler sisters). The other children all stare in open-mouthed wonder at the castle as the boats slowly draw closer and Alexander thinks he wouldn’t mind staying there.</p><p>They are all gathered in a hallway and McGonagall appears wearing beautifully tailored mauve robes, she smiles at Alex and states, “When I call your name you will be sorted into your house which will become your family during your stay at Hogwarts, each house values different characteristics and no house is better or worse than any other for these characteristics. Now wait just a few moments and then we will begin.”</p><p>For a fraction of a second there is silence before the kids break out into hushed and frantic whispers. Alex stands and waits observing the people around him who will be his classmates. Someone taps him on the shoulder and Alex whirls around to face the red-head, Ron from the train who waves and says, “My brothers say we have to fight our deepest fears to be sorted.”</p><p>“That’s ridiculous.”</p><p>The girl from the train, Hermione interrupts her hands on her hip as she juts her chin out. Ron frowns and says, “Well what do you think it is?”</p><p>“Probably a test.”</p><p>“You’re both wrong.”</p><p>A voice interrupts and Alex turns to face a familiar kid, platinum blond hair and an angry frown, Draco Malfoy. Alex glances between the three of them, Ron is glaring at Draco and Hermione is glancing between the two of them with a frown.</p><p>Before anything can devolve further the door opens and McGonagall reappears. Instantly, there is silence as the children file into line and McGonagall leads them into the great hall, where apparently the whole school is seated. Alex observes the room with wide eyes staring at the ceiling which he had read about in Hogwarts: A History though it didn’t compare to the stars at night in the past (light pollution apparently).</p><p>McGonagall sets a raggedy looking hat down on a stool and Alex watches surprised and enraptured as a mouth splits into existence and the hat begins to sing. After the enlightening but tune-deaf song Alex watches as McGonagall pulls out a list and calls a name, “Hannah Abbott.”</p><p>The girl steps forward and McGonagall places the hat on her head, after a moment it calls out, “Hufflepuff!”</p><p>The table with yellow ties cheers and the girl walks over to the table. And so, it goes, Alex pays half-hearted attention to the names trying to connect them to the book on wizarding nobility he had finished reading the night before.</p><p>“Hermione Granger.”</p><p>Is called and Alex blinks and watches as she walks forward her hair like a halo underneath the hat. It takes a few minutes and Alex can almost see her arguing with the hat before it calls out, “Ravenclaw!”</p><p>Hermione’s shoulders slump but she plasters on a smile as she settles at the table with the blue ties. After that Alex stops paying attention until he hears, “Draco Malfoy.”</p><p>The blond boy walks forward trying to look confident but Alex can read the nervous line of his shoulders and see the way his fist is clenched at his side. There is silence for a long moment before the hat says, “Hufflepuff!”</p><p>There is a stunned silence for a long moment, and Alex focuses on the look of sheer terror on Draco’s face that is carefully and quickly masked behind apathy and tries not to think of John after receiving letters from his father. Draco stumbles towards the Hufflepuff table and Alex watches concerned and promises to check in on the other boy.</p><p>A few more names are called and then, “Harry Potter” rings out through the great hall, and with it an expectant silence. Alexander tilts his head up strangely uncomfortable with the attention (maybe because he did nothing to earn it) and walks forward.</p><p>“Ah what do we have here. Mr. Potter, interesting, or should I say Mr. Hamilton?”</p><p>A voice speaks inside his mind (occlumency?) it is male-sounding and Alex glances at the brim of the hat which laughs and the voice replies, “Yes, this is a form of occlumency.”</p><p>“Hamilton.”</p><p> Alex thinks and the hat hums and replies, “Interesting, you’re not the first reincarnate I’ve seen tonight.”</p><p>“There are others?”</p><p>He asks something light filling up his chest like the touch of spring after winter and the thought that <em>he</em> <em>isn’t</em> <em>alone</em>. The hat hums in agreement and adds, “Yes though none remember as of yet. And no, I won’t tell you Mr. Hamilton. Now where to put you? Plenty of bravery, loyalty isn’t your strongest suit though, love of knowledge, ambitious yes, very ambitious better be Slytherin!”</p><p>The hat calls out and Alex rises to his feet setting the hat back on the stool he takes note of the surprise of well, everyone. Walking towards the table with the green ties Alexander supposes it is because Slytherin house is viewed as dark (which statistically is incorrect to say nothing of no one being inherently evil) and he is supposed to have killed a dark lord.</p><p>After a moment McGonagall calls out another name but Alex can feel the eyes of his fellow housemates like that of the enemy redcoats; Slytherin also has a reputation for blood purity and Alex as far as he can understand is a halfblood.</p><p>“Ron Weasley.”</p><p>Is called and Alex watches as the boy settles under the hat who within a second of being placed there calls out, “Gryffindor!”</p><p>The red table bursts into happy cheers. Alex studies the other first years sitting at his table, there are two large boys who look like they might (and that is a strong might) share a single braincell between the two of them. There are two girls sitting beside each other, one with a handsome face and broad shoulders, the other is tiny with sharp features and eyes that cut, there is another girl with straight blond hair and icy grey eyes who is sitting alone watching the proceedings with narrow eyes. There is another boy who is glaring at Alex with features that remind him of inbred children and an almost rodent sort of look to his face.</p><p>Alex glances at the centre of the hall where the last kid is sitting as the hat calls out, “Slytherin!”</p><p>Their table bursts into cheers as the boy who has dark skin with his hair closely shaved to his head joins their table and sits down beside Alex. An old man at the head of the table stands up, he has a long white beard, half moon spectacles, and is wearing frankly garish red robes (it would make even Jefferson gag really).</p><p>“Good evening, I am your Headmaster Albus Dumbledore and I am sure you are all as excited as I am for another year of schooling and perhaps even more importantly our delicious feasts, but first there is some housekeeping to attend to. I must remind you all as Argus has reminded me, that any prohibited items will be confiscated, the list I believe is outside our caretaker’s office. Also, this year the third-floor hallway is strictly prohibited.”</p><p>The Headmaster says a few more words of nonsense but Alex’s mind is still stuck on the whole forbidden floor thing. Who says that to a group of kids? That’s practically reverse-psychology at it’s finest, Alex would know he’s used it on his own children more than a few times.</p><p>Suddenly, food appears on the tables and they seem to groan under the weight of the full course meal. Alexander stares with wide eyes and the boy beside him laughs quietly and says, “It sure is a lot huh?”</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen this much food in my life.”</p><p>The words are heavy and Alex pushes them aside and turns to face the boy as he says, “Harry Potter.”</p><p>“Blaise Zabini, pleasure to meet you.”</p><p>Blaise responds and Alex’s chest hurts for some reason he can’t name. Alex grins and shovels food carefully onto his plate ignoring the weight of eyes that he can still feel from across the hallway as he asks, “Happy to be in Slytherin?”</p><p>“Who wouldn’t be?”</p><p>Someone interrupts and Alex glances at the girl with the handsome face who huffs and says, “Millicent Bulstrode.”</p><p>“It does have a reputation, though it is for the most part an unfounded one.”</p><p>Alex replies and Millicent nods slowly, beside her the other girl narrows her eyes and says, “I think Slytherin is the superior house. Pansy Parkinson.”</p><p>“It’s the house of ambition, most Slytherins achieve their desired careers especially political ones, Daphne Greengrass.”</p><p>The girl with blond hair says studying Alex with narrow eyes, he feels as if he is being dissected.</p><p>“That is, when bias and prejudice don’t make an appearance.”</p><p>Blaise says with a tilt of his head, barely an opinion but almost not a statement. The two boys who resemble gargoyles blink dumbly but the boy with the inbred features scoffs and replies, “You would know all about prejudice wouldn’t you Zabini what with your mother and your family being neutral. Theo Nott.”</p><p>“I don’t think you’re in a position to make that assumption.”</p><p>Alex interrupts with a raised brow and turns to Blaise maybe to apologize but instead he catches a flash of a brilliant smile streaking across Blaise’s lips and grins back. Theo frowns and looks like he might try to insult Alex’s obviously mixed heritage next when Daphne rolls her eyes and says, “Don’t Theo, you’ve already made enough of an idiot of yourself tonight.”</p><p>Theo scowls but is otherwise silent which is a relief. Alex turns back to Blaise as he eats trying not to think of the fact that the food is prepared by what is basically willing slaves (because Alex knows about Brownies and House Elves are nothing like Brownies) and states, “So, you never answered my question.”</p><p>“No, I didn’t.”</p><p>Blaise replies with a nod and Alex frowns for a second before he shrugs far too use to Burr’s (he pushes away everything that lingers with that name alone) hesitance to voice an opinion and asks, “What class are you excited for? At least tell me that much.”</p><p> “Probably potions. Our Head of house is the professor, that’s him there at the staff table.”</p><p>Blaise says and points at a man with straight black hair, a hooked nose, and dark eyes who is glaring at Alex. Great. Beside him is a man with a turban and a nervous expression, suddenly Alex’s head hurts, the pain is comparable to a bullet wound as he grasps at his skull and waits for the pain to pass.</p><p>“Are you alright?”</p><p>“Fine now.”</p><p>Alex bites out as the pain begins to fade and he reaches out shakily for a glass of water which Blaise places in his hands. He mumurs a thanks and downs the liquid before the Headmaster stands up and the food disappears.</p><p>There’s a school song, which they all sing to a different tune and Alexander tries to distract himself from the pain by singing it to the tune of the American national anthem (the new one, which is he admits is pretty cool). Then they are ushered out of the hall and lead by prefects to their common room, which is in the dungeons.</p><p>The prefect pauses in front of a portrait and turns to face the small group of first years (a war always leads to a smaller population size during but is usually followed by a boom afterwards hadn’t he read that somewhere) and says, “This is the entrance to the Slytherin common room, a new password is posted each week on the first day and after that is destroyed. Do not share the password with anyone from another house or you will face severe consequences,” he pauses face grim as he continues, “Our house deals with a lot of prejudice people will hate you because of the colour of your tie, they’ll do whatever they can to get one over a slimy Slytherin. We stick together outside the common room, whatever disagreements or petty squabbles you have they don’t exist outside the common room.”</p><p>“Unity, you’ll make your closest friends in Slytherin or your greatest enemies. The password for this week is Serpent.”</p><p>The other prefect chimes in and Alex thinks it’s almost like dealing with other political parties again, except they quite literally are all children. The portrait swings open revealing a wider door that leads into the common room.</p><p>It is a large room with windows that peer into the lake, the walls are the same stone grey as the castle but the hearth at one end of the room casts it in a warmer light, there are bookshelves on the walls, and plush green couches and chairs which are filled by some of the students.</p><p>The first years are led to the fireplace and Alex watches as the professor with black hair steps into the room narrowing his eyes at Alex before sweeping forward and announcing, “Good evening, I am Professor Snape your Head of House. You have already heard about the prejudice you will face in this house, even from other teachers, I will not intervene in schoolyard duels but if you feel that you are being unfairly judged I will stand for you. Slytherin is the house of cunning and ambition so use it. You will receive your timetables at breakfast tomorrow goodnight.”</p><p>With that Snape turns and leaves the room. Alex watches the man with narrowed eyes before the prefect calls out, “Alright girls on the left, boys on the right. Two to a room.”</p><p>Alex turns whip-fast to Blaise who sighs in a long-suffering sort of manner but nods in agreement as they file up the stairs and claim the room closest to the doors and the bathroom. Alex follows Blaise inside and stares at the two beds with green duvets divided by a window which lets rays of soft light in. Alex’s trunk is at the foot of the bed on the left and with a heavy sigh he collapses onto the soft covers.</p><p>Sleep finds him quickly for once.</p><p> </p><p>Alexander wakes early, he always has, the dregs of a nightmare tugging at his limbs with exhaustion and his chest sore as he stumbles quietly to his feet and into the washroom. He is already a sight with dark bags under his eyes and his long hair a mess and he wishes suddenly and desperately for Eliza who always knew the perfect trick to tame his hair or even to help him sleep.</p><p>The great hall is quiet early in the morning and Alex can see a few teachers blearily sitting at the table as he pulls out parchment and begins to write. It is an essay he started the night before on the need for constitutional rights applicable to all sentient beings, life, liberty, and property, all that jazz (he does have to credit Jefferson for a great Declaration of Independence).</p><p>The hall fills up slowly but surely and Alex sips at the tea provided missing coffee like a second limb.</p><p>“How long have you been here Potter?”</p><p>Blaise asks as he slides onto the bench beside him. Alex blinks slowly pulling himself from a sentence on the necessary emancipation of House Elves and asks carefully, “Depends what time it is?”</p><p>“Around Eight.”</p><p>“Oh, then since six I think.”</p><p>“Merlin, Potter that’s ridiculous.”</p><p>Blaise replies and Alex grins at the boy and says, “I have a lot of work to do.”</p><p>“We haven’t even been assigned homework yet Potter.”</p><p>Daphne says as she slides onto the bench beside him and peers at his sheets with narrowed eyes. Alex shrugs and replies, “Yes, but there’s so much I need to write about.”</p><p>“Like the need to define all sentient creatures as a person under the eyes of the law?”</p><p>Blaise asks peering at Alex’s sheet as well now. He nods and replies, “I doubt Wizarding Britain would be willing to go for non-sentient creatures too.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Daphne asks and Alex’s brow furrows as he glances between the two who are sporting equally confused expressions. Alex sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose adjusting his glasses as he replies, “Why not? If they’re sentient they are just as capable of free speech and action as you and I and yet they are tried by the same tribunal that deals with rampaging Nundus. They are unable to own property or even vote in a government which seeks to define their very existence. It’s like the issue of women’s suffrage,”</p><p>Both Daphne and Blaise’s eyes light up as he continues, “Women for the longest time were unable to vote and yet their government actively created laws that impacted them such as ones dealing with reproductive health or their roles in the home and the workplace, think Napoleon for example. They were seen as lesser just because they weren’t men and it’s the same for magical creatures, especially those with sentience, who like women would not only benefit from having a role in society they could improve it.”</p><p>Alex finishes and gasps quietly for breath as he reaches out for a glass of water, it’s been too long since he’s done public speaking he really should practice. Still, it seems he is not entirely out of practice as the whole Slytherin table has gone silent and more than a few of the upper years are regarding him with thoughtful eyes.</p><p>Blaise and Daphne both look slightly shocked but Daphne is nodding along in agreement and she eventually says, “I can see what you mean Potter. But I doubt an essay will change anything.”</p><p>“It’s happened before, it’s all about public sentiment really.”</p><p>Alex replies with a shrug and pauses and glances at the ceiling where the owls are circling with the mail and newspapers. Huh, he should get on that. Alex doesn’t expect anything but he watches Draco who looks pale and is picking at his breakfast.</p><p>Draco receives a letter and Alex watches as he opens it with shaking hands all the while attempting to maintain an apathetic expression that fails to hide how pale he is. Draco sets the letter down a moment later his expression is utterly shattered.</p><p>Alex rises to his feet ignoring Blaise and Daphne’s questions as he makes his way across the great hall and towards the Hufflepuff table. He can feel the eyes of damn near everyone in the hall as he sits beside Draco and asks softly, “Are you okay?”</p><p>Draco turns to him with wide eyes and Alex waits patiently and is reminded of his children once more. Draco blinks back what are obviously tears and whispers, “My father is not happy with where I have been placed, he believes I should have been in Slytherin.”</p><p>“And your mother?”</p><p>Alex asks quietly and Draco glances at the second letter and replies, “She says it doesn’t matter as long as I uphold our family’s honour.”</p><p>“And what matters more your father or your mother’s opinion?”</p><p>Draco looks at Alex with wide eyes before he answers, “My mother’s.”</p><p>“You’ll be okay then Draco. Hufflepuff is about loyalty, they’re good at finding things, and are determined and resilient, if you apply yourself you will do well and that’s what really matters. If you need to talk let me know.”</p><p>Alex pats Draco on the shoulder and returns to his table feeling the eyes of everyone once more as he sits in between Blaise and Daphne who are studying him with narrowed eyes, he grins unrepentantly at them and glances at his falcon, Liberty, who is clutching a copy of the Prophet, and staring at him, Alex gets the feeling she is annoyed. He gives her a piece of bacon and scans the farce of a newspaper and then returns to his essay.</p><p>“Eat something Potter.”</p><p>Blaise finally says handing him a muffin and Alex complies.</p><p>“Your timetable Mr. Potter.”</p><p>Snape’s oily voice sounds over his shoulder and Alex pulls himself away from his writing and takes the piece of parchment with a neutral expression feeling as if the professor already dislikes him though Alex can’t imagine why.</p><p>“Thank you, sir.”</p><p>The man nods and continues down the table. Alex watches for a moment before he returns to his essay, he’ll finish this paragraph then head to class.</p><p>He is late for class.</p><p>McGonagall fixes him with narrowed but slightly amused eyes and asks, “Did you get lost Mr. Potter?”</p><p>He can feel the eyes of his classmates, Slytherin and Ravenclaw, trained on him as Alex nods and replies, “The stairs were particularly unwilling to cooperate with me Professor.”</p><p>She sighs pinching her brow and orders, “Take a seat Potter.”</p><p>The class is interesting, attempting to turn a needle into a match seems like a basic concept at first but Alex finds that reading about magic and using it is slightly different. He searches for the feel of his magic, it is a sparking thing inside his chest that reminds him of gunpowder and torches, he fans them into a blaze and on the second attempt the needle is transformed into a match.</p><p>“How did you do it so quickly?”</p><p>Hermione asks where she has settled next to him ignorant of the cold eyes of both Blaise and Daphne. Alex tilts his head and replies, “Magic is all about intent and I suppose belief, you have to believe that if you will it the needle will become a match. Or I suppose you must convince the needle that it has always been a match.”</p><p>Alex trails off as a thought occurs and glances at the match stick in his hands. Hermione huffs but nods and returns to her own needle with a wave of her wand. Professor McGonagall passes by and eyes Alex’s match stick with a critical eye before she nods with the shadow of a smile.</p><p>“Our next class is potions, right?”</p><p>Alex asks as they file out of the classroom and he tucks his wand back into the holster he had bought on his second trip to Diagon Alley. Blaise nods adjusting his bag as they begin the long trudge towards the dungeon. Daphne grins viciously and flicks her hair over her shoulder as she adds, “We have it with the Gryffindors and Snape apparently shows the Slytherins a lot of favouritism.”</p><p>“Excellent our Professors aids and abets in continuing the cycle.”</p><p>Alex replies sarcastically as they pass a group of Gryffindor second years who glare at them as if they personally shot their mothers. Blaise raises a brow and Daphne huffs and crosses her arms over her chest as they pause in front of the classroom door and asks, “Are you insinuating that Snape showing favouritism is bad?”</p><p>“Any teacher showing favouritism isn’t the best.”</p><p>Blaise states and Alex nods and adds, “Really it only makes the hatred of Slytherin house worse even if it is nice to feel it the other way around for once.”</p><p>Before either of them can respond the door creaks open and they file into the classroom, Alex picks a seat near the front and grins when Blaise settles beside him with a resigned sigh. Alex observes the classroom with curious eyes, the different cauldrons hanging on the walls, the sinks, the vials and beakers, the different ingredients; it all reminds him of a cross between the science labs at school and a kitchen but definitely more atmospheric.</p><p>The door to the classroom shuts with a bang and the students all jump, Alex for a slightly different reason, as Professor Snape storms into the room his robs flaring behind him like the wings of a bat. The Professor surveys the classroom with narrow eyes and barely hidden annoyance that makes Alex question why the man is even teaching.</p><p>“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion making, as there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.”</p><p>Snape begins his voice drifting almost eerily through the classroom, attempting to ensnare the impressionable minds of the children around him, Alex has to hand it to him it is an excellent speech. The Professor’s eyes narrow on Alex and he snaps suddenly, “Potter! What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood.”?</p><p>Alex considers the question for a moment before he replies, “I believe it is Draught of the Living Death sir but I could be mistaken.”</p><p>Snape’s eyes seem to burn with hatred as the man nods curtly and says, “Correct. Longbottom where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?”</p><p>“The… uh the stomach of a-a goat sir.”</p><p>Neville stammers out looking pale even in the cold light of the dungeon. Alex watches Snape’s expression twist in displeasure and is reminded suddenly of his tutors on Nevis, they were the kind of people who delighted in tormenting children and Snape doesn’t seem to be cut of a different cloth.</p><p>“Correct,” Snape grounds out the word like it a poison a bezoar can’t cure and continues, “What is the difference, Weasley, between monkshood and wolfsbane?"</p><p>“I’m not sure sir.”</p><p>Ron replies his cheeks are red and he looks either furious or embarrassed. A sallow imitation of a grin spreads across Snape’s face as he says, “Never bothered to read the course books Weasley? They are the same.”</p><p>“I bet he has to share with his brothers that’s why.”</p><p>Theo sneers and Alex turns, anger a familiar anger, building in his gut, and states, “I think most families share things it certainly shows something that you seem to be lacking Nott.”</p><p>The air stills for a moment as Nott scowls face flushing and features twisting, Alex hazards a glance at Ron who is smiling into his chest, and then at Snape who looks furious. Alex juts his chin out prepared for whatever disciplinary actions Snape tries to shovel onto him.</p><p>“Your instructions are on the board,” Snape says after a long moment where Alex can see the man weighing his options, he pulls out a pocket watch and states, “You have forty minutes.”</p><p>The other students move in a frenzy as Blaise pulls out his cauldron and wordlessly sets it between the two of them, Alex pulls out his ingredients and checks the instructions on the board as he begins cutting the hazel finely.</p><p>“Be careful Potter, accidents can happen in the potions classroom.”</p><p>Nott says in a low voice as he passes their table ‘accidently’ brushing against it, Alex rolls his eyes casting a quick stabilizing spell along with a low level protective shield that he gets on the second try as he replies, “Sure because the potions classroom is the best space to try and enact revenge while potentially endangering all of our lives, genius idea.”</p><p>“Enough Potter let him be.”</p><p>Blaise says in a resigned tone as Alex passes the sliced Hazel. He pouts but nods and glances at the instructions once more and asks, “It’s not very specific huh? I don’t think most of us have even been properly taught how to hold a knife.”</p><p>“Perhaps it’s supposed to be a learning experience.”</p><p>“In which we all fail and are encouraged to practice dicing and chopping in our free time?”</p><p>Alex retorts as he stirs the potion once clockwise and then twice counter clockwise and adds, “I found this interesting potion book and a lot of the things that don’t really make sense at first glance actually have logical reasons behind them.”</p><p>“Isn’t that usually how it is?”</p><p>Blaise asks as he adds in the powdered unicorn horn. Alex hums in agreement thinking of healing properties and the difference between freely given and shed. After thirty minutes their potion is a pleasant shade of blue, Alex hazards a glance and notices the other potions are in various shades from mud brown to hot pink with only a few leaning towards blue.</p><p>Alex takes the bottles from Blaise and carefully labels them before taking them up to Snape. The Professor takes the vials with a sour expression studying Alex’s with narrow eyes before he pronounces, “Acceptable.”</p><p>He bites back a retort, he can do this much, and trudges back to their table to aid Blaise in cleaning up as he says, “You can hand them in next time.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I swear Snape has something against me.”</p><p>Blaise doesn’t reply and Alex turns to see Blaise raising a brow with a helpless shrug. Alex frowns but lets it be as he puts his cauldron away and helps Blaise clean the stirring rods. Finally, the class is over and Alex waits as the other children file out of the classroom watching Snape with as much patience as he can muster.</p><p>“Have I done something wrong sir?”</p><p>Alex asks when he is the last student in the classroom. Snape’s eyes narrow staring at Alex like a bug to be squashed, there is something pained and maybe nostalgic to Snape’s eyes that reminds him of talking about the war with the other former soldiers, the sort of wound it leaves.</p><p>“No. Dismissed Potter.”</p><p>Snape finally says and Alex frowns but turns and leaves the classroom. Alex can be patient and baring that he is relentless but at the moment he focuses on not being late to his next class and ignoring Blaise’s curious expression when he settles into a seat beside him in charms.</p><p> </p><p>The first week of classes passes quickly and at the same time incredibly slow. Alex enjoys McGonagall’s class and finds that even though she is strict she is an excellent teacher. Charms with Professor Flitwick is educational though the short professor has a tendency to squeak about Alex being a prodigy like his mother. History of Magic is a complete and utter waste of time, so much that most of the students use it as an excuse to nap, Alex checks out books from the library and conducts his own studies (apparently magic played a role in the American Revolution and Alex cannot help but remember Laf’s strange half-conversations).</p><p>Speaking of checking out books, Alex quickly discovers and inhabits the library. The librarian, Madame Pince, quickly becomes familiar with the sight of Alex hunched over one text or another with an ever-growing stack beside him as he reads whichever text he can get his hands on.</p><p>Herbology is fun there’s something almost therapeutic to digging his fingers through the dirt even if he’ll never have the green thumb Eliza had. Professor Sprout is kind and Alex has the class with Draco so he always stands beside him and let’s Draco ramble softly about the letters from his parents and how nice everyone in Hufflepuff is even though they have no reason to be. They have potions again and Snape basically ignores Alex’s existence which he supposes is better than outright hatred. Defence is slightly boring as the teacher stutters through nearly every sentence and Alex finds the defensive and offensive spells they practice, come to him with ease.</p><p>The only truly interesting thing is their flying lessons with Professor Hooch.</p><p>The lawn is green and the Scotland air is cold as the Slytherins stand in a clustered huddle opposite the Gryffindors, Alex waves to Ron and Neville as Daphne continues to ramble about the newest fashion trends for witches which Alex half-heartedly agrees sounds ridiculous.</p><p>Professor Hooch appears and they are led to two rows of brooms, Alex stares for a moment as realisation hits him that they are going to ride honest to God brooms before he shrugs and stands beside one near Blaise.</p><p>“Now I want you to hold your hand over the broom and say up, you have to mean it.”</p><p>The Professor states and Alex studies the broom for a moment before he commands, “Up.”</p><p>The broom jumps into his hands and Alex can feel a faint thrum, something tingling over his skin as he grips the broom. He glances at Blaise who gets it on the second try and then to Daphne who is studying her broom with a quiet air of despair.</p><p>She notices both of them looking and with a sullen expression commands the broom once more, it jumps into her hand and she grins at the two of them. That’s when things go wrong, Alex only sees it out of the corner of his eye as Neville’s broom jerks into the air with the boy attached. Professor Hooch attempts to immobilize the broom but before that happens Neville falls off of his broom and lands on the ground with a small crack.</p><p>Alex flinches at the sound, remembering other broken bones, the screams of dying horses, and the feel of mud tugging at his standard issue boots. He inhales shakily and feels Blaise’s hand on his arm grounding him into the present as Neville is ushered inside.</p><p>Leaving a group of children alone without adult supervision is never a good idea.</p><p>“What’s this?”</p><p>Nott’s voice rings out and Alex watches as he picks up a red marble-like object. Blaise’s eyes narrow his hand still warm on Alex’s arm as he announces, “That’s Longbottom’s remembrall.”</p><p>Nott whips around with a sneer across his features, twisting them, and Alex frowns straightening his shoulders and narrowing his eyes at the boy as Nott says, “Well mine now I suppose. Not like it worked for Longbottom, he’s useless I’m not even sure why they accepted him.”</p><p>“I don’t think finders keepers applies in this situation Nott. Pass it over.”</p><p>Alex says and he can feel the Gryffindors’ eyes on him along with the rest of his house. Unity is important but Alex will stand for his own beliefs over playing nice with an idiot any day. Nott’s eyes narrow at Alex and he can see all the anger of the past week coalescing into one decision as Nott shakes his head with a smirk and states, “No I don’t think I will.”</p><p>He grabs hold of a broom and Alex rolls his eyes and pulls out his wand and says, “Arresto momentum.”</p><p> Nott freezes his broom hovering a few feet off the ground. Alex walks forward with a grin and takes the Remembrall and casually walks over to place it in Ron’s hands with a grin. The redhead grins back and Alex saunters over to Daphne and Blaise as he ends the spell.</p><p>“When did you learn that spell?”</p><p>Daphne asks softly as Nott lowers his broom to the ground and glares at Alex. He shrugs and says, “I practice a lot.”</p><p>“When?” Blaise asks bewildered and continues, “Do you even sleep Harry?”</p><p>“On occasion.”</p><p>Alex replies and then Professor Hooch returns studying the group with narrow eyes. After that they are dismissed but by lunch word of what has happened as circulated through the school as gossip often does. Nott glares at Alex for the rest of the week.</p><p> </p><p>September drips into October as the leaves change into beautiful hues of red and gold reminding Alex of the mess bustling with the fall harvest and the high spirits after the battles of Brandywine and Trenton.</p><p>“Do you know what time it is Harry?”</p><p>Blaise’s familiar voice asks right next to him and he starts pulling himself from the monstrosity of a tome he had been reading to glance at his friend. Scrunching his brow in thought Alex adjusts his glasses and says, “Dinner time?”</p><p>“No, you missed dinner time you dolt, it’s almost curfew.”</p><p>“Already?”</p><p>Alex whines glancing at the book with a pout knowing Blaise is going to drag him away before he can finish what he was reading. Blaise glances between Alex and the book with a raised brow before he asks, “What are you even reading this time? I know you’ve already finished your homework.”</p><p>“It’s about reincarnation.”</p><p>Alex admits casually but the words are heavy, filling the air with tension as Blaise’s brow furrows and he narrows his eyes at Alex and he hurries to explain, “Draco was mentioning that he’s been having strange dreams lately and I just wanted to see if I could help.”</p><p>“And you think he’s a reincarnate?”</p><p>“It’s a possibility. Apparently, souls often reincarnate in cycles and can remember things through dreams.”</p><p>Blaise stares at Alex for a long moment with a pensive expression before he sighs catching a glimpse of Pince and says, “Come on, the prefects get angry when they have to let us in because you were in here all night.”</p><p>Alex flashes Blaise his best pleading eyes but Blaise is surprisingly resistant and locks his arm around Alex tugging him out of the chair and nodding to the librarian as he forces him into the dungeon and into the common room where a prefect nods at Blaise and Alex rolls his eyes; it hasn’t happened that often, only a few times (ten times so far).</p><p>“Do you really believe in reincarnation?”</p><p>Blaise asks from his bed in the darkness of their room. Alex rolls over to stare at his friend and replies without hesitation, “Yes.”</p><p>There is no response and Alex lets the exhaustion he feels quell the racing thoughts of all he has to do, there is so much work to be done.</p><p> </p><p>Before Alex realises it, it’s Halloween, which has apparently become a commercial monstrosity, and Alex has finished all of his assigned homework (his teachers have resorted to pressing a limit on him or he will submit (wonderfully written) fifteen-page essays). Even as his housemates seem cheery at the prospect of the Halloween feast Alex cannot help but feel the weight of all he has lost both in this life and the last.</p><p>It is the anniversary of the night his parents died.</p><p>It is also Samhain, the one night of the year when the barrier between life and death is at its thinnest and Alex is reminded of lighting candles with the children one for each member of the family that was gone (Peggy gone too quickly, one for Washington once he had passed, his mother, John).</p><p>“You’re not coming to the feast?”</p><p>Daphne asks as she finishes touching up her hair, Blaise has been saddled with the duty of holding the mirror up for her to see. Alex shakes his head, his throat feels clogged and his stomach uneasy as he replies, “Not something I want to celebrate. I think I’ll just stay and work on that essay I’m thinking of submitting to the Prophet.”</p><p>Blaise and Daphne trade a glance loaded with unspoken communication but Alex can pick up on concern and it warms his chest slightly from the chill that has invaded and made a home. Blaise sets the mirror down and says, “Do you want us to save you anything?”</p><p>“No, I know where the kitchens are, my lips are sealed Daphne.”</p><p>She pouts and then rolls her eyes, “Are you still seriously considering submitting your essay under the pseudonym Publius?”</p><p>“Why shouldn’t I submit my essays?”</p><p>Alex asks tilting his head and Blaise grins and says, “That’s not what she was asking and you know it.”</p><p>“Have fun, tell me if Nott does anything I can insult him about later.”</p><p>“You are insatiable.”</p><p>“And ridiculous, you forgot ridiculous.”</p><p>Blaise adds with a teasing grin as Daphne ruffles Alex’s hair and darts out of the common room. Blaise rests a comforting hand on his shoulder and Alex smiles reassuringly at his friend and tilts his head at the door, Blaise rolls his eyes and goes leaving Alex alone.</p><p>Alex sits down with his essay in the empty common room and attempts to write but the words are stilted, sealed up inside his head and refusing to be placed onto parchment. He groans in frustration and paces around the common room eyeing the tomes on the shelves, some of which are less than legal. Alex is thankful that for the most part the first-years are left alone as he has watched more than a few of the more vicious Slytherin power plays. Though, he is more than prepared to deal with it.</p><p>Sighing, Alex places his essay away and decides a walk might help. There is something calming about Hogwarts and he has spent more than a few nights wandering with careful feet. The corridors are empty and Alex steers away from the great hall as he walks around the first floor speaking silently to the portraits that are awake and nodding to the suits of armour.</p><p>“Harry?”</p><p>A voice calls and Alex whips around to see Draco Malfoy standing at the end of the hallway. The boy rushes forward and Alex waves slightly confused as to what Draco could be doing rather than eating at the feast.</p><p>“What are you doing here?”</p><p>Alex asks and Draco frowns and replies, “Haven’t you heard? Professor Quirrell said there’s a troll in the dungeon everyone is being directed to their dorms except for the Slytherins who are staying in the great hall.”</p><p>“I wasn’t at dinner, it’s well…” Alex pauses and sees recognition flash over Draco’s face and he continues, “How did a troll get in here? The wards are supposed to prevent that, unless they’ve been tampered with? Which should be impossible unless it was done by someone inside the building.”</p><p>Before Draco can respond they hear a scream. Alex and Draco trade a look before Alex is racing down the hallway tugging out his wand as they round the corner to see the troll. It is absolutely massive, and very ugly, with grey skin and boulder like features.</p><p>“Troll skin is magic resistant.”</p><p>Alex calls out as he watches the troll turn slowly towards the two of them. Behind the troll Alex can see a familiar shock of bushy brown hair. Draco nods and replies, “So, something physical would be our best bet?”</p><p>“Leviosa.”</p><p>Alex says and waves his wand focusing on a broken piece of the floor levitating it above the troll’s head. It glances up and reaches out to swat the tile when Draco calls out, “Hey, you ugly piece of stone!”</p><p>It’s not very creative all things considered.The troll narrows its dull eyes and roars but Alex takes that moment to drop the debris on the troll’s head. It cracks in two and the troll blinks dazedly for a moment before it keels forward. Alex tugs Draco out of the way as the troll collapses with a large thump and a cloud of dust.</p><p>Alex spends a moment waiting to see if the troll will wake before he clambers across the rubble towards Hermione and calls out, “Hermione are you okay?”</p><p>“I’m fine there’s just some debris.”</p><p>She calls back as Draco follows him. Hermione is curled against the wall a piece of debris pinning her leg to the ground and her wand just out of reach, she is otherwise okay but for the fine dust that coats her robes.</p><p>Alex levitates the debris away and asks, “What were you doing here?”</p><p>Draco crouches over Hermione’s leg with a frown and pulls out his wand casting what Alex recognizes as a diagnostic spell used in healing. Hermione frowns the expression vulnerable as she grabs her wand and replies, “I-I just needed space.”</p><p>Before Alex can question Hermione if she is being bullied there is the sound of footsteps and a group of teachers round the corner as Draco says, “Your leg is fine just some bruising.”</p><p>“Good heavens!”</p><p>McGonagall announces staring at the scene with wide eyes, Alex focuses on Snape who is scowling at Quirrell and he glances at Dumbledore who looks strangely pleased at the sight of a couple of first-years defeating a troll.</p><p>“What happened? You three should be in your dorms.”</p><p>McGonagall demands and Alex glances at Draco and Hermione before he pipes up, “I was taking a walk because I didn’t want to attend the feast… it being the anniversary I didn’t feel like celebrating, when I ran into Draco and Hermione who were heading to their dorms.”</p><p>Sympathy burns across McGonagall’s face and he watches Snape’s face pale. McGonagall studies the three of them and says, “It was very dangerous and reckless to attempt to fight a troll alone.”</p><p>“But also, quite commendable.”</p><p>Dumbledore interrupts and McGonagall scowls and says, “Albus!”</p><p>“I am just thankful no one is hurt, except for the troll. Snape, McGonagall if you could escort the children back to their dorms?”</p><p>They nod and Alex rises unsteadily to his feet as the adrenaline fades and with a last glance at Draco and Hermione, Alex follows Snape out of the rather destroyed corridor. Snape is silent as they make their way to the dungeons, and Alex is relieved he doesn’t have to deal with a lecture.</p><p>The common room is bustling as apparently everyone has been escorted back. Daphne notices him first and her face pinches with surprise and worry as she abandons Millicent and is quickly followed by Blaise as she asks, “Harry are you alright?”</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Alex glances around the common room and can feel the weight of the upper years’ attention. He plasters on a pleasant smile and shakes his head pulling them to a small secluded corner and talks about his essay until conversation picks up and he can cast a privacy spell.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Blaise asks again and Alex winces and says quietly, “I uh found the troll?”</p><p>“Alex!”</p><p>Daphne hisses and Alex muffles a flinch and shrugs apologetically and adds, “Well technically it found us.”</p><p>“Us?”</p><p>“I took a walk to clear my head and bumped into Draco who told me about the troll, then we heard a scream and well uh there was the troll.”</p><p>His two friends stare at him in disbelief for a long moment and Alex wants to laugh or maybe cry as he curls deeper into the plush chair. Blaise must notice, he always does, and asks softly, “Are you okay?”</p><p>“I’m fine, just tired.”</p><p>Alex replies knowing it’s a reasonable enough excuse and somewhat true. Blaise and Daphne share a look before Blaise says, “How about we retire early tonight and you can have the candy we saved for you tomorrow?”</p><p>“You guys saved me some candy?”</p><p>Alex asks with wide eyes and Daphne grins and nods even as Blaise loops and arm through Alex’s and tugs him to his feet with a promise of, “Tomorrow.”</p><p>Alex collapses onto his bed and lets his eyes slide shut thinking of his family as the sound of Blaise’s shuffling around fills the room. Eventually the sounds stop and Blaise’s voice fills the room, “Is everything truly okay, Harry?”</p><p>“I miss them. Is it weird to miss people you’ve never really known?”</p><p>Alex says softly and wonders what Lily and James would have been like as parents; he likes to think they would have been good parents. The bed dips and Alex opens his eyes to see Blaise sitting there, he smiles at Alex, a tender smile, and says, “I don’t think it’s weird. Sometimes I still miss my dad even though I never really knew him.”</p><p>Blaise cards a hand through Alex’s hair gently before he turns and slips into his own bed. The touch lingers at the forefront of his mind as Alex thinks of his children, his family, Eliza, his friends, everyone he once knew who is gone.</p><p> </p><p>Winter blankets the grounds in a thick blanket of snow and Christmas proceeds to sneak up on Alex until he is in the main hall staring at the monstrous tree in dawning realisation. Alex curses aloud and Daphne turns to him bundled in her thick coat, with a raised brow.</p><p>“I forgot Christmas was a thing.”</p><p>“You forgot?”</p><p>Daphne says the words flat and seeming to echo. Alex nods once and Daphne sighs and murmurs, “What am I supposed to do with you?”</p><p>“Help me buy gifts for everyone?”</p><p>Alex pleads turning his best puppy dogs on Daphne who stares at him for a long moment before demanding, “Help me with my potions essays for this year and we’ll call it a deal.”</p><p>He wisely doesn’t mention that he is already doing that and shakes on it. Daphne drags him to the common room and returns with a thick magazine explaining, “You can owl order things express but it will cost extra. Are you going home for the holidays?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Alex replies simply and Daphne studies him for a long moment before she nods and passes the magazine over saying, “I am and Blaise is.”</p><p>“I think Neville and Ron are staying.”</p><p>Alex reassures Daphne that he won’t be alone, her face twists aware of what he is doing, or judging him for mentioning them before she points at a scarf and says, “Something like this and chocolate is good for friends, but for close friends you should get something more personal.”</p><p>Christmas is a quiet affair, Alex spends the day reading in the library, Neville and Ron join him at one point and coax him outside to play in the snow and join in on a snowball fight. Dinner is a similarly quiet affair with only a few students in the building they sit at one long table with the teachers Alex argues that Wizard Chess is an insult to actual chess with Ron.</p><p>Alex wakes Christmas morning with something tender in his chest reminding him of his children opening their gifts and Eliza tucked under his arm as he enters the common room, the sixth year prefect, Flint, who is often quiet and grim but hasn’t acted violently towards Alex, waves a greeting and directs him to a pile of presents sitting under the common room tree.</p><p>His eyes widen, a part of him still expecting a pair of too big socks from the Dursleys and only that, a part of him still quietly asks, “Is this for me?”</p><p>“Merry Christmas, Potter.”</p><p>“Merry Christmas Flint.”</p><p>Alex replies with a grin and reaches out opening one of the presents. There is chocolate from Ron and Neville, along with a knit scarf from the Weasley matriarch, a set of ball-point pens that have been enchanted from Hermione which surprises Alex but he is thankful he bought something for her anyways. At some point Flint returns to his dorm and it is just Alex.</p><p>From Draco there is a beautiful self-inking quill, from Daphne there is a set of dress robes and a promise to force him into clothing befitting of his station. From Blaise, there are a few tomes, obviously highly illegal and dark, that he writes, “-will surely help you with your plans to take over the world.”</p><p>Alex grins and carefully tucks the books out of sight before pulling out the last package, it is flimsy in his hands and he searches for a letter finding only, “Your father left this in my position and I thought it was time you received it. Treat it with care.”</p><p>The wrapping paper shifts to reveal a strangely patterned fabric and when Alex puts his hand under the fabric his mouth drops open because his hand is gone. Alex tugs the fabric further over his shoulders and gapes as more of his arm disappears; it is an invisibility cloak.</p><p>Alex decides that the break just got a lot better considering he can now possibly sneak into the restricted section of the library.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Life attempts to settle back into a rhythm; attempt being the key word.</p><p>“Detention Nott.”</p><p>Snape snaps as Alex watches an Ashwinder egg bounce off the protective shield he had put in place before even starting the potion, it’s one of the more advanced ones considering Nott is particularly determined to sabotage one of Alex’s potions.</p><p>Nott pales and then goes an angry blotchy red glaring at Alex all throughout the rest of the class as Alex finishes his potion with Blaise feeling the weight of Nott’s eyes on his spine the entire time.</p><p>“I challenge you to a duel Potter.”</p><p>Nott snaps as they all filter out of the classroom at once eager to escape Snape’s foul mood. Alex raises a brow and catches Blaise’s drawn expression as he replies, “I accept.”</p><p>“The trophy room tonight after curfew.”</p><p>Nott hisses and whirls away as if they aren’t all going to the same class. Alex turns to Blaise and asks, “So, how do wizard duels work? I know how regular duels work, are they similar?”</p><p>“Why would you accept?”</p><p>Blaise asks as they follow the crowd of students up the stairs. Alex tilts his head and asks, “Why wouldn’t I? To refuse would be cowardly. Now do I need to find a second?”</p><p>(Maybe because the last duel he was in he died. But that was different wasn’t it?)</p><p>“No, you don’t need a second though I imagine it might be useful to have one. There is supposed to be a witness usually.”</p><p>“And I suppose we don’t need a doctor on sight? Or to count to ten?”</p><p>Blaise stares at him for a long moment clearly resigned and exasperated as they approach charms and adds, “I don’t even want to know why you know so much about traditional dueling. You stand ten feet apart and then you start usually by mutual agreement once you are in a dueling stance.”</p><p>Alex shrugs as they enter the classroom mulling over what the duel might bring, if Nott is even brave enough to show up.</p><p>“Draco.”</p><p>Alex calls out as he is leaving the great hall, having been forced to eat lunch by Daphne and Blaise. The blond boy stops and spins flashing Alex a smile as they step out of the main hallway and into a smaller one. Alex grins before his expression twitches to something serious as he says, “I need to ask you something.”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>Draco replies with a curious expression and Alex sucks in a breath and says, “Nott challenged me to a duel and I was wondering if you would be willing to be my second?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Draco replies without hesitation and Alex grins and replies, “Thank you, it’s tonight in the trophy hall after curfew, I’ll meet you outside your common room.”</p><p>“You know where it is?”</p><p>Draco asks with a raised brow as they merge with a group of first years heading towards the greenhouses. Alex grins and replies, “I know where all of them are. The Ravenclaw dorm is really easy to get into, you just have to answer a riddle.”</p><p>“That’s all?”</p><p>Draco asks and Alex nods even as Professor Sprout bustles into the classroom and begins her lesson.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Alex slips quietly out of the common room, without the cloak as it’s safer, through the secret door behind the fire place, he found it in his first week, and heads towards the Hufflepuff common room on soft feet. Draco is waiting outside nervously tapping his wand against his arm but when he sees Alex he breaks into an excited smile and Alex can’t help but smile back that familiar rush of adrenaline coursing through his chest.</p><p>The trophy room is empty when they arrive and Alex’s eyes are immediately drawn to the dusty bronze pieces scanning over the names until he finds James Potter on one of the Quidditch ones. He trails his fingers over the name for a long moment, physical proof of his parent’s existence before the sound of footsteps make themselves known.</p><p>Nott approaches with Crabbe looming behind him looking indifferent or maybe just uncomprehending. Nott sneers when he sees Alex and asks, “Ready Potter?”</p><p>Alex nods and takes his place holding his wand in loose fingers, it is different to the weight of a pistol and he focuses on that and nods once at Draco before facing Nott. There is a cold feeling in his chest but he pushes it away. Draco’s voice cuts through the air as he states, “Begin.”</p><p>“Expelliarmus!”</p><p>Nott’s wand flies from his hands and Alex grins viciously at the boy as he bows tucking his wand back into his holster, tempted to ask if he yields. If he focuses on that he doesn’t have to think about Weehawken, dawn, the same spot where his son died, the pain. He can’t fall apart not now. Can’t think about it. He’s okay, Alex tries to keep telling himself this until he believes it.</p><p>The sound of footsteps echoes down the hall jolting Alex from his spiraling thoughts and he flashes Draco wide eyes as Nott and Crabbe flee. Evidently, they have the right idea and Alex is reminded suddenly of the duel against Charles Lee.</p><p>Alex and Draco run quietly down the hallway and they can hear Mrs. Norris, Filch’s cat, nearby as they clamber onto a set of moving staircases which inevitably land at the third floor. Alex trades a glance with Draco whose expression is twisted strangely as they run down the hallway pausing at a large set of doors.</p><p>“Should we go in?”</p><p>Alex asks breathlessly but Draco doesn’t respond and Alex studies his friend with narrowed eyes, Draco’s breathing is irregular, like he can’t quite get enough air and not just because they were running, his pupils are dilated, and his face is pale.</p><p>Mrs. Norris meows down the hallway and Alex makes a decision as he tugs on Draco’s hand and pulls him into the room shutting the door behind him with a soft click.</p><p>“Draco are you okay?”</p><p>Alex asks softly hands warm against Draco’s cold skin where he feels his forehead. Draco makes a pained noise in the back of his throat and sways unsteadily. Alex frowns and glances around the room noticing the rather large dog with three heads sleeping on the ground over what looks like a trapdoor. Huh.</p><p>“We need to leave Draco okay?”</p><p>Alex whispers softly as he pushes open the door with a slight squeak and pulls Draco back into the hallway pausing for breath to see if Mrs. Norris is nearby. It is silent and Alex pulls Draco away from the door with gentle fingers until they are what he dubs a safe enough distance away.</p><p>“Draco?”</p><p>Alex asks tapping his friend gently and receiving no response but the ragged sound of his breathing. Frowning, Alex asks, “Can you hear me?”</p><p>Draco nods. Alex shivers reminded of soldiers who got stuck inside their own heads trapped there by the war; it had happened to him a few times memories consuming his waking moments. Alex scrunches his brow in thought and asks, “Can you breathe with me?” he nods and Alex continues, “Okay good, in and out, just keep breathing you’re okay, you’re safe, we’re at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Alexander?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Alex replies instinctively the word bursting from his mouth after so long without hearing his name. Draco’s eyes clear slightly, he blinks and stares at Alex with tears watering in his eyes as he asks again, “Alex?”</p><p>“John?”</p><p>Alex replies in a sudden moment of clarity and suddenly he has an armful of Draco, John, sobbing into his chest. Alex tightens his arms around John burying his nose in his shoulder as he rubs his hands gently over his spine and John whispers, “I thought I was insane. Thought I was alone. God I’m so sorry Alexander.”</p><p>“John.”</p><p>Alex replies helplessly repeating the name like it’s a prayer that might absolve him of his sins. His fingers tighten in John’s robes and he feels his eyes burn with tears as John laughs a wet croaky laugh and says, “I should have known it was you. All the writing you do.”</p><p>“I can’t help it John. I missed you, God I missed you so much, I needed you.”</p><p>Alex’s voice breaks and he buries his head further in John’s shoulder to muffle the words. John stiffens and pulls back for a second his hands are still cold against Alex’s skin as he tilts his head up to look into John’s grey eyes, “I’m sorry Alexander. I just couldn’t…”</p><p>John trails off and Alex replies softly, “I know. I’m just happy you’re here now.”</p><p>“Are there others?”</p><p>John asks tentatively and Alex frowns and shakes his head, “No one that remembers at least. But the hat insinuated there were others.”</p><p>“Fuck I can’t believe this, magic, England.”</p><p>“It’s a lot to adjust to.”</p><p>Alex replies taking John’s hands and just holding them feeling his pulse. He never got to say goodbye, the letters just stopped until the one from Henry Laurens which had settled on his chest with cold grim certainty. John had been <em>gone.</em></p><p> John yawns and Alex muffles a grin feeling exhaustion dragging at his own limbs but knowing he won’t be able to sleep tonight regardless. Tugging John into a hug Alex states, “Come on I’ll walk you back to your dorm, we can talk about this more tomorrow.”</p><p>John frowns pulling back from Alex to stare at him for a long moment like he wants to suggest they stay together knowing its impossible before he nods. Carefully, Alex pulls John to his feet and they stumble quietly down the stairs and towards the Hufflepuff common room. Outside of the portrait John pulls Alex into a tight hug and Alex relishes in the feel of contact (he’s been starved of it) of John alive beneath his fingertips.</p><p>There is something eerie to Hogwarts at night, at least wandering alone there is. Alex doesn’t dawdle and makes his way to the dungeons on sure feet something light in his chest that is quickly quenched when he slips inside the common room and Snape says, “Detention Potter.”</p><p>“Yes sir.”</p><p>Alex says quietly not wanting to argue knowing the utter folly of even attempting it. He’s near certain that Nott probably scampered back early intent on telling on him and Snape has been waiting here for the better part of an hour, Nott probably got a detention for it as well; it’s a somewhat reassuring thought.</p><p>“Goodnight sir.”</p><p>Alex adds pausing for a moment on the stairs before he slips into his room and hides a smile at Blaise, who is sleeping as usual curled on his side into a tiny ball, the faint sound of talking filling the air in a gentle murmur as Alex pulls out a book on mythical creatures, if he was correct that was a Cerberus.</p><p> </p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>Blaise asks as Alex perks up upon seeing John enter the great hall quickly clambering from his seat he replies, “To see Jo- Draco.”</p><p>Before Blaise can respond Alex is already crossing the great hall and settling at the Hufflepuff table beside John, who turns and beams at Alex pulling him into a side-hug and ruffling his hair. Alex grins unrepentantly and snatches a piece of bacon.</p><p>“Are you technically allowed to sit here?”</p><p>John asks as he attempts to reacquisition his piece of bacon. Alex shrugs and says, “From what I’ve read there’s no rule against it technically except for feasts I think.”</p><p>“Not that you would listen anyway,” John pauses and his expression twists as he asks, “What happened… after?”</p><p>The words plummeting between the two of them reminding Alex of all John had never seen, he had never seen the afterbirth of their nation, only the messy beginning. Alex frowns, casting a quick privacy spell, and asks, “Have you read the history books?”</p><p>“I scoured a few of them last night but you’re not mentioned as often as Washington or Laf.”</p><p>“No,” Alex agrees thinking of Eliza who did everything she could after his death to preserve his memory, his face is on their currency which is beyond strange, he continues, “What is there to say really? Do you want a career summary, a list of my many failures? I don’t even know how to start.”</p><p>John frowns the expression fragile and Alex sighs and says, “Sorry, I know you didn’t get to see any of it and you want to hear it from me.”</p><p>“I do, I want to hear why you made whatever mistakes you thought you made, I want to hear about your triumphs, your successes from you, not some biographer who doesn’t understand political nuance.”</p><p>“You know, my son censored our letters.”</p><p>Alex comments casually and watches as John chokes on the toast he is eating and levels Alex with wide eyes as he asks, “You kept them?”</p><p>“Of course. I think historians are still debating whether we were particularly ‘friendly’ or if it was the language of the time.”</p><p>“Even with what your son censored?”</p><p>John asks with a grin the word son sounding strange on his tongue, Alex grins back and adds, “The one I sent you about my wedding still exists.”</p><p>A blush spreads over John’s cheeks as he huffs a soft laugh smiling with something tender at Alex he says, “You’ll tell me everything later?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Alex says bumping his shoulder against John’s as he dismantles the privacy spell, at the Slytherin table he can see Daphne and Blaise sharing a look and staring at him. Patting John on the shoulder he states, “I better head back to my own table before my housemates kidnap me. I’ll see you in Herbology, if you need anything you know where to find me.”</p><p>John nods and Alex steals another piece of bacon and walks back to the Slytherin table, squashing down the desire to kidnap John and hide somewhere for the rest of the day. Alex squishes beside Daphne as Blaise asks, “What was that?</p><p>Daphne adds, “I didn’t know you and Draco were so close.”</p><p>It is vaguely accusatory. Alex shrugs sipping at his black tea, he is no closer to convincing the House Elves that he should be granted coffee, and replies, “We figured out we have something in common.”</p><p>Blaise and Daphne share a conspiratorial look and Alex sighs and pulls out his recent Essay, one on the necessity to rephrase the Goblin Treatise of 1804, he has paid enough attention in history to understand that another Goblin rebellion could be imminent if the situation is not handled carefully.</p><p>A moment later he asks, “What’s with the cold shoulders from everyone?”</p><p>“We lost house points because of you last night.”</p><p>“And Nott,” Alex adds and tilts his head as he asks, “House points, are those the things the teachers are giving out?”</p><p>“Yes, what did you think they were?”</p><p>Blaise demands and Alex plasters a confused expression on his face as he stares at Blaise. A moment later it begins to crack and he grins ignoring Blaise’s long-suffering groan as he says, “I can’t believe I’m friends with you.”</p><p>“I don’t think you really have a choice.”</p><p>Daphne adds as she daintily sips her tea. Alex prepares to be offended before he thinks of Hercules saying something similar to Burr and says, “She’s right you know.”</p><p>Blaise plants his head on the table with a groan.  </p><p> </p><p>Two nights later he has his detention, Nott arrives at Snape’s office at the same time and glares at Alex as if it might set him on fire; he is definitely not powerful enough for that. The door creaks open and Snape looms over the two of them as he states quietly, “The Headmaster has asked that our groundskeeper Hagrid,” here a roll of his eyes, “handle your detention. Follow me.”</p><p>Why would the Headmaster intervene? Alex wonders as he follows Snape out of the dungeon and into the great hall, Nott glaring petulantly beside him like a toddler the whole time. Alex finds himself curious what the detention will consists of, Snape’s penchant for scrubbing cauldrons is well known.</p><p>Hagrid stands in the entrance hall with two other students, who as they draw closer Alex recognises as Ron and Neville. Alex recognises Hagrid as the man who directed them off the platform, the giant frowns at Snape and says, “Well come on then, best go while there’s still some light out.”</p><p>“We’re going outside?”</p><p>Nott asks fear thickening his voice as he glances at the doors. Hagrid grunts and says, “Yep, inta the Forbidden Forest.”</p><p>“Isn’t it uh Forbidden for a reason?”</p><p>Ron asks face pale as he glances at Neville who looks equally terrified. Alex feels the first cold stirring of fear in the pits of his stomach, he pushes it away with the experience of a seasoned soldier but can’t help but be reminded of the forests during the war, they had lost more than few good men to their boughs.</p><p>“I’ll leave you to it, please return my students at a reasonable time.”</p><p>Snape drawls the words cool and crisp with enjoyment and Alex watches as the man nods once to Alex a silent promise that he will be waiting in case anything goes wrong before the man turns with a flare of his robes and leaves. Hagrid surveys the four of them and states, “Well come on then.”</p><p>Alex follows behind the half-giant and steps into place beside Ron asking quietly, “What are you in for?”</p><p>Ron’s eyes are bright as he glances at Neville and crowds closer to Alex and admits, “Hagrid had a dragon egg he got from some shady dude and it hatched but my brother Charlie works at a dragon reserve in Romania so we smuggled the dragon out but got caught by McGonagall past curfew.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Alex questions in disbelief glancing at Hagrid as they stop at his cabin at the edge of the grounds. Neville nods in agreement and adds, “It was terrifying but kind of fun.”</p><p>“Why did Hagrid have a dragon egg?”</p><p>Alex asks as the man in question place a lamp in Nott’s hand and one in Neville’s, a dog, Fang, barks and exits the hut running circles around their small group. Alex glances at the forest, which looms menacingly in the distance as evening settles around them like the thick heavy curtains of the parlour room.</p><p>“Don’t know, said he got it from a guy at a bar.”</p><p>Ron says with a shrug and Alex’s brow furrows as he replies, “That’s pretty shady, you should ask Hagrid why he got it. Dragon eggs are fairly expensive.”</p><p>Neville beside Ron nods pensively in agreement as they duck under the eaves of the forest the sound of leaves crunching beneath their feet. Hagrid turns to face the four of them and announces, “Alright we’re looking for an injured unicorn, someone’s been attacking the herd.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Alex asks recalling that unicorns are perhaps one of the least-hostile mythical creatures and that the healing property of their horns is best gained willingly. Hagrid shakes his head with a heavy frown and replies, “Don’t know. See this here?” he points at a branch with a dark liquid on it, “This is the unicorn’s blood. I’mma split you into teams, meet back here after ten minutes alright? Nott and Weasley you’re together with me, Longbottom and Potter go with Fang.”</p><p>He frowns something at the edge of his mind a passage he had read that he can’t quite recall. Neville walks beside Alex with Fang loping beside him and asks, “Ready Harry?”</p><p>“Yeah, lead the way Neville.”</p><p>They walk in silence through the forest, it is dark and the wind shifts eerily through the trees, the light of the lantern flickers and catches on the pool of blood they are following. Neville frowns and states quietly, “I don’t understand how anyone could want to hurt a unicorn.”</p><p>“There’s something about their blood, it has healing properties I think,” Alex replies and then adds, “Generally, it’s the same type of people who feel no remorse about killing children.”</p><p>“You think it could be You-Know-Who?”</p><p>Neville asks voice shaky as the wind shifts and the trees around them seem to loom around them. Alex frowns, it’s a bit of a jump in logic and replies, “It’s unlikely.”</p><p>“My Nan doesn’t believe he’s truly gone, says it doesn’t feel resolved.”</p><p>Neville adds in a whisper as they enter a clearing. Alex stumbles to a halt at the sight of a unicorn lying on its side, there is a shadowy figure leaning over it and the scene feels frozen for a moment before Fang whines. The figure pauses turning towards them and Alex can see blood around the figure’s pale mouth as Fang turns tail and runs.</p><p>The figure rises to its feet, the movement stilted and unnatural and Alex’s head pulses suddenly with pain, it is all consuming as the figure drifts towards them. Neville steps in front of Alex wand held shakily in front of him as the figure draws closer.</p><p>The sound of hooves fills the clearing and what can only be a centaur bursts through the trees. The cloaked figure startles and flees as the centaur halts in front of Alex and Neville, he (Alex assumes he is male) turns towards them and states, “Dark things are abound in this forest it is not safe, come I will walk you back to Hagrid.”</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>Alex questions as they follow the centaur through the forest, Alex sticking close to Neville’s side. The centaur tilts his head with a dark frown and answers, “A wraith, a shadow of the past.”</p><p>“It’s been consuming the unicorn’s blood hasn’t it?”</p><p>Neville asks reaching out to grip Alex’s hand. The centaur nods and says, “Yes the blood of a Unicorn can provide life but to slay a creature so pure comes at a deadly cost, you are doomed to a cursed life, a half-life.”</p><p>Things were beginning to connect in Alex’s mind as he recalled the package that had been stolen from Gringotts early in the school year, the same vault he had visited with McGonagall, the Cerberus guarding the trap door. It was probably connected to the wraith, likely something that could prolong life; Alex still feels as if there are pieces missing.</p><p>“There ya are.”</p><p>Hagrid’s voice booms through the air as they halt at the edge of the forest. The centaur inclines his head and states, “There is a wraith in the forest it is the one killing the unicorns.”</p><p>“Thanks for letting me know Firenze.”</p><p>Hagrid replies expression grim. The centaur nods and with a final nod at Alex and Neville gallops back into the forest. Alex watches the centaur be swallowed by the darkness for a long moment before he turns to Hagrid who claps his hands together and says, “Aight that does it for your detention I’ll walk you back to the main hall then you go straight to bed.”</p><p>They follow Hagrid up the slope towards Hogwarts and Ron appears by his side and asks quietly, “What happened?”</p><p>“There was a figure it was drinking the unicorn’s blood.”</p><p>Neville replies bumping his shoulder lightly against Alex’s, he grins for a moment before asking, “What happened with you Ron?’</p><p>“Nott glared at me the whole time and Hagrid started expounding on the virtues of the many deadly creatures in the Forbidden Forest.”</p><p>Alex chuckles as they enter the great hall and he shivers only then realising how cold he is in the warmth of Hogwarts. Neville wraps an arm around his shoulders and Alex grins up at Neville who is pleasantly warm compared to Alex who always suffers in cold temperatures.</p><p>“Goodnight, Neville, Ron.”</p><p>Alex says quietly as Nott storms off down the hallway towards the dungeons. Ron grins at Alex and Neville pats his shoulder once before they turn towards the Gryffindor tower. Alex makes his way quickly to the dungeons, thoughts circling in his head of the figure, of how it is all possibly connected.</p><p>“Harry?”</p><p>Blaise asks as he sneaks into their room. Alex curses and replies, “Yeah?”</p><p>“Everything okay?”</p><p>“Yeah go back to sleep Blaise.”</p><p>Alex replies as he shrugs off his robes desperately wishing he could sneak into the library. Blaise rolls over one eye opening to stare at Alex for a long moment before he says, “Go to sleep, you look exhausted.”</p><p>“I always look exhaust- “</p><p>“Go to sleep.”</p><p>Blaise states and Alex complies with a roll of his eye setting his book down on famous figures in history and climbing into bed. Glancing at his friend in the darkness Alex whispers, “Goodnight”</p><p>“Goodnight Harry.”</p><p> </p><p>Alex lets his feet lead him as he focuses on his breathing, his chest is sore and he swears he can feel the bullet digging its way through his spine. In. Out. Part of him wants to find John and press his ear to his chest, listen to the steady rhythm of his chest like they used to do on bad nights, but the rest of him needs to be alone; Eliza used to say he should never be left alone she is usually right.</p><p>Hogwarts has always felt eerie at night but there is something in the air as Alex trails his fingers over the cold stone glancing at the sleeping portraits and out the windows at the grounds shrouded in darkness. It’s easier to focus on that then the gaping absence in his chest when he thinks about it. They’re gone, all of them.</p><p>His children, Eliza, Hercules, Lafayette, Washington, even Jefferson and Burr. Everything that shaped his existence is gone. His house, the streets he knew, the fields where they fought. Oh, he knows that some of it’s been preserved, but it’s an imitation of what once was, dulled by time.</p><p>His fingers stumble over empty air and Alex glances into an empty classroom, it is shrouded in dust, with white cloth covering desks and chairs reminding Alex of the much larger population size Hogwarts once hosted. Alex tilts his head as he catches a glimpse of something shiny and almost reflective.</p><p>With hesitant steps, Alex enters the classroom to investigate. At one end of the classroom is a large mirror, it has a gold frame with an inscription on the top and seems to dominate the room. Alex pauses in front of the mirror and cannot muffle a gasp at what he sees.</p><p>It’s him, as he was in the past, standing in the mirror, and surrounding him are his family and friends, Eliza has her arms looped around his waist, John is standing with Laf and Hercules holding drinks and dressed in their uniforms Washington standing behind them, his children are talking to each other laughing and happy in a way they hadn’t been since Philip died, and God he can see Philip there too.</p><p>He notices two figures in the background, they are vaguely familiar and it takes Alex a moment to connect them with the pictures he has seen of Lily and James Potter. Those are his parents the ones he never knew.</p><p>Alex reaches out with shaking fingers and touches the surface of the mirror, the adult him mirrors the movement and Alex cannot help the tears that pour down his cheeks. God it has been so long since he has seen any of them.</p><p>With a rough inhale, Alex glances at the inscription above the mirror which reads, Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi</p><p>"I show not your face but your heart's desire"</p><p>Alex whispers something sinking in his chest knowing that the image in front of him isn’t real, isn’t a way to speak with the dead, it is simply what his heart desires most. Once upon a time he imagines it might have shown his legacy but now it shows what he has lost.</p><p>Glancing into the mirror Alex stares at his family he wants a picture to hold onto but knows it is impossible, it is impossible to hold onto what is gone. With a harsh inhale, Alex turns away his chest aches and his eyes are sore as he wipes at the tears on his cheeks; he won’t show John the mirror. The hallways are still when Alex stumbles out of the room but he barely notices as he makes his way to the Hufflepuff common room.</p><p>He stands outside the door for a long moment desperately wishing for John to appear before he turns and walks to the dungeon.</p><p>Alex doesn’t sleep that night or the next.</p><p> </p><p>“I still can’t believe this is your first Quidditch game.”</p><p>Daphne says as she leans against Blaise’s side, he is the only one wearing the thick robes for winter, but to be fair spring is in the air just not in the evening. Alex who has applied multiple warming charms and is leaning against Blaise’s other side hums.</p><p>“That’s because this is the first one, we could successfully pull him out of the library for.”</p><p>Blaise says with a laugh staring at both of them with amusement in his eyes, Alex pouts thinking of the book he had been reading on alchemy and asks, “Do the games usually run so late? You promised that I would have time to finish the book I was reading.”</p><p>“I lied.”</p><p>Blaise replies with a grin even as Daphne shakes her head and says, “Not usually no. I think the games at school are only allowed to go for a day before it’s called a draw but in the professional world games can go on for months.”</p><p>Alex blinks and takes the information in trying to process it even as he watches the Slytherin players whip past their area of the arena, a blur of red, the Gryffindor players follow. Alexander has to admit it is exciting to watch, the game is high speed with five different things happening at once and he’s considering trying out for the team next year.</p><p> A cheer goes up from the Gryffindor team and Alex watches as the Seeker holds up the snitch, Blaise snorts and says, “Took him long enough, the only reason this game went so long is because both of the seekers are so incompetent.”</p><p>“Don’t be mean Blaise, it doesn’t suit you.”</p><p>Daphne says with a nasty grin as the students file out of the stands. Blaise twists his face at her and Alex grins and ducks out of the way of a hex and casts one in return at the third-year student as they make their way to the dungeons.</p><p>They settle in a couple of armchairs in the common room and Alex pulls out his book on famous figures and the sheet he has been compiling research on, casually he asks, “Do either of you know of something that creates immortality?”</p><p>Blaise and Daphne share a look and Alex hurries to explain, “Not for myself, research purposes.”</p><p>“Well there’s that thing Nicholas Flamel created what was it, Blaise?”</p><p>Daphne asks tilting her head at Blaise who frowns before saying, “I think it was a stone of some kind? The sorcerer’s stone? No.”</p><p>Alex vaguely remembers a chocolate frog card from Halloween and asks, “The Philosopher’s stone?”</p><p>“Yes, that’s it.”</p><p>Blaise responds and Daphne nods in agreement before Blaise questions, “What are you researching Harry?”</p><p>“I think potentially the Philosopher’s Stone may be on the third floor, and that someone, likely in the school, is after it.”</p><p>Silence filled the small space for a moment before Daphne asked, “Who do you think it is?”</p><p>“Our head of house?”</p><p>Blaise asked with a roll of his eyes and Alex frowns and shakes his head, “It’s not Snape but I’m not certain who it is. But they probably let the troll in on Halloween, and they’re probably the one killing the unicorns in the Forbidden Forest.”</p><p>Grim silence settles over them for a moment before Blaise sighs and asks, “Are you going to let the adults handle it?”</p><p>“Probably.”</p><p>Alex replies with a shrug though he has a feeling that someone wants him to deal with it, or at least wants his classmates to deal with it for whatever reason.</p><p>“Well there’s no use worrying about it now. Harry what was your theory for McGonagall’s homework on transfiguration of inanimate to animate?”</p><p>Alex shoves aside his books and Daphne hands over her essay with a thankful grin. Blaise rolls his eyes and says, “You’re a leech Greengrass.”</p><p>“You love me anyway Zabini.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my God here they go again.”</p><p>Someone says behind Alex but he doesn’t care to identify who as he glares at Hermione and retorts, “Look the magical binary is just ridiculous and not based in scientific fact or logic take for example the classification of ‘light’ and ‘dark’ spells. Lumos is a light spell but can be used to blind people if the intent is to harm.”</p><p>Hermione frowns her bushy hair seems to crackle around her head as the small but still growing crowd around them shifts. They are in the library and Alex is certain any moment Pince is going to kick them out but he refuses to back down.</p><p>“But as you said Lumos was created with light intent and it depends on the caster. So, in essence you’re saying that magic is a tool and that in fact it is wizards themselves who fall on the binary of light or dark?”</p><p>“Now you’re just speaking of morality Hermione. Which again I will insist that no one is inherently evil, it is usually a matter of nature vs. nature, I know you’ve heard of Freud and understand the basis of psychology. If people are raised by their parents to believe that men are better than women that is how they will act but it doesn’t mean they are incapable of change or inherently evil.”</p><p>Alex argues confidently and easily, he is after all used to arguing his case in front of a jury and this is all too similar to the cabinet meetings with Jefferson. Hermione had started off quietly but she is quickly picking up in volume in confidence.</p><p>“What about people like you know who?”</p><p>“What about him? Do you know the circumstances of his childhood, how the world treated him before he became a mass-murderer? I am not justifying his actions, considering he killed my parents; however, I am arguing that no one is born dark. I will concede that some people are more naturally inclined towards violence just as some can be inclined towards healing but this can also be nurtured. Not to forget that dark is not equivalent to evil.”</p><p>“What about spells that are purely evil such as the killing curse?”</p><p>Hermione asks and the crowd mumurs. Alex narrows his eyes and responds, “Have you heard of the concept of Euthanasia? From what I understand of the science of the killing curse it immediately severs the connection between soul and body, it is completely painless. Could not then the killing curse be used to put an animal out of its misery or in cases of doctor administered euthanasia?”</p><p>“It could. But what about Crucio?”</p><p>Hermione asks and Alex searches for Neville thankful he is not in the crowd as he responds, “Crucio is a spell created with the intent of torture, it is a weapon, however, I stand by my original point that the classification of spells into light and dark is useless instead, we should be viewing spells through the harm they can cause when used with that intent or the aid they can provide. Magic is in a sense a tool and so in essence it is the wielder that is important. Thus, having a class of Defence Against the Dark Arts is pointless when the spells we use are limited because of the dark classification. Instead, we should have classes on morality that help instill lessons on empathy and boundaries.”</p><p>Hermione pauses and Alex continues relentless, “Have you viewed the Hogwarts curriculum of the past? Many of our courses have been cut, either due to views of them being outdated, or far more commonly because the government cut our funding or the board of education voted for these courses to be removed. Do you know what some of them were? Geomancy, ritual magic, summoning, occlumency lessons, and there was no defense against the dark arts, it was just a course on offensive and defensive spells.”</p><p>“What divides us but the spells we use? How are we to judge our morality as wizards and witches otherwise?”</p><p>Hermione asks but she looks curious now and he can see the outrage at not having the opportunity to study what Alex mentioned. He frowns and with a shake of his head replies, “Our actions. Like I said it’s how one uses the spells, not the nature itself, we can not force people to use only what we deem light spells in the hope that people who we consider dark only use dark spells, because a ‘dark’ wizard is just as likely to use Expelliarmus as a ‘light’ wizard.”</p><p>“Granger, Potter! What have I told you about debating in the library? During exam season of all times. Out, out now, and you both are banned for the rest of the week.”</p><p>Pince appears like a harpy bearing down on the crowd of students who scatter swiftly to the wind. Alex flinches at the librarian’s words and watches Hermione’s face pale, he is more than thankful it is Wednesday but cannot help but protest, “Ma’am please- “</p><p>“I won’t hear your excuses, either of you. If you want to debate do so in an empty classroom. Now out both of you.”</p><p> Hermione glares at Alex and his sticks his tongue out as he gathers his book bag and follows her out of the library. The hallways are empty and Hermione rounds on him immediately and says, “I can’t believe you Potter.”</p><p>“Hey, I can’t take all the blame you argued back.”</p><p>Alex reminds her as they shuffle down the hallway. Hermione glares for a moment before her shoulders slump and she says, “What am I suppose to do if I can’t go to the library?”</p><p>“You could always talk to people?”</p><p>“Terry is the only one in my house who talks to me.”</p><p>Hermione admits as she glances out the window hugging a book close to her chest. Alex frowns and asks, “What about outside your house?”</p><p>“Neville and Ron talk to me but that’s because I help them with their homework. Neville at least is helping me understand wizarding customs better. “</p><p>Hermione admits softly and Alex leans closer to her and says, “I talk to you even if it’s in the form of arguing but I prefer to think it’s friendly.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Really.”</p><p>Alex affirms and Hermione grins at him and says softly, “Thanks.”</p><p>They walk in silence for a moment before Hermione asks, “Have you heard about the third floor?”</p><p>“With the Cerberus and possibly the Philosopher’s stone?”</p><p>Alex asks and grins when Hermione gapes at him before she demands, “How do you know about it?”</p><p>“Stumbled on it running away from Mrs. Norris. And I’m sure you heard from Neville about what happened in the Forbidden Forest.”</p><p>“Yes,” she admits with a blush before she continues, “They’re insistent that it’s Snape who’s trying to steal it.”</p><p>“Doubtful.”</p><p>“That’s what I said!”</p><p>Hermione responds throwing one of her hands in the air, Alex shrugs and says, “It’s probably a bit of house prejudice in play.”</p><p>“Probably. Still, I wonder when they’ll attempt it again? I think whoever they are they gave Hagrid the dragon’s egg. He told Neville and Ron this morning that Fluffy, the Cerberus falls asleep to music, apparently he told the dragon egg dealer that.”</p><p>“Whoever it is they’ll probably do it soon, now that our exams are done there’s only the ones for the older students.”</p><p>“I’m just glad they’re over.”</p><p>Hermione admits with a sigh of relief and Alex shakes his head and replies, “I’m sure you did fine Hermione, you’re one of the brightest witches of our age.”</p><p>“You’re pretty bright yourself Harry,” Hermione says with a smile before her face twists and she asks, “Isn’t Dumbledore away on business for the Wizengamot?”</p><p>“He wasn’t at the table this morning.”</p><p>Alex admits and there is a split second where they stare at each other before Hermione says, “I’ll tell McGonagall you tell Snape, meet back here if something goes wrong?”</p><p>“Agreed.”</p><p>They split apart and Alex cannot help but recall Daphne’s words as he trips down the stairs to Snape’s office. He knocks on the door but there is silence, Alex counts to ten praying for patience but there is nothing.</p><p>A prefect rounds the corner and Alex asks, “Do you know where Professor Snape is?”</p><p>“He’s dealing with a potions accident from the exams, apparently a cauldron tipped over and almost destroyed the whole room, a few kids are even in the med bay,” The prefect explains and then adds, “Why? You need any help?”</p><p>“It’s okay.”</p><p>Alex grinds out and turns on his heels walking briskly up the stairs and back towards the library. John is exiting the library and when he sees Alex, he grins but the expression falters when he sees his face and asks, “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“You remember what I told you about the third floor?” John nods and Alex continues, “Well, whoever it was they’re going to try again today.”</p><p>“Okay, what are we going to do?”</p><p>This is why he loves John.</p><p> A moment later Hermione comes skidding down the hallway, following behind her is Ron and Neville. Hermione halts in front of them glancing at John and then Alex who nods before she gasps out, “McGonagall wouldn’t listen to us, said Dumbledore would deal with it when he got back.”</p><p>“We can deal with it.”</p><p>Alex says quietly the words are dangerous, the whole situation is dangerous. Hermione frowns glancing between the five of them before she says, “If we wait till Dumbledore comes back it could be too late.”</p><p>“I’ll go.”</p><p>Ron says tilting his head up eyes flashing, Neville sucks in a breath and squares his shoulders as he adds, “So will I.”</p><p>“I’ll come as well.”</p><p>John says grinning at Alex, Hermione’s expression twists and he can see her internally debating before she states, “You’d better hurry, I’ll wait for Dumbledore to return and tell him what happened.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Ron!”</p><p>Alex cries out as Ron sacrifices his chest piece the Queen moving forward and cutting him down with a swing of her blade. Suddenly, all Alex can see is Lafayette falling during the Brandywine and struggling to his feet, Hercules with a bullet in his arm lugging an unconscious John over the barricade.</p><p>“Alex?”</p><p>John asks softly and he shakes away the lingering dredges of memory and rushes to Ron’s side. John frowns casting a quick diagnosis, hands hovering over Ron as he says, “He’s okay, I think a concussion and maybe a break. I’ll stay with him.”</p><p>Alex glances at his friend for a long moment before he rests his hand gently on Ron’s shoulder and rises to his feet. He glances to Neville who nods back in agreement, John’s voice echoes through the room, “Stay safe, both of you.”</p><p>“We will.”</p><p>Alex promises and walks through the next door with Neville. Immediately, black fire leaps up at the entrance and exit and Alex observes the table in the centre of the room with narrow eyes, there are seven potion bottles on the table and a sheet of parchment.</p><p>He scans the riddle and passes it to Neville as he studies the potions and announces, “Only one of us will be able to go through but one of us can go back. The dwarf potion,” Alex points at the small crystalline potion, “will allow someone to go forward, the purple one is the one to go back.”</p><p>“How did you figure that out Harry?”</p><p>“I like riddles.”</p><p>Alex admits with a smile thinking of the exasperated Ravenclaw common room door before the tension in the room turns it into a frown. Neville stares at Alex for a long moment before he states, “Take the blue potion, I’ll go back to Draco and Ron, we might be able to move him if we can get one of the brooms from the key room.”</p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p>Alex states clasping hands with Neville who says, “You as well Harry.”</p><p>Neville reaches out and takes the purple potion downing it in one quick practiced motion before he walks back through the door they had come through. Alex studies the blue potion for a long moment before with an inhale he downs the potion, it has a curious taste like something synthetic but sweet and the sensation of flames licking at his robes is strange as he walks through the fire.</p><p>The room he enters is large, circular in shape and is carved of the same stone as the rest of Hogwarts. In the centre of the room is the mirror from the empty classroom, it seems strangely out of place with the light reflecting off of its gold frame.</p><p>A figure steps out from behind the mirror.</p><p>“Ah Mr. Potter.”</p><p>“Professor Quirrell?”</p><p>Alex questions staring at the professor who in the strange light of the room looks sharper, every angle pulled to the foreground as the Professor tilts his head and replies, “Yes p-p-poor s-s-stuttering P-P-Professor Q-Quirrell.”</p><p>“You’re the one who’s trying to steal the Philosopher’s stone.”</p><p>Alex states in realisation and Quirrell laughs the sound harsh and shaky as Alex continues, “You were the one who broke into Gringotts and let the troll into the school.”</p><p>“Yes, though Snape was already suspect of me. Ah well no matter, Dumbledore is gone and you are here Harry Potter. Now where is the stone? This mirror is quite peculiar I look into it but it does not show the stone.”</p><p>“The boy.”</p><p>A voice slithers through the air brushing against Alex’s senses and raising the hair on the back of his neck as he glances around the room. Quirrell brightens and says, “Of course My Lord.”</p><p>“Show me to him.”</p><p>The voice commands it is weak but there is something sinuous that reminds Alex of a snake; limbless yet still a predator. Quirrell’s face twists and he asks, “Are you sure My Lord? You are still weak.”</p><p>“Do it.”</p><p>The voice commands and Quirrell nods reaching up he begins to unwrap the turban around his head, the movements are slow and careful and Alex feels his heart seize in his chest as he pulls out his wand. The pale fabric drops with a thump that is loud in the emptiness of the room as Quirrell turns slowly around.</p><p>There is a face on the back of Quirrell’s head, misshapen, barely a face, red eyes stare at Alex and the voice says, “Harry Potter, we meet again.”</p><p>“Voldemort.”</p><p>Alex states a cold feeling filling his chest as his grasp tightens around his wand. The wraith smiles, it is a sickly expression, and states, “Yes, look what I have been reduced to, living off other creatures.”</p><p>“My Lord save your strength.”</p><p>Quirrell says and Voldemort’s eyes narrow and he asks, “What do you see in the mirror Potter?”</p><p>Alex’s glances into the mirror before he can stop himself and his heart shakes apart in his chest at his family. The older Alexander grins back at him and with a wink he reveals a red stone that seems to glow from within which he drops in Alex’s pocket.</p><p>“Well?”</p><p>“I see my family.”</p><p>Alex answers turning to face Voldemort with narrow eyes, the stone is heavy in the pocket of his robes. Voldemort’s eyes narrow and he states, “He lies. The boy has the stone. Quirrell.”</p><p>“Yes, My Lord.”</p><p>“Expelliarmus!”</p><p>Alex casts, Quirrell casts a quick protego and Alex steps back holding his wand in front of him. Quirrell moves in a sudden burst and Alex casts Everte Statum which sends Quirrell flying back he collides with a wall with a crack and Alex watches with narrowed eyes pushing away the memories that threaten to overwhelm him.</p><p>“Expelliarmus!”</p><p>Alex has no time to block the spell and his wand is sent flying clattering on the ground too far away. Quirrell appears towering over him as his hand tightens around Alex’s throat slamming him into the wall with fury in his eyes. Alex grunts and reaches out to break the hold one hand clawing at Quirrell’s face.</p><p>A pained shriek fills the air along with the scent of burning flesh (which is all too familiar). Quirrell stumbles back his skin turning ashy and grey where Alex had touched him. Stumbling forward Alex places his hands on Quirrell’s arms listening to the pained shriek as the man’s skin burns away beneath his hands.</p><p>Alex has killed before, redcoats who came to close to their camp when he was on patrol, the heat of battle as they charge across the fields.</p><p>He steps away from the corpse with shaking hands imaging he can see blood there as he turns and vomits. Alex banishes it and glances at the mirror trying to erase the sound of Quirrell’s screams and the sick feeling that Voldemort is back.</p><p>His vision is going dark and rather than resist Alex lets the darkness claim him.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll write?”</p><p>Alex asks Blaise sleepily as he peers up at his friend from where his head is pillowed on his shoulder. Blaise nods running his hand through Alex’s hair, John who lost whatever bet he had with Blaise is pouting at Alex.</p><p>“Of course, we’ll write.”</p><p>Blaise says and John adds, “You just have to promise to try to stay out of danger for two months.”</p><p>“Don’t make him promise something he can’t keep.”</p><p>Daphne says adjusting her hair and her robes with a roll of her eyes. Alex makes an indignant noise and replies, “I resent that, I was clearly manipulated into confronting Quirrell alone.”</p><p>His friends share a glance and Alex huffs and returns to the book he is reading. It is all too likely that he was manipulated into going after Quirrell, there are just too many pieces collecting together at just the right time for it to be anything else and it rubs at Alex like the stiff collar of his uniform.</p><p>He told Blaise and Daphne what had happened when they confronted him in the infirmary, Blaise had lectured him for half an hour on being quote, “a reckless half-baked Gryffindor,” before Daphne had taken over with threats of increasing bodily harm if he didn’t include them next time because someone had to, “look after your incompetent ass.”</p><p>The point is that Blaise is being clingy and Daphne is refusing to leave him alone but summer has put a bit of a dent in their evil plans. Alex’s chest twists at the thought of going back to the Dursleys of plain meals and awkward silence. He doubts that he could stay with Blaise’s family though, considering he is supposed to be some paragon of light out to defeat Voldemort.</p><p>The door to their coach slides open and Alex grins at Hermione who smiles and is followed by Ron and Neville. John settles the medical textbook he was reading down and asks, “Ron how is your head feeling?”</p><p>“Fine thanks, Madame Pomphrey says you really helped.”</p><p>The words sound awkward in Ron’s mouth but that’s probably because apparently their families are feuding which Alex only became aware of the other day. John nods with a small smile as Hermione bustles inside and asks, “What are you reading.”</p><p>Blaise rolls his eyes but shows Hermione his book as she squishes onto the bench on the other side of Alex. Neville hovers in the doorway for a moment before his eyes lock with Alex’s and he tilts his head into the hallway. Alex nods and disentangles himself from Blaise with a pat on his shoulder before clambering out into the hallway with Neville.</p><p>“Everything okay?”</p><p>Alex asks leaning against the wall of the train and muffling a yawn, maybe he stayed up too late the past few nights researching what little there was available on the war with Voldemort. Neville frowns and says, “You helped Draco when he was having dreams right Harry?”</p><p>“Yeah, why have you been having strange dreams?”</p><p>“I guess, they don’t feel strange until later when I realise that some of the stuff happening- “</p><p>“Doesn’t exists that way today?”</p><p>Neville nods lips pinching and he glances nervously up and down the hallway. Alex smiles softly at Neville and says, “From what I researched it could be because you’re a reincarnate and memories of your past life are slipping through. Or you could be prophetic, I think a few seers actually saw into the past rather than the future but as time is a cycle, they were able to use those visions to affect the future.”</p><p>“Thanks Harry.”</p><p>“It’s no problem Nev.”</p><p>Alex replies and Neville grins back for a moment before he says, “I think Ron’s been having dreams too.”</p><p>“Well if you want you can both write me this summer?”</p><p>“I’d like that,” Neville replies and adds, “My gran would like to meet you. Our families have a strong alliance.”</p><p>“They do?”</p><p>Alex asks as Neville slides the door open and they slip back inside the coach, he soothes Blaise’s raised hackles with a pat on the shoulder and squishes into his side as Neville responds, “The Potter and the Longbottom families have been allied for a century I think.”</p><p>“Alliances are common between noble families.”</p><p>John adds for Hermione’s benefit and Alex nods with a hum thinking of how similar politics are no matter which society one is in. Hermione and Blaise are talking about the differences in herbology and potions. Daphne is talking to John about recent politics and Neville is occasionally speaking which seems to surprise everyone involved. Alex closes his eyes and curls into Blaise’s side, he has time.</p>
