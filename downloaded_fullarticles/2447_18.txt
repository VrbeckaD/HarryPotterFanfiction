    <p>In a small hidden café in an equally hidden corner, there sat a young teen of fourteen. He had big almond shaped, honey colored eyes and gravity defying brunette hair. He looked scrawny and like nothing special. The young man was sitting and eating a slice of his favorite strawberry cake and drinking some green tea. He was currently hiding out from some bullies that had taken to following him around lately.</p>
<p>The young man's name was Sawada Tsunayoshi, or Tsuna for short. Most just called him Dame-Tsuna though, he hated the nickname even though he knew it was true. He was useless and failed at pretty much all he did. He was no good at sports and failed all of his tests. This was why he was bullied and picked on all the time, even by some of the teachers. So here he was, hiding out and enjoying a slice of his favorite cake. As he ate he nearly moaned in delight at the burst of delicious flavors that burst across his tongue. It was even better than his own mother's, and that was saying something! He didn't notice that there was someone nearby, watching him with a bright smile.</p>
<p>The young man also had gravity defying hair but it was a raven's wing black with a little bit of red streaked through. His eyes were also almond shaped, but were a bright emerald green that seemed to glow in the dim lighting of the room and seemed to draw you in and read your very soul. "I didn't know my cakes were that good." the other teen said casually.</p>
<p>Tsuna jumped and blushed crimson. "I can't help it! Your cakes are just too good!" he blurted as he cautiously watched the other teen, waiting to see what the other would do.</p>
<p>The other teen, wearing a black apron covered in flower grinned and stuck out his hand. "Hello, my name is Kuro Sentoki. It is nice to meet you. I am glad you like my food. My guardian and I own this place. I am the one that does all the baking and cooking… My guardian can't cook to save his life so he sticks to the paperwork."</p>
<p>Tsuna blinked and stared at Sentoki in surprise. "You're being nice to me… and you're talking to me like I am a normal person… why?" he asked in confusion. He wasn't used to people treating him this way; like he was a friend. He wasn't sure how to act around someone that wasn't out to hurt him.</p>
<p>Sentoki chuckled and gave him a kind smile. "Because I can tell when someone is in need of a true friend. I was the same way for a long time… It wasn't until I was 11 that I got my first best friend. Even though she was an owl; she was my first and only best friend…" he explained with a wistful smile. Hedwig had sadly been killed a year ago and he still mourned for his beloved owl.</p>
<p>Tsuna blinked a few times as he recognized the look. He gave a shy smile and grabbed Sentoki's hand. "If… if you want…" he took a calming breath and looked at him nervously. "If you want, we could be friends…" he finally offered, sounding a bit unsure and very shy.</p>
<p>Sentoki looked at him in surprise and then down to their joined hands, then back up at him. "I… really?" he blurted out from shock and sudden shyness. At a nod from the brunette he continued with a bright smile. "I'd love too! Do you really want to be friends? Wait... Stupid question... of course you do... Thank-You! I'd love to be friends! Can you come back tomorrow? Also I never got your name..." Sentoki rambled as he looked at the brunette with eyes full of hope.</p>
<p>"Of course I can! I come here after school anyways... And I am sorry. My name is Sawada Tsunayoshi. You can call me Tsuna for short." Tsuna went silent after admitting he came here quite often and he looked down.</p>
<p>Sentoki tilted his head and looked at him curiously. He stayed silent and sighed softly, not liking what he was seeing. “Well, you are welcome here any time you want Tsuna-san, day or night.” The raven-haired teen smiled brightly as he watched Tsuna finished his tea. “Wait! Don’t go just yet!!!” he exclaimed before he rushed into the back. He came back a few moments later with a box that had a nice Orange bow tying it closed. “Here, take this back you your family. It is on me.”</p>
<p>Tsuna stared at him in shock and stayed silent for a bit. “Really?! But… but I have to pay you something! I just can’t take it for nothing!!” he finally exclaimed.</p>
<p>Sentoki chuckled and grinned brighter. “Your friendship is payment enough.” He said happily. Tsuna beamed as he shook Sentoki’s hand again before he left with the box of cakes in his hands.</p>
