</div>The first time Draco had set eyes on the burrow had, to his surprise, not only been planned but expected.  <em>Wanted</em>.  Somewhat joyfully, even.  Somewhat <em>truly</em> being the operative word, as there had been a considerable amount of convincing needed across the board.  He could hardly expect someone’s family to want to invite him over after a long rivalry with, not only several of their children, but their essentially adopted one as well.  Or after his father, in a round-about way, nearly got their kids - born and sort of adopted - killed.  A couple times.<p>Or hell, after his father willfully played part in serving their sort of adopted child up to Lor- <em>Voldemort --  He wasn’t there anymore, didn’t have to be</em> <em><strong>afraid</strong></em> <em>anymore</em> -- a number of times.  Had forced <em>him</em> into trying to do the same, knowing full well he couldn’t.  Though that was hardly an uncommon occurrence within the Malfoy line.  Do it until you can manage without feeling ill, then do it better.</p>
<p>The sickening lurch of apparating felt like a mere drop in the ocean of dread that washed over him as they arrived.  His clammy hands clenched tight in slightly worn leather gloves, his steely expression set and jaw clenched tightly; though, he didn’t know whether it was to stop himself from vomiting or screaming.  </p>
<p>Wide grey eyes stared with resigned panic out at the burrow from the field they’d landed in, the shrill ringing in his ears interrupted only by the crunch of the thick blanket of snow underfoot as he subconsciously stepped back.  The desperate feeling of wanting to go home grasped at him insistently and left him cold as his breath caught in his throat and stuck there.</p>
<p>“Draco…?” </p>
<p>His name hung in the air for a long moment, all worry and pleading as it fell upon deaf ears.  His name puctured the air again, more urgent, more concerned as he turned on his heel and, unbidden, broke into a run.  His heart felt as if it were hammering hard against his ribs as his ragged breathing rattled his chest and made the world feel dizzyingly fuzzy.  The entire landscape seemed to tilt sideways as he was caught - or maybe fell, and was instead rescued from the impact - and pulled back against a firm chest.  Strong arms held him together as inconsolable keening pierced the air, hurting his ears.</p>
<p>They flopped down into the snow clumsily, him in his husband’s lap, and he only recognized the horrid sound to be his own when it as muffled by turning to cling desperately to his spouse.  A flurry of, “I c-can’t, I-I can’t, I <em>can’t</em>.” fell from his lips as he sobbed loudly, his own voice so, so upsettingly loud in his ears as it echoed throughout the field.  He could feel his body shaking, make out the familiar, consoling tones of his husband’s voice, but couldn’t for the life of him push the panic back enough to make out what he was saying.  </p>
<p>They sat in the snow for a long, long time, the early morning sun slowly passing over them and on into early evening.  Normally, the Weasley’s would have come looking for them hours ago, but they knew well enough that it would be…  Difficult, all around.  They were understanding and willing to be kind and patient, if a bit apprehensively.  </p>
<p>With each soft kiss to the top of his head, his cheeks and nose, he had finally began to quiet.  A welcome development, he was sure, though his husband was patient and did not protest; merely rubbed his back in slow, soothing circles and gently sang half-remembered chart-toppers to him.  </p>
<p>At some point, his husband had reluctantly removed both of their gloves to hold his hands, skin to skin, and Draco finally calmed.  The cold was biting and he tried to protest, but he was met with reassuring kisses that melted away his train of thought.  </p>
<p>The cold was biting and he <em>really</em> didn’t want his sweet, kind husband to have to suffer, but physical contact always helped.  Always reminded him, irrevocably, that his husband was still here, still with him.  They both knew they’d be in that field well into the night otherwise.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until he’d stopped shaking, however, that they got up.  Draco looked exhausted and his husband looked worried, as he often did after one of his panic attacks.  Draco’s lower lip trembled as he stared hard at the snow, feeling his face flush with a mixture of embarrassment and shame.  He wanted to apologize, as he often did.  To try and explain, insist that he wasn’t crazy, it was simply that everything about the house itself, where they <em>were</em> was just too loud.  Too much.  He knew it would fall on deaf ears, however.  </p>
<p>His husband knew he wasn’t crazy.  He <em>knew</em> certain places, things were hard for Draco.  Too loud, too painful, too full up of feeling so sharp that he couldn’t handle it and had to distance himself.  He <em><strong>knew</strong></em> that Draco wasn’t crazy, and he loved him.  He loved him <em>so</em> much.  He was so patient with him that Draco often wondered if he was in some incredibly elaborate coma.  It seemed inhuman, the amount of patience that his husband not only possessed, but reserved just for him.  <em>Just</em> for him.  </p>
<p>Instead, he bit his lip hard and shut his eyes against the fresh tears that had begun to well up, sighing through his nose sharply as he willed his nerves to remain still.  “I love you,” he said, once he was able to open his eyes again, his small smile all fragility, all anxiety.  “Thank you.”</p>
<p>It felt like the summer sun was shining down upon him, warming him as his husband smiled back at him calmly.  “Of course, love.  I love you, too.”  The kiss that followed as his warm, charming husband held his sore cheeks with his cold hands was all tenderness and love, followed by more and more until Draco was far too red in the face.  He was all shy smiling as he held his husband’s hand once more, red up to his ears as he carefully tucked their entwined hands into his pocket in an effort to warm them for the arduous walk ahead.</p>
<p>Draco hadn’t realized quite how far out into the fields they’d made it until he could just barely make out the footprints of where they’d landed much, much earlier in the day.  Still a <em>considerable</em> ways away from the burrow.  He frowned as his husband pulled his wand from a coat pocket and quietly uttered, “<em>Lumos</em>.” to light their way.  Draco’s lingering gaze must have caught his attention, for the reassuring squeeze to his hand.  “It’s alright, love.  We’re almost there, I promise.”  He did his best to push back the lingering worry and smile bravely for him.</p>
<p>Arriving at the burrow was a different wave of stress altogether.  As his husband put his wand away, it was finally hitting Draco all over again that they were there, they’d finally made it.  That they’d be there for a <em><strong>while</strong></em>.  They’d been invited, true, but that presented a certain level of interaction that was expected.  Wanted…  Allegedly.  He couldn’t help but wonder if they’d ever forgiven him.  He knew it would have been far too much to hope they’d forgiven his family and, in truth, he hadn’t forgiven his family yet either.  But…  Surely the Weasley’s must have put the past behind them in order to have even considered extending an invitation to him.  At the very least, for his husband’s sake.  It had broken his heart, having to be apart from them for so long.</p>
<p>His husband, his caring, loving, funny husband turned to him as they arrived on the doorstep and kissed his forehead tenderly.  “Just hold on to my hand, alright?  I’m right here love, I promise.  You’ll do great.” he said, smiling.  Draco had only been able to manage an awkward, jerky nod in response doing his best to smile once more, despite the worry in his eyes.  They were essentially the only family his husband <em>had</em>.  He wanted so badly to at least try, for him.  The worn door swung open before his husband could knock a second time and the thick scent of mulling spices and baked goods washed over them, as his husband and by extension himself, were pulled in off the stoop.</p>
