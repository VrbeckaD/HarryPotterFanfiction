    <p>On the gigantic bed of his room at 12 Grimmauld Place Sirius stared at the white fog drifting from his cigarette, the sleeves of his pressed white dress shirt casually rolled up. He glanced at the calendar that hung on the wall in front of him, large crosses covering half of the calendar, showing that there was still a month till school opened. It was a nightmare living here, even worse than most of his summers, and heading to Hogwarts was the only way to wake up.</p>
<p>Taking another drag from his cigarette, he walked to the window, seeing the last of the guests finally leaving. His parents had held a grand dinner, forcing him to act civilized and dress his best. All he did was grudgingly welcome everyone and then he headed back to his room to do nothing.</p>
<p>In fact, it was a surprise when his parents commanded him to stay in his room during the party; usually they’d make him into a house elf, serving to the guest and commanding to be polite; but Sirius wasn’t complaining, it was almost like a blessing staying up here when stuck-up purebloods and death-eater wannabes  were roaming right below him.</p>
<p>On top of this, his summer was going absolute horrible, thank you very much (not like it was ever good). He was thoroughly exhausted. Ever since he arrived he was made into a house elf, being forced to clean the grim house without a single break and then being given only a slice of bread at dinner. It was astonishing that he was even upright after all of this, especially after all the beatings he had to go through.</p>
<p>Sitting back on his bed, he was contemplating changing into his pyjamas and heading to bed. It wasn’t as if his parents would want to see him. At times like this, they preferred to ignore that their disgrace of a son ever existed, and it was fine by him. But the loud footsteps on the stairs heading towards his room beg to differ. He really didn’t have time for one of his father’s shenanigans.</p>
<p>As soon as his father slammed the door open, Sirius abruptly stood, dropping his cigarette and quickly extinguishing it with his foot. He was glad that he hid the packet of muggle cigarettes under his bed, knowing that his father would have burned them if he spotted anything muggle.</p>
<p>It seemed that his father also noticed him extinguishing his cigarette as a small smile showed on his face.</p>
<p>“Glad to see you still know how to respect your elders”- a twisted smile appeared on his father’s face as he slowly approached and sat down on Sirius’ bed – “it seems the lessons are really paying off. Good, good”</p>
<p>Sirius just glared at his father, deciding to keep his mouth, hoping his father would get bored and leave. But that was hardly likely. In the end, just getting out of here with just a few curses would be a blessing. It wasn’t every day that his father just entered his room.</p>
<p><em>You could be in a lot of trouble</em>, his inner self decided to quip.</p>
<p><em>But I’m always in a lot of trouble and he never came in my room before</em>, he argued to himself.</p>
<p>He was contemplating the point he made when he was snapped back into reality by his father’s voice.</p>
<p>“but you know you shouldn’t have extinguished that” he drawled on, ignoring his son’s glares, lighting himself a cigar of his own and blowing a long thick stream of white smoke into the air as if to indicate he was in absolutely no hurry at all.</p>
<p><em>Great, just great, </em>Sirius thought, suppressing the urge to roll his eyes.</p>
<p>Wanting his father to leave, Sirius spoke, trying to sound as nonchalant as possible, keeping the venom out of his voice “didn’t you have something to say, <em>Father</em>?”</p>
<p>Averting his gaze from the mystic fog emitting from his cigar, his father took another drag, fog leaving his mouth as he spoke “in a matter of fact, I do”-his father’s somewhat calm eyes suddenly vanished, making Sirius almost flinch at the sharp maniac left in them.</p>
<p>“I have grown tired of this Gryffindor goody two shoes muggle loving act of yours and I am done waiting for you to slip out of it yourself.” his voice deadly calm causing shivers down his spine.</p>
<p>“Father, I am surprised you ever thought that I would simply slip out of it . . .”</p>
<p>A burning slap was felt across his cheek before he was able to complete his sentence.</p>
<p>“You keep that dirty mouth shut of yours! I am in no mood to hear your worthless chatter!”</p>
<p><em>Well, there goes keeping your mouth shut</em>, Sirius scolded himself as he straightened up and smiled sweetly at his father.</p>
<p>His father ignored and continued his monologue “you will now start taking your rightful place as the heir of The Ancient and Most Noble House of Black and you will stay civilized, keep your mouth shut and do whatever I say.”</p>
<p>With every word the expressional façade he wore for the guest faded and was now replaced by a maddening face.</p>
<p>Sirius acted as if he was pondering over the situation, just to spite his father, of course, he already knew what his decision was “and why do you think I will listen this time?”</p>
<p>A twisted grin stretched across his father’s face as he leaned back as if he was expecting Sirius to ask him that. “You do know what the Dark Lord’s aims are, don’t you?”</p>
<p><em>Now, I</em> <em>really don’t like where things are going</em>, his father wasn’t known to change the topic so suddenly.</p>
<p><em>This isn’t your ordinary chit chat, Sirius, It’s far far worse</em>, his inner voice informed.</p>
<p>He really wanted to tell that voice to shut up, but he knew that wouldn’t work because that voice was just him, just the thoughts he wanted to keep hidden, the ideas he never let anyone see.</p>
<p>Taking a breath and taking care his voice remained calm, he spoke: “who doesn’t?”</p>
<p>His father’s wild eyes looked at the boy in front of him and smiled, cigar dangling between his fingers “good. I thought you were stupid enough to not even know who the Dark Lord is.” he chuckled to himself, no humour in his laugh, just madness.</p>
<p>Sirius tightened his fists, his knuckles turning white, trying hard to keep himself under control.</p>
<p>“You’re lucky that the Dark Lord doesn’t care you’re in Gryffindor. In fact, you’re lucky that he’s even giving you a chance. You finally got a chance to redeem yourself. Not everyone is selected by the Dark Lord himself to join his ranks” </p>
<p>Sirius blood froze. Are they really that stupid, that after opposing his parents' views for his entire life, after making it very clear he wanted no part in this, that he will somehow just abandon all he ever believed just because some crazy maniac offered him to?! </p>
<p>“and why do you think that I will accept this so-called offer?” each word dripped in venom, as Sirius was visibly trying not to scream and to keep his anger cool; which of course he was obviously failing to do so. Sometimes he really was a true Black, with the temper and everything.</p>
<p>
  <em>Don’t think about that now.</em>
</p>
<p>“Because you’re a valuable asset to our Lord. You’re so-called ‘alliances’ with the blood-traitor, half-blood and mud blood are perfect for our Dark Lord’s aim.” His father drawled on as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.</p>
<p>“they are not my ‘alliances’, they’re my friends in fact, they are more family than you all will ever be and if you obviously think that I will betray my friends and become a bloody death eater then you’re more stupid and IDIOTIC THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!” with each word, Sirius' voice got louder and louder, all sense of staying silent flying out of the window. When his father insulted him, he could keep quiet, but no one ever insulted his friends and got away with it, not under Sirius’ watch.</p>
<p>Slowly extinguishing his cigar underneath his foot, his father turned his attention back to Sirius “I really don’t think you understand”- his father slowly stood, his eyes boring into Sirius’-“I don’t care what you think. You’re now supposed to do what I say.”</p>
<p>“Do what you say?”-Sirius scoffed, anger getting the better of him-“I AM NOT GOING TO JOIN THAT STUPID BASTARD’S RANKS, I AM NOT GOING TO BETRAY MY FRIEND NOR AM I GOING TO LISTEN TO YOUR STUPID PURE BLOODED WAYS!”</p>
<p>It was then that he noticed the wand in his father hand, itching to strike.</p>
<p>Before Sirius could do anything to defend himself before he could even move, he was hit by a familiar but unbearable pain. He fell to his knees as the pain circulated through his entire body. the pain was so intense so all-consuming that he didn’t even know where he was… white hot knives were piercing every inch of his skin, his screams echoing across the room.</p>
<p>When his father removed the curse, Sirius lay on the ground, the pain still ripping his entire body.</p>
<p>“Would you like to change your statement?” a twisted yet satisfied smile was etched on his face.</p>
<p>Gathering all his strength, Sirius lifted himself onto his knees, his hair sticking to his sweat covered forehead.</p>
<p>“I don’t regret a single word I said” he rasped, his voice was hoarse and barely a whisper, probably from all the screaming.</p>
<p><em>Of course from all the screaming, there is no probably in this, </em>he thought to himself.</p>
<p> “Oh, I’ll make sure you regret it.”</p>
