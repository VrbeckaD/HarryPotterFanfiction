    <p>Petunia held her cheek. Vernon was still yelling at her but she was shocked he hit her. Oh, he had before but it had been years. She had made sure he never hit her after the first time. She saw Harry was standing behind Vernon, glaring at Vernon. "Do it."</p><p>Harry smiled as he hissed. Darling slithered out from under his jersey. Vernon hearing the hissing sound turned his fury on Harry but Harry kept smiling as the Adder he was speaking to bit Vernon in the shin. The Adder reared back and bit Vernon again.</p><p>"Call the ambulance, Aunt Petunia." Harry smirked as Darling bit Vernon again.</p><p>Petunia didn't question Harry directions. "Is he going to die?"</p><p>"Yes, from anaphylactic shock." Harry called Darling back. The snake slithered up his leg and under his jersey.</p><p>"Good. You need to go upstairs. I will tell the police that he came into the house after trying to clear the clump of bushes and trees from behind the garage." Petunia would make the call as she began to plan on what spell to use in the backyard to make it look like Vernon had been working back behind the garage. Something low level so that the magic would evaporate by the time Dumbledore would get the news. </p><p>Harry didn't respond but headed up the stairs to his room. He watched out his bedroom window as the police and ambulance arrived. He waited for a few minutes until he heard voices. He heard Dudley walk by his bedroom door and followed Dudley down the stairs.</p><p>"Mum, what is wrong with Dad?" Dudley was pulled to Petunia as the paramedics began to work on Vernon.</p><p>The first paramedic looked at the police officers and shook his head no. One of the police officers left the house to go back to his car. "I need some details to put into the report while my partner calls for the coroner." The second police officer opened his small notebook.</p><p>"Mom?" Dudley looked confused. "What does he mean?"</p><p>"May I take my son upstairs?"</p><p>"After I get some basic information if you don't mind? I will need you to come back down afterward."</p><p>Petunia looked at Vernon's body and pushed Dudley behind her. "His name is Vernon Maurice Dursley, he is 32. Is there anything else?"</p><p>"Take your children upstairs. We will let you know when the coroner arrives, you can answer questions when you come back down." The police officer continued writing in his notebook. Petunia and Dudley went upstairs. "Ready when you are."</p><p>Harry remained where he was. He was watching the paramedics working on Vernon.</p><p>"He's got swelling of the lips, tongue, gums, and throat." One of the paramedics spoke as his partner and the police officer wrote down the information. The first paramedic moved down the body and saw the bites on the legs. "Snakebites. He has three sets of bite marks, right leg. He must have stepped on one." Vernon was wearing a pair of shorts with a white tank top.</p><p>"Was he working outside?" The police officer asked Harry. He saw Petunia coming back down the stairs.</p><p>"Yes, he was clearing some of the trees and bushes from behind the garage." Petunia wiped her eyes and blew her nose. "I warned him about the snakes. We had seen them before. Adders have been seen in our neighborhood. He got a bit worried so he was clearing the area behind our garage out."</p><p>"He has lumps on the skin, hives or nettle rash, swelling, redness and bruising at each location of the bites, it spread up the leg." The paramedic just confirmed what Petunia stated. Harry resisted the urge to smile.</p><p>"When the coroner gets here will he will make it official. He will also give you the paperwork on what to do regarding what the government will need." The first paramedic told the officer.</p><p>Petunia gasped. "He's dead?" Her face went pale.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Mrs. Dursley." They all told her.</p><p>______________________________________________________________</p><p>Harry was sitting on the couch as the last of the mourners left. Petunia looked exhausted. "Thank God, they are gone." She faced Harry. "Dumbledore and his ilk might show up now. I know Miss Figg will report the news to him."</p><p>Harry arched a brow. Darling slithered out from under the couch. Darling started hissing. Harry hissed back. "What is the plan?"</p><p>"I think it's time we moved out of here. I will pack our belongings. We can take a taxi to the Leaky Cauldron. We need to get you ready to deal with that old man." Petunia already arranged for the house to be sold, the car was sold yesterday, and all her muggle accounts were closed.</p><p>Harry's gave her a feral grin. Darling started hissing in pleasure. </p><p>______________________________________________________</p><p>Severus was ignoring Minerva's rant about Harry Potter. Dumbledore had returned an hour ago from Surrey. The house that Potter had been residing in now had a different family residing there. Dumbledore learned from his sources that Vernon Dursley was killed by a snake and that the family moved over a year ago. </p><p>"You had Arabella watching him. You know unless it's a cat she wouldn't watch it. She didn't even know they moved. Merlin, Albus. I warned you about putting him with those muggles. Lily's sister wasn't the most pleasant of people at James and Lily's wedding."</p><p>"Petunia? Did you leave him with Petunia? She and Lily hated each other." Severus thought it was an understatement. The two sisters couldn't be in the room without fighting. Severus remembered breaking up more than on brawl between the two. The two were the exact opposite of each other, in personality. </p><p>"I know. I warned him." Minerva finally sat down. "Well, what are you going to do now? They could be anywhere."</p><p>"I'm not sure. She closed all her bank accounts and sold everything." Dumbledore wasn't sure where the woman disappeared to. There was nothing he could find in the muggle world regarding her. He might need to send someone to investigate and locate her.</p><p>"How did her husband die?" Severus wondered if Petunia did something to her husband. </p><p>"Snakebites. The certificate and police report state an Adder bit Vernon three times. He had been out cleaning the area behind their garage." Dumbledore handed Severus his copies of the reports. "The police stated that there was nothing they could do. They concluded that she called almost as soon as he was bitten." </p><p>Severus read all the reports as Minerva and Dumbledore tried to determine what course of action was needed. If Petunia killed her husband she did a perfect murder. He wondered how she got a snake to bit her husband three times. He frowned a bit. "This is dated a little over a year ago. How come you didn't know sooner?" </p><p>"I only was alerted as the protective wards crashed. They needed to be refreshed yearly. Since Harry hasn't been there so they crashed, alerting me to the issue." </p><p>Severus sighed. "What have you decided to do?" Severus had no illusion that anything he or Minerva would say would change Dumbledore's mind. He even wondered why the man even bothered to ask their opinions.</p><p>"We have a few years before Harry turns eleven. It gives us plenty of time to locate Harry. I will see if a few of the Old Crowd can assist."</p><p>Severus didn't think they would have any success. He was going to see what he could discover as he had a feeling that Dumbledore was hiding something, as usual. </p><p>___________________________________________(2 years later)</p><p>"Harry, Dudley, remember you have your lessons to finish." Petunia was sitting at her desk. She had taken a job as a tutor and usually had several students a day visiting their home. This was the time she used to finish her marking for the day. The boys were usually in the room with her doing their assignments. Next year, they would be eleven and decision time.</p><p>"I finished them." Dudley handed her his assignments. "May I go and visit Greg?"</p><p>"Yes, dear, have fun. Be home in time for tea." Petunia took Harry's assignment. Harry went back to reading his book. Darling was curled up in her bed on the hearth. She heard the floo activate. "I believe your friends will be here this weekend." She got a nod of agreement. </p><p>Her group of students usually switched which Manor they spent the weekend at. This week was her weekend. She had the house-elves already preparing for it. The house would be filled with screams, running feet, and laughter, something she never had when living with Vernon. </p><p>Petunia often made a wish that Harry would speak more. She had tried to get him to engage more often but it was a failed experiment. He was her quiet child while Dudley was the exact opposite. She was just thankful they didn't fight as she and Lily did. Lily used to claim Petunia was jealous of Lily for getting into Hogwarts. Petunia was privately tutored. Petunia didn't want to go Hogwarts and had turned down the invitation. She looked up as Harry hissed something to Darling. "Harry?" The snake slithered out of the room.</p><p>Harry turned his head. "She is going patrolling."</p>
