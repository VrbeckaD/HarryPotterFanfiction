    <p>Chapter One</p><p>Early Winter, 1979</p><p>Jets of brightly colored light sparked and flew across the snowy hillside like some sort of sick fireworks display.  Boom, crash, another man down, like a puppet with his strings cut.  It would have been funny if it weren’t so horrifying.</p><p>Darkly cloaked duelists had paired up and were fighting each other all over the battlefield, breaths coming out in mists before them, wands and jets of light flying.  Sirius Black and James Potter were fighting an ugly little set of twins called the Carrows.</p><p>“Just think!” Alecto called gleefully to Amycus.  “Two of the most famous Order of the Phoenix blood traitors in one sitting!”</p><p>“Wouldn’t the Dark Lord be pleased?” Amycus smirked.</p><p>“So who are you taking?  The dumpy little hag or her half-dead twin?” Sirius asked James lightly.</p><p>“Hey -!” Alecto shrieked.</p><p>“Well, I do know how you love dumpy little hags, Sirius,” said James with the utmost dignity and respect.</p><p>Sirius smirked.  “Thought you’d never ask,” he said, and made to face Alecto.</p><p>“Nothing will please us more than to have <i>your</i> body at our feet, Black,” Amycus hissed at Sirius as James made to face him.</p><p>James raised his wand to Amycus’s face.  “Then I’m afraid,” he said quietly, “that you will have to go without being pleased for a very long time.”  At the threat to Sirius, some of the humor had left him.</p><p>But Sirius had barked out a harsh laugh.  “Relax!” he said.  “These two couldn’t hit straight if their wands were pointed for them -!”</p><p>But a vindictive, flushing red Alecto had narrowed her eyes and raised her wand before announcing dueling intentions.  The end of her wand glowed with power as she pointed it at Sirius’s handsome face.</p><p>“Alecto, no, he’s Bellatrix’s -!” Amycus shouted in panic, his poise finally leaving him.</p><p>“Sirius, look out -!”  James made to leap forward -</p><p>“Then let’s cut you down to my level, <i>Black,”</i> Alecto spat out, and she fired a jet of crimson light out of the end of her wand.</p><p>James jumped in front of his friend, and instead of the curse hitting Sirius’s face, it hit James’s arm and shoulder.</p><p>James fell crumpled in a heap of growing blood against the snow.  <i>“James!”</i> Sirius shouted in instinctive panic, his face turning into a snarling, panicked rage.  He looked up at the Carrows with hatred burning in his black eyes.  <i>“Fuck</i> you sick little cupie dolls!”</p><p>“Having problems, Black?” Amycus said, a wide sneer of a grin forming over his features, lowering his hand from Alecto’s shoulder.  “Well done, Alecto.  Nobody cares about Potter.”</p><p>Alecto giggled hysterically to herself.  “I hurt your friend!” she cackled at Sirius, and as Sirius raised his wand, his face twisted with hatred, both of the Carrows raised theirs -</p><p>And then Frank Longbottom swooped in.</p><p>“Watch yourself, Sirius!” he called, raising his own wand and ensuring that the Order members and the Death Eaters were now two on two.  “I don’t know if anyone bothered to tell you this before you enlisted only two years after graduating, but mocking a Death Eater is not always the safest thing to do!”</p><p>Sirius laughed despite himself.  “But who told you to -?”</p><p>And then Lily ran toward them, determined, dark red hair bright against the white snow.</p><p>“Of course,” said Sirius warmly, smiling wryly.  </p><p>“Come on, James.  To the Healer’s tent with you,” Lily breathed, slinging James’s arm across her shoulders and making to leave with him.</p><p>“Yes, Potter, to the Healer’s tent with you!” Alecto called mockingly, and both of the Carrows laughed.</p><p>James growled and almost made to leap forward, but Lily held him back.  “I don’t have time for you,” she told the Carrows with quiet fierceness, and she walked off with James leaning against her, across the ground thundering with crashes and jets of bright light.</p><p>“How’s your wife -?” Sirius began, but Frank laughed.</p><p>“Oh, Alice?  She can handle herself!”</p><p>Alice was fighting Severus Snape almost single-handedly off to their right, her thunderous face the picture of concentration.</p><p>Snape caught sight of Lily and he paused for a split second.  Her red hair a curtain hiding her face, Lily wouldn’t turn and look at him.  Then Alice blasted another curse, and Snape snarled, blocking it just in time and flying back into battle.</p><p>“I didn’t even get to use my Transfiguration,” James muttered, slumped bloody against Lily as they moved farther away into quiet, away from the battlefield.  “I hardly call this surviving a battle with Voldemort.”</p><p>“It’s our third.  And we’re surviving, just the same,” said Lily firmly.  “Look.  There he is, fighting Dumbledore,” she added solemnly.</p><p>Dumbledore and Voldemort were indeed battling on the center of the field.  Even as they watched, Dumbledore transfigured up a great spiral sculpture of ice to guard himself and in a single shot of a greenly lit curse, his white snake-like face twisted, Voldemort blasted it away.  Another battle was going on close to Voldemort.</p><p>“Is… is that Bellatrix Lestrange fighting Mad-Eye Moody?” James asked disbelievingly.</p><p>“She won’t leave <i>his</i> side,” Lily explained simply, with a nod toward Voldemort.</p><p>“The werewolves aren’t here,” James realized.</p><p>“Remus said they wouldn’t be.  He is our spy,” Lily reminded him.  </p><p>“Yes, well.  I’m not sure that we trust that anymore,” said James, troubled, his eyes distant.</p><p>“That people in general don’t trust that?  Or that you don’t trust that?” Lily clarified.</p><p>“People say he’s been in there too long, among them.  No, I still trust him,” James admitted, almost as an afterthought.  “I don’t think Sirius does, though.”</p><p>They had made it to the tent.</p><p>“I have to admit - I thought it would be Peter Pettigrew first in here, and instead it’s you,” said Lily, grinning and trying to make light of things as James lowered himself down bloodily on a bed inside.  The inside of the Healer’s tent was an airy white space with big hospital beds, Lily’s domain, filled with bottles of potions and jars of herbs.  A green fire floated magically in the center of the tent, keeping it warm.</p><p>But James had become unresponsive, turning inward, brooding.  Lily frowned - and then went to the tent and peeked out the flap doors.  She took out her wand and waved it once, and a magical charm of a Bubble appeared conjured before the tent.  Echoing out from it was an almost invisible, ethereal shield, blocking the tent off physically and in sound from the battlefield.</p><p>Lily cautiously retreated her head back inside the tent.</p><p>Lily went over to James and lay him down.  She put her wand over his injured arm and shoulder calmly and began healing him.  He hissed and winced.</p><p>“As I thought.  The cut is cursed,” said Lily.  “I can get rid of the mark, but it’s going to take this and then some prolonged salve potion treatment.  You’ll also have to swallow another potion, a rather nasty one, to make up for what you’ve lost in blood.”</p><p>“So I can’t go back out and fight.”</p><p>Lily looked up at him, unreadable.  “No,” she said at last.  “This is your wand arm.”</p><p>James let out a sharp breath and let his head flop back against the pillow.</p><p>“James, you can’t fight every battle to its end -” Lily began.</p><p>“But -!”  James looked up, hazel eyes wide behind his round glasses.</p><p><i>“You can’t,”</i> Lily emphasized, suddenly desperate and emotional, taking him by the hand, the light coming from her wand wavering for a moment.  “You - if you try that, you won’t make it, and I can’t - <i>I can’t lose you,”</i> she whispered.</p><p>James took her hand, looking up into her eyes.  “We knew the risks when we signed up,” he said.  “We decided it was worth it - for both of us.”</p><p>“But that - that doesn’t mean you have to go out <i>courting</i> -”  Lily looked down; there were tears unshed in her almond-shaped bright green eyes.  Her voice had wavered.  <i>“Damn</i> me and my habit of crying when I get angry,” she managed out in a watery way at last.</p><p>“Lily,” said James tenderly, leaning forward.  </p><p>Lily’s spell finished, blinking away from her wand.  “I - I have to go get the salve -” she began awkwardly, and then James kissed her.</p><p>In a desperate sort of way, she kissed him back, running her hand along his fine jawline, over his thin face and through his messy black hair.  He had his hands in her hair.  Coming to kneel over him, tenderly she massaged the mark that was still on his arm.  He moaned into her mouth, and something seemed to leap through their chests between them.</p><p>Lily gasped and leaned back, eyes wide.  “I - I haven’t been taking the potions -” she began.</p><p>“Relax.  It’s the middle of a battlefield.  Nothing will happen.”  James smiled in fond exasperation.  “Lily Potter forgot to take her potions one night -” he began in a mock solemn voice, and Lily giggled and shoved him.</p><p>“You are <i>ridiculous,”</i> she said, and then she was kissing him again.</p><p>Soon they were moving together, and then Lily straddled James, topping him.  She arched and gasped as he slipped inside her.  They moved together, suppressing soft moans, watching each other - just watching each other.  James’s eyes were wide and awed, Lily’s intent and tender as she softly caressed the mark still on his arm.</p><p>The act was almost totally silent, and went quickly - they knew what was happening just outside the flap in that tent.  It was nevertheless an intensely tender love act.  The two of them watched each other, eyes deep, mouths slightly open with effort as they moved together.</p><p>They came as one with soft moans, and when it was over -</p><p>Lily looked around and gasped.  “I - I have to get back to work,” she said suddenly, face red and flushed, and still awkward, she moved quickly away and went to fiddle with something at her potions table.  Reflexively, she reached an embarrassed hand up to her hair where James had been running his hands through it.</p><p>James watched her, lowering his hands and smirking.  He hummed contentedly and smiled, closing his eyes and leaning his head back against the pillow.  “I should get injured more often,” he said aloud thoughtfully to himself.</p><p>Lily whirled around, suddenly angry, and hissed, <i>“Don’t you dare.”</i></p><p>James laughed.</p><p>Lily cleared her throat primly, straightening her hair and handing him two potion bottles.  “Apply this one to your arm, swallow that one.”  She pointed.  “I would have administered the medicine myself, but because of your silly hair-brained idea, I’ve run out of time and now I have to go find more injured people.”</p><p>She marched to the door of the tent like she was still the brainiac in school, like she still knew everything.  James had never loved anyone more intensely than he did in that moment.</p><p>“Lily.”</p><p>She turned back in surprise, tucking her dark red hair back behind her ear, innocent eyes wide and green.</p><p>“... Be careful,” said James seriously.</p><p>Lily smiled, eyes dancing.  “Look who’s talking,” she said playfully, and left the tent.  James smiled after her.</p>
