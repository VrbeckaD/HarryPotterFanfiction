          <div class="userstuff"><p>Queenie walked through the door, a large purple bruise spread across her cheekbone.   Tina was quick to jump out of her seat, looking at Queenie with concern.    "What the hell happened to you? Who hurt you? W-was it him?"  Queenie was looking at the floor, afraid to meet her sister's eyes.  "He...he found out that I was in a relationship with Y/N. He was angry that I had moved on so quickly. Tina, I'm scared, what if he comes here?"  Tina hated to see her sister so defenceless. She grabbed her wand, leaving Queenie with you, and stormed out of the apartment.  "Oh, he won't. He'll never hurt you ever again."</p></div>
