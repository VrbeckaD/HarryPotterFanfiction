    <p align="left"><strong>CHAPTER 1</strong><br/> <em>“I gotta give it to you, you give me problems.”</em> – Kathleen, Catfish and the Bottlemen</p><p> </p><p>“You named her <em>what</em>?”</p><p>Harry looks deeply into the red eyes of the skeletal animal, but it still doesn’t look like a vampire slayer to him.</p><p>“Buffy,” Luna repeats. “And this is Ross, Baudelaire, Piper, and Hannibal,” she says, pointing at the one Harry is standing next to.</p><p>There’s a terrible silence, finally broken by Hermione’s careful:</p><p>“Luna…I installed Netflix for you two days ago.”</p><p>Luna’s eyes are a limpid blue as she says:</p><p>“It turns out Netfleckers make one lose all sense of time. I sent a letter to Dad about it. He was very happy for the insight.”</p><p>Harry sees Hermione frown and open her mouth, and instantly tunes out the conversation, knowing from experience how long the two girls’ arguments can last. Instead he takes in the scenery of loud, excited students climbing onto the carriages, and with a sudden sting of bitterness, wonders how many of them still have the benefit of thinking there’s nothing pulling them.</p><p>He’s called back to reality by Luna’s reproachful words.</p><p>“Harry, why aren’t you petting Hannibal? They’re loyal creatures, you know, and he probably thinks of you as his master after flying you to the Ministry.”</p><p>Harry blinks. He’s pretty sure that thestral back in fifth year was female.</p><p>“Don’t you recognize him?”</p><p>Luna sounds genuinely offended on behalf of the animal, which keeps placidly munching on Harry’s sleeve. Well, at least that name Hannibal sort of makes sense. He gives it an awkward sort of pat before climbing inside the carriage, and thanking heavens that it isn’t already occupied by some adoring first year. With Hagrid gone to become caretaker of Beauxbâtons horses, they no longer get to the castle through a different entrance, and Harry isn’t all that enthusiastic about being in close quarters with any of them. Meeting some of them on the Hogwarts Express has been – sufficiently enlightening.</p><p>“Harry I can almost hear your thoughts and I’m not impressed,” Hermione quips up.</p><p>“You wouldn’t understand,” Harry mock-sighs. “You have no idea how dramatically inconvenient it is, being The Boy Who Lived Twice To Save The Wizarding World. Adoring crowds everywhere I go, sexual advances left and right, people offering me their first-borns… it’s very tiring.”</p><p>She slaps him on the head with the Daily Prophet, the front page of which shows his own face moodily scowling at the cameras (“The Saviour’s Smouldering Look Sets A New Trend”, which is still better than Witch Weekly’s “Exclusive: Harry Potter’s Scandalous Hogwarts Love Life” and Teen Witch’s “10 reasons we choose our Chosen Boy”).</p><p>“I’d be surprised if all the attention hasn’t already gotten to your head. Clearly you’re going mad.”</p><p>Harry shrugs, his lips curling into a smile.</p><p>“Nah. Haven’t you heard?” He juts his chin out to Luna, who has taken off one of her radish earrings and is nibbling at it. “I’m just as sane as she is.”</p><p>Eventually they fall silent as the carriage is about to turn into view of what Harry once considered his home. He doesn’t know what would be worse, a castle still half destroyed, reminders of the horrible war at every corner, or a new, shiny Hogwarts trying to pretend nothing happened at all.<br/> Finally, the castle comes into view, the familiar towers tearing up the night sky. The carriages come to a halt in front of the large entrance, and as soon as he steps out, Harry drinks in the renewed façade and giant oak door. Last time he saw it, it was in complete ruins.</p><p>“Harry, welcome back.”</p><p>He turns around to see Neville smiling assuredly at him, his confident attitude and broad shoulders miles away from the nervous boy he used to be. Both Ron and Neville went back in mid-July to help with the reconstructions. Ron said it felt like he somehow owed it to Fred, and Hermione and Harry knew better than to argue with that, but it was weeks before the idea of returning to Hogwarts for a retake of their final year made Harry feel anything but completely nauseated.</p><p>“Nev,” Harry greets, before letting his eyes roam the Entrance Hall, looking for–oh.</p><p>Ron has his tongue down Hermione’s throat, his arms holding her in a passionate embrace. Well, he guesses he can say hi a bit later.</p><p>“That’s the best way to attract Dappleblimps,” Luna remarks mildly. “You’d think winning a war would have made them more careful.”</p><p>“Ah, I’ve missed you,” Neville laughs.</p><p>While the two of them catch up with each other, Harry makes his way to his best friends, who have reluctantly let go of each other at Hermione’s sudden realization of how crowded the room is. Both are bright red, but Ron manages to overlook his embarrassment enough to pull Harry into a hug.</p><p>“It’s good to see you again,” he grins. “I hope Mum wasn’t too annoying because you didn’t stay at the Burrow.” He sends a fleeting glance around, and seems reassured that Hermione is out of ear’s reach. “By the way mate, I need to know. Did she receive any more letters from Krum?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Come on, you know, Viktor Krum. He’s always sending Mione these long-ass letters, and the war certainly didn’t stop him.” He pauses a couple of seconds. “I hate that guy.”</p><p>“I…,” Harry shakes his head in bemusement. “I have no idea.”</p><p>“Ugh, what’s the point of getting free samples from George’s shops if you don’t even use them to spy on your best mate’s girlfriend?”</p><p>George recently released the projects he had been working on with Fred, calling the new line ‘Fred’s Fantastically Fabulous Final Fabrications’. It included Extendable Eyes, with which Harry guesses he could have checked Hermione’s mail, had he acquired an even bigger death wish than the one everyone kept talking to him about during the war.</p><p>“Ron, it’s Hermione. I don’t think Wizarding Wheezes could ever trick her.”</p><p>As expected, a dopey grin spreads on the redhead’s face, the one that literally spells out ‘my girlfriend is brilliant and I love her’.</p><p>“I guess you’re right. Let’s get some food then, there’s no jealousy a good old feast can’t fix.”</p><p>They follow the crowd into the Great Hall, and it’s somewhat of a shock to see it again so whole, the four long tables and the sky-reflecting ceiling and the professors’ tables where McGonagall sits and smiles at him – he drops his gaze, fists tight at his side.</p><p>It’s hard to breathe, suddenly. He can still see endless rows of beds with the people who died for him, the limp arms and red-tainted sheets. Some bodies so small it makes him want to retch. The mourning families surrounding them. In his dreams, they scream that it’s all his fault. There’s a pressure in his lungs and his throat feels tight, like he’s finally going to cry those months of unshed tears. It’s not just the deaths. Death is easy, he’s been there. But he can also still hear screams of pain.</p><p>A firm hand on his arm throws him out of his daze.</p><p>“There’s a brick for each of them,” Ron quietly says. “On the far end wall, they each have their name carved into a brick. To commemorate. We can go pay our respects later if you want.” He hesitates; adds. “There’s one for Cedric too.”</p><p>Harry takes a sharp breath, the oxygen almost hurting on the way down.</p><p>“Okay. Okay. That’s good.”</p><p>They find their way to the Gryffindor table and Harry is only slightly trembling by the time he sits down. The table is full of happy faces and loud voices, eager to get the feast started.</p><p>“Yes, yes, people cheated to change the location of the championship, but did someone create a fake trophy and plant it in another club’s practice room to create a scandal which caused their star player’s expulsion?” Seamus is rattling off to Dean.</p><p>“No, but that’s di–oh, hey guys.”</p><p>They both greet the new-comers quickly before going back to their argument about what sport is more corrupted, football or Quidditch. As Ron and Neville start listing other Quidditch scandals to a disgruntled Dean, Harry relaxes, sweet familiarity washing over him in between his old roommates and comrades during the war.</p><p>Letting his gaze sweep once again over the Hall, he finds himself taking stock of the students. Only the Gryffindor table seems to be as full as the previous years. Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff still have a considerable number of students, but not everyone came back to retake their 7th year, and some were sent to different schools after Hogwarts was deemed unsafe. The Slytherin Table, in contrast, is half empty. Few came back, although he does recognize Bulstrode and Parkinson, who he is surprised to see had the guts to come back after what happened during the battle.</p><p>And of course, there’s Malfoy.</p><p>He’s sitting a bit off to the side, his white blond hair falling into his face as he stares down at the table. Somehow, he looks as defeated as he did at his trial.</p><p>It’s the only one Harry went to. Most of June is a blur to him, between the endless ceremonies and dreadful funerals, but the trial stands out to him. He remembers it as if it were yesterday, the stale air of the old room, the indignant and self-righteous faces of the Wizengamot – as if they had lifted a single fucking finger during the war–, the fear lining Narcissa Malfoy’s face and the emptiness in her husband’s eyes… The way the public was almost panting for the Malfoys’ blood. It was horrible. Harry stayed just enough time to testify for Narcissa and for Malfoy, and then left.</p><p>Now, Harry lets his eyes glide over him. He’s as pointy a git as ever, with his narrow shoulders, pointy chin and sharp cheekbones. He looks washed out; everything about him is impossibly pale, his skin and his hair and even his eyes…which are staring right back at him. Fuck.</p><p>Caught, Harry fights hard against an embarrassed blush. How could he have thought Malfoy looked defeated just a minute ago? The way the grey eyes are surveying him, all arrogance and disdain, that’s not defeat. That’s someone still aiming for victory.<br/> Malfoy arches an eyebrow, and Harry knows the polite thing would be to look away – after all, he’s the one who got caught looking – but he can’t back down. Yes, there may be a war and life debts between them, and he can’t honestly say he hates him anymore, but it’s still sodding Malfoy and he absolutely <em>refuses</em> to lose to Malfoy.</p><p>Malfoy must have seen it on his face, because there’s a snarl forming at his lips, and his eyes darken. His entire being seems to scream ‘well go on, fight me’, his bitterness and resentment hitting Harry hard even from the other side of the room. And it’s not exactly what Harry would have expected, after saving the guy’s life twice and defending him at his trial. He can taste something sour in the back of his throat.</p><p>Then McGonagall stands up to announce the Sorting Ceremony, and Harry finally wrenches his eyes away.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Will you stay still for two seconds,” Harry mutters, half exasperated, as he finishes unpacking. “Please?”</p><p>Sometimes he thinks getting a wizarding tattoo was his worst idea yet, as he hasn’t yet gotten used to the tickling sensation when it moves and it’s slowly driving him insane. But Dean was all too happy to draw him the phoenix spanning across his back once he mentioned his interest, and anything that made any of them happy this summer got itself a place of choice on Harry’s list of priorities. Still, it <em>tickles</em>.</p><p>“Talking to yourself again? I hear that’s the first sign of insanity,” comes Seamus voice from behind. “Next is having mood swings for no apparent reason, and inability to follow rules…oh shit.”</p><p>Harry chucks a pillow at him.</p><p>“See! Now the violence! Ah, and this year I won’t be able to rely on other Gryffindors to protect me from you,” Seamus fake-shudders.</p><p>“There’s always Dean just next door,” Harry points out.</p><p>“Oh yes. Dean, my dear friend. My saviour. My knight in shining armour.”</p><p>He launches himself onto a very surprised Dean, who promptly falls to the ground.</p><p>“Seamus what the hell?”</p><p>“Yeah no, he’s not saviour material. Oh, but what am I going to do?” Seamus laments somewhere in the background.</p><p>As McGonagall explained during the feast, the so-called 8th years are all sharing a common room and dormitories somewhere in the West Tower, regardless of House. Harry considers himself somewhat lucky, as he’s roomed with Seamus and Terry Boot, a bookish boy from Ravenclaw.</p><p>Despite being newly convinced that Slytherins are not all bad and that perpetuating the stereotype is only encouraging the exclusion of Slytherins and possible formation of future Dark Lords, only Nott and Malfoy came back to retake the year. He figures it’d be a bit awkward, sharing his bedroom with them when he’s played a huge part in the death of one’s father and the imprisonment of the other’s. Plus, they’re kind of assholes.</p><p>Still, it’s going to be strange not sharing bedrooms with Ron for the first time.</p><p>“We could get drunk,” Anthony Goldstein says, looking down at Seamus’ inert form on the ground.</p><p>“Um, isn’t tomorrow the first day of classes?” Terry points out.</p><p>“Ugh,” Seamus wrinkles his nose, “then we’re definitely getting drunk.”</p><p>Turns out Anthony brought some Fireball back from the summer, and within minutes, they have an actual plan. Seamus and Harry will both go to the dorm Ron, Ernie, Dean and Anthony are sharing, while Terry stays in to get a good night’s sleep. While Dean and Anthony are setting up the drinks in their room, Harry offers to go to the kitchens and get some food from the house elves. The rules are relaxed for the 8th years, and they’re more or less allowed to do anything as long as they’re in their Tower by curfew.</p><p>He quickly lists to the kitchens, tickling the pear and getting inside, the movements still second nature to him. Dobby’s name is on the tip of his tongue for a second, before he swallows and calls out for Kreacher instead. The elf appears almost instantly, a tall orange cat curling around his ankles.</p><p>Kreacher and Crookshanks struck up an unlikely friendship after Kreacher declared that the House of Black had always held cats in high esteem (Harry thought of Sirius’ Animagus form and had to hide a laugh) and proceeded to make the half Kneazle all kinds of fancy dishes to find its favourite.</p><p>He’s also all too happy to give Harry some leftovers from the feast, beaming and bowing as Crookshanks watches the exchange with that superior air cats have. Harry narrow his eyes at him, struggling to hold all the food in his hands.</p><p>“Hey you, no judging. You think I haven’t noticed how much you’ve eaten over the summer?”</p><p>Hermione’s cat resembles her strangely as it stares at him hard for a second before turning around and leaving the room, all self-important disdain. Harry childishly sticks out his tongue to it, before bidding the house elves goodbye and making his way back to the dormitory.<br/> He’s just about to go up the stairs to the West Tower when he hears voices and comes to a halt.</p><p>“What the heck do you think you’re doing here, huh?”</p><p>“Come to shove it in our faces, how your family murdered ours and got away with it? Death Eater scum.”</p><p>He stills.</p><p>“Look at him, always gloating and so arrogant. Do you even know their names? Wait no, you don’t give a single fuck, they weren’t Purebloods. Or maybe you remember torturing them at night and get off on it?”</p><p>Then there’s the sound of flesh hitting flesh, and Harry breaks into a run.</p><p>Down the corridor, three boys – fifth or sixth year Ravenclaws – have backed Malfoy into the wall. Harry’s eyes flit about, taking in the situation quickly. They have his wand, but only one of the three has his own drawn. The one talking has a hand at Malfoy’s throat, his fist clenched as if ready to punch again. The third is kicking at his legs, insulting him under his breath.</p><p>And Malfoy is just taking it, narrow mouth twisted in a scowl as the darkness under his eye spreads. There’s a cut on his nose, a bit of blood dripping down his cheek.</p><p>“Is that really all you’ve got?” He drawls. “Oh yes, kick the bad Death Eater. Go to sleep knowing you’ve made this world a bit better. Might as well join Gryffindor. Oh wait no, that would require actual fighting, not just attacking the losing side three to one once the war is over…we can’t have that.”</p><p>The tirade earns him another punch, and the back of his head hits the wall.</p><p>“<em>Accio</em> wands!”</p><p>Four wands fly into Harry’s hand, and four faces swivel to him.</p><p>“Don’t ever. Don’t ever let me catch you at this again,” he says, his tone icy.</p><p>He doesn’t know how or when it happened, but he’s seething, jaw clenched in disgust. Who the fuck do those kids think they are? The boys gape. They probably thought he’d be proud of them or something. One opens his mouth to protest, and promptly closes it again at the sight of Harry’s face.</p><p>“We all lost people to the war. Now justice has been served, and if Malfoy is here rather than Azkaban, maybe there’s a reason for that. If I see you attacking students again, you’ll have a lot more to deal with. Now go on,” he tells the Ravenclaws. “Get lost.”</p><p>He throws the wands to the ground at their feet and they scramble to get them before hurrying away. Once they’re gone, Harry turns to Malfoy. The former Death Eater is staring at him with fury in his eyes.</p><p>“Well done. Did that feel good? Some kind of ego trip, or do you really still insist on making my life a sodding nightmare?”</p><p>Once again, Harry is thrown by Malfoy’s animosity.</p><p>“I was. I was literally just trying to help? What?”</p><p>Malfoy actually laughs. An utterly cold, mirthless laugh that makes the hairs on Harry’s arms stand up. He grits his teeth.</p><p>“Oh, but yes of course, I forget. It must have been <em>so hard</em> for our chosen one this summer, without anything to save. You must have been so terribly bored.” His tone is sugar sweet, contempt colouring every syllable. “Well spare me your oh-so-heroic ‘help’, I won’t feed your narcissism. Find yourself another pet project,” he sneers. “I think I saw Weasley walk by in his atrocious robes just before. Seems like the monetary issues haven’t been solved…maybe you can start there?”</p><p>Within seconds, Harry has him right back up against the wall.</p><p>“Don’t you fucking dare talk about them.”</p><p>“I mean, you must know of a least <em>a couple</em> of addresses that could help the girl weasel make some extra cash on the side, being an orphan and all. I heard certain brothels will give out leftovers to hungry children on the street. Touching, isn’t it?”</p><p>Malfoy doesn’t have the time to escape the punch, but he’s laughing as blood drips from his mouth.</p><p>“Yes, go ahead, hit me. Show me how much better you are than those Ravenclaw boys. Harry Potter, the most brave and kind-hearted of them all.”</p><p>Harry shoves him away, disgusted with him and with himself. How dare he insult the Weasleys and suggest those things about Ginny? How dare he talk about Harry’s childhood? And how dare he still be able to get under Harry’s skin like no one else?</p><p>He leaves a bloody, grinning Malfoy in the corridor as he picks up the food where he left it earlier and walks up the stairs to his dormitory. Merlin, he needs to get drunk.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah but Snape is, like, scary. Or was, or whatever.”</p><p>“And the Squid isn’t scary? It has tentacles!” Seamus exclaims.</p><p>“Neville’s Boggart was Snape and no one’s Boggart was the Squid,” Dean points out, and everyone is silent a couple of moments.</p><p>“Dean gets points for complicated sentence,” Ron finally nods, hugging the bottle to his chest.</p><p>“But wait, the Giant Squid is <em>wet</em>. Imagine kissing something wet and slimy.”</p><p>This time, Harry speaks up.</p><p>“But Snape was so, like, <em>oily</em>. His hair all greasy and stuff. It would be wet and slimy too!”</p><p>The six boys all make horrified faces, except for Ron, who giggles.</p><p>“But Harry you like wet kisses! Remember Cho? Maybe you would like kissing Snape! Snape and Harry, Snape plus Harry, Snarry…”</p><p>He starts humming ‘Snape and Harry sitting in a tree’, and Harry makes a violent grab for the bottle. The alcohol burns on the way down, and he feels himself relaxing further as warmth courses down his limbs, making things a bit fuzzier.</p><p>“Harry that’s terrible,” Ernie is saying. “Don’t get me wrong, I do like very wet lips. Just not the ones on girls’ <em>faces</em>.”</p><p>There are collective disgusted groans around the room, and Harry quickly takes another swig of the bottle. He needs more of that fuzziness, <em>now</em>. They’ve had a bottle and a half of Fireball by now and are all drunk off their arses, which is a bad thing because classes tomorrow but also it’s a good thing because Harry needs to forget the way Malfoy attacked him before. Well no, he attacked Malfoy, but Malfoy attacked him <em>verbally</em> which is almost as bad and really Harry shouldn’t care but he never thought Malfoy could still hate him after what happened, he thought maybe–</p><p>“Harry! Did you fight with Malfoy?” Ron exclaims. “Already?”</p><p>Did he just talk out loud? Oh well, guess it’s <em>that</em> part of the night.</p><p>“The <em>worst</em> is!” Anthony says, wide-eyed, “there’s <em>no way</em> we can just ig-<em>ignore</em> them this year. Because we <em>all</em> live <em>together</em>.”</p><p>“Argh,” Seamus gasps and steals the bottle from Harry. “I need this.”</p><p>“Please give me the fire,” Anthony moans. “It’s the only way to survive this year.”</p><p>“This is our only light in this dark, dark time,” Seamus says enthusiastically.</p><p>“Our only hope,” Dean agrees.</p><p>“A silver lining in this terrible storm,” Ernie adds.</p><p>“I think it’s ‘cloud’, actually.”</p><p>Everyone turns to stare at Ron. Dean points an accusing finger.</p><p>“You’re becoming your girlfriend and it’s terrifying.”</p><p>“Terrifering,” Harry nods. “Imagine,” he waves his hands around. “A very angry Hermione. Like, very angry. She could take over the world! Terfying.”</p><p>“Woah. Mean Hermione. Dark Lord Hermione!” Justin gasps, and everyone contemplates the idea in a somewhat horrified silence.</p><p>“But you could have saved us, you’re the chosen one!” Ernie cries out.</p><p>Both Ron and Harry immediately shake their head.</p><p>“It’s <em>Hermione</em>.”</p><p>“Please keep her happy,” Dean entreats, holding on to Ron’s arm. “Remember the wet lips.”</p><p>Ron suddenly turns completely crimson, and Harry fake-retches.</p><p>“Ugh.”</p><p>“Uh please, you. You shagged my sister. And then you broke up.”</p><p>Everyone turns to Harry, who is gasping and shaking his head.</p><p>“She wanted to break up! I didn’t–no heartbreak! Everything is good,” he insists. “Very good. So good.”</p><p>“As good as the sex?” Seamus smirks, and then whimpers a complaint because both Harry and Ron have thrown their pillows at him.</p><p>“I never want to think about Gin and sex!” Ron cries out before shuffling to Harry and grabbing his hand. “But it’s okay, because you’re my mate and I love you.”</p><p>“Mate,” Harry whispers back, and suddenly there are confetti falling on top of their heads.</p><p>“Neat!” He hears Seamus say in the distance. “Teach me that spell.”</p><p>Through the confetti, Harry holds his best friend’s hand tight.</p><p>“I’m gonna miss you in the bed next to me but. We will survive!”</p><p>Ron nods enthusiastically.</p><p>“We survived Voldemort and death! We can do this year!” He pauses, wrinkles his nose. “I mean there’s Slytherins in the common room but! We will try.”</p><p>Harry’s grin feels too big for his face, and he pats Ron’s cheek once before passing out.</p>
