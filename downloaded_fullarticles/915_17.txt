          <div class="userstuff"><p>Warning:</p><p>This story is going to be fucked up, do not read if you have any triggers. I am not going to be posting any sort of trigger warning at all in front of any chapter, if you know for a fact that you have triggers, do not read this book. This book is not intended to be an example, nor is it intended to glorify violence, drugs, or sex.</p><p>This book is mainly going to be a Tom/Hermione story, however, they're not going to just magically be in love, it's going to take time. Furthermore, there will be absolutely no magic involved in this story, it's set in an alternate universe for a reason.</p><p>All of the characters in this book will be fucked up to some extent. Hermione is not going to be a good person, she's going to make decisions that many wouldn't agree with, however she is simply reacting to her environment and the harsh conditions of her life. Her relationship with Tom is definitely not going to be a healthy one, but there will be no domestic violence between those two. Tom is also definitely not a good person in this story, so don't expect him to turn into a good person. This is for the most part not a happy story. Life always continues after tragedy, it's not the end of the story, so I will never end any story with a tragedy.</p><p>Do not use the coping skills in this story as an outlet, they're in the story so they can be learned from, not idealized.</p><p>This is just kind of an outlet for me, please don't take offense to anything that is said or done in the story.</p></div>
