  <span>“I don't know who he thinks he is, really!” Lily said “It's the fourth time today he has asked me out” she said and finished her series of overdramatic hand gestures with angrily clenching her fists and throwing angry looks at two first years who walked past them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“He’s a git, and you know it” the girl beside her, Marlene said and sighed. Merlin, she was tired of Lilys never ending complaining about the messy haired potter boy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know I know! He’s so irritating I don't know what to do” and before Marlene could say something she said “I can't hex him, Mcgonagall will give me weeks of detention and I can't afford that right now”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then go on a date with him. Act as boring and bad as you can and he’ll never ask you again” Marlene smiled at her </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you think actually that’ll work?” Lily turned around facing her friend</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'm positive” Marlene ensured her </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then i'll just say yes next time he asks me?” She said, not sure if she liked the idea or if it even would work</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Splendid! Now let's get going, we can't be late for transfiguration or McGonagall will kill us both.” Marlene said standing up</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily sighed but stood up too and the two girls made their way through the castle and into the transfiguration classroom. McGonagall was already sitting at her desk in the front so the two girls sat down in the middle, behind their friends Mary and Dorcas. Alice was sitting with Frank, her boyfriend, on the other side of the room while Emmeline was currently in Herbology.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So what were you up too?” Dorcas asked </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We made plans, out dear Lily is going on a date!” Marlene casual and leaning back on her chair which earned her a dirty look from McGonagall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“No way! With who?” Mary asked, eyes wide open in excitement and surprisement. Lily wasn't exactly the one who dated a lot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“James” Marlene said and both Mary and Dorcas went into some sort of chock. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“James as in James Potter aka the guy you hate ‘cause he’s so irritating and annoying?” Dorcas said</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t hate him.. I just don't like him” Lily defended herself</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But whyyy” Mary asked “and when?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They were cut off but McGonagall who started talking about today's lesson. They were supposed to transfigure a pen into a diamond. It was far from hard but it was all about the details. Everything needed to be perfect.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When the class ended the four girls splitted up. Marlene and Dorcas had Arithmancy, Mary had Advanced herbology and Lily had Advanced potions. Lily liked potions, she was also fairly good at it she got an O on her O.W.Ls which allowed her to take the advanced class. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Too bad James Potter and Sirius black both were in her advanced potions class. They always partnered with each other and did always make some sort of mess. Severus Snape, Lilys ex friend also were in that class. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before the two of them were inseparable, Severus was the one who introduced Lily to the wizard world. But after a nasty fight which ended with him in the hospital wing for a week and them both in a months detention their friendship abruptly came to an end. Lily still got furious when she thought about it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The reason of the fight was easy, he was being a homophobic dick and using racial slurs and then “accidentally” calling her mudblood. Simply as that she lost all respect for him and hexed him. That was in their 3rd year and Snape was still trying to win her back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hi Lily, you ready for today? I think we are getting to try to make a Babbling Beverage” Emmeline said when Lily came up beside her</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hi Em, how was Herbology?” Lily said and hugged the girl</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It was okay, rather boring actually, what about Transfiguration?” Emmeline hugged her back and smiled brightly at her. Somehow she always smiled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Same as always, I still don't get the wand movements quite right” Lily sighed, she could do all the spells but she couldn't do them better than okay.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe you should get a tutor? I heard about one of the boys Ravenclaw doing some tutoring for Mcgonagall” Emmeline said, again smiling</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh there is?” Lily was surprised “Do you know who?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'm afraid I don't, I only know that he’s very good at it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well thank you Em, I think i'll check it out!” Lily smiled, a tutor might be what she needed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The lesson went on without troubles and their potion turned out great. Black and Potter were of course up to trouble again because everytime slughorn turned his back against them they both broke into giggles.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The lesson ended with a desk exploding, spreading red and yellow paint in the room. Lily thankfully was not hit due to her being smart enough to hide behind a pelar at the moment she heard something starting to bubble a little too much.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And as every other teacher Slughorn sent them to McGonagall's office. She was the only one who hadn't give up on them a long time ago.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>After Potions Lily and Emmeline met up the rest of their friends and they all went to their common room. There was surprisingly few people in the common room, two first years and a few second and third year students. The older students were often too be found in the library (or in detention).</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well I have something to do sorry guys. Em told me about a tutor and i really think i need some help” Lily gave the group a weak smile</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really? You're so good at everything” Mary said surprised</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Doesn't mean i can't get better, and I really can't get the right wand movements in transfiguration.” Lily sighed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay honey, come find us later. We will probably be here or in one of our dorms.” Alice said</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Great, see you later!” She said and stepped back out of the common room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lily decided to go to McGonagall to ask about the tutor. She just hoped with her while heart that Black and Potter still wasn't there. She knocked 3 times and the door opened revealing three persons. Because </span>
  <em>
    <span>of course </span>
  </em>
  <span>they still was there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello Miss Evans, what can I do for you today?” McGonagall said giving her a small smile</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Emmeline told me about someone in Ravenclaw doing some tutoring, I’d really need some help so I was just wondering if you knew who it is?” Lily said slightly nervous as she felt Potter's eyes on her. (Black was just sitting there, sipping on his tea)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh yes of course! Are you available tomorrow at four in the afternoon?” McGonagall asked kindly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good! What subject was it you needed help with?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mostly Transfiguration but i guess Charms too” she answered</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bring the materials you need and meet him in the library, at four in the afternoon” McGonagall said </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course! Thank you very much mrs McGonagall” Lily said and thereafter hurried out of the room.</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What a girl” Sirius said after Lily har hurried out of the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s certainly a bright young woman” McGonagall said</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She’s amazing” James said (and being the equivalent of the heart eyes emoji)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who’s the tutor anyways?” Sirius asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oi, isn't it that Lupin bloke in our year?” James answered</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes mr. Lupin has been doing some tutoring lately, he’d make a great teacher in the future” McGonagall said with a certain warmth in her tone “And I believe you're detention for today is over. Please come back in tomorrow again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can't promise anything my dear Minnie” Sirius said already halfway out the door</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Black behave!” She shouted after him but sighing when the two boys left her office. They were a handful.</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was thursday afternoon and in 23 minutes Lily was suppose to meet her new tutor in the library. She still thought it was kinda strange that no one seemed to know who he was. She also for some reason had trouble deciding what to wear. She wanted to look like she was serious with this but not too serious, and nice but not too nice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In the end she settled with a gray skirt and a basic white t-shirt. She picked up her books and decided to go to the library now. Better early than late.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When she arrived at the library it somehow only was 2 minutes left so her plan about coming early was blow away. She entered the huge library and tried to find the person who was supposed to tutor her. A brown haired boy at the table closest to the window waved at her and she smiled and walked to him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was Remus Lupin, he was a fellow prefect so they were was no stranger to one another.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello Lily” He greeted her</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hello Remus” She smiled at him “I didn't know it was you who were tutoring people”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You're disappointed?” He asked </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not at all, i'm more than happy with it being you. I've heard loads of people talking about the handsome super good tutor from Ravenclaw” She smiled brightly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, so people talk about me?” Remus asked slightly shocked </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh you bet they do, and only good stuff” Lily laughed a little at Remus horrified face</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hopefully” He said “Now what was it you needed help with?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh yes i completely forgot about that. It's transfiguration, or mostly my wand work, I can manage all the spells but i want to to them perfect, or at least better. But I don't know how to do it.” She said </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Could you try to transfigure this pen to a candle?” Remus asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course” Lily answered and transfigured the pen into a candle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That's good, could you transfigure it to teddybear?” Remus asked </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She did transfigure the now candle into a teddy bear. It was a sad looking teddy bear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh I see the problem, you're too focused about doing the wand movement perfect so you're overdoing it. Try doing it without thinking too much about it!” Remus told her</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Three weeks went by and Lily improved her wandwork more and more by every lesson with Remus. The boy had slowly grown on him to the part where she would consider him one of her closest friends. They often hung out outside of classes, studying together or gossiping. One time Lily dragged him with her to hogsmeade. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Since the two of them started to hang out Potter had started to back off, he hadn't asked her out since Marlene told her to say yes to a date with him. Lily was surprised, it was nice (she kinda missed it, but that she would never admit. Her theory was that Potter thought her and Remus was dating. Which would never happen, they were only friends. And she was pretty certain he was into guys.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus and Lily was currently sitting in the astronomy tower, lily was working on her ancient runes homework and remus was working on something else. Lily so badly wanted to know but whenever she asked he just smirked at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hypothetically, if i needed to produce a shit ton of ice, what spell would work the best?” Remus broke the silence</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hypothetically? Uh maybe Glacius, but then you need water first... why?” Lily said unsure</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So Aguamenti first to conjure water and then freeze it with Glacius? Great, thanks Lils” Remus smiled thankful at her</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No worries, can't you just tell me what you are doing?” Lily pleaded</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It's a surprise, and you're going to love it. I swear!” Remus laughed at her </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know you can trust me, right?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course?” He answered confused</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Aaaaanything” She said seriously</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lily I don't understand-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh for fucks sake Remus, I know you are doing this to impress </span>
  <em>
    <span>someone</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Lily groaned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I am?” Remus said trying to sound as innocent as he could</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Clearly?! It's not that hard to guess who… you're not that subtle” She said meaningly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“oh” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just tell me who so I can play matchmaker” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. You're not playin matchmaker” Remus protested loudly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Of course I am. If you would just tell me who, otherwise i'll set you up with someone else…” Lily said smiling innocent</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay Lily, merlin.” Remus said</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It's ok, take your time. We have the whole night” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'm gay Lily, i'm so fucking gay” Remus said, he knew she’d take it well. After all the times he had seen her hexing various homophobes who wandered around the school, also he was fairly sure she already knew.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And your crush is…?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It's not a crush” He said (totally </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>blushing)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sure honey” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It's Black, that damn boy is so hot I think i'm going to die” He sighed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can’t deny that” Lily smiled “and i'm going to go play matchmaker now, you finish whatever you are working on and i'm going to find out if black is as gay as he seems” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lily I hate you please don't do that” Remus pleaded</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“To late Rem, i need my ship to sail” Lily said halfway out of the tower</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What ship are you talking about?” Remus half screamed after her</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her answer consisted of the word “wolfstar”, which meant nothing to him. He liked Lily really much, but sometimes she didn't make much sense. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Remus kept working on his secret project (which was very much not to impress a certain Sirius Black, thank you very much). He tried to see if Glacius worked like he wanted it to do, which it did so he continues to his next problem: Is his magic enough to make the ice cover a area that large, or would he need to ask for help.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He wanted to do it alone but if he needed help he was sure Lily would gladly do it.</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Siriuuuuus” James whined “I don't know what i'm going to do with myself” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius sighed, “Just because your crush is seeing someone else, someone whos way hotter than you, doesn't mean it's the end of your life”.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No way that bloke is hotter than me, he’s scrawny and, uh whatever” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Exactly, you can't even say bad things about him!” Sirius said, smiling at the thought of the very hot ravenclaw boy</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'm going to ask her out” James said determined</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No! She has a boyfriend” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But what if they’re just friends? It can't hurt to ask i mean” James said trying to convince both himself and Sirius that Lily Evans still was single.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well don't come crying to me when she says no” Sirius sighed and rolled his eyes</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I love you Pads, you will always me my number one!” James said and blew a kiss at him before bolting up from the sofa and ran out of the common room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius would never understand what it was with James and being so obsessed with the ginger girl.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A few seconds later James came running back, soaked wet and eyebrows in a purple color. Sirius still sat on the bed with a questioning look. “I forgot we placed those spells around the school” James mumbled before hurrying into the bathroom.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Great job Jamie, really” Sirius said while clapping his hands as a sign of sarcasm.</span>
