    <span>My dear sister,</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I know I have quite the nerve contacting you after not trying to stand up for you when you were disowned from the family years ago. I admit that I was too afraid to and I apologize. As you know, I’ve followed through with my arranged marriage to Lucius and I have recently come to learn that I am pregnant. I had suspicions and performed the charm to confirm as well as to test for gender. It is a girl. As Lucius desires a son, I fear just how Lucius might react to a daughter, especially as the first born. As I wish that I could’ve had the strength that you had to ignore my arranged marriage, I still would like to give my little girl that same chance at happiness that I was too scared to fight for. It is because of this desire to give my little girl better that I plead to you to take my little girl and raise her as your own. Lucius would surely work on arranging a marriage for her as early as possible and I refuse to let her be forced to walk such a path. I understand that what I’m asking of you may be difficult for you to agree to between our current relationship standing and the possibility that you may have children of your own already. But you are the only one I would trust with her. I hope you and your husband will take her in. Let me know of your decision.</span>

  <span>Narcissa Malfoy sat in a dark room of the Malfoy Manor, her only light being that of a candle. She was opening a letter from her disowned sister, Andromeda Tonks. A letter that was a reply to a desperate request Narcissa had sent just days before.Narcissa’s hand shook as she untied the roll of parchment and started to read her sister’s reply.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Dearest Cissy,</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I apologize that I had to leave you behind. If I could have, I would’ve taken you with me. I miss you dearly and your letter was a welcome surprise even with the circumstances that caused you to write it. You are right in your assumption that Ted and I have a child, a daughter by the name of Nymphadora. Even with little Nymphadora, Ted and I discussed your plea and have decided to help and take your daughter in as our own. However, the problem is that you’ll need to completely hide signs of your pregnancy until then. Charms to adjust your clothing automatically and hide your growing stomach are easy enough. </span>

  <em>
    <span>The tougher part would be getting the medical care you need and giving birth without Lucius being informed. As much as I hate to say it, it would be bloody impossible for you to use the medi-witch or medi-wizard assigned to the Malfoy family. However, I will get in touch with my own medi-witch and see if I could get her to swear under oath not to reveal your pregnancy. I will contact you as soon as I’ve had a chance to talk to her. In the meantime, take care.</span>

    <span>Love, Andy</span>

  <span>Narcissa sighed in relief after reading Andromeda’s reply. She knew well that Andromeda had every right to have refused to help. The fact that Andromeda had not refused made the burden on Narcissa’s shoulders feel just that much lighter. She knew the road ahead was going to be difficult, as a lot would have to be done and maintained to hide the unborn child. But she knew in the end that it would be worth it.</span>
