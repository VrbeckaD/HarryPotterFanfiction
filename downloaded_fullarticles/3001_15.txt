<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The words played over and over in her head. Hearing Ron say those words meant nothing to her but to watch Harry agree with his words cut her deeply. Hermione and Ron had been dating since the end of the war - about nine years.  It never really bothered her that they had been together so long and he had never proposed as she had been working on her career at the time. Her and Draco Malfoy were rising fast in the ranks as Healers. The pair had started training together and became very good friends.  That fact had not gone over well with then-boyfriend Ron Weasley.</p>
<p>Hermione had gone to his flat one day during her lunch to see him. Using her key, she made her way into the kitchen only to find him having sex on the table with Cho Chang. The two were so into each other that they never heard her step into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Hermione said nothing, letting her purse and keys drop on the counter, startling the couple shagging on the table. Ron turned around, not even a look of surprise to see her standing there. He looked at her coldly, telling her to get out and that he was busy. Hermione had asked if she ever even meant anything to him, to which he replied no. He resumed fucking Cho, who looked annoyed by Hermione’s interruption.</p>
<p>Hermione had grabbed her things, leaving Ron and the flat. She had thought of going to Harry, but she couldn't see anyone at the time, not with every emotion she was feeling. She needed to be alone. After finding a nice hotel room in the Muggle world, Hermione had stayed there, spending the night crying into her pillow.</p>
<p>The next morning, after checking out of the hotel She deciding that she needed to see Harry and talk to him. When she arrived at Harry's, Ron had answered the door. Harry had called from the back telling him to let her in. When she stepped into the kitchen, Hermione knew something was wrong when Harry's eyes met hers. They were filled with betrayal and disgust.</p>
<p>"Can you explain why you are having an affair with Draco Malfoy behind Ron's back?"</p>
<p>Hermione's eyes narrowed. "Excuse me? Ron was shagging Cho Chang on his kitchen table yesterday when I went there for lunch."</p>
<p>"Just leave. You’re not wanted here, Hermione." Ron replied as Harry said nothing; his silence sounded his agreement.</p>
<p>"Fine." Hermione glared, meeting Harry’s eyes. “I was the one who stood by you through everything.”</p>
<p> Hermione left, Apparating to her parents’ old home. She walked up the walkway, unlocking the house. Walking inside, she sat down in her parent’s couch and let the tears roll down her face. How could this have happened. She didn't understand. Why would Harry believe she was having an affair?</p>
<p>Hearing her phone ring, she leaned down, grabbing her bag. Getting her phone, she looked at the name on the screen and laughed a little, answering it. Of course, she would be calling, she always knew when Hermione would need her, then again she could see the future.</p>
<p>"Hey, Alice,” she spoke answering her phone. She sniffled slightly.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" she asked cautiously.</p>
<p>"No. I am not okay," Hermione admitted, pulling her feet underneath her. "I just don't know what to do."</p>
<p>"Come here with us," Alice offered, not hesitating to ask Hermione.</p>
<p>It took Hermione only a second to decide what to do.</p>
<p>"Okay," she answered, wiping the tears off her face.</p>
<p>"Good. You will be living with us for a little while," Alice said excitedly before hanging up the phone.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>After her fifteen-hour flight to Seattle, she stepped off the plane, going in the airport to retrieve her luggage. Grabbing her bags, she began looking for any of the Cullens.  It was hard through the sea of people walking around. </p>
<p>"Looking for us?"</p>
<p>Hermione jumped hearing the heavy southern drawl from behind her. Whipping around, Hermione found Jasper and Alice behind her.</p>
<p>A huge smile spread across her face."Yes, I am so happy to see you both."</p>
<p>"Good, let's get you home." Alice smiled, wrapping her arms around Hermione's shoulders.</p>
<p>Hermione smiled, looking forward to her new beginning. Maybe she could find a little happiness here in this small town away from England.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione talked with Esme, Alice, and Rosalie in the kitchen while cooking and enjoying telling stories to one another. The rest of the family was out hunting while Bella and Renesmee were spending time with her father. This left the group of women alone in the house together.</p>
<p>"Hermione, we will have some guests over tonight as well," Esme informed her, sliding the food into the oven.</p>
<p>"That's wonderful." Hermione smiled mixing together the salad. "Who will be here?"</p>
<p>"Bella's father, and Jacob will be here as well." Esme smiled, she loved having people over at the house.</p>
<p>"Does Bella's father know about all of this?" Hermione asked.</p>
<p>"Charlie knows enough," Alice spoke reluctantly. "He knows there's more out there than just humans, but he doesn't press for more information."</p>
<p>"He doesn't want Bella to leave," Esme said simply. "He loves his daughter very much."</p>
<p>"He sounds like a very good man." Hermione smiled, walking to the refrigerator and placing the salad inside. Turning around, Hermione saw Alice's eyes looking at the counter, unfocused. "Alice are you ok?"</p>
<p>Rapidly blinking, Alice looked up, giving a smile to Hermione. "Yeah, fine. Everyone will be home soon."</p>
<p>Hermione gave a nod, looking skeptically at Alice who only smiled in return. Grabbing plates, Hermione went to set the table as the front door opened. Bella, Renesmee, and a man entered.  This had to be Bella's father. He stood dressed in a gray long sleeve button up, dark jeans, and a black jacket. He was a tall man with an average build, with dark brown slightly curly hair. He was a handsome man, Hermione blinked slightly replaying the words in her head. Has she really just thought Bella's father was handsome?</p>
<p>"Dad, I have told you this: the beard looks good, and it makes the mustache look better too." Bella chuckled, closing the door.</p>
<p>"Whatever you say, Bells." Charlie shrugged, taking off his jacket placing on a hook.</p>
<p>"Charlie, good to see you again." Carlisle appeared along with the rest of the family coming in the house. Hermione glanced up from the table, seeing Edward giving her an odd look as if he had heard her thoughts. Narrowing her eyes, she blocked him from her mind. She knew it worked when he frowned at her; which she returned with a smirk.</p>
<p>"Same, Carlisle." Charlie shook the doctor's hand before removing his jacket, placing it on the coatrack.</p>
<p>"How things at the station been?" Carlisle asked politely.</p>
<p>"Quite, thankfully." Charlie smiled as his eyes looked over, meeting Hermione's whiskey colored eyes.</p>
<p>"Charlie, this is mine and Jasper's friend from England, Hermione Granger. She will be staying with us for a while or until she finds her own place." Alice smiled from behind Hermione.</p>
<p>"Hello." Hermione smiled at the man before her.</p>
<p>"Charlie Swan." He introduced himself to Hermione, shaking her hand.</p>
<p>"It's a pleasure," she replied, letting her hand slide from his. His hand covered hers, she could help but to notice how large they were. "It's good to meet you. I have heard a lot about you."</p>
<p>Charlie chuckled slightly. "I hope it's good."</p>
<p>"Yes, all good I promise." Hermione turned, hearing the timer in the kitchen go off. "I need to help Esme."</p>
<p>Dinner had passed quickly as the only ones that ate were Hermione, Charlie, Renesmee, and Jacob. Everyone filtered outside, sitting around a fire. Hermione somehow ended up sitting next to Charlie. Hermione had the sinking feeling Alice was somehow behind this.</p>
<p>"I hope you don't mind," Charlie spoke, catching Hermione's attention.</p>
<p>"No, not at all." Hermione smiled over to him. "So what do you do?"</p>
<p>"I'm the Chief of Police," Charlie replied.</p>
<p>Hermione's eyebrows rose, "That's amazing."</p>
<p>"Yeah, the paperwork is wonderful," Charlie grumbled as a smile pulled at the corner of his lips.</p>
<p>Hermione laughed.</p>
<p>"So what brought you over to the states to a small town like this?" Charlie asked, taking a drink of his beer.</p>
<p>"Um, I guess just for a change of scene." Hermione frowned slightly as the real reason played through her head.</p>
<p>"Well if you need help with anything. Just ask I don't mind helping." Charlie offered, knowing she wasn't telling him the real reason. At least he could do was help the girl in some way.</p>
<p>"Thank you. I may start looking for somewhere to rent this week," Hermione informed him.</p>
<p>"Good, we could use some new faces in Forks."</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione sat looking over the list of properties for rent in the small town of Forks. She quickly crossed out two properties that were too far out of town, but that still left nearly fourteen properties as options. She sighed, throwing her pen down on the table. This was becoming a pain. Her thoughts began wandering to Charlie, maybe he could help her find something. Grabbing her bag and list of properties, she made her way over to the police station to see if he was at work.</p>
<p>Pulling up outside of the station, she only saw one cruiser sitting out front. Getting out of the car, she made her way to the station.</p>
<p>"Can I help you?" a rough voice asked.</p>
<p>Her eyes found the owner of the voice. Even with his back turned, Hermione could tell it was Charlie looking through a filing cabinet.</p>
<p> "I hope so, chief." Hermione smiled.</p>
<p>Charlie turned quickly looking at Hermione. "Hey, what are you doing over this way?" He asked.</p>
<p>"I am looking for a house and I figured you would be able to help me?" Hermione could have hit herself for how stupid she sounded.</p>
<p>"Well, I can tell you were not to go." Charlie noticed the papers in her hand. "I can look at those for you."</p>
<p>Hermione handed him the papers, "These are the one I have narrowed it down to."</p>
<p>Taking the papers, Charlie flipped through them marking out some that were either not in a good part of town or the homes were not worth renting. "This should help you some."</p>
<p>"That will certainly narrow the search. Thank you, Charlie." She smiled, taking the papers back as Charlie handed them to her. "I am sorry to bother you at work with this."</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it."Charlie sighed, looking around. "If you want I could take you over to the houses and let you look at them. We have to get the keys first."</p>
<p>"I don't want to be a trouble," Hermione stumbled over her words. "I know you're busy with work."</p>
<p>"Yep, we're slammed with work," Charlie said glancing around the empty station. "Come on, I'll take you."</p>
<p>Charlie grabbed his car keys off his desk, opening the front door to let Hermione out first. Sliding in the car, Charlie drove her over to the realtor’s office to get a realtor to meet them over at the two houses. Hermione quickly said no to the first one, seeing as how it was only one bedroom and one bath. She may be the only one living there, but she still wanted some room.</p>
<p>Driving up to the second one, Hermione fell in love with it just seeing the outside. It was a two-story log house, not overly large but still a nice size. The realtor unlocked the door, letting Hermione and Charlie in to see the interior. The kitchen and living room were open to one another with the master bedroom off of the kitchen. A stone fireplace rested in the corner of the living room. There were two guest rooms with a bathroom in the middle set upstairs.</p>
<p>"I love this house, but I want to sleep on it before I make a final decision," Hermione said, looking everything over again.</p>
<p>"Now, this house has been viewed quite a bit lately. I would put in an offer soon to either rent or buy."</p>
<p>"Come on, Jerry. Don't pull the realtor stuff," Charlie said gruffly. Charlie inwardly rolled his eyes, why would the man really want to try and lie with the him standing here. "She's new to town."</p>
<p>Jerry frowned, "Sorry Charlie. Just let me know what you decide to do."</p>
<p>"I'll let you know soon thank you." Hermione smiled.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Jerry," Charlie said shaking the man's hand before leading Hermione out of the door.</p>
<p>Charlie shut the car door, starting it and backing out of the driveway before he glanced at Hermione. "I hated him in school."</p>
<p>Hermione couldn't help but start laughing at his bluntness.</p>
<p>"What?" He asked glancing over at her.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. You were just so blunt and said that with a perfectly straight face. It was funny." Hermione covered her mouth, trying to stop laughing.</p>
<p>Charlie shook his head with smile tugging at his lips. "I'm a funny guy."</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Hermione smiled as Jerry placed the keys to the house in her hands. She had signed a two-year lease for the house. The owners to the home hadn't been able to sell it and they now lived across the country. Jerry had called and asked if rent would be okay, they agreed that some money was better than no money for the house.</p>
<p>"Thank you so much for the help." Hermione thanked him with a smile. She would certainly be letting Alice decorate her house.</p>
<p>"Not a problem. If you need anything just give me a call."</p>
<p>Hermione left the office, getting back into Carlisle's car that he had loaned her to use. Her phone rang as she started the car.</p>
<p>"Hey, Alice," Hermione answered already knowing what she was calling for.</p>
<p>"So I am already thinking colors for that house, and I have it all picked out you so don't have to worry about a thing," Alice informed her with rapid fire.</p>
<p>Hermione laughed, "Good. I give you free reign I trust your judgment."</p>
<p>"Bad move," Hermione heard Emmett yell through the phone.</p>
<p>"Hush, Emmett," Alice hissed. "So what are you going to do now?"</p>
<p>"Now? I think I have to thank someone for helping me find this house. I am wondering how I should do that." Hermione mused to herself, trying to figure out how to thank Charlie for his help.</p>
<p>"You could take him lunch," Alice suggested.</p>
<p>"<em>Sex is always a good option!" </em>Emmett yelled.</p>
<p>"Emmett!" Hermione and Alice yelled simultaneously. Emmett's laughter faded from the phone as Hermione sighed. "He's a pain."</p>
<p>"I know." Alice agreed with a small chuckle in her voice. "Lunch sounds like a great idea. Just go to the carver cafe and get him a steak with fries and a salad."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Alice." Hermione ended the call, driving over to the cafe.</p>
<p>Entering the cafe, Hermione found all eyes on her. Her eyes widened slightly, trying to figure out why. She could only guess since she was the new person in town, it had people talking. She quickly walked over to the counter hoping people would go back to what they were doing.</p>
<p>"Hey, I am Cora. Can I help you?" Hermione looked up seeing the waitress in front of her.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am wanting to place an order to go," Hermione informed her. Cora pulled out her pad waiting to ready to write down the order. "I need a steak with fries and a salad."</p>
<p>"How would you like it cooked?"</p>
<p>"That's a good question." Hermione frowned, wondering what Charlie would like.</p>
<p>“Is it for the chief?" Cora asked with a knowing smile. Hermione looked up in surprise before nodding her answer. "Well done it is. It's been the talk of the town," Cora informed her. </p>
<p>"Well, I guess I know why people were talking when I came in," Hermione whispered.</p>
<p>"People saw the two of you together last week," Cora replied.</p>
<p>"He was helping me find a house. It helped to have someone who knew the area," Hermione explained. "I figured the least I could at least buy him lunch for him helping me."</p>
<p>"That's very sweet," Cora said pointedly glancing around as some people became focus intently on their meals. "Is there anything else you want with this order?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, a soup and salad with two cokes."</p>
<p>"Broccoli and cheese soup okay?" Cora asked, writing down the rest of the order.</p>
<p>"Sounds great." Hermione smiled. "Thank you, Cora."</p>
<p>"You're welcome. What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Hermione," Hermione answered.</p>
<p>"Pleasure to meet you. I will have your order ready soon." Cora walked away, going to prepare the order.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later Cora came back with her order bagged and ready to go. Hermione paid for the meal and drinks before making her way over to the station. Pulling up, she noticed the parking the station looked busy. She hoped she wouldn't be bothering Charlie. Grabbing the food, Hermione exited the car and made her way into the station.</p>
<p>"Can I help you?" A young deputy asked, looking Hermione over.</p>
<p>"Yeah, is Chief Swan in?"  Hermione asked politely.</p>
<p>"Yeah but I am sorry he is busy," he said in a rather bored tone.</p>
<p>Hermione frowned at the man or possibly boy behind the desk. "I-"</p>
<p>"Newton, make sure-" Charlie spoke coming out of his office. His words froze, noticing Hermione standing in the front. "Hermione, what are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"I brought you lunch as a way to thank you," Hermione spoke holding up the bag.</p>
<p>"What for?" Charlie asked, dropping files on Newton's desk.</p>
<p>Hermione smiled brightly, "I got the house."</p>
<p>"That's great," he said happily, taking the bags from her hands. Charlie missed some of the stares the other deputies were giving to one another.  "Follow me. We can eat in my office. Mike, handle the phones."</p>
<p>"Yes, Sir," Mike stammered.</p>
<p>Charlie closed the door to his office placing the food down on his desk. "Thank you for lunch."</p>
<p>"Thank you for helping me," Hermione said, opening the bag, pulling out Charlie's food and placing it on his side of the desk as he sat down. Hermione grabbed her food and drink, sitting down across from him.</p>
<p>"So when you do get to move into the house?" Charlie asked.</p>
<p>"Next week," she answered. "I am letting Alice decorate the house."</p>
<p>Charlie chuckled, "She is a sweet girl. I am sure even if you didn't want her to do it, she would find a way."</p>
<p>"That is the reason I am letting it happen." Hermione looked over at Charlie. "You all seem pretty busy today."</p>
<p>"Yeah, there has been some break-ins happening across Forks and someone's truck was stolen," Charlie said continuing to eat. "How did you know what I liked to eat?"</p>
<p>"Alice suggested food from Carvers cafe. Cora filled in the blanks," Hermione admitted with a blush creeping up on her cheeks.</p>
<p>Charlie nodded with a smiled. "You didn't have to do anything for me."</p>
<p>"I know, but I still wanted to do something nice," Hermione admitted. "The only people I have here are the Cullens. So it's nice having new people."</p>
<p>"I'm new people?" Charlie asked as his brow went to his hairline. "I don't know if I am that interesting."</p>
<p>"I guess it would depend on what the person is interested in," Hermione stated as her whiskey brown eyes met Charlie's chocolate brown eyes.</p>
<p>A smirk played one Charlie's lips, "I guess you're right."</p>
<p>Hermione jumped slightly as her cell phone rang. Grabbing it she answered the phone quickly. "Hello."</p>
<p>"Hey, Hermione, I am at your house and realized I can't get in," Alice spoke through the phone.</p>
<p>"I am on my way, Alice." Hermione laughed, hanging up the phone. "I guess that would be my cue to go home." Hermione stood to throw away her empty containers.</p>
<p>"I'll walk you out," Charlie offered, opening the office door stepping back into the front office. Charlie saw the deputies jump back to their desks as conversations stopped. Walking through the office, he noticed the subtle stares that were given. Opening the front door, Charlie walked her down to the car. Frowning he noticed she still had Dr. Cullens car. "You still have Carlisle's car?" Charlie asked.</p>
<p>"I don't have one right now, and Carlisle and Esme have been kind enough to loan me theirs." </p>
<p>Charlie nodded, opening the car door for her. "Thank you again for lunch."</p>
<p>"Anytime." Hermione smiled, sliding into the car. Charlie shut the door, walking back into the station, hearing Mike Newton running his mouth.</p>
<p>"She was fine," Newton said, not seeing Charlie standing behind him. "What I wouldn't give to-"</p>
<p>"Watch it, Newton," Charlie growled causing Mike to jump. Charlie turned a glare on the deputies in the station as he spoke, "Get back to work. Now."</p>
<p>Charlie walked back in his office closing the door, he took a seat at his desk looking out the window. He hadn't been able to keep Hermione off of his mind for the past few days. After lunch, hearing the Newton boy talk about her like that made his blood boil. Charlie frowned slightly. He hadn’t feelings like these in a long time.</p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> Hermione stood in her living room watching Alice run all over the room decorating everything. Alice has painted the entire house in one day. She placed pictures on her shelves of her family and Draco Malfoy with his wife Astoria. Her brow furrowed hearing Alice's choice of music to play for the evening; Witchcraft by Frank Sinatra. </p>
<p>"I figured you would just love the song," Alice said slyly, handing Hermione a glass of wine.</p>
<p>"Oh yes," Hermione said taking the glass. "The irony isn't lost on me."</p>
<p>"Cause there's no nicer witch than you!" Alice sang walking up the stairs to place Hermione's boxes in her room.</p>
<p>"Some would disagree there," Hermione  whispered.</p>
<p>"Stop that."</p>
<p>"You stop that." Hermione jumped turning around to find Jasper standing behind her. "I swear I am going to place bells on all of you."</p>
<p>Jasper chuckled before turning serious, "Don't live your life in the past, Hermione. It's been nearly two months since you have been here. I feel so many emotions roll off of you. You shouldn't feel like this."</p>
<p>"I am okay when I am with people. It's worse when I am alone." Hermione sighed, leaning against her couch. "I don't think my heart was fully in the relationship I was in near the end of it. I think what hurts the most is how easily they all turned their backs on me. The only ones from England that have even checked on me are my former enemy turned the only friend I have."</p>
<p>"Betrayal is the hardest thing to forgive," Jasper said knowingly.</p>
<p>"I am sorry for the emotional overload, Jasper." Hermione frowned looking over to him.</p>
<p>"It's ok." Jasper smiled. "Alice upstairs?"</p>
<p>"She is. She has finished nearly every room." Hermione laughed. "It's like watching a kid in a candy store."</p>
<p>A knock sounded on Hermione's front door stopping their conversation. Hermione frowned looking at the door. "You expecting someone?" Jasper asked noticing Hermione's face.</p>
<p>"No," Hermione said, shaking her head.</p>
<p>"Jazz, could you please come upstairs," Alice called before Jasper could open the front door.</p>
<p>"Go, I got it." Hermione smiled, watching Jasper disappear up the stairs. Hermione walked over to the door, turning on the porch light. Peeking out of her window, she found Charlie standing on her porch.</p>
<p>Hermione quickly opens the door, "Charlie, hi, come inside."</p>
<p>"I don't want to interrupt. I know you have guests over," Charlie said with his hands in his pockets.</p>
<p>"It's only Jasper and Alice please come in. It's cold outside." Hermione shivered, feeling a cold gust of wind hit her legs. Charlie quickly stepped into the house, letting Hermione close the door behind him.</p>
<p>"Wow, this place looks great. You have done a lot," Charlie said looking around the house.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I asked the realtor if I could paint and the owners approved it." Hermione smiled. "Were you needing something, Charlie? I figured you would already be home by now." Hermione noted Charlie was still dressed in uniform.</p>
<p>"I was working late and I drove by and saw your lights still on," Charlie told her. "I wanted to ask you something."</p>
<p>"Okay," She said sitting on the armrest of her couch looking up at him.</p>
<p>"I wanted to see what you were doing tomorrow?" Charlie asked.</p>
<p>"With my busy social life?" Hermione asked sarcastically but her tone playful. "Absolutely nothing."</p>
<p>"Would you feel like spending the day with me?"</p>
<p>"What do you have in mind, Chief?"</p>
<p>"Something to do in the afternoon then dinner in Port Angeles?" Charlie asked, rubbing his hands together nervously.</p>
<p>"It sounds like a date." Hermione smiled.</p>
<p>"I'll pick you up around one tomorrow. it will take little over an hour to get there."</p>
<p>"I can't wait," Hermione said, following Charlie over to the door.</p>
<p>Charlie opened the door, turning back around to look down at Hermione. "I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight, Hermione."</p>
<p>"Goodnight, Charlie," Hermione whispered, leaning against the door watching him walk out to his car. Jasper was right, it was time for her to let go of the past and focus on the future. As she watched Charlie pull away, she couldn’t help but feel that her future was certainly looking bright.</p>
