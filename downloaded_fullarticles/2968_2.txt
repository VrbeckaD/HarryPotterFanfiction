          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry knew it was a mistake to have the punch at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes annual Christmas party. </p>
<p>Oh, it was wickedly good but after as much as he'd had, his head was spinning and he was seeing double.</p>
<p>"Hey, baby. Wanna come home with me tonight?"</p>
<p>Harry turned towards Ron's voice and blinked rapidly trying to clear his blurry vision.</p>
<p>"Bloody hell!" Harry yanked Ron toward him.</p>
<p>"Whaddya do that for?" Ron slurred, his face tomato-red. </p>
<p>"You were flirting with George's shrunken head jumper!"</p>
<p>"Damn." Ron sighed heavily. "The witch with the pink hair was a bit of all right."</p></div>
