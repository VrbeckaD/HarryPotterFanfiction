    <p>Moony and Padfoot. </p>
<p>Padfoot and Moony.</p>
<p>The two were inseparable during their Hogwarts years and still afterwards until Peter betrayed them and Sirius went to Azkaban and Remus did what he could to survive.</p>
<p>Sirius was still in love but Remus didn't accept it. He couldn't because he had false hope. He couldn't because he still felt guilty for blaming Sirius. He couldn't be in a room alone with him without feeling like a small child who punched his little sibling.</p>
<p>After a while, Tonks came and fought for his attention as well. He had to admit. She was beautiful in her own self. She was funny and spoke for what she believed in. She was the odd man out and loved playing pranks on other people. Maybe it was because of all her similarities to Sirius that he dated her.</p>
<p>Remus ended marrying Tonks with a smile that was slightly forced on his face. He could feel the hard state of Sirius. He could feel the swear accumulating on the back of his neck. He didn't want a confrontation. He couldn't handle that. He couldn't without questioning his romantic interest in Tonks and he didn't want to do that.</p>
<p> "Do you love her?"</p>
<p> "I know I love you."</p>
<p> " Why are you with her and not me? "</p>
<p> "Because I couldn't have you without the guilt, so I took the next best thing. "</p>
<p>A kid. A kid who looked too much like Tonks and not enough like Sirius. A kid who loved Uncle Sirius and should have loved Sirius like his dad. Sirius held the child with such love. He cared for the child like it was his own because he was supposed to be. The child was never supposed to be Tonks'. She wasn't even supposed to be in the picture.</p>
<p> "He loves you."</p>
<p> " I know Tonks. "</p>
<p> "He doesn't want to have you."</p>
<p> " I know Tonks. "</p>
<p> "He wishes his child looked more like you."</p>
<p> " I know Tonks. "</p>
<p>A battle. A battle he knew he was going to die in. Remus made a promise to himself to watch over his child in the afterlife. He knew that once he saw Sirius there too, he still wouldn't be able to go for it. He still didn't want to take that chance. He still didn't want to fuck up everything even more. So he died and was buried next to his lovely wife. He did see Sirius but never talked to him for the rest of eternity. He loved Tonks, yes.</p>
<p>But his heart always belonged to Sirius Black.</p>
