    <p>The first time Newt wakes up is only to see Percival Graves leaning towards him with a concerned frown on his face. Then Newt blinks and realizes that it’s not just concern, he looks terrified.</p>
<p>“Are you okay? Please, Newt, you have to say something… anything… please.”</p>
<p>But he can’t talk, his head suddenly hurts like it’s being cracked open; Newt groans in pain and Graves flinches like he’s experiencing the same pain as he is.</p>
<p>Which doesn’t make any sense, because according with Tina’s letter Mr. Graves, the real one, was taking his job again as Director of Magical Security in New York and Newt was in London at the moment.</p>
<p>Another wave of pain makes him forget about it, but he has an strange feeling right before he closes his eyes and thinks that it’s the first time he has seen the real Graves.</p>
<p>The second time Newt wakes up things get even more complicated; he’s in a hospital, at first he thinks it’s St Mungo, but as soon as the healers come inside Newt realizes they’re not from England.</p>
<p>Both of them explain him he has suffered an accident in Central Park; he was trying to calm an hippogriff down, but something went wrong and Newt ended up in the lake, until Percival Graves saved him.</p>
<p>Newt asks about the creature and when they tell him they believe the auror that brought him in took care of it, Newt pales and freaks out until the witch assures him that the hippogriff is inside his case.</p>
<p>The magizoologist starts to get confused; if Percival Graves took the hippogriff alone, the other creatures would get scared because they didn’t recognize the auror.</p>
<p>“I need to see my creatures,” he tries to get up, but the pain in the head and the spell one of the healers uses to petrify him is enough to keep him in place.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Scamander, you cannot leave until you’re completely recovered.”</p>
<p>Newt tries to move, but it’s useless. He looks for his wand, but it’s nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>“How did I end up in New York?” He frowns, which only prompts the two healers to look at each other in a funny way.</p>
<p>“What year is it, Mr. Scamander?”</p>
<p>Newt answers, irritated and argues with them that he needs to see his creatures, but another spell makes him close his eyes almost immediately.</p>
<p>The third time Newt wakes up it’s a nightmare. Or at least he wishes it was.</p>
<p>The two healers that come to see him explain to him as clear as possible the injury on his head caused him retrograde amnesia.</p>
<p>“You don’t remember the last two years,” the witch with long brown hair says when Newt seems as lost by his words as he was before they started to explain. “There’s a potion for that, but we need at least a month for it to be ready.”</p>
<p>Newt nods, but he’s really not fully aware of what he’s doing; he knows he shouldn’t feel that uneasy or worried, since they have told him there’s a cure, but Newt can’t help but think about all the trips and experiences he probably in that time. He would’ve been more alarmed if he didn’t know he keeps everything in his notebook… So regarding his research he’s safe, but he’s not sure about the other aspects of his life, of course it’s not like he has social life, not too much at least.</p>
<p>Besides, he only has to endure a month without two years of memories.</p>
<p>What could’ve had happened in two years?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Mr. Scamander!” Newt blinks a few times before opening his eyes. The witch that said his name is younger than the other two healers that came to see him. “There’s someone here who wants to see you.”</p>
<p>She smirks at him as soon as she says it, like it’s part of a very juicy secret.</p>
<p>“Theseus Scamander?” He mutters, hopeful. If anyone knows what happened to him in two years that’d be his brother. He needs to ask him so many things…</p>
<p>But the witch shakes her head at the name.</p>
<p>“No, your brother… Mr. Scamander said he’d be here in a couple of hours,” she bites her lip and shiver like she just remembered something terrifying. “They’ve told me, Mr. Scamander fire-called the hospital to know if you’re alright.”</p>
<p>Newt rolls his eyes praying to Merlin his brother didn’t threat the entire hospital.</p>
<p>“Actually I was talking about your fiancé,” she continues, lips quirking up.</p>
<p>He’s thinking about Theseus and how he’s going to deal with his overprotective nature now that Newt’s injured and he has a very good reason to act like a mother hen. However, the last word she says it’s enough to make Newt stare at her and freeze.</p>
<p>“What?” He squeaks, still trying to think if the word he heard is right.</p>
<p>“Your fiancé,” she repeats. “He has been waiting to see you for hours, he really cares about you… I haven’t seen someone so desperate to-”</p>
<p>“Stop! I just…” Newt mumbles, feeling the headache coming. “I don’t have-”</p>
<p>He shakes his head, biting the rest of his words; he has lost two years… In that time he could’ve of course, but… It doesn’t feel right… He’s not the type to get in a serious relationship, especially because of his kind of work and because he has never been someone with suitors…</p>
<p>After seeing him so hesitant, the witch starts to worry and with a movement of her wand aimed at the end of the bed she checks the notes left by her colleagues. By the way her brows quirk up, Newt if she knew anything about his condition.</p>
<p>“Who is he?” He can’t stop himself from asking and the witch looks at the door, like she can feel the other’s presence.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t… This is my first week working here and I-”</p>
<p>“Does he know?” Newt cuts her off.</p>
<p>“He hasn’t talked with your assigned healers,” she informs, biting her lip.</p>
<p>“Who is he?” Newt repeats, knowing it’s ridiculous to try to remember, that he won’t find information about him in his shattered memory, but he tries anyways.</p>
<p>“The auror who saved you, I think his name is… Percival Graves, he works at MACUSA,” she says and Newt can’t help but to blink at her in confusion.</p>
<p>He doesn’t even know Mr. Graves… Well, apparently he met him during those two years and they… got engaged. It’s so weird for Newt to think about that because he has no memory of it.</p>
<p>He was the one that found him, that’s something he can remember; he sees Percival Graves leaning, expression concerned… alarmed while he tries to reach Newt, calling h by his first name almost desperately.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to tell him to go back later?” There must be something more than bewilderment on Newt’s face for her to ask him that.</p>
<p>“No… It’s fine,” Newt assures, feeling suddenly flustered. “I… Please tell him to come in.”</p>
<p>Percival Graves… his fiancé deserves to know.</p>
<p>“I can explain to him if you want-”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell him,” he mumbles.</p>
<p>She nods and exits the room, leaving him alone. Newt regrets his decision almost immediately… He doesn’t know how he’s going to talk to someone he hasn’t met yet about a relationship he doesn’t remember.</p>
<p>He can’t imagine how Theseus’ friend ended up falling for somebody like him.</p>
<p>Shaking his head, Newt takes a deep breath and thinks about Graves… he tries to imagine how difficult it’d be for someone to find out that the person you care about doesn’t remember you at all.</p>
<p>It’s heartbreaking.</p>
<p>When Percival Graves comes inside, not only Newt forgets what he was going to say… he also feels speechless.</p>
<p>The auror doesn’t wait too much and he walks towards Newt almost desperately, eyes roaming all over him with worry.</p>
<p>“How do you feel, Newt?” He puts his hand on Newt’s cheek and the magizoologist almost flinches out of instinct, but the moment he feels Graves’ fingers on his skin, he relaxes immediately.</p>
<p>He feels safe around him.</p>
<p>“I’ve been worse,” he smiles and gets surprised when the Director’s lips quirk up.</p>
<p>“Please don’t do that to me ever again,” Graves pleads and Newt has the feeling that man doesn’t do that very often. “I was so worried.”</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Newt reaches out to feel Graves’ face with his fingers and when the man closes his eyes and leans into the touch, Newt gasps, fascinated.</p>
<p>Graves seems to trust him completely.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Newt blushes and he wonders if he does that often when the auror is around.</p>
<p>“Mr- Percival… you need to know something…” He begins after a sigh.</p>
<p>He hesitates, but he knows the more he waits the harder it’d be to tell him. So he starts by explaining to him what the healers told him.</p>
<p>“Two years,” Graves repeats, taking a step back and to Newt’s surprise, he misses immediately the warmth of the auror’s body next to him. “That’s the time you’ve been working for MACUSA… That means you don’t remember… me.”</p>
<p>Newt sees the hurt on Graves’ face, the sad realization on his features and his heart aches.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry…” He mumbles, not knowing what else to say.</p>
<p>“It’s not your fault,” Graves tries to smile, but Newt can see how difficult it’s for him.</p>
<p>The auror reaches out again, but stops before touching Newt’s forehead, the magizoologist smiles and takes the auror’s hand in his.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” he assures. Then, he adds: “I didn’t know we were engaged…”</p>
<p>For a couple of seconds Graves blinks at him in confusion, but his expression vanishes so quickly that Newt thinks he probably imagined it.</p>
<p>Then, the Director of Magical Security blushes and looks down at their hands.</p>
<p>“The new healers told me.”</p>
<p>“Listen, Newt… about that… I actually-”</p>
<p>But he gets interrupted when Newt’s healers walk in the room, the taller one… the man with black hair asks him to get out the room to let Newt rest.</p>
<p>Graves assures he’s going to be back and tells him his creatures are fed and perfectly okay inside the case.</p>
<p>Newt smiles at him and feels immediately more relaxed at his words. Because, despite of not remembering anything about him, he believes him. He knows his creatures are safe with him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Someone is yelling outside and to his horror, Newt realizes it’s his brother having a heated discussion with Graves and two other people. He’s not sure, but he thinks the voices belong to the healers that have been taking care of him.</p>
<p>“You’re an idiot, Percival!” Theseus snarls. “What were you thinking?”</p>
<p>“I cannot let you inside in this condition, Mr. Scamander,” one of the witches explains and Theseus’ response is a terrifying growl.</p>
<p>Newt rolls his eyes, wondering if his brother is going to get himself kicked out of the hospital, but after a couple of seconds in which he hears Percival apologizing, the door opens and his brother rushes to his side.</p>
<p>He can’t tell how angry his brother was, because the anger vanishes from his face the moment his eyes meet Newt’s.</p>
<p>“Hello, little one.”</p>
<p>Newt smiles, chuckling amused as he says: “Please don’t kill anyone, ‘Seus.”</p>
<p>“You heard me?” Theseus looks at him, almost alarmed and Newt wonders what was the argument about.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t understand much. I just know that you were growling like an angry wampus,” Newt jokes. “What was that about, by the way?”</p>
<p>Theseus sighs, looks down and then ruffles his hair.</p>
<p>“Nothing important.” He assures. “I… They told me what happened. They also said they’re gonna let you go in a day or two… So you’ll be coming back to England with me, at least until the potion is ready.”</p>
<p>“But I work for MACUSA now,” Newt says, frowning. “Besides, I’d like to stay with Percival. It’s not fair to him-”</p>
<p>“Not fair to him?” Theseus repeats through gritted teeth, by the way his eye is twitching, Newt knows there’s an explosion coming. “Listen, Newt, he’s absolutely no worthy of your concern-”</p>
<p>“He’s your friend,” Newt points out, amused. He’d be worried if he didn’t know Theseus better. He never likes anyone that shows interest in him. That makes him wonder how he reacted when he found out they were in a relationship.</p>
<p>“He was,” Theseus corrects him and Newt rolls his eyes.</p>
<p>“He’s my fiancé,” he tries again, feeling the word weird in his mouth.</p>
<p>Theseus grimaces when he hears it and then he takes Newt hands and looks at him, hesitant.</p>
<p>“There’s something you should know, Newt…” He starts but then interrupts himself, looking back at the door and then at Newt.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. It’s nothing.” He assures in a defeated sigh.</p>
<p>Newt knows his brother’s lying, he is aware that he’s hiding something, but he decides he’s not going to pressure him… at least not today.</p>
<p>Besides, he has so many things to think about like his creatures and how much he wants to see them again and, of course… Percival Graves. He’s still not sure what he’s going to do about that.</p>
