    <p><em>Parseltongue</em><br/>Normal Speech<br/><strong>Telepathic speech</strong></p><hr/><p> </p><p>Hot</p><p>That’s what Harry felt as sweat dripped down the side of his face as he carried the heavy camping bags out of the car. His aunt, uncle, and cousin were sitting in the shade as he did all the work. “Hurry up boy! Set those tents up then go find some firewood you useless freak!”</p><p>Harry winced as his aunt Petunia slapped him over the head. “Yes, aunt Petunia, sorry aunt Petunia.”</p><p>It took the young boy another hour before he was finished setting the camp up, he fell back against a tree panting his body sore from the bruises all over. Harry flinched when a tree branch hit him on the head causing a small cut on his cheek.</p><p>Dudely laughed loudly smacking him again in the stomach. Harry glared at the older boy. “Ow stop it!”</p><p>The overweight boy took a step back and fell over a rock, he started hollering loudly at the small scrape on his hand. Vernon and Petunia raced over and Petunia brought the boy into her arms. Vernon snarled looking at Harry. “WHAT HAPPENED!”</p><p>Harry’s Avada green eyes widened in fear and he shook his head trembling slightly. “I I do-don’t know I he t-tripped I swear!”</p><p>Dudely looked at him grinning viciously. “Liar! The freak did something freaky again! He made me fall!”</p><p>The brunette opened his mouth to argue but Vernon raised his fat fist before punching Harry on the cheek causing the boy to fall to the ground in pain.</p><p>Tears started filling Harry’s pretty green eyes as blood dripping from his mouth. Vernon kicked him in the ribs glaring. “You freak! How dare you use your freakishness on my boy! I’ll be sure to beat the freak out of you!”</p><p>Harry curled up covering his head with his hands as he cried silently through the beating. Vernon stopped panting after a few minutes. “Go get the firewood boy, and you better not take too long!”</p><p>Harry sobbed nodding and quickly scurried off into the woods, he sniffled looking over his bruises as he walked. “Stupid Dudely, why is it always me? Why won’t they ever believe me? Why do they have to hurt me!”</p><p>The wind picked up around Harry as he cried, the small boy hunched his shoulders as he sobbed into the silent forest. He didn’t know why his relatives hated him so much, he’d never done anything to them so why did they hate him? It wasn’t fair!</p><p>Harry started to collect firewood and turned to make his way back to camp. Everything was silent before a loud blood curdling scream echoed throughout the wooded area.</p><p>Harry’s eyes widened in fear as he knew the sound of that voice, it was his aunt Petunia. Harry dropped the wood and took off back towards the camp.</p><p>Bursting through the tree’s Harry froze in shock and fear. There was blood everywhere, a few limbs lying around and Dudely was on his ass staring up at the giant beast in front of him.</p><p>Dudely turned to look at Harry and reached out for him. “Help!” He didn’t get far before the beast’s giant mouth bit him in half. Harry felt nauseas at the sight of his cousin’s upper half staring at him lifelessly.</p><p>The beast turned its attention away from the bloody mess of Harry’s relatives and looked into his eyes. The reptilian eyes stared into Harry’s green eyes.</p><p>Harry closed his eyes tensing up and lowering his head as the beast came towards him, shaking out its giant wings and licking over its razor-sharp teeth. It stopped right in front of the boy and leaned down.</p><p>Harry expected the monster to not hesitate, to eat him in one bite. The beast sniffed him before letting out a purring sound. <em>“Young hatchling do not worry I won’t hurt you.”</em></p><p>Harry opened his greens eyes looking up into the beasts suddenly kinder reptilian eyes. Harry slowly untensed and looked to the beast curiously. <em>“W-What are you?”</em></p><p>The beast gave an amused snort before curling around the brunette bringing the small boy up to its chest and wrapping its wings around them. <em>“I am a dragon, hatchling, no enough questions, it’s time for you to sleep we will be moving and finding a better nest tomorrow I will care for you from now on hatchling.”</em></p><p>Harry smiled and hesitantly snuggled closer to the warmth the dragon gave off. He knew he should feel scared and sad about his relatives but he couldn’t bring himself to care, this dragon was kinder to him than his own family has ever been.</p><p>The small brunette felt the exhaustion lulling him to sleep and he closed his eyes hoping when he woke the dragon would still be there and that this wasn’t some kind of dream.</p><p>-(Break)-</p><p>The next morning Harry was jostled awake by the mother dragon. Harry yawned rubbing his eyes tiredly. The dragon leaned down and started running its tongue over the boys hair.</p><p>Harry squirmed trying to get away but the dragon huffed. <em>“Stop squirming hatchling, I am trying to clean you.”</em></p><p>Harry pouted but sat still as the mother dragon cleaned him. After five minutes Harry was cleaning and slightly wet from the spit. Harry looked up at the dragon and took the time to really admire it. The dragon was lean with a white body and the horns and spikes along it’s back were black. The dragon had icy blue eyes that turned a darker blue when angered.</p><p>The mother looked over when she felt the boy’s eyes on her. <em>“What is it hatchling? Why are you staring at me?”</em></p><p>Harry blushed looking down and fiddled with his fingers before glancing back up. <em>“Why are you being so kind to me? Shouldn’t you have ate me like my relatives?”</em></p><p>The dragon snorted leaning its head down closer to Harry. <em>“You are nothing like those vile meat sacks hatchling, you have the blood of dragons running through you, when you come of age you will inherit your bloodline, you are special my little hatchling and I will treat you as my own.”</em></p><p>Harry felt tears in his eyes and he threw his arms around the dragon’s head, the dragon wrapped it’s wing around the boy amused by the little humans antics. <em>“We must move hatchling, before the meat sacks with sticks come and try to separate us.”</em></p><p>Harry nodded and the dragon pulled the boy into her claws hands holding him like something delicate. She spread her wings out and shot off up into the air. Harry grinned loving the feeling of the wind through his hair.</p><p>The boy looked up at the dragon again. <em>“What’s your name?”</em></p><p>The dragon looked down at him and seemed to almost smile. <em>“My names is Cyndryt, the bright, but you my hatchling can call me mother for that is what I am to you now, you are my hatchling and I am your mother.”</em></p><p>Harry was silent for a while before a small smile crept onto his face and he snuggled closer to the white dragon. <em>“Thank you….Mother.”</em></p>
