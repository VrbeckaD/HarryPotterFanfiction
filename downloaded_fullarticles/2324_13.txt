  <em>Harry's POV </em>
</p><p dir="ltr">I groaned as I slipped off my bed spread, landing on the floor in a pile of sheets with a thud. It took only a moment before I gained full conciousness. I grasp at the thin rimmed glasses on my bedside table, placing them on my face and taking nottice of how dark the room was.</p><p dir="ltr">I shakily stood up, draping my sheet over my bed as I checked he time on my bedside clock.<br/>
"Three thirty, great." I mumble, virtually silently as I began grabbing the towel from a box under my bed.</p><p dir="ltr">The first night here and I've already woken up at an ungodly hour and decided to shower. I grabbed my folded invisibility cloak and was off out the door towards my common room.</p><p dir="ltr">There was the odd insomniac who had fallen asleep on one of the sofas besides the fire with a book in their lap. I dropped a blanket we keep in here over the top of them, not wanting them sleeping in the cold, it's not the best way to sleep.</p><p dir="ltr">I smile as I leave, knowing the small things will never be notticed, they'll probably think it was a house elf, but I know what actually happened. And that doesn't bother me.</p><p dir="ltr">I hide under the cloak as I hear the Fat Lady's snors fall away behind me. Within five minutes of almost running, I slid into the shower room, taking a deep breath of fresh air as I removed the cloak.</p><p dir="ltr">I dart into the nearest stall, locking the door. I stripped down as I turned on the shower, the water was almost always cold in he showers, but it never bothered me. I took my time letting the heavy water droplets flow over my shoulders and relax my muscles.</p><p dir="ltr">Quickly washing my hair and body, I flop against the cool tiles of the stall wall. I turn off the water stream, beginning to towel myself down and change back into my shirt and shorts, placing my glasses on my nose. I unlock the stall only to be met with the ghostly pale figure of Mertle.</p><p dir="ltr">"Hey, Harry..." She drawled out her words, in her usually giggly voice.<br/>
"Hi, Mertle." He gave a curt wave and leant against the door.</p><p dir="ltr">"You won't guess what I saw through the drain pipes. Don't worry, it wasn't yours, this time." She cackled as I rolled my eyes, you can't really press charges for sexual assult on a ghost.<br/>
"What was it?" I mumble, not really caring at this point, it was Mertle, she informed me on everything, even the boring stuff.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was just wandering around the Slytherin boys' bathing room earlier and you won't believe what I heard. It was a boy crying." She was circling me as she spoke, passing through walls as through they were air.<br/>
"Who?" Eventhough he was Slytherin, I cared, it's just a human emotion to care for someone in need.</p><p dir="ltr">"For that you'll have to give me something in return." She was giggling uncontrolably, I was genuinly scared of what she was goung to ask me to do.<br/>
"What is it?" I rubbed my stinging eyes, they were straining in the darkness anyway, it didn't help that the person I was speaking to was virtually transparent.</p><p dir="ltr">"You'll have to give me a kiss." She smiled simply, I was almost reliefed it wasn't anything worse.<br/>
"Mertle, I would, but I can't." I was lying, I wouldn't even if I could.<br/>
"Why not?" She droned, leaning against my shoulder, her touch as light as a feather.</p><p dir="ltr">"I physically can't, Mertle, you're a ghost, I'm human, it's impossible." I put to her in my sweetest voice. I felt her moved, crossing her arms and beginning to storm off.<br/>
"Fine, you won't know then! You probably would have liked to know but I see how it is." She disappeared as she spoke, leaving me in the darkness.</p><p dir="ltr">I sigh, picking up my things and leave, wrapping myself in the cloak as I did so. I brish my teeth and quickly leave before ai could get caught.</p><p dir="ltr">The trip back seemed much shorter as I scurried through the corridors. In no time at all, I was tryig to wake the Fat Lady as quietly as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">"Psst! Please wake up!" I tried in vein to wake her with whisper yells. When nothing happened I raised a brow and simply said the password loud enough for it to register with her in her sleep,</p><p dir="ltr">"<em>Chocolate frogs.</em>" As the picture frame swung open, I slipped through, hurrying through the common room, removing my cloak as I did so.</p><p dir="ltr">I tread up the steps, cringing at the loud creak the door made as I opened it. I shut it behind me and replaced all my things, sliding under my now cold sheets.</p><p dir="ltr">I lay in the darkness, staring up at the four poster roof above me. The silence in the room was deafening, the only time I heard the slightest sound was one of the other boys snore. The night outside was still, not even a breeze to bring a leaf fluttering by my window.</p><p dir="ltr">I stay in the same position for hours, watching as the light outside blossomed from the black night to the warm oranges and pinks over he Forbiddon Forest. It was around six a.m. that I decided to actually get up, the birds seemed to be joining me in that gesture.</p><p dir="ltr">I dressed fully in my robes, sitting on the edge of my bed, waiting for Ron to get up. It was quater to seven when he finally rolled out of bed to get ready.</p><p dir="ltr">"Mornin', Ron." I chuckle at how pissed off he looked.<br/>
"Why are you awake already? Why am I awake now?" He managed out gruffly as he attempted to put his sheets back on his bed after he untangled them from his ankles.</p><p dir="ltr">"Because if you don't hurry up, I'll leave for the Great Hall without you and you'll miss breakfast." As I spoke, Ron began getting ready. He was done within ten seconds, and to be quite honest, I'm not suprised, threaten Ron with missing breakfast and he'll do anything.</p><p dir="ltr">"What was that about breakfast?" He turned to me, shobbily dressed, but still dressed.<br/>
"C'mon, don't forget you're satchel." I chuckled, grabbing my own.</p><p dir="ltr">It alsmost seemed weird how we'd gotten back into our same rutine as before, as though nothing had happened. Not that it really bothers me, I love the simple things in life. I'd love life to just be simple.</p><p dir="ltr">I made my way down the stairs, falling into step besides Ron. We hurried to the hall, I could feel my stomach growling to be fed, and I doubt there's ever been a time I haven't heard Rons' groaning before any meal.</p><p dir="ltr">I slowed as we entered the hall, taking a moment to admire how nothing seemed to have changed. Just how I had, and always will, love it.</p>
