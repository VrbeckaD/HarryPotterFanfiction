    <p>Hermione Granger Weasley was not above admitting that she was afraid of certain things. Heights, monsters under her bed, and scary movies were fears of hers that had developed early in her life on the outskirts of London with her parents. But as she became deeper involved in her new life in the wizarding world, Hermione found more and more things to be afraid of. <br/>After first year, it was a fear of failure, something that had been looming in the back of her mind for years but had come around full bloom when she realized she would need to work twice as hard to get half the recognition of her peers from magical families. Second year brought a fear of snakes and losing her friends, the thought of not being there to help them creeping into her mind as she awoke from her petrification to find that both Harry and Ron had almost been killed trying to track down answers in the Chamber of Secrets.<br/>And so it went, as each school year passed, Hermione would collect more and more things to be afraid of. Things she kept bottled up in order to protect herself and to put on a brave front to be able to help her friends. <br/>However much she hid from her friends, she wasn’t above admitting to them today how truly terrified she was as she rushed into the waiting room of St. Mungo’s Hospital, Harry and Ginny hot on her heels. <br/>The portly old nurse at the nurses station was not impressed with the sight before her. All three young adults were absolutely soaking wet from the rain falling all over England at the moment. Hermione’s hair was plastered to her face, Harry was still is his Auror robes, and Ginny was heavily pregnant. <br/>“The psych ward is two levels down,” the nurse said barely looking up from her clipboard. <br/>“Listen you daft horrid look-,” Ginny was cut off by a shout from down the hallways. All four people turned their heads towards the voice coming from a bedraggled looking ginger man. <br/>“Hermione thank the gods you’re-“<br/>“George Fabian Weasley you better have a damn good explanation as to why your brother is in the hospital,” Hermione voice slowly rose in octave, her face turning an unnatural shade of red. <br/>“Quiet please,” the nurse shushed them from her spot at the station but the crowd ignored her. <br/>“It was an accident I’m sure he’ll be fine Herms,” George rubbed the back of his neck. “He’ll be back to normal in no time! Come on then, he’s not awake but you can wait with me.”<br/>“Sorry but only family are allowed back,” the nurse seemed to gain a sense of joy from denying the small crowd entry.<br/>“Listen here you barmy old witch,” Hermione’s eyes lit up with anger. “I’ll be following my brother in law to go and see my HUSBAND whether you like it or not. And if you want to deny entry to The Boy Who Lived and the captain of the Hollyhead Harpies, well then I hope you have fun dealing with Rita Skeeter.”<br/>Hermione smirked at the baffled look on the witch’s face and followed George down the corridor towards Fred’s room. <br/>“Healer Swell, this is Hermione, Fred’s wife. Mione, Healer Swell. She’s been assigned to Fred’s case.”<br/>Hermione shook the hand of the older woman who’s grey hairs were sneaking out of the right bun she wore. <br/>“I was just telling George here that Fred should make a full recover. He cracked two ribs but that’s about it. Your husband is very lucky,” Healer Swell smiled at Hermione sweetly. “Although it may take a bit of time for his eyebrows to grow back. But that’s punishment enough isn’t it?”<br/>Hermione let out a small laugh as she sat in the chair beside Fred’s bed, grabbing his hand and running her fingertips over the gold band on his left hand. <br/>“How long until he wakes,” Hermione posed the question to Healer Swell but kept her eyes on her husband. Hermione has instantly feared the worst when Ginny has rushed over from the shop to bring Hermione from work to St. Mungo’s. After nearly losing Fred in the war, she wasn’t taking any chances with his well being. <br/>“Pretty soon here, the sleeping potion should wear off in the next half hour,” Healer Swell checked her watch and turned towards George. “Just call for me when he wakes and I’ll check him over.”<br/>The slim woman exited the room, bumping into Harry and Ginny on her way out. Ginny smiled politely and then lowered herself into a chair when she finally made it into the room. <br/>“Good Godric this child won’t rest until they kick every organ in my body will they?!,” Ginny threw her head back in exasperation. “I can’t believe I’ve got a whole month left of this.”<br/>“Or longer,” George pointed out, earning him a swift kick to the shin. “Ow!! I was just pointing out the obvious!!”<br/>Ginny rolled her eyes and turned to Hermione. Since leaving school and saving the world, the two girls had become as close as sisters. Hermione had shared a room with Ginny at The Burrow for over a year before moving into the flat above the shop with Fred and George. <br/>“How’s my git of a brother doing? Didn’t kill anybody or burn down the shop did he?”<br/>“I don’t know, George, did you kill anyone today,” Hermione turned to George who defensively raised his hands at the stormy eyed look from the younger witch. <br/>“Mione you know I didn’t do any of this on purpose. I would clearly make the explosion much bigger if I was trying to off Freddie.”<br/>Hermione and Ginny both slapped George’s arms, causing a loud yelp from the ginger man. <br/>“Honestly George, this is a serious matt-“<br/>“Mione,” Harry interrupted her tirade. “Hermione, he’s waking up.”<br/>All four heads in the room turned swiftly towards Fred, who’s eyes shot open as he glanced around the room. <br/>“Forge! You absolute tosser, never scare me like that again!” George lunged across Hermione to hug his twin. “Hermione and Ginny almost killed me! Can you believe it?”<br/>“I’m going to go grab Healer Swell,” Harry said quickly as he walked out the door. <br/>The room had an air of tension to it as the group looked at Fred. <br/>“What in Merlin’s name happened?” Fred asked as he sat up a little straighter. “My head’s pounding and I feel like I can’t breathe properly.”<br/>“You blew up a batch of Dreamless Sleep in the shop. You’re lucky it wasn’t anything worse or Mione would’ve killed both of you,” Ginny grumbled from her seat. “How’re you feeling?”<br/>Fred’s eyes were wide as he stared at his sister, looking as if she had appeared out of thin air wearing a top hat and singing an opera. <br/>“Blimey Gin, you’re pregnant!”, Fred exclaimed, causing all three people to stare at him incredulously. <br/>“Yeah I have been for the past eight months, thanks for noticing Fredric,” Ginny rolled her eyes at her brother, clearly thinking he was pulling a joke on her. <br/>“Granger what are you doing here,” Fred turned to the woman by his bedside, making her and George’s faces contort further into confusion. <br/>“What are you talking about love? Ginny got me as soon as it happened,” Hermione stared at her husband in shock. “And why are you calling me Granger? You haven’t called me that in ages!”<br/>Hermione felt her heart drop to her stomach as Harry walked back in with Healer Swell. <br/>“Mister Weasley how are you feeling,” Healer Swell began waving her wand over Fred’s body as she asked him questions. “Any pain or tenderness around your body?”<br/>“Just my head and ribs,” Fred answered. “And the pain in my heart from finding out that my only sister is pregnant and never told me. Potter did you do  this?!” <br/>Harry stared at Fred for a moment before turning to Ginny who now looked more concerned for her brother. <br/>“Well seeing as Ginny is my wife, I would sure hop-“<br/>“You lot got married too? How much have you been hiding from me?”<br/>Healer Swell stared curiously at Fred, along with the rest of the room, before asking him a final question. <br/>“Fred, what's the date?”<br/>“April 14, 1999! George and I just celebrated our 21st birthday!”<br/>The room seemed to freeze at Fred’s sudden declaration. Healer Swell continued to ask questions to the redhead, but Hermione could barely hear them. <br/>“Hermione, are you alright? You look a bit pale,” Harry asked nervously as he eyed his best friend. <br/>“I- I think I’m going to be sick,” Hermione quickly stood up and rushed out of the room, Ginny following her as quickly as her rounded figure would let her. <br/>“What’s Granger got her knickers in a twist for,” Fred turned to his twin and then to Harry, looking between them and waiting for someone to give him an answer. <br/>“Fred I swear, if you’re pulling some horrible prank on us now is the time to speak up,” George’s face was rigid as stone as he stared at his brother. “I’m serious, do you really think it’s still 1999?”<br/>“Of course I do! Why wouldn’t I? That is the year isn’t it?”<br/>Healer Swell sighed and looked down at Fred with a look of pity. <br/>“Fred, I’m afraid you’re experiencing some amnesia from an explosion in your shop today,” Healer Swells face contorted almost painfully as she spoke. “It’s actually May 20, 2000.”<br/>Fred turned from the Healer and looked at his twin, confusion flooding his face. George has sunk into the chair Hermione had been in and had his hands over his face, loud groans coming from behind them. <br/>“Oh bollocks this is bad, this is so fucking bad. She’s gonna kill me, mum’s gonna kill me. And Hermione will hex my bits off… oh good gods.”<br/>“George, did I hear correctly that Fred was brewing a Dreamless Sleep potion when the explosion happened,” Healer Swell asked. George popped his head up, his hair pointing in various directions. <br/>“Yeah, he does a batch of it every Saturday, though he’s never managed to blow up a cauldron of it.”<br/>“I think that the potion is what has affected Fred’s memory. You see, Dreamless Sleep is only two ingredients different from a standard Memory Altering potion,” Healer Swell sighed again. “I think Fred could have possibly mixed up his potions ingredients and caused an explosion, the new potion affecting his brain when it combusted. I’ve seen a few rare cases before.”<br/>“Well is it going to fix itself? Will I get my memory back,” Fred’s stomach clenched tightly as he looked at the older Healer. <br/>“It’s unclear now. Some people have had their memories return within weeks, some never do,” Healer Swell looked at Fred, her eyes sympathetic as she looked at the redhead. “We’ll have to wait and see what the case is for you, but we don’t have much to go off of.”<br/>“Right okay,” Fred let a breath out that he hadn’t realized he was holding in. “Georgie, catch me up. What’d I miss?”<br/>“Actually, I'd like to speak with George for a moment. In the hallway perhaps,” Healer Swell turned towards Harry who was standing behind her looking absolutely befuddled. “You too Mr. Potter, and we can see if we can find the girls out there. We’ll be right back Fred.”<br/>Healer Swell ushered the two young men out into the hallways where Ginny and Hermione occupied two chairs halfway down from Fred’s room. Hermione, who had her head in her hands as Ginny rubbed her back, sat bolt upright at the sight of the trio. <br/>“George please tell me that daft idiot is playing a terrible joke,” Hermione’s voice had a slight sadness to it as she looked at her brother in law. <br/>“Sorry Mione, turns out Freddie somehow messed up his potion and blew his memory to bits.”<br/>“George! Honestly,” Ginny wrapped an arm around Hermione’s shoulder as the older witch started to cry. “Read the room you idiot!”<br/>“Let’s all regroup for just a moment,” Healer Swell’s calming voice floated around the group of young adults and they all instantly looked at her. “I know Fred’s diagnosis is a bit of an obstacle, but it’s nothing you lot can’t sort out I’m sure.<br/>“Now with the happenings and changes of the last year, there’s clearly a lot that Fred has missed out on. Don’t overload the poor bloke with an information dump. You’ve got to ease him into it, start out small and move onto the bigger stuff later,” Healer Swell paused and looked towards Hermione. “Okay maybe not all of the big stuff. It would probably be a good idea to tell Fred he’s got a wife now or else you two will go home and he’ll be right confused.”<br/>Hermione forced a small smile towards the Healer as she continued to explain what they could do to help Fred in this transition period. As much as she tried to retain the information being given, her mind was elsewhere. Fred and Hermione had been married for barely six months now, they were just getting the hang of things and now… well now this. If the universe was trying to tell Hermione anything, it was that nothing would ever go her way. <br/>“Now I suggest only two of you go in right now, perhaps George and Hermione,” Healer Swell turned to the duo, Hermione still in her chair and George standing next to her. “You two can maybe explain a bit about what’s going on. After that, you’re free to go. Fred doesn’t seem to have any life threatening injuries so he’s alright to go home for now. Just bring him back in a week.”<br/>George placed his hand on Hermione’s arm, slowly leading her back down the hallway towards Fred’s room. She tried to clear her head, keep her thoughts clear and focused on Fred’s wellbeing. But she found that she couldn’t do it. A few feet from the doorway of the hospital room, Hermione stopped in her tracks. <br/>“George, what if he hates me,” Hermione's eyes shimmered with tears as she looked up at her brother. “What if he resents me for getting married?”<br/>“Well love, ministry says there’s no way round that one so even if he did hate you there’s not much he could do about it,” George gave the brunette witch a small smile. “Besides, Fred’s known you for ages. Reckon he’ll react the same as he did a year ago. You’ll be fine, I swear it on my twin.”<br/>Hermione rolled her eyes, but accepted the hug that George offered her. The duo finally made their way into the room to find Fred staring at his left hand. <br/>“Oi! Did I run off and get married too?”<br/>“Well, the Ministry passed a Marriage Law on the first anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts. They paired us all up and married us off,” George scoffed as he took up the seat on Fred’s right side, Hermione going to his left. “Mum nearly blew a gasket, but she was more than happy to plan a few weddings.”<br/>“Well,” Fred looked up at George, his eyes flitting to Hermione for a moment before going back to his twin. “Where’s the lucky bird that gets to call herself Mrs. Fred Weasley? She here to come and whisk me home now?”<br/>“She is,” Hermione said quietly. Fred’s head whipped around towards the curly haired witch as she held up her left hand, showcasing a golden ring with rubies and diamonds encrusted into the band. “Mrs. Weasley at your service.”<br/>Fred’s face contorted in confusion as he stared at Hermione, then he began to laugh. His eyes started to water as he looked between George and Hermione. <br/>“I’ve seen lots of good pranks in my lifetime, but this one takes the cake,” Fred grinned wildly. “How’d you get Granger in on this one?” <br/>Hermione dipped her head down, covering her eyes with her hands as George had done earlier. George glared at Fred for a moment before sighing loudly. <br/>“Okay let’s clear the air for a moment,” George groaned. “No ones playing any pranks. Fred’s really got amnesia, Hermione is really chained to this tosser forever, and Potter really did knock up poor Ginny.”<br/>Hermione let out a wry giggle as she surveyed the twins. Her laughter bubbles up, spilling out of her uncontrollably as tears of joy leaked down her face. <br/>“Jesus Mione, don’t take it too harshly,” George chastised the brunette. <br/>“H-he’s got no eyebrows,” Hermione barely got the words out between her laughter, George quickly joining her as Fred leaped from the bed in search of a mirror, his pale ass on display for any unlucky soul that might pass him. <br/>“Merlin’s saggy balls George, my beautiful face,” Fred’s cries from the hallway could be heard inside the hospital room as George and Hermione dissolved into a fit of giggles. “My poor beautiful eyebrows. Oi! Healer nurse ma’am? Have you got something to fix this?”</p>
