    <p>Percival Graves felt weak. He had been kept as a prisoner by Grindelwald for some time now. The last few days were just a blur to him, from the dark room to the stuffy air, to the constant humiliation, everything was the same day after day. Grindelwald had tried to win him over at first, explaining why he did what he did, realizing quickly that Graves couldn't be convinced. That had been the turning point, Grindelwald changed his methods, he started to hit him, to touch him.<br/>
He wanted to break Graves, but Graves was stronger than this, because he knew that in the end, no matter how bad Grindelwald treated him, he needed Graves alive. They'd find him, sooner or later. Probably later, from what it seemed like. </p><p>While Graves took pride in staying loyal, not giving away any information about the MACUSA to Grindelwald, it really didn't take long for his impersonator to get whatever he wanted. He must have known beforehand that a dark force was at work in New York, but his investigation was a lot easier, now that he had access to inside information. Grindelwald knew that they had narrowed down the origin of the occurrences, knew that the church was probably the breeding ground of the Obscurus. And just like Graves himself, Grindelwald was fast to find whom he thought was the weakest link: Credence. He was using the innocent boy, hoping he would provide him with the information he needed.</p><p>Why did Tina have to snap back then? Why did she have to attack the mother?<br/>
Graves couldn't really blame her, of course, just thinking about how Mary Lou treated Credence made him sick. That's why he had decided to leave the observation of the church in Tina's hands, because he would've snapped as well. And once he was at it, hurting the mother might not have been enough. Was he disappointed by Tina? A bit, admittedly. However, he was perfectly able to relate to her set of actions. But if Tina were still on the case, then maybe Grindelwald wouldn't have that strong of a hold on Credence. </p><p>Credence. When they first took a closer look at the church and its following, this boy stood out the most to Graves. His appearance, trying his hardest not to be seen, looking so small despite his tallness, always a sorrowful look on his face.<br/>
The longing eyes, whenever he wasn't degraded by words or actions of the person he was confronted with. Longing for an acceptance he had never experienced in his life, but he knew was out there. Graves wanted to help him, save him, show him that there were people who cared. He got too attached too quickly, he didn't really understand where these feelings came from. </p><p>It got so far that he even took Credence out to a diner at one point. Both didn't know what to do, what to say, how to act. Credence was way too shy to start any conversation at all, while at the same time being overwhelmed by the thought that someone really cared enough to notice him, notice how he suffered. He just stared at Graves the whole time, who was trying to process why and how they had ended up in that situation. </p><p>Credence had been looking so miserable out there, shivering in the cold, being ignored by passers-by for about half an hour. Finally, Graves couldn't stand that sight anymore, he stepped in front of the young man and asked him if he could treat him for something to eat and drink. Graves now believed that Credence must have noticed him near the church before, because he didn't hesitate long before following him.</p><p>Although Credence was obviously very thankful for the warm meal, he was very careful at the same time. He only spoke when he was asked and his answers were short. But what Graves understood was that Credence didn't want to leave the diner, he didn't want to go back into the cold streets, trying to hand out pamphlets. The last bites of his meal went down very slow, just to push his harsh reality further away, if only for a few minutes.<br/>
It was when they left the diner that Credence spoke without being spoken to first, his eyes focused on the ground. He wanted to know how he could reciprocate. That's when Graves developed the idea of turning the young man into a spy for the MACUSA. What a selfish idea that had been. </p><p>They met a couple more times, Graves gave him the instructions, healed his bruises, convinced him that he needed his help. Around that time Graves noticed that he felt more than just sympathy or maybe pity for Credence. His affection was of pure nature, at least most of the time.<br/>
Other times, often at night, his thoughts circled around the young man and Graves was surprised by how lewd and powerful some of these images were. He had to admit to himself that he didn't care about Credence all fatherly, that he wanted to feel the boy's longing eyes on his naked body, his figure stretched out to his full height on the bed. </p><p>That's why he had decided to leave the observation in Tina's hands. Should have considered that Tina might mess it up, but, despite everything: he really couldn't blame her.<br/>
The problem was that Graves didn't have a chance to make sure the observation of the Second Salemers – and therefore Credence – was taken care of by someone else than Tina before Grindelwald got him. And as soon as Grindelwald realized that the church took an important role in finding whatever was causing the trouble in New York, he assigned himself to the task of keeping an eye on the worshipers. </p><p>It took Grindelwald as much as a day to find out that Credence could be used as a source of further information. He also discovered that there was a special bond between his prisoner and Credence, who probably just went straight up to Grindelwald when he noticed the wizard near his church again. And Grindelwald had every intention to take advantage of this information.</p><p>When Grindelwald  returned he asked Graves worrying questions, like: why would the young man  be so attached to Percival, why had he taken him out to a diner and: “Percival, do I see sweat on your forehead?“ This was definitely what Grindelwald had been waiting for, a sign of nervousness from Graves. </p><p>He grinned, before he continued with his speech: “Don't worry, I won't hurt him. Well, only as much as he wants me to. As he wants 'you' to. He is so desperately craving for attention, doesn't matter in what way, could be a kind look, could be words, could be a daring touch... He doesn't realize how challenging it is to resist him, does he? So innocent despite what he is going through every day.<br/>
I know you saw it, too, Percival. The hunger in his eyes whenever he thinks that you – that 'we' – are not noticing it. I was wondering why you'd let someone else take care of the church when you clearly had a good lock on the situation. Especially since you get along with Credence so well. You should have seen him today, how his face lit up when he noticed me. How willing he was to give in to my embrace. You were afraid of where this might lead to, weren't you? That you might not be strong enough to resist him, for he is quite beautiful, isn't he? So pure. Well...” </p><p>Grindelwald's mouth was right next to Graves's ear as he continued: “...you're lucky, because I think I will be generous enough to show you where your relationship with Credence could have come to.“ The laugh that followed made Graves shudder. He didn't want to know what those words were supposed to mean. All he knew was that he feared for Credence's well being.</p>
