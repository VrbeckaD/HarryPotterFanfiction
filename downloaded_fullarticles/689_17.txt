    <p>POV Hermione Granger</p><p>There are worse things, I suppose, than a holiday devoted to love. I can't think of any now, but I'm sure they exist. People get crazy about that date, looking for someone who can fill the emptiness they say there is in their hearts. For me, most people are hungry, but they prefer to think they are missing a love to fill them. Speaking like that, it even seems like I'm a spinster, but I'm just a 24-year-old girl who is not very interested in romance.</p><p>To be honest, I think even my cupid hates me because it's not possible. The last guys I dated or dated were complete idiots. Needless to say, it did not work out very well with any of them, right? I just do not say I think love does not exist because I see it in my parents, and in the eyes of my best friends - whom I helped to stay together. But honestly, I think I was born to be alone with my cat.</p><p>"Just my luck, to get stuck with an assignment on Valentine's." I said looking at my desk with a huge pile of papers, staring at what would probably make me stuck in the office for the rest of the week.</p><p>"Oh, quit whining. It's not like you're seeing anyone." my best friend and practically my brother, Harry, said from his table, staring at me with those piercing green eyes, very similar to his mother's (which, together with my best friend, tries to find a boyfriend for me, since I remember me).</p><p>"Er... so, about that." I started a bit hesitantly, not bothering to look in his direction.</p><p>"What? Are you seeing someone and not telling me? I thought we were best friends!" Harry said indignantly, as if it were really possible for me to go out with someone and not tell him.</p><p>"That's not it! I'm not seeing anyone, it's just ... you know how Ginny is at this time of year, and I just wanted to spend a quiet Friday at home." I said throwing myself in my chair and trying to force myself to start working with those papers. That's what they say, if you think hard, maybe you focus enough to make it all go away. It wasn't working.</p><p>"Believe me, I know how she looks, but I'm afraid you will not be able to do anything to stop her from going to the party. Believe me, even I tried to run away. She's out of control." he said beginning to furiously type in the computer to be able to avoid my look, probably.</p><p>"HARRY! It's from my best friend you're talking about! Besides, she's your girlfriend." amazing how Harry can be romantic in a minute, and a completely oblivious person the next minute. "And how come I can't run away?"</p><p>"Because she's my girlfriend, I can tell her that. Has not she told you yet?" Harry's looking at me with a funny face and I do not know why.</p><p>"Told me what?" Lord, what did Ginevra Weasley did now?</p><p>"The Weasleys are coming to party. And when I say everyone, I mean everyone indeed." Harry is looking at me with a strange face, which probably should be reflecting mine.</p><p>"All of them?" I do not know if I'm ready to meet my entire best friend's family. At least, not after everything she told me about them.</p><p>"Exactly. So the party will not be there in my apartment anymore, but in my parents' house." He's giving me an invitation with everything that's going to be at the party. I'm starting to get even more afraid of Ginny.</p><p>"She's gone crazy!" as if it were not enough for Harry's redhead mother to almost drive me crazy here in the company, my best friend, also redheaded (I'm catching a pattern here, Sirs Potter), are trying to drive me crazy!</p><p>"Yes, but avoid saying that to her." Harry has come back to advance his work, or what I think is work.</p><p>"Did you tell her that?" Sometimes I think my best friend is not worth living, seriously.</p><p>"I was distracted, okay?" He's turning red and I do not want to wonder why. "Anyway, the party starts at 7:00 p.m., but she told you to go home at 3:00 p.m., so you guys get together."</p><p>"I know how to clean it myself" I mumbled to myself, hoping he would not hear me.</p><p>"According to Ginny, you do not know." Of course he was going to listen, what was I thinking?</p><p>"How did you manage to keep your girlfriend all this time?" because he is definitely not the master of praise, at least not like his father.</p><p>"She loves me." Harry shrugged and laughed. That could only be the reason they were still together.</p><p>"Someone had to love you, did not you, son?" James Potter, owner of the company, also known as Harry's father - and my godfather - came into our room, and did not waste time to make funny of Harry, as he always does.</p><p>"Ha ha, how funny are you, father?! Did you sleep with Bozo?" Harry asked for a laugh as I tried to hide mine without any success, of course.</p><p>"No, I slept with the woman of my life." He said with such a passionate look that made me look away. It's by scenes like these that I know that love exists, just do not know if it exists for me.</p><p>"Oh, father, you disgust! Do not make me have mental images!" Harry said, thrusting his fingers into his ears and starting to sing "la-la-la." Really, very mature of you Harry.</p><p>"Is that the way you talk to your father? Have more respect with him!" I said slapping Harry's head to see if I put some sense into his head.</p><p>"Thank you Mione, I do not know what would become of me if it were not for you, the best goddaughter in the world." James said giving a kiss to my forehead, which made me smile.</p><p>"Of course, do not worry about me. I am only your only child, blood of your blood. Nothing important, do you know?" I already said that my best friend is the most dramatic person in the world? No? I'm telling you now then.</p><p>"That's when you say that, I'm sure we've chosen the best person to be your godfather. You two have a tendency to drama." James said sitting on the edge of my desk.</p><p>"Now that you've said that, really, the two are almost a drama queen when they want, right?" I said laughing, which caused a crisis of laughter in the James and a Harry more and more sulky.</p><p>"What's going on here? No one else works at this company, right?" A redhead came in through the door, making us startle.</p><p>"MOTHER! Glad you arrived! These two were bullying me." Harry said pointing at me and his father. Snitch.</p><p>"What a calumny! It was not anything that happened here love, he's lying." James said with the most innocent face I've ever seen, but Lily is vaccinated against that face.</p><p>"Mione, my dear, can you tell me what really happened?" My godmother and one of the best people in the world, Lilian Evans Potter, asked me as she stared at me with those green eyes that kept me from lying, ever since I understood myself.</p><p>"We were not bullying him, just saying that just like his godfather, Harry can be a drama queen at times." I said with a shrug.</p><p>"I do not think we should have let Sirius spend so much time when he was a kid, James, I do not know if it was a very good thing." I love Lily, really. Harry's face is priceless as well.</p><p>"MOTHER! You should be defending me, not standing on their side." He said, his face sulky as we laughed.</p><p>"Harry dear, I can't deny the truth, can I?" She said, hugging her son. "Now how about we all get back to work? What do you tell me?"</p><p>"If the mistress orders, we obey, do not we?" James said, standing up and walking toward the door. "Do not work too many children!"</p><p>"JAMES!" Lily shouted again as she walked to the door behind her husband, which made us all laugh. "I hope they're moving on, to be free on Friday night."</p><p>"Hermione here does not seem to be very interested in the party, you know." Harry said as I glared at him. My best friend is so dead, he has no idea.</p><p>"WHAT? Mione, how come you're not excited about the party? Was it something of the decor? Or was it the food? I knew I should have called Jean to ask what would be interesting to serve." The redhead broke off, without even stopping to breathe.</p><p>"Thank you for that, Harry." I said to my best friend.</p><p>"Whenever you need." He said with a shrug, grinning. I'm going to kill this kid and no one will know it was me.</p><p>"Lily, it has nothing to do with the food or the decor, and I know that my mother probably helped you and Ginny in some things, so I know that everything will be perfect." I said in a quiet voice, trying to hide what I was really feeling.</p><p>"So what's the problem, dear? Are you worried because there's no one to go with you? Because we can change that quickly, you know, right?" She said coming to hug me. Wait, what's she saying?</p><p>"What? No, it has nothing to do with me having nobody to go with me at the party." I said, preparing myself for what I was going to say next. "It's more the idea of the party itself."</p><p>"Are not you excited about the party?" Lily's face is so hurt that it makes me feel bad about this conversation.</p><p>"Er... I think Dad needs my help. So I'll leave you two alone and I'm just going, it's..." Harry said, getting up and leaving as quickly as possible from our living room, which made Lily and I laugh.</p><p>"So now that the boys are out, you want to tell me what's really bothering you?" Lily asked as she sat down at Harry's desk.</p><p>"Is that the date you know? Why do people get so mad about Valentine's Day? I can not understand the fixation, because Ginny NEEDS this party to be perfect." I undressed, taking everything that was stuck in my chest.</p><p>"I understand ..." Lily said with a knowing face.</p><p>"You understan?" I asked with a frightened face and who isn't understanding anything, which I hate!</p><p>"Of course I do, Mione. I've also had those same questions that you're having now, and I hated it when Valentine's Day was coming. I was clogged with chocolate on that date." She said, smiling, lost in memory.</p><p>"And what made you change your mind? Because now you're like, the Queen of Valentine, the ambassador of love." I said, really curious, because I can't believe that this redhead of my side already hated the day of the boyfriends.</p><p>"Ambassador of love? Really?" She is laughing now, looking at my goofy face.</p><p>"Yeah ... you've been trying to get me a boyfriend since I was 14. And you get over it on Valentine's Day, I thought the title would go well." I said shrugging, and feeling my cheeks become the color of her hair.</p><p>"Ah, my dear!" She came to my side to hug me. "Do you mind that much when I give you a cupid?"</p><p>"I think it bothered me more when I was a teenager. Nowadays, I do not think I care much anymore. It's not like it really works." I said to her, unable to believe my own voice.</p><p>"What do you mean it will not work? What do you mean by that?" Lily is looking at me with a strange face, as if I were from another planet.</p><p>"Lily, as much as I appreciate your help, I kind of gave up on this idea of finding someone ideal for me." I replied, looking at the papers on my desk so I would not have to meet her gaze.</p><p>"How can you say that, my dear? Of course there is someone ideal for you, you just have not met yet." She said raising my chin and making me look at her.</p><p>"You say so with certainty, as if just because you're saying, fate decides to come true." Lily scares me sometimes with her predictions.</p><p>"Of course fate will listen to me and you two will soon meet. Believe in the ambassador of love." she said doing a super hero pose, which made me laugh. Lily is the best person to cheer me on, and the best godmother of all.</p><p>"Ok, I believe in you. Let's see, who knows I do not know my soul mate on Valentine's Day?" Is there anything more cliché than that?</p><p>"Do not be so scornful Mione, trust me. Now, I think we have a few things to settle before we can go to lunch, do not you think?" and with that simple phrase, she returned to be my boss.</p><p>I think I'll have to follow Lily's advice and wait, who knows, fate can bring me my soul mate just as the kid at the corner restaurant brings my lunch. Dreaming costs nothing, does not it? I just want to know, is there really anyone made for me? And if so, what would he be doing right now?</p>
