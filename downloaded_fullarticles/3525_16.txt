Even if they didn't want to fall asleep during their classes, James, Sirius, and Pete were trying and failing to do so. Some of their teachers gave them dirty looks.</p><p>"Wake up, Pettigrew," someone said snidely.</p><p>"Wow, Black." Severus Snape scoffed and rolled his eyes. "Never thought you could really be this arrogant for some reason... Falling asleep during class of all things. Selfish."</p><p>"I'm sorry, Potter." Lily Evans shrugged. "That's just lazy."</p><p>The three of them took it. They didn't talk back or make any excuses. Just glanced at each other, made eye contact with a little nod, and kept going about their day.</p><p>Last night had been full moon. They'd spent the whole time caring for a werewolf.</p><p>And they'd deal with the consequences bravely and quietly.</p></div>
