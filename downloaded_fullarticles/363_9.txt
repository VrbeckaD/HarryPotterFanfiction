    <p>
  <span>The sun was setting on the last day of August, as two brothers stood on a verdant field. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The day had been as bright and warm as any could hope for, a last breath of life before the arrival of autumn. They traveled out here every year on this day. To celebrate the older brother’s birthday and commemorate the last day before school began again. Enjoying a picnic with all their favorite meals served. But evening was coming to an end and the two boys watched as the pale-gold orb clung to the horizon. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you really have to go, Jacob?” The youngest of the brothers, a boy of ten, spun around to the other with pleading eyes. The older sibling slowly turned to face him, shaking his head.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lucas, you ask this every year. You know I have to,” Jacob stopped to observe his younger brother looking only more miserable hearing the answer. The older sibling gave a smile in response. Stopping only when Lucas did not return it. He leaned slightly down. Resting his hands on his brother’s shoulders “It’s just one more year. Then you’ll be on your way to Hogwarts with me.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lucas averted Jacob’s gaze. Starring into the ground as a small foot kicked into the dirt “And then there will only be a year before you’re gone again.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t worry about it. After one year at Hogwarts you’ll have friends all of your own.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lucas looked up to his brother again “You think so?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m certain of it,” Jacob gave a nod. His voice confident. The lines of Lucas’ face brightened.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I hope so,” Lucas’ tone was wistful for a short moment. The young boy’s smile faded away as his eyes turned downcast for a second time “I hate my current school.” He murmured.   </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I know,” Jacob’s words and expression were nothing but somber now. Silence stood between them for a moment. Only a distant cry from their mother, Kelly Blackburn, signaling them to come back to the rest of the family drew the older brother’s attention.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Dessert is ready. Let’s go back and have some,” Jacob’s words were edged with feigned enthusiasm. Seeing his brother’s mood lighten up, however, made his own genuine. Both brothers now turned and walked towards a small table where their parents and grandparents awaited. They had only gone a few steps before Jacob motioned Lucas to stop “Wait - There is something I need to say while we’re still alone.” Both brothers turned to face each other once more. Lucas stood completely still. Attentive of his brother’s words. His eyes the only thing to betray any movement. Jacob continued. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I wanted to say this at Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, but I doubt there’ll be time for it there.” The teenager’s gaze drifted away for a brief moment as his brows furrowed before returning to Lucas who remained mute. The brother proceeded “I’ve been working on something very big at Hogwarts for the last two years - Something important. And if I succeed; it’ll help everybody beyond imagining.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t understand, Jacob,” Lucas rubbed the back of his neck and his mouth tensed and contracted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m not sure if I can say more,” Jacob paused. Closing his eyes as he took a deep breath “You not knowing may perhaps be for the better. Some people would certainly try to stop me if they knew what I was doing.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The younger child’s eyes widened “Jacob, are you in trouble?” The older brother shook his head.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No..” Jacob let out a weak laugh “...at least not yet anyway.”  Once more he rested his hands on Lucas’ shoulders as he leaned down to look his little brother directly in the eyes.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lucas, listen… “ He let out a small sigh before resuming “What I am trying to say is that in the future you might hear others speak poorly of me, but know that what I do I am doing for a good reason. And no matter what bad things these people might say about me. Understand this - It’s only lies.”  The end of the small speech left Lucas only slowly nodding as he absorbed every word of what his brother told him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Lucas! Jacob! Dessert is waiting for you - Come on!” Mrs. Blackburn yelled to them once more. Both brothers turned towards their mother and the rest of their family awaiting them. Jacob quickly turned back to face his sibling.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And Lucas, don’t tell Mum and Dad any of this no matter what, okay? It’s hush-hush,” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lucas frantically nodded at his brother’s command. Provoking a smile from the teenager. Clapping him on the shoulder; Jacob rose back up again “Great. Now let’s get back. I’m starving for some chocolate pudding!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And with that, both brothers turned and walked towards a small table where their parents and grandparents were. Allowing themselves to enjoy the day as they were wonted to. Finishing up the last course of the picnic. The entire family would afterward return to the grandparents’ house. Spending the remainder of the evening there and to stay overnight.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>First of September would always start with a hearty breakfast as the Blackburn family enjoyed one last meal together before they journeyed to London. The entire family would travel by the floo network and always Kelly, would panic over the prospect of George Blackburn, their muggle grandfather, using it. George would always, in return, balk and laugh at Kelly’s worry before going through first. Much to the amusement of both children. And in the end, they would arrive at Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. Where the old and magnificent Hogwarts Express stood ready to bring both wizards and witches forth to the magical school.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Having found a compartment and place to store his luggage. Jacob now stood outside the train once more. To say goodbye to his family one last time before departure. Having said farewell first to his parents and then his grandparents, the teenager turned to Lucas and leaned down to face him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You remember what I said yesterday,” The older sibling’s words more a wish than a question “You stay strong, little brother, alright?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lucas nodded. A half-choked “Yes,” the only words to escape the young boy as he struggled to hold back tears. Both brothers embraced, clinging to each other as if they would never let go. Stopping only when it was clear it was time to leave. Jacob entered the train. Looking out to his family through the window of his compartment. All waving goodbye as the signal for the train’s departure rang throughout the station. Lucas began running, desperate to follow his brother as long as he could. Forced to stop at the end of the platform. The last thing Lucas saw of his brother was him looking back with a sad smile on his lips.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The last of his brother Lucas would ever see.</span>
