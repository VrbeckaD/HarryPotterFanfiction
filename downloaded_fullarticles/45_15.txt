    <p>
  <span>Hermione smiled as she breathed in the scent of the books at Flourish and Blotts.  Seventh year was going to be better than any of the previous years. She was Head Girl this year, and she couldn’t wait to tell her two best friends.  They were meeting later today at the Leaky Cauldron, and after being in the Mediterranean all summer, she missed them both keenly. Letters were just not the same.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>She knew better than to think either of them would be interested in buying books with her so she had decided to come to Diagon Alley early so Hermione could enjoy her favorite part of school shopping without the boys complaining that she was taking too long.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>She walked slowly up and down each and every aisle of the store, sometimes she would stop and pick up a book from her list while other times she got distracted by a book that just sounded interesting.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>She was standing in an aisle so engrossed in a book of the University level Arithmancy that when the strange pressed himself up against her back and his nose brushed the back of her neck she was caught completely and utterly off guard.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Mmmm, you smell like applewood and old books.”  He growled in a tone that made her knees shake a bit.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Her breath caught a bit, and she was surrounded by the smell of newsprint, coffee, and wet earth.  Her mind went completely blank as she tried to understand what was going on. When he brain did finally restart, she turned swiftly in the man’s arms and glared up at him.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“We’re in a bookstore, it could be the smell isn’t me.”  She said stepping out of his grasp and using the book in her hands as a shield against her chest.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Oh, it is you, my sweetling.  I can tell.” He said with a smile as he licked his lips.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“What do you think you’re doing exactly?”  She asked keeping her glare even as instincts told her to press herself against the stranger.  Where was this coming from?</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>He looked at her for a long moment as if she were particularly slow.  He took a step towards her as a slow smirk formed on strikingly handsome features “What’s your name my little Omega?”  He nearly purred.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“I-I’m not…” She started and shook her head.  Sometimes living the summer away from wizardkind she could forget about the strange social order that magical people had.  She had read many books on the subject of what was commonly referred to as wizard puberty, but as of last year, she had not presented as one of the three archetypes.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Oh yes, you are.  I’m surprised you don’t have every Alpha and Beta male in a block radius coming in here to sniff you.”  He said as his eyes traveled over her and he placed a hand on the shelf next to her head. “You smell terrific.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>She had to admit to herself the man smelt perfect.  She could feel her body reacting to his pheromones and even the way he used his large frame to full advantage.  He was a peak specimen of an Alpha male, and she had the urge to bare her neck to him.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Does that line ever work?”  She asked because she was Hermione Granger and was not one to let herself fall into a biological trap just because her body wanted her to.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>He growled and narrowed her eyes, he didn’t seem to like her tone.  She held in the whimper and stood her ground as she looked back up into his eyes.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“What’s your name my little Omega with a mouth?”  He nearly hissed as he dark eyes held her in place.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Hermione Granger, what’s yours?”  She asked as she refused to be cowed by any of his Alpha posturing.  This was the twentieth century, and they were in the middle of a public place.  She knew he wouldn’t try anything against her will.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Edvard Tollim at your service.”  He said with a charming smile that probably had a lot of girls spreading their legs for the man.  His hand moved up, and his fingers brushed over a spot of Hermione’s neck that made her let out an involuntary gasp.  “Why does your name sound familiar?” He asked as his thumb continued to brush over what she would know from her reading was one of her scent glands.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>She wanted to tell him everything about being Harry Potter’s best friend.  The desire to give into him only grew as he touched her like he was.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“I wouldn’t know.”  She snapped instead and jerked away from his hand.  “It’s very rude to do that to a stranger.” She said, and her body was shaking from the force of her instincts.  “Please step back.” She added firmly and glanced around for an avenue of escape.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Well aren't you a surprise?”  He asked seeming both annoyed and delighted by her reaction.  “I’m staying with some family friends right now; you should come to visit me so we can get to know each other better.  Or I could come to visit you?” He offered his eyes traveling over her once more.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“I’ll be heading to Hogwarts in a couple of days, so I don’t think that will be possible.”  She said firmly, as she picked up her shopping basket. “I actually have friends waiting on me now.”  She said not knowing why she felt the need to give the man a reason for leaving.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>He picked up one of the books form her basket and looked it over without even bothering to ask.  “You must be taking advanced Athurmancy this year.” He said as he opened the book.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Yes, which means I need that book.”  She said as she tried to snatch it back from him, but he turned to keep it out of her grasp.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“No.”  He said tucking the book under his arm and turning away from her towards the Athermancy section of the store.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>She glanced back toward the checkout desk before following him.  At the very least she could get herself another copy of the required reading for the class.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Nenyor’s book is useless.  It’s a crime they are still using it to teach.  If you’re not a complete imbecile you will want…”  he paused as he scanned the shelves. “...ah Wenlock’s book.” He said as he pulled the thicker volume from the shelf and put her original selection away.  “It has everything that the Nenyor book has, only it’s correct and proofed.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>She looked between him and the book her held out skeptically.  Nenyor’s book was on her reading list. She did not like the idea of deviating from the reading list.  He raised an eyebrow at her as if he was giving her a personal challenge. She ground her teeth as she looked between the offered book and the one she was meant to get.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Fine.” He said and lowered the book.  “I’ll buy you the Wenlock book.” He said looking over her in a way that made Hermione feel his displeasure.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“I did not ask or do I need your help Mr. Tollim.” She said as she held her breath before dashing forward to grab the book she wanted.  She moved back again before he could touch her and headed towards the counter to pay for her selection.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>As she got into line, her shoulders dropped as she smelled the man’s now familiar scent directly behind her.  He wasn’t making a move to touch or talk to her again, but his looming presence was all consuming. It felt like it was seeping into her bones and making her thoughts distant and unfocused.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>She had a powerful urge to lean back into him and allow him to wrap himself around her.  She wanted to expose her neck to him and show her submission. Hermione shook her head as the line moved her body positively vibrating as she fought the new and powerful instincts.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>When it was finally her turn, she set her books on the counter and forced herself not to look at him.  She would fight with every fiber in her bring not to give into the base feelings. She was Hermione Jean Granger, and she would not be ruled by anything but logic.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>She nearly ran from the store once her purchases were made.  As the fresh air hit her, she let how a relieved sigh when it cleared his scent from her system.  She blinked a few times and swallowed before remember she needed to meet the boys and rushed off towards the Leaky Cauldron.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>'Mr. Tollim' smirked as he watched Hermione's retreating back.  It had been a long while since he had found an omega so worthy of his attention.  Since returning to the world of the living a few years ago, he had not had the chance to express that side of himself adequately.  It would be a joy to hunt the girl and make her his. She had willingly given him more than enough information he would need to find her again.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>He looked down at the book in his hand with a smile.  If she were as smart as he suspected, then she would realize its value as soon as she gave into reading it.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Tucking the book under his arm once again he strolled down the Diagon Alley as if he didn’t have a care in the world.  He smiled at the pretty witches who giggled at him, none smart enough to see the wolf hidden neatly behind the mask of a sheep.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>He went on a few more unhurried errands before Apparating to the edge of Malfoy Manor.  When he had first risen to his current state, he had stayed at the manor with the ever sniveling Malfoys, but it took him very little time to find a place of his own.  No, he was not here to stay, but he felt that they would be a valuable source of information when it came to his newest prey.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>He opened the front door and strode into the entrance hall, not bothering to knock or wait for one of their filthy little house elves to come and collect him.  As he crossed the threshold he let the illusions of his former self, slide away like a snake shedding its skin.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>He met the delectate Narcissa first, and she bowed her head in a beautiful show of submission only the most graceful Omega was capable.  Of course, the woman was mated to Lucius, so he had no desire for her. If he had, he would merely kill the Malfoy patriarch and take her, but he had never liked such fragile seeming things.  They broke much too quickly.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“I am looking for your son, Lady Malfoy.  Is he home?” He asked looking down at her she noticed her sudden stillness.  She was afraid of him, but she feared for her son more. But did she worry enough to defy him?</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“He’s told everything he knows about the Potter boy, my Lord.”  She said softly instead of answering him.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“I am sure he is a loyal subject, Lady Malfoy.”  He said trying to put her at ease. “But I have new questions about one of his classmates.  This is his final year at Hogwarts, is it not?” He asked as if it was a casual conversation.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Yes my Lord.  We are proud to say Draco will be Head Boy this year.”  She said unable to keep from boasting over her boy.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“I too was Head Boy in my time.  But that only means he is well positioned to answer my questions.  Where is he?” He asked again, making the inpatients in his tone clear.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“On the Quidditch field my Lord.  I will have an elf bring him to you in the den?”  She offered before he could make the request.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“My time is valuable.”  He added as he moved past her towards the den.  Knowing he did not wish to wait would moving them all the more quickly.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>He made himself comfortable in Lucius chair before setting the book down on a short table to his left.  Now that he had nothing else to focus on memories on Hermione's delectable smell washed over him. He had wanted to bite her right there in the store.  She was something special; he had never had the drive to actually claim an Omega before.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“My Lord,”  Draco spoke from the door, and Voldemort motioned for him to enter.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Young Master Malfoy.”  He greeted him as if they were friends.  “I hear congratulations are in order.” He said placing an easy smile on his pale lips.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Thank you, Sir.”  He said bowing his head, but his whole form was tense.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Voldemort took in a slow breath, and the smile turned cold as he realized why the matriarch was so keen to protect her son.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“You’ve presented as an Alpha.”  He said in the same pleasant tone that he had used to congratulate the boy.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Yes my Lord.”  Draco agreed nervously.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Kneel.”  He ordered getting to his feet in a swift motion.  He had to deal severely with Alphas within his ranks.  They were valuable members, but they needed to be tamed, to understand who they served.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>He watched as the boy fought with his instincts to force himself to his knees.  He was pleased with the show; most had far more trouble following that order the first time.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“You have control over your baser instincts.”  He said as he circled the young Malfoy. “In the future, this will make you a stronger Alpha, than just giving into what the beast wants.”  He explained as he watched the boy struggle to stay on his knees. “I find it also helps to let young Alphas know their place. You know your place, don’t you Draco?”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Yes my Lord.”  He ground out through clenched teeth.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Yes, I would think so.  The Malfoy line has always been stronger than most.  But this is not in fact why I asked you here today Draco.”  He said stroking the boy’s ego as he did as he was ordered. “I wish to know more about one of your classmates.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“I will continue to report on all of Potter’s actions at school my Lord.”  He said as Voldemort continued to circle. He did not move from his kneeling position; it seemed he was smart enough to realize the test wasn’t over.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Good.  You are a useful spy, just like your godfather.”  He agreed with a nod of his head. “But I had an encounter with another of your classmates.  Her name was familiar to me, but I can’t place the context. Tell me all you know of Hermione Granger.”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Voldemort watched the sneer form on the boy’s face.  “You know her because Granger is Potter’s mudblood sidekick,”  Draco said as he clenched his fists at his sides.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Potter’s mudblood,”  Voldemort repeated to himself, a small smile still on his nearly invisible lips.  “Well doesn’t she get more interesting. Tell me Draco, has she presented yet?” He asked though he already knew the answer.  She seemed surprised by his attention, so he could only assume it was a new occurrence.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Not that I know my Lord.  Most assume she will present Alpha, but I think she’ll be just another Beta.”  He said with a continued look of disdain.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>Voldemort tapped his wand against his thigh as he thought over what to do next.  He desired her, his own Alpha instincts pushing him towards the girl. If she was a mudblood, there was no way he could claim her, not that he had ever claimed a mate.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“What else can you tell me about her?”  He asked moving back to sit down as he made the boy continue to kneel.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“I’ll probably have to share a common room with her this year.  They’ll probably make her Head Girl since she is top of our class.”  He reported with a frown.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Than that will place you well to keep an eye on her activities for me.”  He said tapping his wand against his knee as he glanced over at the book. “I assume she despises you as much as you despise her?”</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“Why would you care, she is nothing, my Lord,”  Draco said looking up at his superior for the first time.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span></span><br/>

  <span>“She is an omega Draco.  And I find I wish to enjoy her.”  Voldemort admitted in a dangerous tone.  “I do not like others touching what is mine.”  He growled, genuinely showing his own Alpha side for the first time.</span>
  <span></span><br/>

  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>Draco lowered hunched a little trying to get lower as the more powerful Alpha showed his strength.  “Yes my Lord.” He said understanding the threat perfectly. “I will warn the others.” He added thinking quickly.</span>
