    <p>1899, somewhere atop the <em>Blocksberg</em>, deep in one of the forests, a clearing with the hollowed out trunk of the Donar's Oak in its middle was brightly illuminated by the light of the milk moon.</p><p>There, kneeling before the trunk was a half-clad young man, his face hidden away by the shadows cast from the crown of horn he wore atop his head. His blond hair was caked with ash, and runlets of dried blood marked old scars and new cuts alike, where he had opened a pathway to guide his bloody tears down his cheeks.</p><p>Pale skin was painted with ash and coal in patterns that to the eye of the beholder, were clearly heavily laden with some peculiar meaning. Prominent above all, were the symbols of oak, seed and thunder, ansuz, inguz and thurisaz painted to be a bindrune in the black of coal to the white of ash on his chest, just above his heart.</p><p>Thirteen wooden bowls were placed before the young man, and in each of them a sacrifice had been prepared in advance.</p><p>From some of them wafts of burning euodia, saccinit, fraxinella, olibanum, and amomum rose into the air, whereas in others blood was bubbling with unearthly ferocity, water was swelling to the rim only to recede back to a single drop, and earth too was there put in a bowl, moving as if alive. Some of them were empty, soon to be filled.</p><p>Behind him bronze sickle, rope and wand lay readied for his ritual.</p><p>Then, directed by some invisible command, a unintelligible chant flew from his lips in half a whisper with every breath he took, and soon a droning monotone of mantra filled the air with a constant underline of melody to it.</p><p>Time meant little to the young man as afar whence the thunder roared its mystic sound to the chant of invocation breathing life into the idol resting afoot the hollowed remains of Donar's Oak.</p><p>The thunder's rumbling recurred in the distance, wind picked up and all the eidola of the night creeped closer to the shine of unearthly light radiating from the youth's body.</p><p>Tremors of magic were slowly but with a steady rhythm, in time with the chant, enticing movement from the heretofore ramrod body until trance began to lay a pleasurable haze over the thoughts of doubts.</p><p>The wafts of smoke, a terribly burning yet addicting mixture of smells danced around, drifting around the young man, hurting in his eyes until blood began to trickle from his nose, slowly running down his face until all of his chin was covered with a thin smear of red.</p><p>Void of any conscious control over his actions, the young man's body took this as the cue, the movement guided by the ingrained knowledge of this ritual, one hand dipping into the first bowl of his own blood.</p>
<hr/><p>Unbeknownst to the boy his flight from school and consequently his plans had not went fully unnoticed, despite all the precautions he had taken to prevent anyone from interfering with his plans.</p><p>Indeed, earlier in the night as the charms protecting the school and its land from the eyes of anyone not attending reported a breach, Abraham Kiebert, Charms Warden of the Durmstrang Institute had immediately made the decision to leg it.</p><p>He had rushed to the office of the Headmaster, on the way picking up a few more informations that would decidedly proof useful when reporting to his boss.</p><p>And that was how he was stood in the office, face to face with the two centuries old man with his grey beard stained by ink and wax, leather girdle corseted tightly around the hip, and a thick fur robe thrown over the shoulders.</p><p>Yet, despite the appearance of an old and feeble hermit, the Headmaster Áskell Rasmussen was anything but to be taken lightly. He had not maintained Headmastership for nearly a century for nothing.</p><p>Kiebert stood shakily, his chest heaving up and down quickly.</p><p>"Are you sure Kiebert?" Asked the rough voice of the Headmaster, the calm in it belying his rage.</p><p>"He's never shown his face to his duties, Sir."</p><p>"I've asked if you were sure!"</p><p>Kiebert swallowed heavily. Sweat and tears of fear marked the truth of his words, "Yes! Yes! I told you before, Sir! He's too far gone! Mad and bereft of morals, that boy!" He spat the last word. "He's gone off after being seen reading something in his grandfather's ritual books!"</p><p>The Headmaster's head snapped to face Kiebert. "Not just truant but an apostate?!"</p><p>He muttered something inaudible before he gesturing for the other man to answer.</p><p>Kiebert nodded sharply. "The charms have reported him leaving through a breach at the outer forest, Sir."</p><p>Áskell Rasmussen's mood soured once more, his fist going down on the table before him. "He's responsible?"</p><p>"I'm afraid so, Sir."</p><p>A breach in the charms to allow apparition, done by a student no less? "Impertinent bastard! Go, find him! Bring him back, any means, you hear?!"</p><p>Kiebert hesitated to leave. Again he swallowed audibly and hard, sweat dripping down into his robes. "Any means, Sir? His grandfather, Sir… He might find objection with that."</p><p>Rasmussen growled with barely restrained anger. As he made to grab his wand, he spat, "Leave already you fool! The Magistrate is to join you! Bring him back at once! I'll manage the bastard's family!"</p><p>Not daring to stay any longer, Kiebert bowed quickly and ran out of office, back down the untold amount of stairs to the brooms. He was in dire need to hurry. Walking outside to the edge of the forest from where he could apparate would take far too long to do as he was ordered.</p><p>Once Kiebert was gone, the Headmaster spat into the fire of the hearth.</p><p>Never in all his years as the Headmaster of Durmstrang had he seen such a perverse interest in the forbidden arts of the occult and the dark. This was the last chance he would offer the boy. He'd take it, or he'd die.</p><p>With that decision made, he bade one of the school's <em>Fenggs</em> to procure an owl while he made to dash down some words of choice for the bastard's grandfather.</p><p>Courtesy as it was, the old hound would come down hard on his school if he wasn't at least informed about what was going to happen.</p><p>And truth be told, there simply was no good way to tell Johannes Grindelwald that his only living descendant was possibly going to die tonight.</p>
<hr/><p>Soon it would be time for the sacrifice.</p><p>This knowledge swam in the back of his head and yet Gellert shoved it away. It was necessary, he was sure of it. This would mark his entrance into the world of tomorrow. A new age for all children of magical blood. A Utopia born from his own blood. An ambition worth bleeding for, a future worth sacrificing for.</p><p>As it were, Gellert wasn't too keen on the pain ahead of him. He would manage, most assuredly, as he had done before, but that didn't mean he had to enjoy it. He didn't need to enjoy cutting into his own flesh, carving into it with deliberately slow motions to infuse not only his action but also the wound with a certain meaning and magic that was meant to transition his transcendental self into his body.</p><p>The trance still kept him sedated, kept the mix of fear and anticipation of what he was about to do far away from his mind, kept him ensnared with the feeling of pleasurable vastness, as if he was adrift in all the world's magic.</p><p>With quick and well practiced movements he finished painting his chest and arms in the patterns of selected bindrunes, the blood on his chest, around the rune-cross having dried to a thick film of crust already.</p><p>A few more moments, then it would be time. The thunderstorm was closing in on the <em>Blocksberg</em>. And he would need to await the right moment to begin. Timing was of importance with this sort of magic, and, truth be told, he wasn't prepared for the aftermath of failure.</p><p>Gellert could feel the presences of these spirits of the <em>Blocksberg</em> around him. It was an odd feeling, for he could not see them, yet he knew, with certainty that they were there. It felt as if he could see them just from the corner of his eye, like a shadow that would be gone if he were to turn his head.</p><p>These spirits, eidola of the benign sort, much like any other being living yonder the plane on which humans existed, could feel the magic he was invoking with his chant, with this ritual.</p><p>He just hoped they wouldn't interfere with what he was about to do. The freely given blood of the Karkonosz should help along their understanding that he had the blessing of the highest forest and mountain spirit.</p>
<hr/><p>Kiebert was annoyed, frustrated, angry and not just a little alarmed.</p><p>As the Charms Warden of Durmstrang he had a firm knowledge of the magicks involved with charms, even if he never had managed to attain a professorial chair, and as such it had been relatively easy to follow the destination the (hopefully soon to be ex)student Gellert Grindelwald must have had in mind when he apparated from behind the forest at Durmstrang.</p><p>What had him annoyed was that he had to repeat the sniffing of apparition traces a few more times, as the student in question had attempted to hide his tracks by apparating all over the lands.</p><p>What had him frustrated was that he could not pinpoint the final destination without following every single apparition in a proper routine of appearing, dispelling his own magicks, then deliberately and carefully searching for a trace of familiar magicks.</p><p>What had him angry was that he could already guess the final destination, - which in turn lead to why he was alarmed: it was the <em>Blocksberg</em>, the most magical and therefore most important mountain of all the witch-mountains in the German Realm.</p><p>Oh, the Headmaster would have more than just a few words with the Grindelwald, and so would the Prince, or rather his torture, for that matter, that Kiebert was sure of.</p><p>With all the apparition over the lands it was a miracle that the troops of the Prince of the Magical German Realm hadn't already picked up the trail of the magicks, storming after them with their wands at the ready!</p><p>Tergiversators, people who had caused a break of the Statute of Secrecy were automatically sentenced to death by exsanguination, that was common knowledge to anyone of magical heritage in these lands.</p><p>So, admittedly, it was quite understandable that Kiebert was quite alarmed and no little wary, which he would admit without shame if his companion had bothered to ask.</p><p>Instead, for the umptieth time he was asked, "How's it coming along, Abraham?"</p><p>Resigned to being the mule on this exploration, Kiebert turned around.</p><p>"There's no mistaking it. It's the <em>Blocksberg</em>," he replied with a shiver running down his back. "It will take hours to find him with all the spirits flogging to the mountain!"</p><p>Durmstrang's Magistrate, a young Swiss man scowled at that revelation, his eyes flicking up to where a carpet of clouds was hiding away the light of the milk moon. "Full moon night, right. Yes, he's done it now, thrice-be-damned Grindelwalds! Sure hope old Rasmussen knows what he's doing."</p><p>Kiebert agreed quietly as he looked around. If he had anything to say on the matter he would have erased the name Grindelwald from the register and forgotten about the boy altogether.</p><p>Instead he now had to keep an eye open for the wizards of the French Third Republic <em>and</em> the troops of the Prince!</p><p>They were far too close to the Kandel, somewhere at the southern border of the Grand Duchy of Baden, having apparated almost ten times until they arrived here.</p><p>"Let's get going," he said with a tired sigh, glancing over to his colleague. He'd rather be gone before anyone arrived to check for who exactly had trespassed these lands.</p>
<hr/><p>Aside of the thunder rumbling away it was quiet in the clearing. Far too quiet to be natural.</p><p>Yet this quietness was it, that allowed Gellert to keep focused, of course, but it also made the heavy beating of his heart all that much more obvious to himself.</p><p>He could hear it, feel it, and its steady loud and strong pounding was making him even more anxious of what he was about to do.</p><p>The crown of horn sat heavy atop his head, the wand in his hand felt even more heavy, and the bronze sickle? The sickle he barely could lift.</p><p>Then, with steely determination he ignored all these feelings, ignored reason and the primal want to prevent pain, prevent suffering, and he took a deep, fortifying breath.</p><p>The wand rose first shakily and then as he gained confidence, more steadily, and with fervour he incantated, "One eye for the All-Seer - Haptasnytrir!"</p><p>He moved the wand over his left eye, fixing it in its place, and then, before the anticipation of the pain could drive him stiff with fear, he plunged the bronze sickle into his eye socket.</p><p>The moment the cold metal pierced the ocular globe Gellert's conscious perception, all his world, his body and mind were aflame with piercing, tearing pain.</p><p>The first seconds felt like a minute, and only by chance did Gellert's body remember how to breath, yet when he shakily gasped air into his lungs, he knew there was no stopping now, for every movement, every breath he took, every shiver, every tremor of pain running through his body jostled the sickle a bit deeper into the bleeding socket.</p><p>Yet he didn't cry the blood-freezing cry he felt his body all too ready to unleash. No, Gellert kept this feeling of sacrifice open, welcomed it with the pain even, for it was what he was willing to give.</p><p>Gellert's voice cracked when he incantated the next sentence of the sacrificial spell, but he carried on nevertheless. It was far too late to stop.</p><p>He waved his wand towards the pierced eyeball, and then, clenching his jaw shut, ripped the sickle plus eye out of its socket.</p><p>He moaned at the feeling of emptiness; he felt ill knowing that he had just ripped out a part of himself, and still he drove onward. He ignored the trickle of fluids running down the deep-cut pathways on his cheeks, and he ignored the trembling of his body, the feeling of cold that pulsated around and through his guts.</p><p>He dropped the eye into one of the empty bowls and invocated, "This sacrifice for the Spell-Speaker - Glapsviðr."</p><p>As he finished speaking the eye went up in pale blue flames.</p><p>With rapt fascination Gellert observed it being incinerated; it seemed his sacrifice was being welcomed!</p><p>Quickly he set about mixing the remains with all the other ingredients. </p><p>He was almost done. He felt elevated, gripped by some indescribable feeling of peace within himself. He knew, he could do it, now that he had proof that his idea had merit. Just one more little step and all would be well.</p><p>He felt the spirits cheer him on, he felt them dancing with joy at his actions.</p><p>With that knowledge firmly in mind, Gellert picked the rope from behind him and levitated it over the trunk of the Donar's oak.</p><p>He was almost done.</p>
<hr/><p><em>The </em>Johannes Grindelwald, father of the bloodline of Grindelwald clenched his fist around the parchment some owl had delivered a few seconds ago; did they truly think he'd sit back and let someone spill the blood of his family? Only a Grindelwald was allowed to bleed a Grindelwald!</p><p>The parchment crumpled under the force of his will and broke into brittle pieces until only dust remained.</p><p>He threw the remains into the fire of his stove and turned around.</p><p>"Hudl!" He roared into the air. "Hudl-<em>Fengg</em>! Bring me staff and stick! Now!"</p><p>A second later a small halfling with more beard than body and a red felt hat appeared before the ancient man, with staff and stick floating before its short body.</p><p>Johannes Grindelwald cast his mind into a forced calmness as he stowed away the stick and gripped the staff to hurry down the hallway.</p><p>The <em>Fengg</em> hurried behind him, small bursts of ashen light procuring furlined manteau and thick leather boots from nothingness. With magic they quickly were spelled onto the still walking Herr Johannes.</p><p>Herr Johannes knew he'd have to hurry, not only to make it in time to get there and to stop whatever foolishness Gellert was part of, but also because knowing his own limits, he could not stay away from what kept him alive for all that long at a time. He hadn't survived seven hundred years only to waste away by accident!</p><p>But… just in case, he thought and stopped in his tracks. "Hudl! If for whatever reason I do not return, then you are free to go!"</p><p>The halfling's eyes widened upon hearing that, but it agreed quickly nonetheless.</p><p>Herr Johannes didn't turn around to see his servant's reaction, instead having said his piece, he grunted as he started moving again. "And burn the place to the ground. Take the stones home <em>if</em> you go!" No need to have the bastards sniff around for his secrets!</p><p>As he reached the door, he took a calming breath. He had to go quite the distance.</p><p>And then, with barely a whisper Herr Johannes disappeared in a swirl of colours.</p>
<hr/><p>At the same time Herr Johannes left his house, Kiebert cast a warming charm onto himself while watching his colleague Eberstadt gander the lands from atop the <em>Teufelskanzel</em>, some near-ancient occult idol built of rocks atop the <em>Blocksberg</em>.</p><p>It was well past midnight and the air had some unnatural chill to it, and truth be told, Abraham Kiebert would rather not be anywhere close to the <em>Blocksberg</em> around the time of the Esbat!</p><p>And where was he? Atop the very mountain!</p><p>In the end his fear of what the old Rasmussen would do to him if he were to skip his duty had won out. He was a wizard, after all. He shouldn't be afraid of a mountain, even if said mountain was known to <em>anyone</em> in the Realm for its occult qualities, even if said mountain was known to harbour the most vile spirits and creatures especially at the time of the Esbat!</p><p>He twitched at some odd sound coming from farther down the hill before him, but the knowledge that he had his wand in hands kept him feeling somewhat safe. And instead of turning to hex whatever had made the sound, he asked, "Can you make out anything Knud?"</p><p>Knud Eberstadt, proud Swiss and temporary Magistrate at Durmstrang shook his head mutely. He swung his wand at the somewhat illuminated hill before him, sending two more orbs of light to brighten the woods.</p><p>After a few more seconds of staring after the lights moving over the treeline, he turned around and grumbled a few words of choice in his native dialect.</p><p>"There's nothing! <em>If</em> Grindelwald is here, then he's not lit any fires. Can't imagine any way to find him without flying the brooms over the trees and searching clearing after clearing."</p><p>Kiebert denied the not so subtle suggestion once more. "I've told you! There's a troop of the Prince stationed at Wernigerode! They would see us - I don't have to tell you what's gonna happen <em>if</em>-," he was interrupted by Eberstadt's grunt.</p><p>"I know, I know. Don't piss yourself Abraham."</p><p>"Do stuff it then, would you?"</p><p>Eberstadt huffed and turned back to stare down the hill. "No tracking charms up your sleeves?" He asked it mockingly and knew Kiebert wouldn't take it personally.</p><p>"There's no such thing! Anything remotely close to what you have in mind is strictly in the field of divination, and I am pants at that!"</p><p>"Schiesdreck!"</p><p>Kiebert snorted mirthlessly. "That sums it up quite well."</p>
<hr/><p>Gellert bit back his need to scream at the feeling of acid burning down his throat as he attempted to swallow around the physical want to throw up.</p><p>The forcibly taken - tricked and stolen, his mind supplied - tear of the <em>Ekke Nekkepenn</em> burnt in his throat and as soon as it reached his stomach, that too felt aflame with the heat of a hundred fires.</p><p>He should have known that ingesting fluids from an aquatic creature famed for its pyrokinesic magic would have some such strange effects, and yet here he was, writhing in place so as not to make a sound, lest he disturb the proper process of this ritual.</p><p>But he remembered his grandfather's words. He remembered the lessons as his lifeline, the one reason why he burdened himself to wade through this torment: "Whoever is hard with himself earns the right to be hard with others as well and avenges himself for the pain whose manifestations he was not allowed to show and had to repress!"</p><p>And indeed there was a purpose to him drinking these tears. The qualities of these tears, - or rather the effect they had on those people who were brazen enough to ingest them, could be described as enhancing in the widest meaning of the word.</p><p>Quite so, Gellert would not feel pain or heat from any fire until the tears had been fully digested, and yet any water he would come into contact with would make it so that he felt as if he was burned at the stake. A double-edged sword, most assuredly, and yet it was strictly necessary as he had no plans to burn himself alive in the next part of the ritual.</p><p>No magic was to interfere with the next part.</p><p>Gellert forced himself to stand up-right, rope around his neck, sickle and bowl of blood in hands and a surge of determination hardening his face.</p><p>With his right hand he held the big bowls above his head. He took a quick breath, as if to assure him that this was necessary, and then he turned it upside down, spilling the bubbling (freely given) blood of the Karkonosz onto himself and everything below him.</p><p>In a heartbeat everything it came into contact with went up in flames; bowls, earth, the wood of the Oak, the rope, and Gellert's body too.</p><p>"One life for the Hanged God - Hangatýr!" Gellert shouted it aloud through the sound of flames licking at his ears, and with a resolved grunt he cut the rope of the counterweight.</p><p>With a heavy jolt the rope around his neck dragged him up high into the air.</p><p>His eyes widened upon suddenly realising the feeling of pressure around his throat, the inability to breath, the pressure in his head that began to make him feel dazed.</p><p>Immediately regret welled up within him. He didn't want to die!</p><p>But then, slowly, with every long moment he hung there, strung up by his neck like a puppet, he forced himself to cease the struggle. He forced himself to cease this natural reaction to the impending end of his existence. He would have to trust the magic of the ritual. Either it would work or he would die, it was quite simple really.</p><p>The crown of horn slipped from his head and Gellert closed his bulging eye.</p><p>Death wasn't that bad.</p>
<hr/><p>"There!" Eberstadt's voice exclaimed triumphantly.</p><p>Thunder cracked above their heads and a second later hundreds of arms of lightning broke through the clear sky.</p><p>Kiebert's head whipped around, his eyes going wide upon spotting the flaring light. "Is that fire?"</p><p>"You bet your wimpy ass it is! Let's go! Before we lose him! The boy'll wish he'd never left his bed tonight!"</p><p>Before Kiebert could react Eberstadt disapparated in a veily cloud of vapour down the hill towards where the fire was breathing away its light.</p><p>"Fuck!" Abraham Kiebert spat out. He gripped his wand tight and followed after his hotheaded colleague.</p><p>It took a few seconds but then he had caught up with Knud Eberstadt, just in time to break through the cover of the treetops.</p><p>They touched down in the midst of a rather small and densely forested clearing, and now that Kiebert was standing in it, he thought it a wonder that they had managed to spot it from atop the <em>Teufelskanzel</em>.</p><p>"Where is he," Eberstadt demanded, his eyes darting over the moonlit lawn. "There's the fire, but-" Kiebert's gasp interrupted him.</p><p>Eberstadt turned his head to glance at the Charms Warden only to see him sprinting towards the hollow trunk that was ablaze, the red and yellow light of the fire throwing haunting shadows at the gentle hill.</p><p>His eyes followed the direction Kiebert was dashing in, then they widened with shock.</p><p>"Is that? Fuck!"</p><p>Knud Eberstadt was rooted with shock. He'd seen some injuries throughout his young life, he'd seen some fighting. But never had he seen something like this!</p><p>Abraham Kiebert, desperation driving him, already had his wand aloft to summon water forth from the very air, yet when it splashed harmlessly against the scorched earth and the fire raving around the trunk, he cursed frustratedly.</p><p>"Help me!" He yelled at Eberstadt from afar, his wand in motion to transfigure earth to sand to put out the fire around the trunk. "Help me! Snap out of it Knud!"</p><p>They'd have to hurry lest the Prince's troops were to spot the fire too, before they could get Grindelwald and leave.</p>
<hr/><p>Johannes Grindelwald arrived at the <em>Teufelskanzel</em> just in time to see the back of a wizard disapparate down the hill.</p><p>He didn't stop him, even if he could for his mind was cast afar and wide and he knew already where his descendant was. He could smell it in the air, feel it on his skin, sense it with his mind, - the magic Gellert had been invoking, the sacrifices he had made.</p><p>A growl ripped from his mouth. For he too could sense that death was drawing close. Too close!</p><p>He rammed his staff to the ground and hurled himself into the direction he sensed Gellert to be in. It came as no surprise to him that this too was the direction the wizard had disapparated to, old Áskell Rasmussen had made it clear that he would send his own people after Gellert after all.</p><p>It took a few moments but then Herr Johannes arrived at the scene, one wizard thrown into shock, rooted by his own fear firmly in place whereas another was hurriedly trying to put out a veritable tempest of flames dancing around the trunk of a very familiar piece of tree.</p><p>"Leave it," he growled. "You cannot extinguish these flames!"</p><p>His shouting seemed to snap out the young wizard before him, his arm trembling with panick and yet the wand in his hand was grasped tight.</p><p>For a short moment it looked as if he was going to attack Herr Johannes, but then he thought better.</p><p>"Don't piss yourself, boy!" The old man ordered harshly and strode past the Magistrate.</p><p>A few quick strides later Herr Johannes stood next to Kiebert, and with barely a glance he continued to bark his orders, "You, wizard! Cut the rope and get my boy down!"</p><p>"But the fire-," Kiebert protested distractedly only to receive a growl in reply.</p><p>Before he could protest any further Herr Johannes stomped his staff onto the earth and with a hollow sound magic echoed back.</p><p>Immediately all the fire's wild flames receded into the ground just as if all the oxygen had been sucked out of the very air, leaving behind unscorched Oak, blackened earth and the limp body of Gellert Grindelwald hanging lifelessly.</p><p>"Get my boy down, I said!"</p><p>Herr Johannes sucked in a laboured breath. These little tricks of magic already had him feel drained and tired. He was truly getting too old for this shit. He should have never meddled with … better leave these thoughts for another time, he thought.</p><p>Kiebert, surprise mixing with fear at seeing the almost casual display of power without the use of a wand, there and then realised just who he stood next to.</p><p>Because of that knowledge, he was not daring to delay any further: he jabbed his wand at the rope above Grindelwald's head and sent a cutting spell at it. As soon as it gave way he swished and flicked and set to levitate the falling body gently down to earth.</p><p>Meanwhile Knud Eberstadt had managed to catch up. He stood next to Kiebert, the grip around his wand whitening his knuckles. His heart hammered loudly in his chest, the pulse driving a gushing sound through his ears as he saw the dead body before him.</p><p>He had never seen a dead body before. He had never wanted to see someone so young dead. And now he didn't know if he ever could forget this picture again.</p><p>Kiebert, as soon as Gellert's body had been lowered down kneeled down and set to cast about any medical charms he knew of. Yet there was no hope; all these terrible thoughts, these ideas of anticipation that his mind had sent at his third eye, these moving pictures of finding just death where life should have been, unveiled themselves to be the truth.</p><p>"He's dead," he declared with some odd feeling of finality he never had known before and still hoped to be just some crude figment of imagination. "He's dead," he repeated hollowly.</p><p>A retching sound filled the night's silence just as a stroke of lightning flashed brightness into the clearing.</p><p>The eidola of the night danced in circles around the lifeless body just as the thunder broke.</p>
