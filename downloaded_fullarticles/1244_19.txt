    <p>It was loud and unbearable, he feels that he should have gone mad a long time ago. Maybe he was already mad, not that there would be a difference if he was with nothing to compare it to. Earth was screaming and pleading for help. Just recently has he been able to hear her. There was nothing he could do, that anyone could actually. Which was him being the last human being alive and all.<br/>
</p>
<p>Okay that's great and all but the how we got here is simple, Humanity. Harry Potter threw his head back and let loose booming laughter. He had kids, beautiful with so much ahead of them. So much promise after the war ended and the peace returned. Heck he even sent them off to Hogwarts with Ginny, sweet Ginny. They never came back.<br/>
</p>
<p>Less than a week before the wizarding world was found out. And nobody knew, not until the bombs started dropping. A massive nuke took out Hogwarts with all the teachers and students with it. The Muggles didn’t even try to peace talk, instead opting to come out guns blazing. Right after Harry and Ginny mourned and became homebodies. One day Harry had gone out to get their vaults things as Gringotts was no longer safe.<br/>
</p>
<p>He came back to smoking rubble and fire with Ginny nowhere in sight. He never found her body. They were picked off one by one with google maps of all things, the technology was somehow able to see through the wards. Diagon Alley was one of the first to go, like Hogwarts.<br/>
</p>
<p>Harry gathered everything and collected all the magical artifacts he could, including the Hallows. One by one everyone he knew either disappeared or was killed. Ten years later only handfuls of magical people were left. By twenty less than ten. At twenty five only him, Not from lack of trying. The Hallows made him immortal in the literal sense, he ALWAYS came back.<br/>
</p>
<p>Harry watched as the world was found sick and irreparable from all the bombs used. Watched as the muggles slowly died out. He watched as the buildings and every shred of humanity’s existence started to crumble. Even though the air was poison he breathed it in deep, the water sludge that he choked on he still drank it. The only reprieve the greenhouse and heavily enchanted house he created. Even that was quickly wearing away by the acid rain. The magic dying and seeping out, the Earth was dying. And now he could hear her screams.</p>
