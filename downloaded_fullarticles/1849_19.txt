    <p>Harry was currently moving around the coffee shop as he cleans up the dirty tables, making sure that there wasn't any trash under the tables. He really loved his job at the coffee shop and he considered it one of his best jobs ever aside from watching his best friend's two children. He loved hanging around his friends, drink coffee on the job (who favored him and his best friend Hermione), and kill time when business was slow. If you were to ask him, Harry would say that his life was great, however, he was a single man. Hermione and a couple of his other friends would tell him that he was easy-going, and that they would take advantage of him.</p><p>The last two people Harry dated were dubbed a 'complete ass' by Hermione. She had disliked Romilda Vane, and she really despised Cormac McLaggen with a passion. His other friend Neville constantly told him that people, especially Romilda and Cormac were simply using him for money, but he didn't understand it until it was too late. As soon as they got what they wanted from Harry, they broke up with him and he was left with his heart, which was completely broken. Blaise, Harry's other friend, would always tell him that they were gold diggers, and in the end, even Harry had to agree with his sentiment. At this moment in time, all he wanted was someone who would genuinely like him and not use him for their own beneficial needs.</p><p>As soon as he was done with the tables, he looked around the empty shop and sighed to himself contently. He figured that not a lot of people were outside due to the heavy rainfall. It was raining so hard, that the drops were hitting the windows, which made him want to grab a cup of coffee and sit at one of the tables to enjoy the rainfall that was currently taking place.</p><p>"Anyone out there, Harry?" Justin asked as she came from the back.</p><p>"No, not yet."</p><p>Justin sighs.</p><p>"Well, come get a cup of coffee and you can take your break."</p><p>"Got it."</p><p>Harry grabbed a cup of coffee, sat at a table and took out his phone. Now, if Harry was being honest with himself, he had a gut feeling that something was going to happen today. If there was anything that he could be sure of, it was to trust his gut feeling and his gut was telling him that something good was going to happen to him. Just as he had his fourth sip of coffee and sent a text to his friend Luna, the door opened. As Harry looked up, he saw a tall man with wet blonde hair plastered on his forehead, soaking wet clothes and holding onto a stroller, causing Harry to rush over to him.</p><p>"Are you alright?" Harry asked him worriedly as he helped the blonde gentleman to a seat.</p><p>"A bit." The blonde said as he shivered as he pulled the stroller closer towards him after he dropped his bag near his feet.</p><p>Harry watched as the wet man lifted his hands to lift up the cover of the stroller, checking on his baby who was dry and sleeping quietly. Harry smiled at the baby, trying not to coo so loudly.</p><p>"What would you like to drink?" Harry asked the shivering man.</p><p>"Cocoa, if you have any, please."</p><p>"Got it."</p><p>Harry rushes behind the counter and made a cup of cocoa for the young father. After a few moments, he had a big mug that was filled with hot chocolate with whipped cream on top with marshmallows on top with a spoon in the mug. As he was walking back towards the occupied table, Harry noticed the man hunched over in the chair, pushing his hair back with his hand.</p><p>"Are you alright?" Harry asked the blonde as he placed the mug in front of the man. "Do you need to go to the hospital or something?"</p><p>The blonde looks up at Harry and shook his head.</p><p>"No, it's just cold, but thank you for asking." The blonde said. "Could you keep me company?"</p><p> Harry's breath almost hitched as cool grey eyes met his own green eyes and if Harry was honest with himself, they were beautiful.</p><p>"If you really want me to."</p><p>"I do." The blonde says. "I need to take my mind off of things for a while."</p><p>And with that, Harry sits down taking in the blonde's appearance. He noticed that the man in front of him was tall, slender, had a pale and pointed face, sleek blond hair, and ice grey eyes.</p><p>"Here."  Harry said handing the blonde his oversized hoodie. "You're still shivering."</p><p>"Thanks." The blonde said as he put on Harry's sweater.</p><p>"So what's you're name?"</p><p>"My name is Draco Malfoy." The blonde said before taking a sip of his hot chocolate. "What's yours?"</p><p>"I'm Harry. Harry Potter. It's nice to meet you, Draco."</p><p>Draco chuckled at Harry's smile.</p><p>"Likewise, Harry."</p><p align="center">

</p><p>"Boys really suck sometimes." Draco says almost three hours later in the empty coffee shop. Within those three hours, Harry found out why Draco was walking in the freezing, cold rain with his two month old daughter. His ex-boyfriend had kicked them out of their apartment for reasons that Draco didn't know, and when Draco went back to the apartment an hour later, Draco's ex was gone. The only thing that Draco knew was that his ex had left him a note saying that he didn't care for him nor their baby.</p><p>"I agree with that." Harry told him.</p><p>"Not all boys suck through. You're a good one, Green Eyes."</p><p>Harry smiles brightly.</p><p>"It's Harry, remember?"</p><p>"I remember, <em>Potter</em>." Draco says playfully, causing Harry to chuckle. "You know what? I made mistake with being with Gregory. He was an asshole, through and through to the very end."</p><p>Harry guessed that Gregory was the baby father, so he nodded as he was listening to Draco, who was currently putting his spoon in the empty mug.</p><p>"Since he's a fucking deadbeat, I have to take care of my baby all by myself. I just know that my parents are going to say 'I told you so' because they knew that Marcus was wrong for me. I should have trusted their judgement based on my previous ex-boyfriends, but apparently I never learned my lesson." Draco said as his tears were rolling down his cheeks. "If I'm being honest, I guess that deep down inside I knew that they were right, but I wanted to prove them wrong. I can't go back and face them right now. Nothing good ever happens to me."</p><p>All of a sudden, Draco finds himself in Harry's embrace.</p><p>"It's alright." Harry says. Don't cry over that punkass, douche. You deserve better than him."</p><p>"That's what everyone says, but I always settle for less. I thought that he was different, but I was clearly wrong. When I told him that I was pregnant, he was so happy, but by the end of my pregnancy, he was distance. When she was born, he acted as if she didn't even exist. All he did was cheat on me, drink and did who knows what. I didn't even care taht he cheated on me as I was going to break up with him, but he did that to me in the most shittiest way possible. It sucks that I always find my heart in pieces in the grass because of dumbass people, you know?"</p><p>Harry knows the feeling all too well. Like his friends told him, people only used him for their own beneficial needs. It hurt Harry to know that people would use him just to gain materialistic things instead of loving and having feelings for him.</p><p>"Thank you for being a shoulder to cry on." Draco says. "I'm sorry that I got your shirt wet."</p><p>Harry chuckles.</p><p>"It'll dry, so don't worry."</p><p>Draco smiles as he wipes his tears.</p><p>"Do you have place to stay?"</p><p>"I was actually thinking about going to a hotel since my parents live in Great Britain."</p><p>"Well, why not stay with me instead of a dingy hotel?" Harry asked him.</p><p>Draco looks at him in shock.</p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p>"Yeah, I live in a huge house." Harry said. "You can stay as long as you need to until you are ready to see your parents."</p><p>Draco is fiddling with his hands in hesitation, and Harry can see the wheels in Draco's head turning.</p><p>"I don't want to be a burden, or-"</p><p>"You won't as you're staying with me. The weather is still bad and I don't want you or your baby to get sick."</p><p>Draco takes a relaxing breath.</p><p>"You're really sweet, Potter."</p><p>Harry smiles.</p><p>As Draco was about to say something, whining comes from the stroller and he quickly caters to his baby.</p><p>"Your baby is really adorable." Harry says causing Draco to smile.</p><p>"Thank you. Her name is Victoria." Draco says as his daughter was moving her tiny fists around. "You want to hold her?"</p><p>"Sure." He says holding his arms close as Draco placed his daughter in Harry's arms.</p><p>Harry smiles once he stares at her.</p><p>"Hey, adorable. My name is Harry." He says as he brushed his finger on her fist.</p><p>Victoria smiles at him and in that moment, Harry's heart swells in a way that he's never felt before. He instantly has this urge to protect her at all times.</p><p>"I think she likes you." Draco says handing Harry a bottle for Victoria. "She always gets fussy when someone new holds her for some reason."</p><p>"According to my best friend, I have a knack for kids. I guess they like me or something." Harry says as he shrugs as he starts feeding the baby.</p><p>It's quiet for a moment while Harry is holding baby Victoria.</p><p>"Are you sure you want me to stay with you? I mean I could find somewhere to stay."</p><p>"Of course I want you to stay. I have extra rooms and I want to make sure that you and little Victoria here that you are safe."</p><p>Draco nods as he watches Harry feed Victoria. He noticed that Harry was gentle with his daughter and in that moment he noticed something. Marcus never held their daughter like that, like she was wanted. He only held her when Draco forced him to.</p><p>"I get off in a few minutes, so we'll be leaving in a little but." Harry said a few minutes later when she fell back asleep.</p><p>"Ok." Draco said as Harry handed Victoria back to her father.</p><p>"I'll be back."</p><p>"And I'll get ready."</p><p>As Harry got into the staffroom, Hermione was waiting for him.</p><p>"What happened?" She asked him. "Who is he?"</p><p>"His name is Draco, and his boyfriend left him and their baby girl." Harry said as he's grabbing his coat and his bag. "He needs a place to stay."</p><p>"You are?"</p><p>"Yes, I am. Could you trust me on this?"</p><p>Hermione bits her lip, but nonetheless, she nods her head.</p><p>"Ok. I trust you, but if he does something you don't like, I will punch him in the face and call him a foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach, got it?"</p><p>"Got it." Harry says as he nods his head.</p><p>"Got what?" Neville asked.</p><p>"I have a guest coming home with me."</p><p>Neville's eyes widened.</p><p>"Don't worry." Harry told him. "Besides, he has a baby, so he needs a warm place to stay since his ex walked out on them."</p><p>"Man, that's rough. Well, if you're good and you trust him, then I trust you. Just be very careful, alright?"</p><p>Harry nods.</p><p>"I'll see you later." Harry tells his friends as he leaves the staffroom.</p><p>"I hope he knows what he's doing." Justin says.</p><p>"Me too." Hermione says.</p><p>A moment later, Harry got to the table where Draco was at.</p><p>"Ready to go?"</p><p>"In a moment." Draco said as he was burping his daughter. As he was burping his daughter, Victoria smiled at Harry.</p><p>"Aww, she smiled at me." Harry said.</p><p>Draco smiled.</p><p>"I think she really likes you a lot." Draco says after his daughter released a burp. After he burped, Draco placed he in the stoller, secured a little hat over her head and covered the stroller with a blanker.</p><p>"I like her too." Harry said.</p><p>Draco smiled.</p><p>"I'm ready." Draco said as he grabbed his bag that had both his and his daughter's things.</p><p>"Let's go."</p>
