  <strong> Potter's Picky Potioneer. </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"There should be an investigation into your ballroom-corner-looming, Snape. It's unnaturally bewitching."</p>
<p>Severus snorts at Potter's latest pick-up-line. "That utter tripe eclipses the nonsense about angels you spouted last month, Potter."</p>
<p>"Don't be mean. Took me ages to think that one up."</p>
<p>"Really? Merlin! How do you ever get laid?"</p>
<p>"I don't. The bloke I fancy is impossibly picky."</p>
<p>"Is he?"</p>
<p>"Either that or he's an oblivious prat."</p>
<p>"Maybe he's wary. With flirting that awful, he probably thinks you're jesting." </p>
<p>"I'm not. I-I'm-</p>
<p>"P-utterly smitten?"</p>
<p>Potter blushes adorably. "Y-yeah."</p>
<p>"Seriously?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Oh!"</p>
<p>"Please, Snape-</p>
<p>"Fine! I'm— p-utterly smitten too, Po-er-<em> Harry</em>."</p>
