    <p>Disclaimer: neither Final Fantasy or Harry Potter belong to me, they are the property of their creators.</p><p>	In the Wizarding World blood was everything. Affection could be shared with those not of one's family line, but one's own heir was the most important thing in any wizard's life. Some wizards did differ from the masses and invested a great deal of emotion in people not of their blood, but it was very unusual.</p><p>	Harry Potter was already an oddity in the Wizarding World, and as the 'Saviour of the Light' it was assumed that he loved everyone.</p><p>	Not true.</p><p>	Due to his upbringing he had no desire for such personal bonds. The Dursleys would use such things against him or drive those people away, so why bother with the heartache.</p><p>	Unfortunately, Ron Weasley did not understand this when he stuck to Harry's side like glue in that first year of schooling at Hogwarts. And Hermione Granger adopted this limpet impression after the troll incident. Then Mrs Weasley sent him Christmas presents, and his two tag-a-longs proved themselves useful in the protections/obstacle course hidden on the third floor. By the end of the first year he gave up and accepted the fact that he now had friends. And as with all possessions he had managed to keep in his time at the Dursleys, he protected them zealously.</p><p>	This reluctant response of considering the people who clung to him for a considerable length of time as his, gained him two best friends, a godfather, a pseudo-godfather, a pseudo-family, quidditch teammates, other friends, numerous acquaintances and two demented house elves.</p><p>	Unfortunately this way of thinking had gained him all of the above, whom upon learning his unique parentage had schemed and somehow sent him on a five year long vacation...to another dimension.</p><p>	All of this because Harry had the dubious honour of being descended from the Beaufort Line, courtesy of his mother's mother's mother. The same line that had branched to produce Merlin, King Arthur, Morgana Le Fey, Anne Boleyn, and that crazy witch that disguised herself so she could be burned at the stake several times. It was from this line that his mother came, the only witch nuts enough to be so sure that the Veil of Death led to another dimension – and was created by pacifist witches to escape a dark lord over a millennium ago- that she actually stepped through it.</p><p>	What followed for her was two years of being in the care of Hojo, whom she taunted mercilessly while he drew her blood and injected her with odd substances that her magic got rid of. Her indomitable spirit never once backed down, even when Hojo became terrifying because the President was sending his beloved Project S into battle too early and there was a risk of it being terminated. For a while the scientist had watched her contemplatively, then a new substance was added to her injections, and within three months she was throwing up into the cell's bucket and having odd cravings. The prick had impregnated her!</p><p>	Over the next two months Hojo had gloated that his Project S would live on through her, all the while injecting a glowing green substance he called mako directly into her womb. Still, being from the bonkers line that she was, she had used the energy from the mako – and a ritual circle to focus that energy which she drew in her own blood – to apparate back to her own dimension using her marriage bond to her husband to guide her.</p><p>	Fortunately she had a husband as nuts as she was, who not only believed her when she said that she had been in another dimension – that apparently moved half as fast as her home dimension, because four years had passed for her husband – but was also overjoyed that she was pregnant and happily proclaimed that the child would be his heir. Magic then worked hard to make his statement true, making the child his in magic and searching through the genetic provided by Project S for traits that matched his own.</p><p>	Hence a child that any magic heritage ritual would swear was James Potter's, with the genetics of a psycho witch and a science experiment. Harry blamed this for his faulty survival instinct, his ability to attract any and all trouble within ten miles of himself, and the fact that breaking into Gringotts was the most fun he'd had in his life.</p><p>	And Mr and Mrs Potter had kept it a secret from everyone, so the journals he received with his inheritance on his seventeenth birthday that had belonged to the madwoman who gave birth to him were a bit of a shock. Harry wished he hadn't been so curious about their contents, he also wished that he hadn't shared the contents with his best friends.</p><p>	And voilà...he was in another dimension and stuck here for five years. Unless he completed the out clause one of the asylum dodgers he called family had so helpfully included in the ritual circle that brought him here.</p><p>	Blood was so important to wizards because common blood provided an energy circuit and if he met this Project S and got some of its blood it would recharge the ritual and send him home. The catch: the blood had to be given willingly and used within an hour of it being given. So he'd have to convince Project S to come to the remote location of the ritual circle and willingly let him cut it. In other words, he'd have to spend time with whatever it was. </p><p>	If he was as blood obsessed as his psychotic family was he'd have killed them by now. As it was he wasn't, and so instead he trudged towards Shinra.</p><p>	Joy! Note the sarcasm!</p>
