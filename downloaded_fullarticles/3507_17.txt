  <b>James POV</b>
</p><p>The author brings us back from the dead to write this shit series. They have given me Hagrid's crossbow, saying that I've stolen it while he was asleep-</p><p>
  <b>Remus POV</b>
</p><p>"James, who are you talking to?" I ask, carding through my sandy brown hair-</p><p>
  <b>Sirius POV</b>
</p><p>"hUh?" I ask, flipping my gorgeous ebony black hair while my steel grey eyes glint-</p><p>
  <b>Peter POV</b>
</p><p>"wHAT'S GOING ON??" I scream. I look at the backs of my hands. They are whole again and free from rabies. I touch my nose, previously shot off by Remus' gun in <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/15164888" rel="nofollow"> the previous fic. </a> It is unharmed-</p><p>
  <b>Lily POV</b>
</p><p>"Why am I here?" I ask, combing through my red hair-</p><p>
  <b>Snape POV</b>
</p><p>"Oi, why am I the only person who is referred to their last name in that POV thing?" I ask, disgruntled. Also why the fuck is everybody touching their hair-</p><p>
  <b>Sirius POV</b>
</p><p>"Shut up, Snape."</p><p>
  <b>Remus POV</b>
</p><p>"Yeah, you tell 'im, honey!"</p><p>
  <b>Snape POV</b>
</p><p>"My name is <em> Severus </em>, Wolfstar!" I whip out my bazooka, aiming it at Wolfstar. Then I fire. Potter and Lily gape. And uh... so does the fat one.</p><p>
  <b>Wolfstar POV</b>
</p><p>"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" WE BURN!1!1!1!1!1!!1!!1111</p><p>
  <b>Snape POV</b>
</p><p>“Wolfstar goes down! MUAHAHAHA”</p><p>
  <b>Lily POV</b>
</p><p>“Oh Merlin, Sev! You’ve killed them!” I scream.</p><p>
  <b>Peter POV </b>
</p><p>“Well isn’t that peachy! One of us might actually get to be the last one standing now!” I say.</p><p>
  <b>Lily POV</b>
</p><p>“What do you mean, Peter?”</p><p>
  <b>Peter POV</b>
</p><p>“Haven’t you noticed that in this god-awful series, James always dies first, because I kill him-”</p><p>
  <b>James POV</b>
</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>
  <b>Peter POV </b>
</p><p>“-and then I get creamed by Wolfstar-”</p><p>
  <b>James POV</b>
</p><p>“Wait. What’s a Wolfstar?”</p><p>
  <b>Peter POV</b>
</p><p>“-aND THEN Wolfstar finish each other off.”</p><p>
  <b>Lily POV</b>
</p><p>“No, I just got here!” I say. What is going on?</p><p>
  <b>Snape POV</b>
</p><p>“Black and Lupin have been sleeping with each other since Merlin-knows-when,” I say icily. “Are you that <em> unobservant </em>, Potter?”</p><p>
  <b>Dead Wolfstar POV</b>
</p><p>“We can hear you!”</p><p>
  <b>Lily POV</b>
</p><p>My green emerald eyes snap into attention and I finally realise what’s going on. <em> “You lot have been trying to <u>kill</u> each other!” </em></p><p>
  <b>Snape POV</b>
</p><p>“Of <em> bloody </em>course they have been, Lily!” I say, pained. “These no-good Gryffindors know nothing but destruction-”</p><p>
  <b>James POV</b>
</p><p>No-good Gryffindors? I hate the sound of that. I aim my crossbow and fire.</p><p>
  <em> ThOOOOM! </em>
</p><p>Shoot, I missed. The arrow pierces one of them crimson armchairs.</p><p>
  <b>Snape POV</b>
</p><p>I quickly scatter out of the way. I eye Potter with a look. "What the <em>fuck,</em> Potter!"</p><p>
  <strong>James POV</strong>
</p><p>"<em>All Gryffindors</em>," I seethe, loading another arrow, "<em>are QUEENS!</em>"</p><p>
  <strong>Snape POV</strong>
</p><p>"<em>If they breathe</em>," I seethe back, loading up my bazooka, "<em>they're a tHOOOOOOOOOOOOT!</em>"</p><p>
  <strong>Peter POV</strong>
</p><p>James fires his arrows and Snape shoots whatver it is that comes out of bazookas and they miss each other. The common room, however, gets contiunally destroyed. I take Lily's hand and pull her aside. </p><p>
  <strong>Lily POV</strong>
</p><p>Dust swarms everywhere, so thick that I can't see James or Sev and Remus and Sirius- Wolfstar? Wolfstar's corpses. Peter has grabbed my hand and is pulling me to crouch under a table. I whip out my wand. </p><p>"<em>Reducto!</em>" I shout, as a piece of flaming (literally) red upholstery comes flying in our direction. It explodes into pieces and hammers Sev right in the head. He falls to the floor. I gasp and get up to run over.</p><p>
  <strong>James POV</strong>
</p><p>What's she doing? whAT the fUCK. She's touching the oily hair of that git. Oh Merlin, bits of that sofa are stuck in there. Gross.</p><p>"Evans! Move!" I shout, grabbing three arrows at once and loading them. </p><p>
  <strong>Lily POV</strong>
</p><p>I point my wand in between his eyes. "<em>You bloody menace</em>," I seethe. "He's my friend!" </p><p>Perhaps I'm a little scared of his arrows- after all, I am standing right in front of him- </p><p>
  <strong>James POV</strong>
</p><p>"Evans, don't you see?" I plead. My arms are hurting from holding this heavy bow. "He said <em>all</em> Gryffindors are thots!"</p><p>
  <strong>Lily POV</strong>
</p><p>"I don't understand the meaning of that word!"</p><p>
  <strong>James POV</strong>
</p><p>"It means hoes!"</p><p>
  <strong>Lily POV </strong>
</p><p>My eyes widen in shock and horror. I look at him in shock. I am in so much shock, my wand drops to my side. </p><p>"Sev! Is that true?"</p><p>
  <strong>Snape POV</strong>
</p><p>"You're different!" I say quickly. Merlin, I'll never get to bang her now. I grab my bazooka and aim it as Potter. "This motherfucker, however-"</p><p>
  <strong>James POV</strong>
</p><p>"Oh please, you can't kill me!" I say, running a somehow free hand through my hot messy hair. "I'm a bad bitch!"</p><p>I look at Evans, who is swinging her wand, once at me, the next at Snivellus, having doubts about who to hex.</p><p>
  <strong>Lily POV</strong>
</p><p>Oh Merlin-</p><p>
  <strong>Snape POV</strong>
</p><p>I fire my bazooka. Potter dodges and runs as the projectile I fired explodes into the wall behind him. </p><p>
  <strong>James POV</strong>
</p><p>"Hahahaha!" I laugh. "I told you I was invincibl-"</p><p>
  <strong>Lily POV</strong>
</p><p>Potter drops dead. Out of the dust emerges a deathly pale figure with ebony black hair all over his face, obscuring his eyes. Oh shit, it's.... <em>Sirius??</em></p><p>
  <strong>Sirius POV</strong>
</p><p>"Take that, you oily git!" I laugh, as his stupid body drops to the floor, blood leaking out of his throat which I have just slit.</p><p>Then his hand suddenly drops, and a <em>crossbow</em> hits my feet. His head lolls and I see the glint of<em> glasses</em>. OH FUCK I KILLED JAMES-</p><p>
  <strong>Lily POV</strong>
</p><p>"Sirius, what the fuck!" I yell! "You just killed your best friend!"</p><p>Sirius has a dagger in his hand, and Potter has a huge bloody slit in his throat. </p><p>
  <strong>Sirius POV</strong>
</p><p>"No, no, NOOOOOO!!!!!" I screech, "No James, don't be dead, I thought you were Snape,<em> oh James!"  </em>I cradle his head. The slit is so deep that his head snaps off in my hands. I scream and so does Lily, who gags. I can hear Snape gagging as well.</p><p>
  <strong>Snape POV</strong>
</p><p>I throw up all over this Gryffindor carpet. </p><p>
  <strong>Sirius POV</strong>
</p><p>I hope Remus doesn't see me like this.</p><p>
  <strong>Remus POV</strong>
</p><p>I come back from the dead. I see James' head (literally) in Sirius' blood stained hands. I gag and throw up. Sirius turns and sees me, alarmed-</p><p>
  <strong>Lily POV</strong>
</p><p>"Wait wait wait," I say, my brain kicking into gear. I point at Wolfstar. "<em>Didn't you two die</em>??"</p><p>
  <strong>Sirius POV</strong>
</p><p>"That's just what the books want you to think!" I say, tears pouring out of my eyes. </p><p>
  <strong>Remus POV</strong>
</p><p><em>"</em>This is a<em> crack fic</em>, Lils," I say expositorily. "Logic doesn't exist here, and in the Harry Potter fandom, neither does canon."</p><p>
  <strong>Lily POV</strong>
</p><p>"hUH? What the-who's Harry Potter?"</p><p>
  <strong>Remus POV</strong>
</p><p>"Hell if I know! Right now is the MWPP era!" I cock my trusty ol' revolver and aim it at Snape. "<em>You're goin' down!</em>"</p><p>
  <strong>Snape POV</strong>
</p><p>The werewolf has a gun in my face. I smirk and aim my bazooka in his face as well. "You first!"</p><p>
  <strong>Remus POV</strong>
</p><p>Suddenly, there is a shout of "<em>Avada Kedavra</em>". Snape drops dead, bazooka at his feet. I am stunned. I look behind me and see <em>Peter</em>, tears lining his cheeks and his wand in his hand. </p><p>"Holy shit! Peter!" I yell, having completely forgotten about his existence for who-knows-how-many-lines. </p><p>
  <strong>Peter POV</strong>
</p><p>I am so sick of you all writing me out of Marauder fics. I am valid, dammit!</p><p>"I hate you all!" I scream!</p><p>
  <strong>Sirius POV</strong>
</p><p>I flip my gorgeous hair again. Peter looks angry. "Why? Because people like us better than you? Honestly, Pete-" </p><p>Peter shoots another killing curse. It narrowly misses me, and strikes an armchair behind us instead. I sit back up in shock, brandishing my dagger. </p><p>"Oh, honestly!"</p><p>
  <strong>Peter POV</strong>
</p><p>Remus' revolver barrel is on my temple. "What are you playing at, Petey?" he asks. "You hate us all, do you-"</p><p>He gasps when I stick my wand against his chest. "<em>Yes,</em>" I seethe. "<em><u>All</u> of you can go to hell</em>-"</p><p>
  <strong>Remus POV</strong>
</p><p>Another shout of the Killing Curse. The green light is so close to me, that I freeze. But I do not topple, and the light remains in my eyes. Peter, however, drops face-down onto the dusty carpet. I look up and I see Lily, her wand out. She is shaking. I see how this is going to be. </p><p>
  <strong>Lily POV</strong>
</p><p>Sirius and Remus both take out their wands and stand opposite me. </p><p>"Evans," says Sirius, slowly. "Put down your wand."</p><p>"You put down yours!" I shout back. </p><p>"No, just lower it," says Remus calmly. His head turns to the portrait hole with actual multiple holes in it. "And then run."</p><p>I sneak a quick glance of James and his detatched head, and Sev's corpse. Sev's wand has fallen out of his robes. I bend down, arms up.</p><p>
  <strong>Sirius POV</strong>
</p><p>She's actually doing it. She bends down, hovering her own wand just above the debris of carpet, and-</p><p>SHE PICKS UP ANOTHER WAND AND AIMS BOTH-</p><p>"<em>AVADA KEDAVRA!</em>"</p><p>
  <strong>Wolfstar POV</strong>
</p><p>Dead.</p><p>
  <strong>Lily POV</strong>
</p><p>As I stare at their four bodies, my red hair somehow fluttering despite the closed windows, I realise that it is-</p><p>The End. </p><p> </p></div>
