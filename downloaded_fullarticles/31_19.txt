    <p>Hermione sat on the plush seats outside the Minister for Magic's office. She wasn't sure why she'd been summoned, especially since she'd had a meeting with Kingsley just yesterday about the latest bill she was trying to push through about Werewolf rights, so she was even more confused when Harry turned up a few minutes later, looking harried.</p><p>"You too?" he asked, sitting down heavily beside her and stifling a yawn.</p><p>“I suppose so, do you know what this is about?”</p><p>“No, I thought it might be about the case I’m working at the moment, but I don’t see why he’d need you to be here if it was that.”</p><p>“Hmm, is it anything to do with werewolves?”</p><p>“No, why?”</p><p>“Just what I’m working on at the moment,” she shrugged, “Might’ve needed us to work together on something?”</p><p>“Maybe,” he said, sounding unconvinced as he yawned again, not trying to hide it this time. She smiled. All these years in a nine to five job and he still hadn’t got used to it, although it probably didn’t help that aurors tended to get dragged out to work at stupid hours on a fairly regular basis.</p><p>“Well, what do you-”</p><p>“Mr Potter, Ms Granger? The Minister is ready to see you.”</p><p>They exchanged a look and entered the office. She wasn’t sure why, but Hermione was beginning to have a bad feeling about this.</p><p>***</p><p>“Ah, good morning, Ms Granger, Mr Potter.”</p><p>“Morning,”</p><p>“Morning, Minister,”</p><p>“Sit, please,” His voice was steady and he looked as friendly as ever, though he was a fairly taciturn man in general. “Did your bill get submitted without incident yesterday?”</p><p>“Er, yes, I submitted it to the Wizengamot after our meeting,”</p><p>“Excellent, and Mr Potter, how goes the Morrison case?”</p><p>“Good, it’s moving along.” Harry spoke slowly, as if he was trying to figure something out, “Would you like the monthly report early, sir?”</p><p>“No, no, that won’t be necessary,” Kingsley waved his concerns aside casually, and now Hermione was really suspicious, there was a look in his eye that made her feel horribly like she was about to be roped into something. It seemed that Harry had the same idea, because despite the fact that he was sitting in front of the leader of wizarding Britain, his eyes were narrowed in an expression that she recognised all too well from their school days. It was the look he got right before he was about to yell at a teacher, or hex someone, or do something else that was equally stupid and impulsive.</p><p>“Sir, why-?” She began, trying to resolve whatever this was before Harry made an idiot out of himself. Again. Not that he wouldn’t get away with it, of course, but she’d rather not be involved in an open confrontation with the Minister for Magic if she could avoid it. Thankfully, Kingsley cut her off before she could finish her question.</p><p>“Yes, I apologise for my vagueness in asking you both here. You’re aware of the Muggle Society Integration Program?”</p><p>It was a statement rather than a question, but Hermione had never quite grown out of the compulsion to be the first to answer.</p><p>“It’s designed to help pure-blood wizard and witches overcome ignorant and damaging beliefs about muggles by shadowing a ministry agent who works within the muggle world, therefore normalising the muggle world and showing that muggles are different but not lesser.” She recited.</p><p>“Impeccable as always,” said Kingsley, to which Harry snorted shamelessly.</p><p>“But what does this have to do with us?” she asked, ignoring Harry’s smirk.</p><p>“Well, are you aware that many of the participants in the Program are enrolled as part of their- ah- rehabilitation?”</p><p>Harry snorted again, this time with no trace of humour.</p><p>“And by rehabilitation, you mean that they’re trying to make up for coming down on the wrong side of the war?” He said derisively.</p><p>“Those who were, as you so bluntly put, ‘on the wrong side’, have been punished accordingly, I believe you yourself were present at many of the trials, Mr Potter.”</p><p>“So what, these are the ones who weren’t quite bad enough for Azkaban? The ones who plotted away and hoped for Voldemort’s victory but didn’t get the tattoo, so they get a day trip to London instead?”</p><p>“Harry!” she raised her eyebrows at him and lightly touched his arm, which seemed to calm him a little. For the most part, they had moved on from the war, but the prevalence of pure-blood ideology, even after everything that had transpired, was a sore spot for all of them. It wasn’t the sort of thing to just melt away overnight, and even though the atrocities committed by Voldemort and his followers were almost universally viewed as repulsive, there were pockets of the pure-blood aristocracy who might not have dark marks, might not have actually <em>fought</em>, but nonetheless had been firmly on- as Harry put it- the wrong side. She couldn’t deny that it deeply disturbed her too, but all she could really do at the moment is focus on making things better, on making sure something like that never happened again. The Muggle Society Integration Program wasn’t exactly a miracle cure, but it was a start.</p><p>“Sorry Sir,” muttered Harry, “It just- it still bothers me sometimes.”</p><p>“I understand,” said Kingsley levelly, regarding them both with an almost Dumbledore-ish expression of amused interest on his usually impassive face. “Believe me, it bothers me too, but I honestly believe that this is a step in the right direction.”</p><p>“So wait, why are we here?”</p><p>“Well, as I was saying, many of those who were, let us say working in shades of grey, during the war, have committed to participating in this program, many of them as a condition of their freedom.”</p><p>Oh, she was really starting to get a bad feeling about this.</p><p>“Now, I know the Program is typically conducted by a member of the Muggle Liaison Office, or occasionally Magical Law Enforcement, but given the uh, unique situation here, I felt it may be prudent to enlist a more experienced liaison.”</p><p>“The unique situation?” she asked weakly.</p><p>He didn’t reply, merely slid a file over the desk towards them. Clipped to the front was a rather unflattering mugshot of an unpleasantly familiar face.</p><p>“NO.” Harry said resolutely, as Hermione sat slack jawed next to him.</p><p>“Now, just-”</p><p>“NO.”</p><p>“<em>Him?</em>” she managed.</p><p>“Now, Mr Potter, Ms Granger, I know that-”</p><p>“You cannot be serious.”</p><p>“I am entirely serious, it is a condition of his rehabilitation and subsequent freedom. Now, I know you have a history with-”</p><p>“So, let me get this straight,” said Harry, pinching the bridge of his nose under his glasses, “You want us to take <em>Draco Malfoy</em>- Draco <em>fucking</em> Malfoy- around London on some sort of <em>muggle tour</em>? Have you <em>met</em> Malfoy?”</p><p>“Firstly, yes I have met Malfoy.” Said Kingsley, eyebrow quirked at Harry’s outburst, “As recently as last week in fact, and while I admit he is hardly the most affable wizard, I have no reason to think he does not regret his role in the war. In fact I believe he regrets it deeply.”</p><p>“Yeah right,” scoffed Harry, but Kingsley silenced him with a look.</p><p>“And secondly, I do not expect you both to manage Malfoy’s participation in the Program-”</p><p>“Well that’s a relief-”</p><p>“- actually, I only need one of you.”</p><p>“What?!” they both exclaimed.</p><p>“Now I don’t mind how you decide, but-”</p><p>“But why do you need us at all?” asked Hermione pleadingly, “We’re hardly his biggest fans, why can’t someone more neutral from Muggle Liaisons-”</p><p>“Yeah!” interrupted Harry, “Isn’t this stuff <em>literally </em>their job?”</p><p>To her surprise, Kingsley sighed, looking tired.</p><p>“I understand your resistance to the idea, I do.” He said, “But the short answer to your question is: I need one of you to do it because Malfoy is a handful. He might regret his role in the war, but he’s still arrogant and headstrong, and there are few that I would trust to neither rise to his taunting nor be intimidated by him.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, you do know that Hermione punched him in the face right?”</p><p>“Harry!”</p><p>“I’m aware,” said Kingsley steadily, but his mouth twitched slightly.</p><p>“You’re hardly a shining example of ‘not rising to Malfoy’s shit’ either…” she huffed petulantly.</p><p>“I take it that’s why Ron’s not here?” asked Harry with a small smile. Hermione couldn’t help but smile back, thinking of the unmitigated disaster <em>that</em> would be.</p><p>“I admit Mr Weasley doesn’t have the best record of keeping his temper where Mr Malfoy is concerned, but ultimately, he isn’t here because he too, is pureblood. I daresay he wouldn’t be of a great deal of use in navigating muggle London, whereas the two of you grew up with muggles, and thus, we circle back to the purpose of this meeting.”</p><p>Harry grunted his assent and folded his arms, while Hermione simply sat in astonishment.</p><p>“But, what about-?”</p><p>“Your work? The Wizengamot will debate your bill for at least a month, and it’ll only be a week or so delay to the start of your next project. As for the Morrison case, should Mr Potter decide to take on the responsibility I will explain the situation to the Senior Auror myself.”</p><p>“But-”</p><p>“I’m afraid that’s all there is to say, Mr Potter, Ms Granger,”</p><p>“That’s-”</p><p>“Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a great deal of work to get through before my next meeting, please send me a memo when you’ve decided which one of you will be taking on the project.”</p><p>He flicked his wand and the door behind them opened. The meeting was over, whether they liked it or not. She nodded curtly and stood up to leave, dragging Harry out behind her before he had a chance to start an argument. The door clicked shut behind them, and they were left standing dumbstruck in the waiting room.</p><p>“You know, it’d be really wonderful if just once you could try and refrain from picking a fight with the Minister for Magic.” She said after a minute, nudging his shoulder affectionately.</p><p>“What even <em>was</em> that?” he blurted out, “How can he just- Why can’t- Ugh. It’s too early in the morning for this.”</p><p>“Come on, let’s get some coffee and figure this out, since apparently this madness is priority number one now.”</p><p>***</p><p>Half an hour later, they sat down in an empty conference room in Magical Law Enforcement, two steaming mugs of coffee between them. Hermione had considered going out to the trendy muggle coffee shop down the road, but they had both decided that the current situation needed rather heavier ordnance. The coffee in Magical Law Enforcement was something of a legend, since what it lacked in palatability it made up tenfold in nosebleed-inducing strength. Ironically, it was probably illegal, but no one was willing to risk the inevitable riot that would ensue upon depriving the aurors of their caffeine.</p><p>Hermione took a tentative sip and wrinkled her nose, reaching over to put yet another packet of sugar in. Harry took a large gulp and too his credit, only spluttered a little as he swallowed. Still, she felt the effects almost immediately, this stuff really was pure rocket fuel, no wonder the aurors manage to pull the crazy shifts they did without having regular mental breakdowns, though she worried slightly for the state of their stomach linings, not to mention their tastebuds.</p><p>“So,” said Harry flatly, already halfway through his mug.</p><p>“So.” She echoed, folding her hands in front of her and staring him down. They sat like that for several minutes in silence, until Harry smirked and finished his mug.</p><p>“You would have made a great auror, Hermione,” he laughed, “That’s one hell of a poker face.”</p><p>“Of course I would have,” she sniffed haughtily, “But flattery will get you nowhere, Potter.” She tried and failed to take a delicate sip of the foul coffee, grimacing as it burned her throat.</p><p>“Well, I’ve still got open cases, it’s all hands on deck for the Morrison case, at least you’ve got a natural break-”</p><p>“Don’t give me that, Harry, you know as well as I do we’ve got half a dozen projects on the boil at any one time,”</p><p>“Well then if it’s always like that, it’s no worse time than any other!”</p><p>“Oh come on, that’s utter rubbish-”</p><p>“Whereas this is crucial point in our investigation-”</p><p>“Please, Ron told me it’ll be at least another few weeks of stakeouts and surveillance until you’ve got anything actionable.”</p><p>“What? You’re talking to Ron, since when?” </p><p>“We had coffee last week,” she said, blushing slightly, “He wanted to tell me in person about him and Susan, as if I wasn’t already aware…” she added under her breath.</p><p>“As if everyone in a hundred mile radius wasn’t already aware,” said Harry, rolling his eyes and grinning knowingly, Ron and Susan hadn’t exactly been subtle in their recent tryst, but she was happy for him all the same. She was also extremely glad that the awkward semi-silence between them since their breakup last year had finally been broken. They had made small talk at events and outings, but last week was the first time in far too long they had actually sat and talked like old times, before everything got messy and broken. She hoped it would continue.</p><p>“Yeah, it’s fine though, it’s been nearly a year for god’s sake,”</p><p>“Yeah, but still,”</p><p>“Yes, well. It was nice of him to reach out and tell me in person, maybe it’ll be a bit less awkward when I visit now.”</p><p>“We can but hope,” he grinned, taking another gulp of coffee, “And speaking of awkward things-”</p><p>“Urgh-”</p><p>“Come on, Hermione, I’m just hitting my stride as an auror, I don’t want to ruin it by going to Azkaban for <em>murdering Malfoy</em>.”</p><p>“Oh don’t be ridiculous-”</p><p>“It’s me and Ginny’s anniversary next week, why ruin an otherwise lovely occasion?”</p><p>“Low blow, Harry. Don’t bring Ginny into this-”</p><p>“I won’t have to murder him if he ruins our anniversary, because <em>she’ll do it first,</em>”</p><p>“I mean, you’re not wrong,” she conceded with a small smile at the thought of Ginny’s rage, which was always entertaining when it wasn’t aimed at you. “But still, you really think she’ll be better off having to come home every day to my mood after a day out with Malfoy?”</p><p>“Fair point, but she could stay with us-”</p><p>“No way. That’s so unfair!”</p><p>“But I reeeaallly hate him, Hermione,” he wheedled, drawing a reluctant grin from her.</p><p>“And I’m sure the feeling is mutual. For both of us.”</p><p>“Ugh, this is the worst thing I’ve had to do since I started here, and that includes that one time Ron and I had to dig through a muggle landfill to find that cursed lamp.”</p><p>“You think it’ll be better for me? I’m sure he’ll be just delighted to find out his least favourite mudblood is the one showing him around,”</p><p>There was a beat of silence as they both contemplated their potential fates.</p><p>“Only one thing for it then,” said Harry, rooting around in his pocket and pulling out a fifty pence piece. “Flip for it? Seems only right to use a muggle coin.”</p><p>“Well, at least it’s fair,” she said hesitantly, “Heads or tails?”</p><p>“Heads, you take him, Tails I do. Winner buys loser an unholy amount of alcohol at the end of the week.”</p><p>“Fine, fine. Let’s go.”</p><p>Grinning a little nervously, Harry balanced the coin on his thumb and flicked it high into the air, where it spun for a second. He caught it and slapped it down on the back of his hand. When he revealed it, the Queen’s head glinted up at her. <em>Shit.</em></p><p>“Shit.”</p><p>“Well, Hermione, looks like you’ve got a busy week ahead of you,” Harry gloated, a smug grin plastered over his face.</p><p>“Shut up, Harry.”</p><p>“Try not to punch him in the face again, or do. Either works for me.”</p><p>“Ugh.”</p>
