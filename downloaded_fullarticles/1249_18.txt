          <div class="userstuff"><p>Hello all! Sorry this isn't an actual story, but I just wanted to say a few things. I've read a lot of stuff on this site, and a lot of it is absolutely amazing! I figured I would give this whole writing thing a try. I can't promise that I'll update regularly, or even finish a story, because my mind goes a million miles an hour and I can't stay focused on one thing for very long. I hope to come back to any unfinished works I have and finish them, but no guarantees. </p>
<p>I also don't mind people helping me with my writing, but I won't stand for people who will bash on my writing for the hell of it. I love appreciative comments, and will try my best to respond to as many as I can.</p>
<p>With that being said, I hope others enjoy what I write and possibly inspire some other people to give writing a try!</p></div>
