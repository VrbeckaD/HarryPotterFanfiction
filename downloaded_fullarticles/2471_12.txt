    <p>It was already late in the evening, when suddenly some figures appeared out of nowhere on the sparsely lit street. The unexpected appearance of this group was not the only unusual thing, however; their clothes also seemed quite strange. Had they been noticed, some might have thought they were on their way to a costume party and others might have just wondered about the strange fashion taste of some people. But fortunately, no one was around to ask questions. This was because there was nothing nearby, at least nothing that would make anyone come to this place. The only thing that marked the road was an old house that was already past its peak. Most of the windows were broken or poorly locked with wooden planks, in the garden the weed proliferated and a huge hole gaped in the roof of the house.</p><p>While four of the people slowly made their way towards the building, the youngest of them stopped and looked around curiously. The young girl tried to grasp everything around her, from the run-down house, to the gnarled trees on the opposite meadow, to the church tower of the nearest village, and with every movement of her head her blond curls jumped around her face. Her gaze also wandered towards the night sky, where the stars were already sparkling. A particularly brightly shining star had taken full advantage of her attention, so that she did not even notice how her family was moving further and further away. Only when she heard someone calling her name could she avert her gaze and realize that there was only one person left. She hurriedly ran to the woman waiting impatiently for her.</p><p>"Marlene, I've told you a thousand times that you shouldn't dawdle like this."</p><p>"Sorry, Mom, but..."</p><p>"No buts! Now hurry up, the others are waiting."</p><p>She took the child by the hand and took another step towards the house. Suddenly they no longer stood in front of a run-down house, but in front of a magnificent building that could have been the manor of a noble family. It was as if they had stepped through a magical wall that only now gave them a view of the huge estate. Marlene's father and her brothers, who had only just crossed the magic shortly before, were now also visible again and were already waiting for the two women to finally go inside the building. A stern look from her father revealed to Marlene that he was not particularly enthusiastic about her dawdling either, but he quickly turned away from her again and turned his attention to the front door in front of him. Even before he had the chance to knock, the door opened by itself. On closer inspection, however, it became clear that this was not due to another spell, but rather to a house-elf bowing deeply and asking the McKinnons in with a hand gesture. While her parents and brothers simply entered without looking at her again, Marlene smiled at the creature, which was only a few centimetres smaller than herself, and then ran after her family. </p><p>Only a few moments later they were already standing in the middle of a large room filled with cheerfully entertaining people. It didn't take two seconds before a lady, who probably wanted to distract from the wrinkles in her face and grey hair with a lot of jewellery, approached them. She liked the lady with the jewellery, after all, it was her grandmother. A brief glance towards her mother assured the young girl, however, that she had hoped to avoid this encounter for a while, despite the smile on her face. Marlene had never understood why they didn't get along, but she was too happy and excited to think about it that night.</p><p>"Mother, I had been wondering how long it would take you to find us, even though I had frankly hoped to find some alcohol before," even if it would seem like a little teasing to outsiders, everyone involved knew that there was a spark of truth in Marlene's father's statement.</p><p>"I am glad to see you again, Niklas. And of course I'm happy to see my wonderful grandchildren again," she just went on without paying any further attention to his comment - or his wife. "You've all grown so big, I can hardly remember the last time I saw you. I'm sure it wouldn't be so long ago if your father would let me hear from him now and then. Merlin's beard, Kagan, don't just stand there crooked and Cole take your hands out of your trouser pocket. You're not toddlers anymore, even your sister behaves better than you two. Where's Nicolai anyway?"</p><p>The absence of the eldest son of the McKinnon’s prompted her to end her torrent of words earlier than usual. For a moment nobody answered, because nobody had expected that she would stop talking right now, because if Anichka McKinnon was good at one thing, it was never-ending babbling, preferably by criticizing others. However Marlene’s father answered for them.</p><p>"He can't come today, he has to take care of…important things."</p><p>"Important things? This is his aunt's engagement party. What's so important? Niklas, your sister is 35 and has only now finally managed to find a decent man and you want to tell me that your son does not manage to come to this incredibly significant event?"</p><p>"Significant for you, mother. "Be glad that he can at least come to the wedding and now please excuse us, we would also like to talk to the other guests."</p><p>Without waiting for an answer, he passed her, closely followed by his family. It did not take long before the two boys found an excuse to part with the small group, so that Marlene was now alone with her parents. Her previous excitement dwindled more and more. Bored, she tried to listen to the adults conversations, but rarely understood what was at stake. Tiredness also began to take over, but whether this was a consequence of boredom or due to how late it was already being not entirely clear. But Marlene didn't seem to be the only one who was feeling like this. In the room next door, a black-haired, obviously extremely bored boy was busy getting on his mother's nerves. </p><p>"Mom? Mother? Mom? Moooom?"</p><p>"Sirius, be quiet! People are starting to stare at us."</p><p>"But I'm bored. Why did I even have to go?"</p><p>"Sirius Orion Black, for the last time, stop asking stupid questions, be quiet and just once in your life act like a normal wizard."</p><p>Reluctantly, the boy fell silent. He knew there would be bad consequences if he disturbed his mother any longer. His gaze wandered through the room hoping to discover something interesting, unfortunately in vain. For what felt like an eternity he stood only with his parents, wobbled restlessly back and forth on the spot and continued to observe the people in the room. He had completely blocked out his parents, so that he didn't even notice how their conversation partners came and went. However, when he turned his attention back to his parents after a while, they were just immersed in a conversation with another witch.</p><p>"I was against it from the beginning, but he's such a stubborn guy. You're lucky your two boys are still so young."</p><p>"I really don't understand what your problem is, Orlena. It's a great opportunity for him, and we all know it's the only right thing to do."</p><p>"The only right thing? Don't you think that's a little extreme? Just remember what happened to Iliana."</p><p>"None of us know exactly what happened back then. You should stop listening to such stupid rumours."</p><p>Since he had nothing better to do anyway, Sirius tried to follow the conversation somehow, but no matter how hard he tried, he had no idea what they were talking about. What struck him, however, was the tension of both women while they were talking about this topic. It was like they both wanted to say something, but nobody dared to say it. Before the two could continue their conversation, a man came up, Sirius suspected that it was the woman's husband, and whispered something to her. Thereupon the woman turned again to Walburga to tell her that something had happened and that she would have to leave now. Sirius could not understand exactly what had happened, since something else had already claimed his attention. Behind the man, a little blonde girl, about Sirius' age, who had previously been hidden behind her father, stepped forward. She smiled at him briefly before her mother pushed her gently towards the exit.</p><p>Both of them knew at that time that they would meet again eventually, even if it was not clear when exactly. But neither of them could have imagined what the future would hold for them.</p>
