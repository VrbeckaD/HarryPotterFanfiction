    <p>Remus sat up groggily in bed, looking around as a few stray blond curls fell onto his face, him brushing them away as he glanced at his husband, who still slept silently next to him, his arms wrapped around Remus' waist, the sun lighting the other man up perfectly.</p>
<p>Remus felt a smile spread across his freckled face, a sigh slipping from his lips once he glanced at the grandfather clock, reading the "11:32," in roman numerals. He despised waking up late, and he knew, despite how much Sirius enjoyed it, he would have to wake him. Just because it was summer, doesn't give them an excuse to slack. </p>
<p>He peeled the others arms off of him, shaking him lightly as his name escaped his lips softly.</p>
<p>"Sirius, dear wake up." </p>
<p>His voice was a soft mumble, as Sirius groaned, his eyes slowly opening as he looked up at him.</p>
<p>"I was having the most amazing dream, why'd you wa-" He was cut off by a loud crash from the kitchen, followed by a soft squeal, both of them scampering up quickly, Sirius quickly pulling on pants as the rushed out, only to be greeted by a dark skinned girl, on a stool, shaking as shattered glass laid on the floor.</p>
<p>The two men looked at each other quickly, before nodding, both running off to get shoes, Sirius picking up the girl on the stool once he had shoes on, Remus sweeping up the glass with a broom, the small girl clinging to Sirius until he set her down, Remus making sure there was no glass. </p>
<p>"Well, that's a fun way to start a Saturday." Sirius chuckled, Remus letting out a sigh, before glancing over at the girl.</p>
<p>"Now why did you decide to make that the way to start your eleventh birthday?" He shook his head, "go get dressed love, Sirius, help me get ready for breakfast." Remus ordered, both complying, as the girl rushed off, Sirius grabbed some ingredients for french toast, him and Remus preparing it as the girl slipped into a skirt that went to her knees, along with white socks, and a bronze sweater with a black dog on it that Sirius got for her, her skipping out, calling that she would go check the mail as she slipped on black flats, stepping out into the warm late summer air, and out to their small mailbox, grabbing the bundle of letters before rushing back in, looking over them, and spotting one very peculiar, it had yellow-ish paper, with a very classy looking wax emblem snapping it shut. </p>
<p>As she made her way back to the kitchen, she called out to her two fathers.</p>
<p>"Papa, daddy, what's 'Hogwarts?'"</p>
<p>Both men stopped, dropping everything in their hands and rushing over, taking the letter, and quickly opening it, reading over it, as grins formed on their faces, Remus dropping the letter, Sirius and them hugging each other, the girl leaning down and reading the letter, well, skimming over it, she knew her two dads were wizards, but from what she read, she was too. She walked over, setting the letter down before tapping on Remus' shoulder.</p>
<p>"Daddy, isn't that the school you teach at?" She asked curiously, Remus nodding quickly. "I get to be there for you, my dear Lin!" He hugged her, she giggling, Sirius perking up instantly. "We must get your supplies after breakfast, your term starts in a week!" Sirius chirped, rushing back over and finishing the preparations for breakfast.</p>
