  <b>Prologue</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This has to be the most half-baked plan of the century.” A dark-haired witch said as she dropped down next to her two best friends and slammed the newest edition of </span>
  <em>
    <span>Magic Magazine</span>
  </em>
  <span> onto the oak wooden table.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I think my parents still win that prize, Sam. I mean, it’s not every day your folks construct a magical portal to the Astral plane and turn you into a Spirit in the process.” Danny drawled lazily as he took a bite from his scrambled eggs, that he washed down with some pumpkin juice.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Failed Dark magic and maimed Technomancy aside, what is it that got you so worked up, Sam?” Tucker, a cocoa-skinned boy and her other best friend, asked as he eyed the parchment in front of him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You know what I meant, Danny.” She waved her hand in a dismissive gesture. “Have guys heard of the Triwizard tournament?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Danny looked thoughtful for a second before nodding his head. “Wasn’t that the team up of Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, they compete for this Cup thing and a money prize, don’t they? I honestly don’t see why anyone would compete for something like that. Wasn’t it abolished, though? I thought I read somewhere that they quit after the death toll got too high.” Tucker grimaced at the thought, but not for long and stuffed a sausage in his mouth.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sam huffed at the obvious display of carnivory but continued. “It was, but they decided to bring it back again this year. With new rules and more safety nets, to assure that nothing goes wrong.” She paused and tapped her wand to the parchment. “They also decided that instead of just bringing it back, they needed to spice things up. This year, Hogwarts is going to host the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Tetrawizard</span>
  </em>
  <span> Tournament.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Danny let out a small laugh. “What poor bastards did they manage to rope into this?” He snickered.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tucker nudged the boy beside him and pointed at the headline.</span>
</p>
<p>

    <em>New Tetrawizard Tournament Forges Bonds Overseas. Casper Institute of Magic Agrees To Compete!</em>

</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh.” He finished lamely. “We are.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>.o0o.o0o.o0o.</b>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“We’re doing </span>
  <em>
    <span>what</span>
  </em>
  <span> now?” Harry asked with a raise of his eyebrow.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hogwarts will be hosting the Tetrawizard tournament, this year. A variation of the Triwizard tournament that used to be held between us, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang.” Hermione said, swiping a bit of hair behind her ear.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And this caught your attention </span>
  <em>
    <span>why</span>
  </em>
  <span> exactly?” Ron didn’t even look up from his plate and continued to shuffle food in his mouth.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Because,” She leaned in close and softly whispered. “the Casper Institute of Magic will be competing as the fourth school.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ron’s fork froze halfway to his mouth, and the redhead noticeably paled. “You have to be kidding, right? Dumbledore isn’t barmy enough to invite </span>
  <em>
    <span>Casper</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry, who seemed to be missing a key piece of information, frowned before asking. “What’s so special about Casper?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Looking back and forth, and quickly glancing at the Slytherin table, Ron also leaned in closer. “My mum’s told me all about Casper. Dangerous lot, they are. They practise the Dark Arts like it’s nothing. Don’t even bat an eye at some of the truly horrible stuff like Necromancy.” He shuddered for a moment.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course, that’s not all they’re known for.” Hermione scolded. “Casper is one of a kind, because it tests the children at age eleven, to see what affinity they’ve got. Light, Dark or Grey. Each affinity has their own set of classes and specialised career branches. Such as Necromancy, but also Light Arts, like Alchemy.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wait a minute? What do you mean with affinity? I haven’t heard that before.” Harry asked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, of course. Sometimes I forget you didn’t grow up with magic folk.” Ron managed to say in between chewing his chicken. “Magic has three main branches. Light, Dark and Grey. Here at Hogwarts we only teach Light Arts and defence against the Dark Arts. Maybe a few Light bordering on Grey spells will filter through, but that’s it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“This is also the reason that You-Know-Who was able to get so many followers. He attracted a lot of Grey and Dark witches and wizards because they were allowed to use the Dark Arts.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry hummed in thought. “Wouldn’t it make sense for a person with a Dark affinity to practise the Dark Arts, though? It sounds reasonable to me.” He said with a small shrug.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But that’s the thing, Harry. The Dark Arts have the highest collection of curses, hexes, jinxes and lethal spells. You can even risk addiction to the Dark. You have to be very responsible to practise it.” Hermione cut in.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay, I get that. But why what if someone has a Dark affinity, and does Light magic?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“They can, it’s just not as powerful as when a Light witch or wizard would do it. I believe it’s also more difficult.” Ron pushed his plate away and grinned happily at the satisfaction of a full stomach.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Then I have another question for you, Hermione,” Harry said.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What’s the Triwizard Tournament?”</span>
