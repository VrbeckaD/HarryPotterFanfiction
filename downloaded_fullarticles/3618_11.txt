    <p>Albus often thinks that if he had been born into another family, even into another <em>branch</em> of his family, he might have stood a halfway decent shot at coming out sane.</p><p>Unluckily for him, he hadn’t been, so when his big brother James crashes through the door of his flat, clutching a beer bottle like it’s his baby, Al only manages to heave a long, deep sigh before switching on the part of his brain best-equipped to deal with James Sirius Potter and heading out to greet him.</p><p>“Yo, Al,” says James upon seeing him, his eyes hazy with alcohol and his feet swaying. “You shouldn’t leave your door unlocked.”</p><p>At least he’s not yet at the slurring stage. Although James can handle his alcohol pretty well, even though he’s short, he’s got muscles and a long history of drinking, so it takes a lot for him to get super drunk. Al would probably classify him as half-drunk at the moment. He’s got a black eye blooming which means he’s probably just been in a fight.</p><p>“I don’t,” Al answers and takes his brother’s arm, hauling him over to the couch in their living room. It’s more of a joint living room and study, used mostly by him since god knows what Scorpius does at work but it clearly doesn’t require an office at home. “You just know the password.”</p><p>“Oh, yeah.” James’ face clears and he laughs, a boyish sound that brings Al sharply back to the days of running around the Burrow and James making fun of his attempts to ride a toy broomstick. “You should really change it. Everyone knows Mum’s birthday.”</p><p>“But they don’t know that I use it,” Al reminds him, gently but firmly pressing on James’ shoulders until he collapses onto the couch, his legs folding gracelessly beneath him. “Everyone would think it’s Dad’s birthday instead.”</p><p>James’ expression darkens and Al winces at himself for even mentioning his father. He really needs to keep a list called ‘taboo subjects for James in a Mood’ somewhere around the flat.</p><p>“Whatever.” The laughter has faded and now James slumps, disgruntled and sullen, into the couch, curling around his bottle of beer like it’s some sort of treasure and not worth five sickles at the grocery store. “Where’s Scorpion?”</p><p>“Scorpius,” Al corrects patiently. He pries the bottle from James’ hand after a bit of a struggle and tosses it quickly into the garbage bin. “He’s out.”</p><p>James blinks up at him, divested of his only accessory. “With Rosie?”</p><p>Al is abruptly too tired for this. “What are you doing here, James?”</p><p>“Came to see my little brother.” James tries to punch him on the shoulder but since Al is standing and he isn’t, he only reaches his forearm. “I’m allowed to do that, right? You haven’t taken out a restraining order?”</p><p>“As if.” What Al doesn’t say, as he gingerly lowers himself down next to his brother, perfectly out of vomiting range, is that he could no sooner take out a restraining order against James than cut off one of his own limbs. “Who’d you fight this time?”</p><p>James pretends to look offended and puts up a rather good face for someone who’s probably had, by Al’s calculations, at least six bottles of beers by now. He loses it quickly though and adopts his favorite I-just-got-away-with-something grin. “Matthew Davies. Guy’s a punk, and he was going around saying he’d slept with Lily, so I decked him.”</p><p>Al raises an eyebrow. “Did he?”</p><p>James shrugs, careless. “Who cares? Guys only say that shit around me to rile me up, you know that. It’s not like Lily’ll ever tell the truth.”</p><p>What a perfectly eloquent answer. Al lowers his estimation down to five bottles of beer.</p><p>“Maybe,” suggests Al carefully, “you shouldn’t let them rile you up so much.”</p><p>James looks at him in earnest confusion. Like this, with his dark hair all spiked up and messy, and hazel eyes wide and bright, he almost looks like a normal person, if you can ignore the black eye and the tattoo of a dragon spitting fireballs in slow motion around his neck or the fact that his left knuckle is purpling as they speak.</p><p>“Why would I do that?” he demands, as if this is an outrageous expectation.</p><p>“So you get hurt less?” Al suggests, reaching out to press two fingers to the bottom of James’ eye. Immediately, James flinches away with a muttered, “<em>Fuck</em>.” Al looks at him with what he knows is their mother’s preferred what-did-I-<em>just</em>-say face.</p><p>“Nah.” James flexes his arm, clenching and unclenching his bruised fist. “It’s fun, y’know. They all think they can take me, but they can’t. Davies is a fucking pussy.”</p><p>“Don’t say that,” Al says automatically. He’s listened to too many of Rose’s sermons on the importance of watching what language we use to let that slide.</p><p>James snorts. “Whatever. It was one of his friends who got me, anyway, not him. He quailed as soon as I landed one.”</p><p>“And I’m sure this will be all over Phoenyx as soon as I open it up, right?” Al says dryly. Truthfully, he hates the app and takes great care not to open it up if he can help it; he honestly prefers its muggle equivalent Twitter to get his world news. At least Twitter doesn’t constantly have moments on what outrageous outfits his little sister is wearing to parties or who his brother has beaten up or how many affairs his father has had (zero, at Al’s last count, but five at Phoenyx’s.)</p><p>“Everything we do ends up on Phoenyx,” James says dismissively. “Hey, do you have any vodka?”</p><p>“No,” Al lies. They do, in fact, have a good amount of alcohol, since Scorpius is rich and likes a well-stocked liquor cabinet, but the last thing his brother needs is more to drink. “I’ll get you some water.”</p><p>“You’re the most boring brother in the world!” James calls as Al heads into their kitchen. But he’s laughing, so Al knows he doesn’t really mean it. “God, what is with you and your muggle shit? Is this an actual television?”</p><p>“Don’t touch it,” Al says over his shoulder, rummaging around in their fridge for their stash of Sober-Me-Up potions. “I worked hard to fix that up.”</p><p>“You’re so weird.” James leans over the back of the couch to watch him. He’s looking more and more sleepy the longer the night drags on, so Al adds a quick sleeping charm to the water-potion mixture he’s creating. “Even weirder than Lily, and she’s <em>weird</em>.”</p><p>“She is pretty weird,” Al agrees. He comes back through the archway that separates their kitchen from their living room and offers the concoction to James. “Drink all of it and maybe you’ll avoid a hangover tomorrow.”</p><p>“But that’s the whole fun of drinking,” says James. He downs the whole glass anyway then makes a face. “Merlin, that’s <em>gross</em>. I thought you and your freaky little Slytherin society were supposed to be good at making potions?”</p><p>“Fuck off,” Al replies on instinct. James flashes that unbearably childish grin at him and Al exhales a sigh which turns into a laugh halfway. “You’re clearly not drunk enough if you’re making fun of me.”</p><p>“It’s my job.” James’ eyelids are lowering, so the sleeping charm is taking effect. “’M your big brother… s’what I do…”</p><p>Al Summons a blanket from the coat closet just as James nods off and carefully arranges his brother in the most comfortable position on their couch. Since it’s a used couch, no position is really that comfortable, but James is much shorter than him—something he hates to be reminded of—so he manages to fit all his limbs on there before covering him up with the blanket.</p><p>Scorpius is going to kill him for letting James crash at their flat again, but Al is prepared to weather the snarky comments if it means James can get a decent’s night sleep instead of spending it all out in night clubs and bars, picking fights with anyone that moves. Especially if it means James won’t end up in a strange girl’s bedroom at the end of the night and turn into Phoenyx’s top-trending news in a matter of minutes when she sells the story to buy herself a new house or whatever.</p><p>That’s happened three times, which is three times too many, in Al’s humble opinion, so he closes the lights of the living room and heads up to his bedroom to deal with whatever storm Scorpius brings him tomorrow after a full night’s rest.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>Scorpius is glaring at him when he wakes up.</p><p>Al sighs and draws the blankets up to his face. “Leave me alone.”</p><p>Scorpius snags the blankets and pulls them down. “You let your <em>brother</em> crash on <em>my</em> couch.”</p><p>“Excuse me,” says Al, offended. “It’s <em>our</em> couch. I picked it out.”</p><p>“I paid for it,” Scorpius retorts. “Whatever, that’s not the point.”</p><p>“What is the point?” Al asks wearily.</p><p>“The <em>point</em> is that he’s eaten all my favorite cereal. And I think he’s drunk. Again.”</p><p>This is concerning enough to wake Al up completely. “I swear I locked our liquor cabinet.”</p><p>“Yeah, he knows my passwords, too,” Scorpius says, nose wrinkling in a very pureblood-esque disgruntled face. “Can you go deal with him, <em>please</em>? I’m in no mood.”</p><p>“You’re never in a mood for James,” Al reminds him, already pulling his covers off and getting out of bed. James day-drinking is a notable phenomenon, not because it doesn’t usually happen, but because it never happens without a reason.</p><p>Scorpius shrugs then tosses himself down into his own bed, across the room from Al’s, with an arm across his eyes to shelter them from the sunlight streaming through their window. “He hates me. I hate him. It’s a symbiotic relationship.”</p><p>“Don’t think that’s what symbiotic means.” Al grabs his pants and tries not to look at the lean, graceful line of Scorpius draped over his silver bed coverings. He’s wearing last night’s clothes, but since it was <em>Scorpius</em>, those clothes are a black silk shirt and ironed jeans and the buttons of his shirt are popped just enough to expose the angles of his collarbone—and the pink hickeys on his throat.</p><p>Al turns away, buckling up his own—very much non-ironed—jeans. “Had a fun time with Rose?”</p><p>He thinks he does a good job of keeping his voice casual, but Scorpius pulls his arm away and sits up. “I can <em>feel</em> the judgment, Al.”</p><p>“Wasn’t trying to judge,” Al says, even though he very much was. “What is this, the fifth time you guys have gotten back together?”</p><p>Scorpius pulls a face at him, his lips curving downwards. “You don’t need to say it like that.”</p><p>“Oh, sorry.” Pointedly, Al pulls out his phone and opens up Phoenyx. “Would you prefer I say ‘Back at it again! Malfoy heir and Granger-Weasley princess spotted giggling in Little Italy! Are these star-crossed lovers finally back together?’”</p><p>He says all this in a completely deadpan voice, watching Scorpius’ eyes glaze over with every word. At the end of it, he stares mutely at Scorpius until his best friend finally cracks and bursts into laughter.</p><p>“God,” Scorpius gasps. “Are they still calling her ‘Granger-Weasley princess?’ That is <em>so</em> five years ago. She’s gonna lose it.”</p><p>Al shakes his head. “You know Rose refuses to read this shit.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Scorpius sighs, not a little dreamily, and drops back down onto his bed. “She’s smart like that.”</p><p>Al stuffs his phone into his pockets, makes sure his wand is tucked into his sleeve, in case James is <em>really</em> in a bad mood, and tosses his pillow at Scorpius before heads for the door. “Just don’t screw it up again. I am <em>not</em> mediating for you two one more fucking time, Scor.”</p><p>“Whatever!” Scorpius calls after him. “It wasn’t my fault anyway, it was hers!”</p><p>Al flips him off and slams the bedroom door shut as he leaves. In the next instant, he realizes this was a bad idea because it immediately alerts James to his presence.</p><p>Fortunately—or not, depending on how you looked at it—James didn’t seem like he was in the mood for a fight, for <em>once</em>. Instead, he was sitting at a stool on their kitchen counter, drinking one of Scorpius’ margarita mixes—<em>gross</em>. Al makes a face but crosses over to sit next to him anyway. His brother looks positively despondent.</p><p>“Morning, sunshine,” he says, knocking a knuckle on James’ head to wake him up. James turns a baleful glare on him. “What’s the matter with you? Still hungover?”</p><p>James only grunts and doesn’t answer, curling further around his shitty pineapple-and-tequila margarita as if he’s a dragon hoarding his gold. Al catalogues this in his mind’s list of ‘James’ moods’ as ‘reasonably bad, but could be worse.’</p><p>“Alright,” says Al with a shrug. “Don’t talk about it then. Want some real breakfast?”</p><p>The best way to deal with James’ mood swings is to pretend they’re not happening, unless it’s one of those mood swings where he’s about to blow up. This doesn’t look like one of those, though, so Al sets about making pancakes until his brother is ready to talk about whatever’s got him like this.</p><p>Unfortunately, Scorpius saves them both the trouble and bounds in—freshly showered and smelling like his stupidly expensive cologne, of <em>course</em>—to exacerbate the drama and pour salt in James’ wounds, as he’s wont to do.</p><p>“Is it true you knocked up Abby Longbottom?”</p><p>Al freezes in the middle of flipping pancakes. When he turns around, James is swiveling to stare at Scorpius with the most dirty, mutinous look he’s ever given anyone—which, with James, is saying a lot.</p><p>“Hey.” Scorpius puts his hands up. “Don’t shoot the messenger. It was on The Owlery.”</p><p>Al groans before he can help himself. “Scor, that shit is the lowest of the low of gossip mags, why do you even <em>go</em> on there—”</p><p>“But it was confirmed by The Legacy,” Scorpius continues blithely, and Al snaps his mouth shut. The Legacy is a much more elite and well-renowned paper; his cousin Molly works there and they would never publish a story if it was only a rumor. “And then The Prophet…”</p><p>Scorpius trails off when he notices that James still looks like he’s about to blast Scorpius’ head off. To be honest, Al kind of wants to see it at this point. His brother and his best friend have hated each other for so long, Lily has a running bet going on what will finally get them both to snap.</p><p>But he’s James’ brother and Scorpius’ best friend, so he has to do damage control. “Hey, Scor?” He waits till Scorpius is looking at him before he says, meaningfully, “Fuck off, would you?”</p><p>“This is my house,” Scorpius protests, but steps backwards when Al shoots him his most dangerous Slytherin look. He never uses that against Scorpius, only against more hapless Gryffindors, so it does the trick. “Alright, alright. I’ve got a date anyway.”</p><p>“Is it Rose?” Al can’t help but ask. Scorpius winks at him, which could go either way, and bounces off, uncaring of the storm cloud he’s left in his kitchen for Al to deal with.</p><p>Al slides his pancakes onto a plate, tops them with copious amounts of whipped cream, and wordlessly slides them over to James along with a fork. His brother stares at the food for a minute, then stabs the fork right into the center of the pile and angrily begins to eat.</p><p>“So…” Al says once James has shoveled his way through half the plate. “You wanna talk about it?”</p><p>James swallows a bite, takes another shot of the margarita, and grimaces. “Not really.”</p><p>“Do you want some orange juice?” Al asks. James makes a face but nods and Al Summons the bottle of orange juice from the fridge to pour it into a glass for him. It takes about five sips of that until James slumps down in his seat with an exhausted sigh.</p><p>“Are you gonna yell at me?” he asks morosely. “Cuz I already know I fucked up.”</p><p>Al stares at his big brother, a deep and genuine panic rising inside him that he hasn’t felt so acutely since that time he stepped outside to find his sixteen-year-old sister drunk and crashed out on his front porch, smelling of alcohol and bad decisions and almost frozen to death. That time, with Lily, had freaked him out so much he’d taken her right to St. Mungo’s but this time—this time it’s not one of his siblings dying from fighting the grips of nature too long and too hard. This time, it’s just James and his terrible decisions and how wrecked he looks when he meets Al’s gaze, hazel eyes full of shame.</p><p>Those are, his father had once told them, your grandfather’s eyes. The other one, the dead one. James Potter the First.</p><p>He’d also had a kid at twenty but somehow, Al doesn’t think it really compares.</p><p>“Tell me you didn’t,” he chokes out finally. “Tell me she’s not pregnant, James.”</p><p>James drops his head. “I didn’t mean to.”</p><p>“<em>James</em>.” Al’s voice is rising, not to the point of yelling but definitely to the point of freaking out. “Fucking hell, James, tell me it’s not <em>Abby</em>.”</p><p>James doesn’t reply. Al reaches across the counter and grabs his shoulders, thinking he might shake them, but he meets no resistance in his brother’s usually-solid muscles, and that’s enough to give him pause.</p><p>“God,” Al breathes. “<em>God</em>.”</p><p>The desperation in his voice seems to crack James a little, because he huffs out a little self-deprecating laugh and pulls his head up. His hair swoops across his forehead, the picture of the irreverent hero’s son he’s always pretended to be, and at this angle, Al can see why sweet little Abigail Longbottom has been in love with him since forever.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” James says, and his voice is so clear despite the alcohol and the hangover, that Al knows, in his bones, that he means it. “I don’t—I meant to apologize to her—but I couldn’t. That’s why—last night—I just couldn’t face her, Al. I never meant to do that.”</p><p>Despite what all the papers and all the social media sites would have you believe, James Potter is not a man of no conscience. He buries it beneath six layers of cigarettes and alcohol and bad attitude, but Al knows first-hand that his brother feels more than rage—feels guilt, regret, and shame sometimes, too, even when he pretends not to. He’d seen it on James’ face the first time he’d actually punched Scorpius for real and Al had refused to speak to him for two months, and he sees it now, in the aftermath of what is probably the worst decision of James’ life, sitting hungover at his kitchen counter and apologizing to a girl who’s not there.</p><p>“How did it happen?” Al asks carefully. “Were you drunk?”</p><p>“No, I—” James pauses, takes a breath. He frowns a little, like he’s going back in time to the memory of that night, however many months ago it was. “I was mad at—well, at everyone. But I was mad at Neville, ‘cause he’d come over to Mum and Dad’s and told them he was disappointed in me for not, like, taking a job as an Auror like he’d offered to help me with.”</p><p>James likes disappointing people, Al notes, but he hates when it’s pointed out to him. He hates when people say, explicitly, to his face, that he’s disappointed them, partly because their parents never, ever have—even though everyone knows that they should. And everyone says it <em>for </em>them.</p><p>“And I was mad at Lily,” James continues slowly. “Because she’d slept with Luke and not told me and he let it slip and you know he wouldn’t lie to me about that. And I was mad at him for doing it. And then I was mad at Jake for just—for just <em>existing</em>, god. Fuck.”</p><p>Al parses this through in his mind: Luke Goldstein is one of James’ closest friends, a pretentious poet with a shit-eating grin and a way of encouraging James’ bad habits but somehow never getting <em>himself</em> into trouble alongside him. He does, somehow, have a genuine friendship built with James, so the real surprise is that he would dare sleep with Lily knowing that. Although Lily often gets whatever she wants regardless of how anyone else feels about it, so maybe that was why.</p><p>And Jake Longbottom was Abby’s elder, eternally-sensible brother, who always takes on the most responsibilities of any kid in their whole social circle—Potters, Weasleys, Longbottoms, Scamanders, the children of the heroes who grew up together—and manages to hold the weight of the world on his shoulder without ever stumbling.</p><p>Al hates him, too. Nobody should be that poised, that graceful, when they have Harry Potter for a godfather. Just look at Teddy, after all. Jake is the best example and therefore the worst enemy of the Potter kids, all three of whom resent him for setting a benchmark they can never live up to.</p><p>Jake’s a good guy, though, which only makes it worse. Still, Al is pretty sure the appropriate response is not to <em>sleep with his sister and knock her up</em>.</p><p>“So, you slept with Abby to piss off her father?” Al asks.</p><p>James frowns. “I guess it sounds awful when you put it that way.”</p><p>“James, it sounds awful no matter which way I put it,” Al points out. “<em>She</em> wasn’t drunk, then, was she?”</p><p>“God, no!” James looks genuinely hurt. “What kind of an asshole do you think I am? I’d never do that. And it’s <em>Abby</em>. It’s… it’s Abby.”</p><p>The way he says it, Al knows exactly what he means: it’s Abby, the girl they’ve grown up with their whole lives. She looks like an angel and acts like one, too, and of all the girls who have drifted in and out of the orbit of James Sirius Potter, she’s the last one who should have gotten knocked up by him. The other girls, they’d be terrifically eager to have his baby, to claim his trust fund for child support money, to have the notoriety of being the mother of Harry Potter’s first grandchild, but not Abby. She loves Harry and Ginny almost more than their actual kids do.</p><p>And she loves James. Been in love with him since she was eleven and unfortunately, it’s never gotten better. Al has lost track of the amount of times he’s told her to move on and find someone deserving, because James has always been in his too-cool-for-school phase and refused to look twice at her, and Abby had just continued holding out hope that one day he would grow up and be ready for her.</p><p>Al wishes he could have saved her the trouble, the pain and the drama. She doesn’t deserve the rumors, the whispering, the talks of her being a slut and her child being a bastard. But she and James are grown-ups and they’ve both made their bad choices.</p><p>“Okay,” Al says finally, snapping back into focus. Regardless of his feelings, this is a Potter problem, and he knows best how to solve those. “Okay. How far along is she?”</p><p>James blinks, but answers, “About three months. She went to the doctor two weeks ago, and I guess it’s just got out now. She told me three days ago.”</p><p>Al frowns. “Have you been drunk for three days?”</p><p>“Maybe,” says James defensively. “Wouldn’t you?”</p><p>Al shakes his head and continues on. “Well, okay. What’s done is done. It’s out there now. Are you… are you going to marry her?”</p><p>James looks completely taken aback by this question, as if it had never even occurred to him. “What? No. Why? Should I?”</p><p>Al shrugs. “I don’t know your feelings. Are you in love with her? Do you want to marry her and raise your kid together?”</p><p>“No,” says James automatically, then winces. “No, I mean, I’m not—I’m not in love with her. It’s <em>Abby</em>. It was just—it was a stupid mistake. I can’t marry her, I…” He trails off, no doubt going along the same path that Al’s thoughts had gone. “Oh, god.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Al lets it sink in for a minute, what they both know the press is going to do to Abby, to their kid. “Okay, next question: is she going to keep it?”</p><p>James looks stricken. “I didn’t ask. Do you think she will?”</p><p>“I think you should ask,” Al says pointedly. “But yes, I think she will. She’d be a good mother, you know that. Even if it’s yours.”</p><p>James sighs and drops his head into his hands, the leftovers of his pancakes gone cold on the plate in front of him. “Neville is going to kill me.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Al pats his brother on the back. “That I can’t help you with. But you can at least mitigate the damage.”</p><p>“Al,” says James very seriously. “I need you to go with me.”</p><p>He’s about to refuse, he really is, but James looks at him with those doe hazel eyes, and no matter how much of a fight he puts up, Al knows he would do anything for his brother when it comes down to it. So instead he just sighs and says, “Finish your breakfast, and then we’ll talk about it.”</p><p>James shovels another bite of cold pancakes into his mouth. “Y’know I love you, right?” he says around the food.</p><p>Al makes a face at him. “Don’t talk while you eat.”</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>He makes James shower and put on clean clothes before he even considers Flooing him to Abby’s house, and then he still has to call Neville and make sure it’s okay, which he does with only a little bit of trepidation—he <em>likes</em> Neville, and he consoles himself with the fact that <em>he</em> hadn’t been the one who knocked up Neville’s only daughter.</p><p>“You and James?” Neville asks, his voice going steely cold over the phone. “I don’t know if that’s a good idea, Al.”</p><p>“I know,” Al inhales. “I know, believe me, Uncle Neville, I know. But—come on, you know they need to talk. If not now, then <em>soon</em>. It’s his kid, too.”</p><p>Neville heaves a bone-deep sigh and says, “I’ll ask her. If she says no, I don’t want him anywhere near her, understand?”</p><p>“Of course.” Al crosses his fingers and prays he won’t have to go back to his sneaking-around-Hogwarts days to find a way to get James and Abby to talk behind Neville’s back. “I understand completely, sir.”</p><p>Neville muffles the phone for a bit, and comes back five minutes later, sounding even more tired than before. “Abby says to meet her at Melly’s in Dragon Hill Market. Ten minutes. Don’t be late.”</p><p>“Got it.” Al tries his best to sound professional as he says, “Thank you, sir.”</p><p>“And Al?” Neville says before he hangs up, making Al hesitate. “I know it’s not your fault. But if she thinks it’s for the best to not be involved with your family at all anymore, I’m going to need you to respect that. I know she’s your friend, too, but…”</p><p>“Right.” Al feels his heart sink a little further. “I understand.”</p><p>Neville sighs again. “Take care, Al,” he says, and then hangs up. Al stares down at the phone, wondering when his godfather had turned into an authority figure to circumvent. Even during Hogwarts, Neville had been his favorite professor, and never one he felt he had to lie to. But lines are drawn differently outside of Hogwarts, he’s found, and if this battle places him on James’ side instead of Abby’s, he supposes he’s going to have to deal with it.</p><p>“Melly’s,” he reports to James, sliding on his coat. “Let’s go. We don’t want to be late.”</p><p>James looks rather like he <em>does</em> want to be late, but gets up anyway and the two brothers Apparate over to Dragon Hill Market, where the afternoon sun has just begun lowering—it had taken way longer to get James dressed and ready than expected. The marketplace is slowing down from its usual hustle and bustle at this hour, but all the restaurants are still lit up creating a warm golden glow over the walkways.</p><p>Melly’s is a little American café tucked into a corner, with orange curtains and the best fizzy drinks Al’s ever had. Dragon Hill is supposed to be an international hub, hidden in the heart of London, where wizards and witches can get a taste of magical styles and foods from all over the world. It’s a lot more classy than his and James’ usual haunts but he does like it; their parents had brought them here a lot as kids to ‘expose them to new ideas.’</p><p>“Where is she?” James says, jiggling his leg as he pretends to sip at his iced tea. Al watches him in part-amusement and part-concern. James had actually taken time to put in effort into his appearance for this, so he’d traded out the leather jacket for a blue sweater and non-ripped jeans that he’d stolen from Al’s wardrobe and spelled to his size, and he honestly looks almost respectable.</p><p>At least, he might if not for the tattoos spiraling around his wrists, and the black eye still healing despite the charms Al has laid on it. Rose could’ve done it better, had always been better at Healing than him, but he didn’t want to call her for this. Rose is good at dealing with James in certain circumstances only.</p><p>And then, there’s the whole thing with Scorpius that he would rather not get into at the moment.</p><p>“Relax, we’re early,” says Al, although he’s getting a little antsy himself. “She said she’ll be here, and Abby always keeps her word.”</p><p>That’s the thing about Abby—no matter what the world lays at her feet, no matter all the kids that mocked her for being Professor Longbottom’s daughter, no matter how much trouble she’d gotten into being a close friend of the Potters and Weasleys—she’s a good person through and through. She’s never broken a promise, she always helps him when he’s gotten himself into trouble, she’s fixed up his broken bones more times than he can count.</p><p>She doesn’t deserve any of this. Al is halfway to feeling sad about it again when Abby walks through the doorway of Melly’s.</p><p>There’s only five other people in the café, but it seems like everyone stops and stares. Abby meets their scrutiny with her head held high, looking across the booths and finally locking onto the one Al and James are sitting at. She’s wearing a loose dress—way looser than she normally wears, but it doesn’t make it immediately obvious that she’s pregnant—and comfortable sandals, and her blonde hair is tied up in a ponytail, as professional as possible.</p><p>In front of her, Al has always felt like a disaster, a failure to the legacy of their brave Gryffindor parents. Unlike with her brother, he doesn’t feel like she lords it over him, only tries her best to make him better through her sweet and steady presence. She catches his eye and half smiles, then walks over to the two of them, ignoring the bursts of whispering that have spouted in her wake.</p><p>“Hi,” says Al, a little uncertainly, rising to greet her. “You look—you look good, Abbs.”</p><p>Abby smiles and reaches forward to hug him, which surprises him enough that he hugs back, even though he can in no way be called a hugger. Still, she’s been one of his closest friends since childhood, and she always smells like her mother’s homemade peach pie.</p><p>“You, too,” Abby says fondly and brushes a loose strand of his dark hair out of his face. Al squeezes her hand and steps back so she can see James, who has also gotten to his feet and is looking at her with an expression of terror and guilt.</p><p>Abby doesn’t say anything to him. The two of them just stare at each other for a moment, and then Al clears his throat and gently pushes Abby into the booth so she’ll have his seat across from James.</p><p>“Right, well, uh,” Al begins awkwardly. “Thank you for meeting us here. Um, I know this isn’t… the best of circumstances. But… James wanted to say something to you.”</p><p>Abby blinks and turns to look expectantly at James, who has gone white and silent. Al coughs and kicks him underneath the table.</p><p>“It’s okay,” says Abby before James can find the words or that famed Gryffindor courage, though. “I know.”</p><p>“Er,” Al says. She looks calm as ever, but the tension around the table is thick enough to cut. “Should I… leave you two alone, then?”</p><p>James manages a nod. Abby shoots Al a smile and jerks her head as if to say, ‘It’s okay, go.’</p><p>Al takes a deep breath, squeezes James’ shoulder, then gets up and Apparates away as soon as he reaches the threshold of Melly’s, unable to stay in there a moment longer even if James had wanted him to.</p><p>He figures he’ll give them an hour, so instead of wandering around looking at the eclectic collection of foreign clothes and trying new French pastries or whatever, he decides to take a breather and go as far away as possible, so he shows up on his cousin Victoire’s doorstep in Brighton, where she’s rented an actual house—thereby making her perhaps the most put-together of all the Weasley cousins.</p><p>Although, as he enters in the voice-activation password spell to be let in, he thinks that might not be totally true. James isn’t the only cousin with a bad reputation in the wizarding media sphere, and Victoire hasn’t been having the easiest go of it lately, either.</p><p>“Vic?” he calls in to the blue-and-gold-decorated house, closing the door behind him. “You in?”</p><p>Much like his cousin, the house is classy and elegant, with paintings she’s bought from exclusive magical art auctions hanging around the walls, lots of photographs of her and her family, and a not-used leather couch next to a glass coffee table and a wooden bookshelf that seems to house most of her personal library.</p><p>The kitchen is even open concept, not even having an archway to get to and from the living room like his rather more cramped flat does. He finds her in there, cooking up a soup of some sort—it smells reasonably good, which is a first for Victoire, who famously cannot cook without setting something on fire.</p><p>“Hi, Al,” she greets, seeming mostly cheerful. “You’re just in time for dinner. Want some tea? I brewed a batch, just on the counter there.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Al pours himself a cup—she has these tiny little Disneyland-themed cups she got the last time her family went on vacation to Paris and they’re super cute but always make him feel huge when he drinks out of them. “What’s going on with you?”</p><p>“Just the usual.” Victoire turns her stove off and carefully ladles her soup into two bowls for both of them. “Got an auction on Saturday and Dean wants something for an anniversary gift for his wife, so it has to be perfect. Dom and Lily got in trouble again for doing, like, a ritual in the Forbidden Forest or something? And, oh yeah, every time I go outside, people ask me how I feel about Teddy and his new girlfriend, so, that’s been super fun.”</p><p>She finishes this off with a deep roll of her eyes and offers him a bowl. Al pokes at it with his spoon in interest; it almost looks edible.</p><p>“Sorry about Teddy,” he offers, taking a tentative sip as Victoire watches him. “I know it must suck. This is actually really good, what’d you put in it?”</p><p>“Carrots and caramelized onions,” Victoire says with a beam. “And I followed Grandma’s recipe this time.”</p><p>“That would make the difference, yes,” Al agrees. He smirks at her. “Remember when you almost burned down the Burrow?”</p><p>“Shut up, that was years ago.” Victoire sniffs and holds her head higher in her classic I-was-Head-Girl-and-I’m-better-than-you pose. “I’ve <em>overcome</em> my failings, Albus. I’m a stronger person now.”</p><p>“Mm.” Al takes another spoonful of the soup, then adds, carefully, “I don’t think Teddy even likes that girl.”</p><p>Victoire’s blonde brows draw downwards immediately. “I don’t care,” she says, but then, “What makes you say that?”</p><p>“Dunno.” Al shrugs one shoulder and pulls out his phone. He opens up Lumosgram and finds Teddy’s profile, with the picture of his date out to some band party hanging onto his arms. The picture is in black and white and heavily filtered, but the girl’s got dark hair (not his type) and is wearing heels so high she’s at Teddy’s height (definitely not his type) and a snotty Slytherin look in her eyes (Al recognizes it, because he has one too, and he <em>knows</em> that’s not Teddy’s type.)</p><p>“He probably just needed a date and picked the first girl he met at a night club. Look at him, he looks miserable.”</p><p>Teddy is, admittedly, smiling in the picture, but Al knows his godbrother, and knows there’s no way he actually went home with that girl, just like he hasn’t gone home with any of the girls he’s been seen with since his and Victoire’s engagement ended. Victoire, for her part, looks over the picture once and snorts.</p><p>“Well, that doesn’t stop people from talking.” She frowns down into her soup. “I just wish he’d, I don’t know, take a sabbatical or something. Does he need to be around London all the time? Why can’t his band go tour Spain or somewhere?”</p><p>“He does live there,” Al points out gently. Victoire scoffs and waves her hand in that French way her mother does, dismissing his point entirely. “You could always get a boyfriend, too, you know.”</p><p>“Oh, yeah.” Victoire rolls her eyes again (Al is starting to see where Lily picked the habit up from.) “Because guys are just lining up to date the bitch who broke Teddy Lupin’s heart.”</p><p>“That’s not even remotely what happened,” Al protests. “And, hello, you’re a Veela?”</p><p>Victoire’s gaze clouds ever with anger. “That only makes it worse. Did you see Skeeter’s piece in The Owlery? All about how I was a crazy bitch who turned into a bird and attacked Teddy with my Veela powers and that’s why he left me.”</p><p>“Uh, no.” Al honestly tries to avoid The Owlery, run by Lana Skeeter, as much as possible. He hates that lady more than he hates most people. “That’s stupid, though. Nobody would take that seriously.”</p><p>Victoire levels him a look over the top of her bowl of her soup and he sighs, giving in.</p><p>“Okay, so a lot of people would take that seriously,” Al admits. “That’s just because people are stupid. Trust me, look at how they treat me. Every time I step foot in Knockturn Alley I’ve gone over to the Dark side. Like, damn, I just want some frog eyes sometimes, y’know?”</p><p>Victoire shakes her head with a burst of wry laughter. “Don’t I know it. I met up with a friend in Hogsmeade yesterday, you know Julian Wood, right? And immediately everyone on Phoenyx was talking about how I was such a slut for moving on from Teddy so fast, even though Julian and I have been friends since Hogwarts! And he’s had a girlfriend for<em>ever</em>.”</p><p>“People are stupid,” Al commiserates. “Especially in our world. Did you hear Lily’s pregnant?”</p><p>“Is she? Are they saying it’s Teddy again?”</p><p>“No, this time it’s the new Transfiguration professor and she’s using him to get free booze.” Al smirks. “As if Lily needs to sleep with someone to get free booze.”</p><p>“It’s like they don’t even know her,” Victoire agrees, and then starts giggling. “God. How messed up are our lives that we’re laughing at your little sister potentially having an affair with her teacher?”</p><p>“Pretty messed up.” Al sighs and props his chin on his hand. “That professor is pretty hot, though. <em>You</em> could sleep with him if you wanted. You never had him.”</p><p>Victoire laughs, finishing off her soup with a rather unladylike slurp. “Puh-<em>lease</em>. He’s way more your type than mine. Besides, dating purebloods is for snobs.”</p><p>Al raises his eyebrows high. “Oh, and you’re not a snob?”  </p><p>“Of course not,” she says primly. “I’m a half-breed abomination and I exclusively date people who <em>aren’t</em> from the Sacred Twenty-Eight.” Her voice lowers to make this sound even more dramatic than it is, and Al can’t help cracking a grin.</p><p>“You know, Teddy is a Black, right?”</p><p>“Teddy has two muggleborn grandparents,” Victoire reminds him. “Doesn’t count. And he’s never worn a black tie in his life, so.”</p><p>“Hm, you’re right, that <em>is</em> a qualification for being a snobby pureblood,” Al muses. “Does that make me a snob?”</p><p>“Definitely.” Victoire meets his stare for a minute, and then they both start laughing. “Speaking of purebloods, though, Dean wants me to tutor his niece. You know her? Annora Greengrass?”</p><p>“Scorpius’ cousin, Annora?” Al considers what he knows of the elusive, homeschooled Greengrass. “She’s a total bitch. Chased away seven nannies and twelve tutors, and counting. Isn’t she, like, seventeen, why does she need a tutor?”</p><p>“She’s going to sit her NEWTs soon and apparently she’s been struggling in a few subjects.” Victoire pulls out a piece of paper from one of her pockets and slides that across the counter to Al. “Charms, Potions, and History. I got O’s in all of them so Dean says they’d be willing to pay me a <em>lot</em>. And offer free board and meals, too.”</p><p>Al blinks. “You need that? Just to tutor someone?”</p><p>Victoire shrugs. “This is the <em>pureblood</em> side of the Greengrasses. They still live in the eighteenth century, I guess. But… it’s not a bad offer.”</p><p>She’s toying with the wrinkled edges of the paper, which lists out the details of the job offering. Al stares at her incredulously. “You’re not seriously considering it. That girl is a <em>nightmare</em>. Scorpius took me over to Greengrass Manor once and she tried to set me on fire.”</p><p>“I’ve heard,” Victoire says, but when she meets his gaze, this time, there’s a longing in it. “But… I like to teach. And, frankly, this house is a little much to keep living in. I mean, Dean pays me well, as an art buyer, but I live alone now and… everything smells like Teddy.”</p><p>Al furrows his brow. “So… you want a fresh start… at Greengrass Manor? Of all places, Vic, come on. You could go teach at Hogwarts, you have the qualifications.”</p><p>“I know, but I don’t have my teaching certificate, and this could be a good way to earn it,” Victoire points out. “Dom says I should do it. She says autumn solstice is a time for change or whatever.”</p><p>Al rolls his eyes. “Dom’s a weirdo,” he says, dismissive even though he actually quite likes Dominique, in all her strange, astrology-obsessed weirdness. “What did Louis say?”</p><p>“I haven’t told anyone else,” Victoire admits. “Dom was just there when I got the letter. She snuck out of Hogwarts somehow.”</p><p>Al, who knows very well that James had left the Marauders’ Map to Lily when he graduated, stays quiet on that front. “Right, well… I mean, Vic, I’ve <em>met</em> Annora. She’s a nightmare. But if you think this is a good move for you…”</p><p>Victoire exhales a deep breath. “Okay, I know you’re not convinced. What if you come with me to Greengrass Manor next weekend, to check it out? You could bring Scorpius, too, and just… help me decide, I don’t know.”</p><p>She looks so lost that Al feels his oft-rumored ice-cold heart thaw, just a little. “Alright, I’ll go with you. And I’ll ask Scorpius. But Vic… if you’re feeling so bad about all this, maybe you should talk to Teddy?”</p><p>Immediately, Victoire’s face closes over. “No.”</p><p>“But,” Al tries, “it’s been five months. And—”</p><p>“Al,” she interrupts, laying a hand over his. “I know he’s your godbrother and you love him. But just trust me on this, okay?”</p><p>“I’d trust you more if I knew what happened,” Al points out. He doesn’t often like to pry—hates when people do it to him, as a matter of fact—but the mystery of why Teddy and Victoire broke their engagement has been hanging over their entire family like a raincloud since it happened last May. He’s heard all the rumors—she was cheating on him, he was cheating on <em>her</em>, he was cheating on her with one of their cousins, she was pregnant and he didn’t want kids (that one, at least, has been disproved), he turned into a werewolf and tried to bite her, and of course, the crazy Veela angle of Lana Skeeter.</p><p>But nobody except Teddy and Victoire knows the full truth of the argument that led to their break-up, one sunny day in May. They’d been together for five years at that point, after their first break-up while Victoire was still in Hogwarts, which had been memorable solely for her goth phase, and had seemed solid as rocks, planning a Christmas wedding for that very year—until it all fell apart.</p><p>Victoire shakes her head, strands of her blonde hair falling out of her messy bun. “It’s over, Al. It’s done with. Just forget about it.”</p><p>Al sighs and slides out of his seat, moving around the counter to where she’s standing. “If you say so,” he says, wrapping an arm around her and pressing a kiss to her cheek. “I’ll see you next week, then.”</p><p>Victoire smiles wanly at him as he turns to go, but stops him when he’s at the door. “Hey, wait, Al?”</p><p>“Yeah?” He turns back to look at her, still standing in the kitchen in her oversized pink sweater with her bowl of soup in her hands. She’s one of the few cousins he truly gets along with, and he can’t fathom why Teddy would have been stupid enough to let such a good thing in his life go.</p><p>“Is it true?” she asks. “About James and Abby?”</p><p>“What about them?” he hedges.</p><p>Victoire narrows her eyes at him. “That she’s pregnant. I mean… I know James is a wreck, but he wouldn’t just knock up a girl, would he?”</p><p>“You have such a high opinion of my brother,” Al says with a grim smile. “Unfortunately, he’s an idiot, so yes, it’s true.”</p><p>Victoire’s eyes widen and then she says, “Well, fuck.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Al agrees, shoving his hands into his coat pockets. “That about sums it up.”</p>
