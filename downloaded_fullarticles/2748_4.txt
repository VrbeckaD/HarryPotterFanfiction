<p>The Lupins of Lydia Avenue were a very quiet family. If the townspeople of Lynton had been asked about them, they might have taken a moment to place the name, and then given an answer along the lines of, ‘Oh, that young couple at the end of the row? They're decent folk, don’t go out much. They've a little boy, quiet thing he is—what was his name again? Rufus? Russell?’</p>
<p>For their part, the Lupins seemed content living on the outer edge of the community. Their son, whose name happened to be Remus, was likelier to be found playing quietly by himself than running around with the village children. In fact, none of the Lupins were prone to making social advances, but when approached, they proved to be such kind, helpful, ordinary people that no-one could think ill of them, even on the rare occasions their house seemed to attract oddly-dressed people at all hours of the night.</p>
<p>Mr Lupin was rarely seen, off working long hours somewhere unknown. But every Saturday at ten o'clock in the morning, as regular as clockwork, Mrs Lupin walked down to the village with her son to run errands. She was polite to everyone she met, and especially friendly with the greengrocers; old ladies often stopped to fuss over little Remus, who stared at them with solemn brown eyes and clutched his mother's hand tightly. </p>
<p>So when, one clear Saturday morning in October, Mrs Lupin did not make an appearance on Lynton’s high street, the Lupins inadvertently caused the first disturbance of their quiet existence. It was the greengrocer who, at half past ten, first wondered aloud ‘Where's Mrs Lupin?’</p>
<p>The question spread and at tea-time, a few townspeople had gathered at the little cafe across from the grocery in an unofficial council. Rumours flitted back and forth between friends and neighbours. </p>
<p>‘Haven’t seen them in days, not even in their yard—’</p>
<p>‘Did you hear that sound the other evening by their house? Like a gunshot—’</p>
<p>‘I heard the Lupin boy was ill. No wonder, he always looked a sickly one—’ </p>
<p>‘No, it was Mr Lupin,’ said one Mrs Mary Reynolds, with a certainty that caused a hush to settle over the cafe as several gossips turned to look at her. The old woman waited until she had their undivided attention before continuing. ‘I saw him last night, must have been hurrying home from God only knows where he works. Looked a mess, too, couldn’t believe what he was wearing, looked like a cape and robes,’ Mrs Reynolds paused, taking a deep breath and watching her audience’s faces carefully, ‘He was deathly pale, about ready to topple over. He didn’t even notice me, just walked right past, shoving some sort of stick into his pocket, and muttering nonsense—I heard something about wizards in the government.’</p>
<p>‘Finally gone round the bend, I’d wager,’ said the greengrocer’s wife. ‘It’ll be the madhouse for Lupin, mark my words.’ </p>
<p>A murmur of agreement from a few other women followed this assertion, as the townspeople remembered other robed visitors and nocturnal activities around the Lupin house. Tea-time slipped away, and, as no new information was forthcoming, the group trickled away from the cafe to get on with their lives. Mrs Reynolds stayed longer than anyone, but when her account of her sighting of Mr Lupin had been exaggerated, analyzed, and eventually exhausted, she finished her errands, buying groceries and posting a letter to her nephew.</p>
<p>It was evening, and the sky was turning a deep purple when Mrs Reynolds started down Lydia Avenue. She hesitated at her front path, glanced quickly over her shoulder, and then continued to the next house over, the house at the very end of the row. She let herself in the Lupins’ front gate, glancing suspiciously around the yard. There was a lovely garden, meticulously maintained, with a small vegetable patch and potted lupins—proof that someone had a sense of humour, she thought. Mrs Reynolds approached the front door and had raised her hand to knock when she heard raised voices.</p>
<p>‘Hope, listen. You don’t understand—’</p>
<p>‘What don’t I understand? You said yourself this man doesn’t know where you live. We cannot leave our home because of an empty threat from a man who—’</p>
<p>‘Greyback isn’t a man!’</p>
<p>There was a long, heavy silence. Mrs Reynolds stood silently outside the front door, thoughts of gathering gossip chased away by a deep-seated need to get her nose out of other people’s lives before she learned something truly awful. She turned on her heels and hurried for the safety of her own home.</p>
<p>That night, sleepless despite her best efforts, Mrs Reynolds roused herself from bed and returned downstairs to make a nice cup of tea. It was nearly eleven o’clock and she had just set the kettle on to boil when she heard the scream. It was the undeniably terrified scream of a child, cut off short.</p>
<p>A howl shattered the silence. Mrs Reynolds felt ill. Wolves? There were no wolves in the British Isles... Mrs Reynolds felt cold creep through her veins. She rushed to her door to lock it, but her hand froze on the handle. She was sure it had been a child’s scream...  </p>
<p>Grabbing a heavy iron skillet from her kitchen, Mrs Reynolds ran outside, still in her slippers and nightgown. She was halfway to the Lupins’ house when she heard a man’s shout: ‘<em> Remus! </em>’ There was a bang and a burst of light flashed through the gaps in the hedge. Clutching her skillet tightly, Mrs Reynolds headed resolutely for the far side of the Lupins’ back yard. Illuminated in the pale silver glow of the full moon, a man stood over a small, crumpled body. His arm was outstretched, pointing a thin length of wood at a beast of nightmare. Feral eyes glinted from under its matted fur. It snarled in pain, something thick and dark dripping from its fangs. The man yelled a word and the monster howled again, but Mrs Reynolds had dropped her skillet and was already running. She locked herself in her house, drew the curtains, and sat down, shaking, at her table.</p>
<p>Hours later, Mrs Reynolds startled awake in her kitchen to the sound of someone letting themselves in through her front door. The same door that she remembered very distinctly locking the night before. The man walking into her house was so bizarre-looking that her mind went blank for a moment. She stared, taking in his long, purple robes emblazoned with an official-looking patch across the chest pocket, a design of two intertwining ‘M’s.</p>
<p>‘Good evening,’ said the man in a low, solicitous voice. ‘Mrs Reynolds, I presume.’</p>
<p>‘Y-Yes, please, er —do come in,’ Mrs Reynolds replied unnecessarily. The stranger was already making himself quite at home. He pulled out a chair at her table, sitting and gesturing to the chair from which she had just stood up.</p>
<p>‘Please, have a seat.’</p>
<p>Mrs Reynolds sat down. ‘I understand you’ve had quite the fright,’ the man continued, perfectly at ease. ‘Would you like to tell me about it?’ </p>
<p>Mrs Reynolds would have liked to tell him to get out of her house thank you very much and who did he think he was, but she refrained. It was something about his utter calm and self-assuredness. ‘There—it was the Lupins,’ she said. ‘I—I heard a scream last night, and I ran out to look. I saw—well, I thought I saw Mr Lupin, and he was pointing—well, a stick at what looked like a wolf, but of course I know wolves only live on the Continent, and it all sounds dreadfully silly now that I say it, but, you see, there was a <em>child</em>.’</p>
<p>‘There was indeed, and I can assure you the matter is perfectly in hand. Is that all? </p>
<p>‘Well—yes, but—’</p>
<p> ‘In that case, there is no need to worry, Mrs Reynolds. None at all.’</p>
<p> The man reached into the folds of his robes and took out, to Mrs Reynolds’s confusion, a slender wooden wand. He pointed it after her and, as she stared into his eyes, murmured ‘<em> Obliviate. </em>’</p>
<p>And so it was that when the Lupin family disappeared from Lynton without telling a soul the reason for their departure, Mrs Reynolds knew nothing more about it than anyone else. She knew nothing about the fate of the small boy who lay, broken and bleeding, in a bed in a hidden hospital in London. She knew nothing of the name Fenrir Greyback, a name that was now spreading across the wizarding world as wizards and witches opened their copies of the Daily Prophet. Fenrir Greyback, the ‘savage killer’ who targeted his victims on the full moon. The name was spoken in hushed voices, as if to say it aloud was to summon ill fortune. Whispers of sympathy were heard also, for the unnamed couple in the article, the couple that had lost their son.</p>
