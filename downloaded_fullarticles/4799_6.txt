    <p> </p><p>Truth or Potion</p><p>Prologue</p><p> </p><p>“If I had to pick between a troll and McGonagall? Easy. I’d go for the troll. Ask me something difficult next time, Pans,” Draco Malfoy slurred from his spot on a Slytherin common room couch. He and several Housemates had begun a game of truth or dare several hours earlier. Of course, being Slytherins, they harbored a number of secrets and opted to drink instead of revealing the requested information.</p><p>“Fine, fine,” the raven-haired witch rolled her eyes. “How about this?” She looked around the circle of friends. “The next time each of us passes, we have to drink one of these.”</p><p>“What is it?” Zabini asked, peering at the mystery potion vials Pansy held out for them all to see.</p><p>“That’s for me to know and you to find out.”</p><p>“And we should trust you because…?” asked Draco.</p><p>“Dear, Merlin. It’s not poison!” She complained, rolling her eyes again.</p><p>“It is Veritaserum?” Millicent asked.</p><p>“No, and it’s not a love potion, or any of the other crazy things you’re probably thinking.”</p><p>“Then why not tell us?” Millicent asked again.</p><p>“What’s the fun in that? Besides this is supposed to be extra incentive to tell the truth.”</p><p>A moment passed before Goyle agreed to the new terms. The others were impressed; he was usually a follower, not a leader, but as it was, the rest of the group followed his example and reluctantly agreed.</p><p>“Right, who wants to go first?” When no one volunteered, Pansy ‘randomly’ picked someone. “Draco!”</p><p>“Dare.”</p><p>“I dare you to kiss the prettiest witch here,” Pansy beamed at him, pursing her lips in anticipation. Draco took a moment to look at Pansy, then Millicent, the only girls in their group, and think before he stood somewhat gracefully in his inebriated state, strode over to a group of fifth year girls, knelt in front of one, and kissed her firmly on the mouth. While she had previously been giggling with her friends, she then sat in shock, her eyes wide as Malfoy snogged her. Even after he stood and returned to his spot, the girl and her friends stared after him. He paid hem no further attention.</p><p>“What was that about?” Pansy demanded, her cheeks growing red in anger.</p><p>“You said to kiss the prettiest girl here.”</p><p>“Yes, and you kissed some nobody?”</p><p>“She’s the prettiest girl here. You didn’t say I had to know her, or she had to be playing with us.” Unable to argue, Pansy huffed, slumped and glared at the floor. “I suppose it’s my turn then. Blaise, truth or dare?” the dark-skinned wizard gave Draco a wry grin.</p><p>“Dare.”</p><p>“I dare you to drink Pansy’s potion.” Draco saw the witch perk up out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>“That’s not part of the game!” Blaise argued. “It’s only meant for when we pass!”</p><p>“I don’t remember that being stipulated in the rules. Do you, Pansy?” The blond turned to the witch once more, his expression that of pure innocence. Pansy, all too happy to encourage the idea, shook her head.</p><p>“Nope. I never said it was <em>only </em>for passes.”</p><p>“Alright then, Blaise. Drink up,” Draco waved one of the vials in front of his friend’s face. “If you pass, you have to drink anyway, so let’s just find out what all the fuss is about, eh?”</p><p>Glaring at his “friend,” Blaise snatched the vial from the blond’s hand, noticing Pansy’s gleeful expression. Honestly, her grin practically split her face in two. In one fluid motion, he unstoppered the potion and downed it.</p><p>“Well?” Nott asked after a moment. The small group, with the exception of Pansy who couldn’t contain her excitement, sat perfectly still and watched the Italian for any sign of poisoning or other strangeness.</p><p>“I….I don’t feel any different.” Still, they all waited another few moments before settling back into more relaxed positions.</p><p>“Alright then. Who’s next?” Nobody immediately reacted to the raven-haired witch’s question.</p><p>“Millicent, you’re up,” Draco finally said. The plump witch glanced nervously at Zabini once more before taking a breath and beginning her turn.</p><p>“Truth.”</p><p>“Alright. Over the summer, I spotted you and a pretty girl we’ve never seen before looking awfully close in a dark corner of the Leaky Cauldron. Who is she?” Draco watched as the poor girl’s eyes grew twice their size and darted around the circle of Slytherins.</p><p>“I-I-uh…” Her mouth set in a nervous frown as she clearly attempted to come up with some explanation.</p><p>“You know, there’s another option here. Pansy’s potion.” The blond wizard waved another vial in front of her, which she quickly snatched up and threw back. However, once she realized what she had done without thinking, her gaze darted back to Blaise in horror. He just shrugged.</p><p>The game continued in much the same way for nearly every other player, except Draco, who was very crafty in his interpretations of every question aimed at him. He hadn’t risked choosing dare since his own dare for Blaise, knowing how that would turn out.</p><p>“Okay, Draco. Truth or dare?” Pansy asked him for the fourth time that night, knowing which option he would go for.</p><p>“Truth.” The hour had grown late and half the group had already fallen asleep on the rug in front of the Slytherin Common Room fire. Still, Pansy was determined to get Draco to drink one of her potions.</p><p>“Merlin’s tits, Draco, just pick dare already!” Pansy herself was heavily leaning on the armrest of the couch Draco laid on, her eyelids drooping in her exhaustion.</p><p>“No,” he smirked from his place among emerald pillows, his eyes closed. Pansy looked around the room, as if she could find a complicated enough question for Draco to pass on answering amidst the fireplace or forgotten textbooks. The last two times he evaded her questions, she had begun to consider going a much more Slytherin route, but worried he would be very angry with her. She needed to determine how badly she wanted him to take the damn potion. Was her amusement worth Draco potentially not speaking to her for the foreseeable future?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>“Fine. When You-Know-Who was living in Malfoy Manor, you flooed to my house in a tizzy one night.” Draco was already glaring at his “friend” for bringing up the time he had the Dark Lord in his home. “Why?” The blond frowned at her question, gradually paling as the minutes wore on. He was clearly trying to come up with a way to avoid answering with the whole truth.</p><p>Blaise groggily turned to his friend from his spot on the nearby armchair in interest. Theo and Goyle, too, were awake enough to pay closer attention to the outcome. After several tense minutes, Draco finally extended his hand, glaring at the group who were all staring at him in shock. The vial had hardly touched his hand before it was thrown back and Draco grabbed a second.</p><p>“Pansy. Truth or Dare?” He asked as he sat up on the couch.</p><p>“What?” The witch’s good mood completely vanished as the question dawned on her.</p><p>“You heard me. Truth….or dare?” Draco’s icy grey eyes stared her down in challenge and a small smirk played at the corners of his lips.</p><p>“I-That’s-I’m not playing!” Her eyes widened in panic.</p><p>“It’s only fair, Pansy, dear,” Blaise grinned.</p><p>“Answer the question,” Draco demanded.</p><p>“No!” She nearly screamed and jumped up from her seated position on the floor. Despite his drowsy state, Blaise’s hand shot out to grab her wrist, preventing her escape. Draco helped his dark-skinned friend hold her down against the couch he had stood from.</p><p>“So is that a ‘pass’?”</p><p>“I think it is, Draco,” Blaise grunted as the witch attempted to knee his crown jewels.</p><p>Five vials still lay where Pansy had deposited them, near where she had been sitting. Plucking one from the floor, Draco unstoppered it and held it over the witch’s face.</p><p>“You know the penalty for passing, Pansy.” Draco’s grin was almost maniacal as Blaise forced her mouth open. They ignored her frustrated screams that woke everyone in the common room and poured the contents down her throat, making sure to cover her mouth so she would be forced to swallow it. When they were satisfied that she had done so, they released her and made their way for the boy’s dorms, the rest of their group following suit.</p><p>“What? Where are you going?” Pansy cried out from her sprawled position among the pillows.</p><p>“To bed?” Draco said. “It’s late and I’m tired.”</p><p>“B-but, what about me?”</p><p>“What<em> about</em> you?”</p><p>“I-I wasn’t playing. Why’d you make me take the potion?”</p><p>“Pansy, dear, if the potion was harmless, then you have nothing to worry about.” The witch set her mouth in a grim line, unable to argue, since she had in fact promised that the potion was harmless. And it <em>was</em>. But that didn’t mean it was going to be a pleasant experience.</p><p>She watched as the rest of the eighth year Slytherins disappeared to their respective dorms before she finally stood up and followed. Sleep evaded her as she imagined every horrible scenario that could take place because of the potion. She hadn’t seen exactly which one Draco had given her, so she couldn’t be sure what to avoid. The next week was going to be Hell.</p>
