    <p>Once upon a time the youngest of three girls set out to find a Juniper tree. An evergreen conifer with blue berries, and small yellow flowers. Juniper Black left a note by the kitchen sink, grabbed a bagful of useful items, and set off. She went down a winding road, skipping over trickling streams and fallen tree trunks until she reached the bottom of her mountain. Which in her unbiased opinion looked as plain as the top or middle of the mountain. Continuing on she made her way into a village through a rusty and decayed kissing gate. It was a small village but it contained the one place she believed she could find a Juniper tree, a garden center.</p><p> </p><p>The Frunsbury garden center trees were displayed in a small courtyard. The saplings were planted in pretty blue pots in front of a grown corresponding tree. And, the most recent edition, dwarfed by an oak and a yew, was a Juniper tree. An evergreen conifer with blue female berries, and small yellow male flowers. This one was female and its berries had not yet ripened and were still in the shape of green flowers.</p><p> </p><p>Years of pent up frustration left her in an elated squeal. And, after admiring the tree for a good while, she had skipped all the way home. There she began to think. Seeing a Juniper tree had been her life's dream for a while but now that she had seen one, what would be her next dream. She stewed on this conundrum for a while at her desk. All her family had a dream, one that they followed no matter what. Since great great grandpa Phineas was disowned for his dreams of muggle-borns right’s.</p><p> </p><p>Great-grandpa Isiah dreamed of being a craftsman and great aunties Fay and Queenie dreamed of keeping the furniture shop going. Grandad Eddie dreamed of having a large family. Her own dad dreamed of being a master wandmaker. Not having a dream would be terrible. But, dreams were unique, she couldn’t make herself a dream, she’d have to come across it. Settled on waiting little Juniper decided to find something to do.</p><p> </p><p>Things to do were easily found in a family as large as hers. For everyone needed bits and pieces for their own hobbies and work. You could find brooms, paper, recipes, abacuses, telescopes, and anything else really. Juniper couldn’t imagine not opening a cupboard and having several boxes near miss her head. But, the best thing to do, in Juniper's unbiased opinion, was tailoring.</p><p> </p><p>All of Juniper’s best clothes had come from aunt Diane’s and uncle Charles’ studio. The studio also functioned as an observatory so many of her fine dresses were detailed with fine stars and galaxies. While her aunt sewed her uncle would spout interesting facts and predictions that he saw in the sky.</p><p>“Venus is bright tonight.”</p><p>“Bad year to be a Pisces.”</p><p>“Might invest in some life insurance.”</p><p> </p><p>Today neither of them were in and all their work was neatly packed away from snooping nieces. Juniper’s embroidery hoop was in her special little drawer and she sat on a piano stool to get a good half-hours work in. Little witches weren’t made to sit still however and a half-hour is all she did before she went looking for another thing to do. Down from the tower, the studio was found in was the craft room where aunt Queenie’s workers made furniture for the shop. The smell of freshly cut cedar and ash was lovely but it was simply too busy for her to not get underfoot. Next door was her father's workshop.</p><p> </p><p>The workshop was decidedly un-magical for making such magical processes within. A table and some cubby holes to store the finished product. It was dangerous to have any magic other than the core and wood you were working with for your wand lest there will be unwanted effects. Her father made wands tailored to each wizard who commissioned him. He wouldn’t serve just anyone though. Same as the furniture store. Prejudiced purebloods were not welcome in any Black establishment. So Isiah Black’s II wands’ went to wizards like Celestina Warbeck ‘The singing sorceress.’</p><p> </p><p>He was varnishing and painting an oak wand now, for cousin Sawyer who’d yet again broken his wand. Her dad was grizzly like a bear and as protective of his children as one too. Her mum seemed to absolutely love this about him as her aunt and uncles often teased. It seemed something a ten-year-old <em> ‘would learn when they’re older’ </em>so she buried her head in his scruff just like mum, unashamedly.</p><p> </p><p>Sawyer’s new wand was similar to the last one with black vines painted from the tip down but this time there were a few pink buds circling the top and bottom of the handle. Had Sawyer fallen in love? Her father smiled as she gaped at his work.</p><p>“You’ll be getting one when you're eleven June-bug and no sooner.” He chuckled.</p><p>“I want to do magic not just learn about it,” she whined but it fell on deaf ears. All her sisters and cousins had said the same thing at some point.</p><p> </p><p>All too soon her father encouraged her out of his workshop and she was on the hunt for yet another thing to do. Which she did not find before lunch. Somber and rather downtrodden Juniper went to talk to her Grandpas’ paintings. While she had tried to wait she had really wanted to find her new dream today.</p><p> </p><p>All the family paintings were in the attic. Grandpa Phineas and Eddie’s were small paintings and could fit above the stairway while the rest were on the further side of the room. Various chairs and magnum opuses were placed about the room for the paintings to praise and admire. Although one or two had been covered on command.</p><p> </p><p>Grandpa Phineas had thick black hair that most of his descendants inherited except aunt Queenie, aunt Diane, and Juniper herself. His face was neutrally stern but brightened up when talking to just about anyone. Grandpa Eddie also had thick black hair but with flecks of sandy brown to grey at his temples. He was ever cheerful as he had been in life.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello Juniper, good day?” said grandpa Eddie</p><p>“I suppose, I found a Juniper tree and fulfilled my dream.” she sighed.</p><p>“And, you need a new dream little Bug?” asked grandpa Phineas, knowingly. Juniper hummed in ascertaining. “Perhaps,” His eyes twinkled as much as a painting could.</p><p>“I thought you were joking about that,” said Eddie.</p><p>“Perhaps, your new dream could be going to Hogwarts.” Juniper reeled back in shock. The Black family didn’t go to Hogwarts! And, she told the old painting such. This caused the two old men to begin squealing in laughter. Until, unexpectedly, grandpa Isiah spoke up from the opposite wall.</p><p>“Why would she fulfill that dream, it should be personal to her?”</p><p> </p><p>“Why would anyone want to go to Hogwarts Son? To learn.”</p><p>“But, I can learn with Aunt Queenie, like dad and everyone else?” Phineas’ smile strengthened at that.</p><p>“You can but do you want to?” And, that question plagued her for the entire night. There was nothing wrong with aunt Queenie. There was nothing with Hogwarts. But, which would she choose given the choice? She didn’t decide until her eleventh birthday.</p><p> </p><p>It was often a tradition that Grandpa Phineas’ old friend Dumbledore would visit the Trinket Manor on a child’s eleventh birthday and make horrible jokes about Uncle Phineas’ name. He would bring with him the child’s Hogwarts invitation and an actual gift they would appreciate. Juniper’s birthday was no different. He had visited just three months ago for cousin Howard’s birthday afterall. But, Juniper would not be as dismissive of the Hogwarts letter this year. She had skimmed through Howard’s letter and decided that she would go to Hogwarts.</p><p> </p><p>It might have been best to mention this before the party. It would definitely have been best to mention it before her father had taken a gulp of tea. But, that is the way life sometimes went. Splattered across the breakfast table.</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You want to go to Hogwarts?” asked her dad eyebrows raising. Mum was carefully dabbing at his tea-soaked beard while sending worried glances across to Juniper. The rest of the family had taken it quite the same way. Even Grandma, a muggle, and Uncle Charles, who’d been a Hufflepuff. Dumbledore simply sat and had his eye twinkles say it all for him. Not a single member of the Black family, who’d been born in the black family, had gone to Hogwarts for years.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I suppose it wouldn’t be too dangerous anymore.” Said aunt Diane with a quivering smile. “And, there’d be a lot less self-teaching and teachers to ask if you're stuck, I know you struggled with that Isiah.” Dad nodded numbly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Junie does take after you Izzy, it could be for the best.” Added uncle Charlie.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But, there’d be less time to do the things you love and you’d be far from home.” said her mother biting her lip, “You’re not jumping into this are you- You have considered.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Black in Phineas’ line to come to Hogwarts,” added Dumbledore, eyes still twinkling. Soon everybody had one or several opinions about it all. Juniper felt herself become slightly queasy. Then she met her father's eye.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“First Black to go to Hogwarts, Eh.” He smiled from ear to ear. “ I think it’s a wonderful idea.” That, of course, was not the end of the debate and as Juniper swished her new wand around with her siblings and cousins the adults set out the details. But, Juniper felt all was well as she tried out her first charm under her older sister's guidance.</span>
