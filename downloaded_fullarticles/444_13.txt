    <p align="justify">As sex parties went, it was by no means the most extravagant that Sirius Black had attended. He could pluck any number of memories from his mind of miniature dragons breathing fire from the bar; of shimmering images of lithe witches and wizards shapeshifting as they danced in time to exotic music; of the sharp sting of liquor lapped from someone’s secret places, glittering in the half light, debauched and delicious. <br/><br/>But tonight at The Auror—Kingsley Shacklebolt’s club for the <em>discerning</em> witch or wizard—was casual. One of The Violet Thestrals’ old albums was playing through the overhead speakers, the familiar <em>thump-thump-thump</em> of the bass a steady comfort. Sirius glanced around the room, noting how it was filled with far more familiar faces than usual. <em>Where were the new people when you wanted them?</em>, Sirius thought, taking another swift sip of his gillywater and tonic. He glanced at the fairy-lights strung around the knotted, uneven wooden beams that supported the roof, the way that the steps up to the dance floor had been lined with <em>mimbulus mimbletonia</em>, the plants swaying in time with the music. Tonight felt cosy, for want of a better word; it felt like stepping back in time a little bit to the moment when The Auror had been a monthly party in Kingsley Shacklebolt's living room. <br/><br/><em>Speak of the sorcerer and he shall appear</em>, Sirius thought, as Kingsley swept over to him, a bedazzled purple robe slung loosely around his bare shoulders. He placed a swift kiss on both of Sirius’ cheeks.<br/><br/>“Sirius Black,” he all but purred, his voiced mellow and lilting. “Been a while since I’ve seen you around here.” <br/><br/>“The flighty temptress of business has taken me overseas, Kingsley,” Sirius replied with a grin, spreading his arms wide in a <em>what can you do</em> gesture. “It’s good to be back.” <br/><br/>“No Miss McKinnon tonight?” <br/><br/>Sirius laughed and jerked his chin to one corner of the dance floor, where his girlfriend had her arms around the ebony curves of one Dorcas Meadowes. “Getting her fix,” he chuckled. <br/><br/>"Ah, some things don't change, hey?" <br/><br/>Sirius gave a good-natured shrug and took a sip from his drink. “Tell you what is new, though. James seems awfully chummy—“ he nodded towards where James was leaning against a wooden beam, talking to some redhead that Sirius didn’t recognise. “Want to fill me in?” <br/><br/>Kingsley followed Sirius’ gaze. “Lily,” he said with a wicked grin. “Not long out of Hogwarts, and not long on the scene.”<br/><br/>“Another novice?” Sirius nudged Kingsley with his elbow. “Where are all the old-hands, old man, who know what they’re doing?” <br/><br/>“Who are you calling <em>old man</em>? You’re not far from thirty! Anyway, you want to count your blessings,” Kingsley chided with a chuckle. “When I was a young man, we only had Aberforth Dumbledore’s—“<br/><br/>“Yeah yeah, you only had crumbly old Aberforth’s pub to hook up in. Change the record.”<br/><br/>Kingsley let out an amused hiss, and took a sip of gillywater from the glass one of the bartenders had instinctively placed before him on the bar. He rolled the ice cubes around his glass, watching how they collided with each other and the sides of the glass. <br/><br/>“It’s quieter at the moment,” he said eventually. “I think… well, I know the talk from the Ministry has people scared. Threats of <em>raids</em> and <em>curfews</em>, like that’s going to stop me.” <br/><br/>“They try and close down The Auror, Kingsley, and I’ll fucking skin em alive,” Sirius replied pointedly. <br/><br/>The two of them stood in silence for a few minutes, surveying the scene. Fabian Prewett was on the other side of the room, and Sirius contemplated going over; that <em>delicious</em> night he’d spent with Fabian and Marlene a couple of months ago was still burning bright in the back of Sirius’ mind. Then, Kingsley spoke again. <br/><br/>“The Doc was called in for questioning last week.” <br/><br/>“What?” <br/><br/>“Pulled him right out of the Leaky Cauldron when he was trying to have a quiet drink and all.” <br/><br/>“Merlin.” Sirius winced and put his empty glass back down on the bar top, gesturing lazily for the bartender to refill it. “He say anything?” <br/><br/>Kingsley shook his head. “No, for all his faults, he’s a subtle man. Wasn’t going to walk in there and say <em>I’m Caradoc Dearborn, and I’m the one at Shacklebolt’s sex parties who can supply any kind of pill a person might want</em>, was he?” <br/><br/>Sirius thought for a minute. Admittedly, no matter how many times he’d bought from The Doc, he’d never seen him anything other than sober. No booze, no pills. <br/><br/>“Anyway,” Kingsley continued, “I don’t think there was anything of interest to them out of that interrogation. The Doc looked a mess afterwards, though.”<br/><br/>Sirius felt the bud of anger bloom in his chest. The Auror was <em>home</em>. It was the place where no one had ever questioned who he was, or what he wanted. It was the name whispered on all the lips of the queer Hogwarts students when they sought out someone’s company who might just understand, passed back-and-forth like some talisman that might just keep them going until they could step into its sacred halls and shed that skin of false pretence. <br/><br/>“What the fuck do they want, anyway?” he asked angrily, swiping up the new drink that had been put beside Kingsley’s. “We’re not fucking hurting anyone.” <br/><br/>“No, but we are free.” Kingsley’s mellifluous voice had taken on a cautious tone. “That’s always dangerous to people, Sirius. You know that, don’t you, with your family? They don’t hate you because you’re queer, they hate you because you’re <em>free</em>. Free to love unashamedly and unrestricted. Free to be honest, to honour yourself and who you are more than any faux sense of propriety. That’s why they hate us.” <br/><br/>“What, so Fudge is just going to swoop in here with his raids and his curfews and think that it’s going to wipe queer wizards off the face of the planet?” <br/><br/>Kingsley chuckled darkly and shook his head. “Fudge is just the front man. It’s all the rest of them—Voldemort, and the Malfoys, and all the rest of that lot. The ones who say that this is about morality, when really it’s about supremacy. You mark my words, they’ll start saying that queer magic wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for Muggles. We’ve got to fight that.”<br/><br/>“And what happens if we lose?” <br/><br/>“Regardless of what happens, at the end of all of it, I’m convinced there’ll be no gentle epilogue for them. None of them. They don’t deserve it.” <br/><br/>Sirius smiled at his friend, his features softened from the sharp scowl he’d been sporting. Kingsley was a good man; the best of men. Father figure, mentor, protector. “We won’t let this story get to an epilogue,” Sirius insisted. He wrapped an arm around Kingsley’s broad shoulders and planted an affectionate kiss to his temple. “I promise.” <br/><br/>Kingsley gave him a grateful smile. “Anyway,” he said, nodding towards the DJ booth. Sirius followed the gesture with his gaze to see John Dawlish, gesturing over with a grin on his face and a drink in hand. “Johnny’s calling.” <br/><br/>"He looks like he's had about seven too many, and he's <em>definitely</em> not doing anything with those records."<br/><br/>Kingsley laughed; a broad, beaming grin that showed off a glittering gold tooth on one side of his mouth. He patted Sirius' chest affectionately. "Sirius, darling, he never does anything with the records. I've been with that man for nearly twenty years, and he's always been a terrible DJ. I charmed the turntable so it's not connected to the speakers, he's just never noticed..."<br/><br/>Sirius guffawed as the other man waved, and wandered through the throng of people towards the DJ booth. The smile slipped from his face as Sirius watched Kingsley go. His heart ached—for Kingsley, for John, for the whole sorry mess. For this place that had welcomed him with open arms after he’d left the security of Hogwarts, the first place he’d come to understand as somewhere he could belong. The Auror made things easy. It made it easier for him to love Marlene, by giving him a place where he could find an outlet for all those desires that didn’t fit into the stereotypical boxes of <em>man, loving woman</em>, regardless of how long they had been together or what they looked like to people on the outside. The Auror gave them both a place where they could breathe. It was the place that Marlene could envelop herself in Dorcas Meadowes’ embraces, and Sirius wouldn’t feel <em>jealous</em>, because it was the place that had taught him how to curb that jealousy and temper it with joy.<br/> <br/>Sirius glanced back over to where James was leaning against the beam, still deeply engrossed in his conversation with the redhead—Lily, that was what Kingsley had said her name was. Sirius idly ran his eyes over James’ figure, paying attention—for once—to what he was wearing, the way he’d styled his hair. James was tall, solid like an old oak tree, with his long limbs and steady core. Very little about that had changed since they were teenagers, experimenting in the Gryffindor dormitories out of sheer boredom…<br/><br/>Sirius shook that thought from his head, and turned. He could think about <em>James, undressed</em> at any time; walk into James’ bedroom in their shared flat, if he really wanted, and bend his head to mark blooms across James’ collarbones like they were teenagers again. Sirius chuckled to himself at thought—<em>talk about bringing up the past.</em> It had been a long time since he and James had been involved like that…<br/><br/>Sirius turned to pick up his drink again when he noticed a man he didn't recognise on the opposite side of the bar. He was young—Sirius estimated that he couldn't have been older than twenty—and sported a pattern of scars across one side of his face that almost took Sirius' breath away. He had auburn hair, which sat in unruly curls atop his head, and hazel eyes that were very firmly fixed on James. The look on the man's face wasn't irritation that James was chatting up this girl; to Sirius, it looked almost more like mild interest. <br/><br/>The scars were curious. No, curious was the wrong word—<em>beautiful.</em> Yes, that was a better way of describing the raised lines that shimmered silver in the light of the bar, that seemed to draw a line right down the middle of the young man's face so that the left side of it was carved of ice and cut glass. Sirius felt the familiar heat pool in his chest, that sensuous desire that would spread around his body with every breath. He grinned to himself, leaving the glass of gillywater half drunk on the bar, and sauntered over. <br/><br/>“You want another drink, or are you just going to nurse those ice cubes for the rest of the night?” Sirius nodded towards the empty glass that the man was rolling between his hands. He stopped, eyes snapping from where he was watch James and Lily to Sirius' face. For a second, a flicker of surprise seemed to dance in his features before he spoke. <br/><br/>“It’s alright, I’ll—“ <br/><br/>“You sure? I’m ordering anyway.” <br/><br/>There was a breath of silence. <br/><br/>“Are you sure?” <br/><br/>“Certain,” Sirius said. “Firewhisky, right?” <br/><br/>"Please." <br/><br/>Sirius signalled to the bartender, who walked over. He ordered a gillywater, neat, and a firewhisky on the rocks, studiously schooling his face into something casual. He didn’t want to look at this young man with his fascinating face and his long fingers and his round, short vowels that sounded so <em>different</em> to Sirius. <br/><br/>Sirius paid up and slid the glass of firewhisky over, before reaching out a hand to introduce himself. “Sirius Black.” <br/><br/>“Remus Lupin.” The young man's handshake was firm, but not overly so; not one of those men who wanted to <em>prove</em> things before he'd even set foot in the bedroom, Sirius thought. <br/><br/>"Don't think I've seen you around before," he said. <br/><br/>“Don’t think you have.” <br/><br/>The conversation flowed lightly between them, easy and natural—if only for the fact that Remus asked most of the questions and Sirius answered them. Sirius would push back a little, try and find out what Remus did—<em>bit of this, bit of that</em>—or where he was from—<em>lived in London for a while now</em>—or something that might give Sirius some clue about who this deliciously mysterious creature before him was. But, to no avail. <br/><br/>Eventually, Sirius finished his gillywater, and leant a little closer to Remus. "So," he murmured, "seeing as you've successfully avoided all my attempts to get to know you, perhaps you'd like to cut straight to the point and we can head upstairs so I can... show you the ropes." <br/><br/>"Bold of you to assume I don't know what I'm doing." <br/><br/>“Baby boy, I know a novice when I see one,” Sirius said slowly. Mirth danced in his eyes as he looked at Remus. “You want to come upstairs?” <br/><br/>Remus let out a low chuckle. "Are all your chat up lines like this?" He raised his eyebrows at Sirius, taking a long sip of whisky. "Are they all so... forced?" <br/><br/>"Forced?" Now it was Sirius' eyebrows that shot up. "Do you know, in all my years of fucking about here, I don't think I've ever heard that." <br/><br/>"That's because everyone here is old and probably uses the same chat up lines too." <br/><br/>"You little shit," laughed Sirius. And fuck if this wasn't refreshing, this tete-a-tete. As much as The Auror was great, Sirius did miss the opportunity to spar like this, to dance round someone unknown and uncharted. <br/><br/>The song that was playing above them came to a close, and there was a pause in the music. It felt like the room was holding its breath, as though all of them were eavesdropping on this little conversation, until the familiar chords of Elphius Brazenbeak sounded above them, and the rich vocals rang out. <br/><br/><em>What's the use in knowing all your secrets? Never wanted more than just an hour or two with you...</em><br/><br/>"Yeah," Remus muttered, reaching out and running the pad of his thumb across Sirius' lips. "I'll go upstairs with you then, Sirius Black."<br/> <br/>The sensation made Sirius stir in his boxers, and all he could think about was replacing that thumb with Remus' cock, letting it slip across his lips until they were slick with pre-come before taking it in his mouth. "Ok," he muttered against Remus' thumb. "Ok." <br/><br/>Sirius usually would have made some comment about the people on the dancefloor parting like the waves when they walked towards the little door at the back of the room, so innocuous, and yet promising so much. But he couldn't form those words; he couldn't find either the sarcastic quip or the dirty joke that would fill the silence that hummed between them. Remus, for his part, seemed utterly unfazed. <br/><br/>As they passed Marlene and Dorcas, the blonde looked up. Her eyes flicked between Sirius and Remus, and she almost <em>purred</em>. “Have fun.”<br/><br/>Sirius grinned wickedly. Part of the deliciousness of this was Marlene’s permission, her unequivocal <em>yes</em> that said he could play with who he wanted to. He winked at her, before sliding his hand into Remus' and pulling the other man towards the door. <br/><br/>The staircase behind it was narrow, a twisting thing that was only wide enough for them to walk one-at-a-time, climbing higher and higher into the bones of the building. Sirius could feel Remus' heartbeat in his palm as he reached behind him to keep their hands clasped; the thought of all that adrenaline rushing through the younger man made Sirius feel on fire. Then, Remus spoke, distracting Sirius from counting out the rapid pulse fluttering beneath his fingertips. <br/><br/>“You know her?” Remus asked. "The blonde." <br/><br/>“My girl,” explained Sirius. <br/><br/>“Oh.” There was something in that tone that sounded... not disappointed, Sirius thought, but <em>disapproving</em>. They had reached the top of the staircase and ducked through the archway. Now they were side-by-side, he glanced out the corner of his eye at Remus. The scars really were fascinating; now he was closer, the patina across his pale skin almost looked regular, intentional.<br/><br/>Sirius bit back the urge to ask about the scars. Instead, he raised his eyebrows at Remus. “Lots of couples here. I thought you brought your partner? Redhead, talking to my mate.” <br/><br/>“Lily?” Remus laughed. “She’s a friend, definitely nothing more." <br/><br/>"Why were you looking at her like that then?" <br/><br/>"Like what?"<br/><br/>"I don't know, like you wanted to sleep with her. Like she was yours."<br/><br/>"I wasn't looking at her like she was mine," scoffed Remus, "I was looking out for her. Anyway, are you sure your girl doesn’t mind you coming upstairs with me?” <br/><br/>“Glaciers melt into the same oceans they rise up from,” shrugged Sirius, knotting his fingers a little tighter with Remus’ as they walked along the upstairs corridor, past a couple wantonly fucking against the wall. “Marls and I always find our way home.” <br/><br/>They reached the end of the corridor, and Sirius grinned. The little light outside his favourite room was glowing green in its bracket. He paused, and turned to Remus. "You been up here before?" <br/><br/>Remus shook his head. Sirius opened the door in response, and beckoned him inside. <br/><br/>It was like stepping into a pocket of the night's sky. The room was almost entirely covered in midnight blue velvet—so dark it bordered on black—and covered in a glittering embroidery that mapped out the intricacies of the constellations. <em>Aquila</em> to <em>Delphinus</em> to <em>Lyra</em> to <em>Hercules</em>, each tiny detail of the stars and planets woven into the fabric that covered the walls and ceiling. Sirius heard Remus take in a breath of awe as the two of them made their way into the room, the door shutting behind them with a soft thud. <br/><br/>"Cool, huh?" Sirius asked. He led Remus towards the bed in the centre of the room, pausing momentarily to point to a cluster of stars. "<em>Canis majoris</em>. That's my constellation." <br/><br/>"Did you seriously bring me to this room so that we could fuck under your own namesake? That's bold."<br/><br/>Sirius chuckled, and pointed to another constellation. "No, you dickhead, I just like it in here. Anyway, we'll be fucking under your constellation, too—that's the Lupus constellation. That's what your name means, doesn't it? Remus Lupin. Wolf." <br/><br/>Remus let out a small noise—perhaps agreement, Sirius wasn't sure. He was staring hard at the Lupus constellation, eyes flicking from star to star. <br/><br/>"So," Sirius said slowly, circling back round Remus with a look on his face that could only be described as <em>hungry</em>. "How about we talk about how to make this first time something to remember?"<br/><br/>“It’s not my first time,” Remus scoffed and returned his attention to Sirius. <br/><br/>“Why so tense, hmm?” Sirius stood behind him, slipping his hands onto the other man’s shoulders and gently rolling the muscles between his fingers. He leant forward to place a soft kiss on Remus’ neck, grinning into his skin when he heard Remus let out a gentle moan. “It doesn’t matter if this is your first time or not, we’re still going to talk about boundaries.” <br/><br/>Sirius stepped away from Remus and stood there, waiting for an answer. And really, he meant it—if Remus decided that he didn't want this anymore, then Sirius would stop, would walk him back down the stairs to the bar and buy him another drink, would introduce him to Kingsley and to Fabian. The Auror was a place that did away with those rules that said in order for someone to give, another must take; the parity of individuals, the rich bloom of an enthusiastic yes—that's what dictated the space and the people in it. <br/><br/>"Alright," Remus said finally with a slight smile, "I'm here to fuck, not to get to know you."<br/><br/>"<em>Oof</em>—" Sirius clutched at his chest and feigned hurt as he slipped his feet out of his suede shoes. "Ok, big man, I get it. No idle chitchat. Anything else?"<br/><br/>Remus shrugged. "I'm afraid I'm a simple man with simple tastes—arguably verging on boring. You?”<br/><br/>Sirius shook his head. "No such thing as boring," he said. “We use protection charms, obviously. No daddy kinks, no pain play, no watersports. And look, Remus, I'll be honest with you, all I really want to do is go down on you.”<br/><br/>“And in return?”<br/><br/>Sirius laughed, watching as Remus ran a hand over one bicep. “Er, that’s not how this works for me. I don’t expect. Call it a kink, if you will, but this really isn't transactional.”<br/><br/>Remus narrowed his eyes in slight disbelief. “You’re telling me you’re willing to give me a blow job and… you don’t want anything in return? At a sex club?” <br/><br/>Sirius barked out another laugh. “Remus, it’s not that I’m just willing. I want to. Very much. But only if you want me to, obviously.” <br/><br/>Remus reached out a hand, gathering up the fabric of Sirius' shirt in his fist. "You'll have to shut up if you want my dick in your mouth," he said mildly. <br/><br/>Sirius didn’t bother answering that. He bent his head to press his lips against Remus', to run his tongue across them and feel the way the patina of scars on the left side bled into the soft pink skin. Remus released his grip on Sirius' shirt, instead threading his hands through Sirius' dark hair, pulling lightly at the strands and making Sirius groan against him. This man was infuriating, if only for the fact that he seemed to know exactly what it was that got Sirius going. The play fighting, the aggressive back-and-forth, the way he didn't expect Sirius to reduce himself to some giggling giddy stereotype, or vice versa. <br/><br/>Sirius pulled back, an amused frown on his face. "Are you always this salty, by the way? Because this is some of the most aggressive flirting I've ever experienced, and I'm not saying I'm not into it but—"<br/><br/>Remus rolled his eyes. "Do you ever stop talking? Get on your knees, Black."<br/><br/>Sirius, for once, did as he was told. He manoeuvred Remus towards the bed, pushing him into a sitting position. His hands made light work of Remus' belt buckle, his button, because this was what Sirius was desperate for; his hands shook with adrenaline and excitement as he lowered the zip on Remus' trousers over where his erection strained against the fabric. Sirius palmed him over the material of his boxers, delighting in the way a whimper escaped Remus' lips. He thought about teasing the other man a little more, making him wait, perhaps even making him beg, but Sirius was too greedy for that now. He moved Remus' boxers, the other man canting his hips up for Sirius to slip them down. <br/><br/>And<em> Merlin</em>, Remus was packing. Sirius tried hard not to let out a surprised—albeit joyful—chuckle, because Remus really was fucking divine like this. Instead, he bent his head and after muttering a quick protection charm, kissed lightly against Remus' shaft, teasing him with soft ministrations until he was leaking, breathing heavy.<br/><br/>Sirius took Remus in his mouth, slowly. He relished the noise of the soft inhale that Remus took, the way his chest and stomach jumped with the rush of air to his lungs. Sirius fucking loved doing this, bringing someone to their knees until they were quaking, begging, all because of his mouth. He teased his tongue around the tip of Remus' cock, humming in delight at the taste of pre-come. <br/><br/>"<em>Fuuuuck</em>," Remus groaned, running his hand through Sirius' hair almost absentmindedly. "That feels so fucking good." <br/><br/>Sirius looked up through long eyelashes at him, grey eyes meeting hazel. He knew he must look filthy like this, with his eyes still full of that arrogance that they always were, while his mouth was full of Remus' cock. Really, the effect it had on Remus was self-evident—he went slack-jawed when their eyes met, a rich and throaty groan emitted from his open mouth. <br/><br/>Sirius began to move faster, one of his hands coming to tease at Remus' balls, massage them gently between his fingers. He took Remus further into his mouth, knowing that the pressure and the heat and the wetness was driving him wild, because Sirius knew he was good at this. He'd <em>always</em> been good at this; taken to it like a duck to water, really. And he was in his element like this, with Remus' cock in his mouth and the other man groaning and grinding beneath him, growling out a litany of <em>fuck</em> and <em>Sirius</em> and <em>Jesus fucking Christ</em>. Sirius moved his fingers to press against that magic little spot behind Remus' balls, and was rewarded with a wanton groan that seemed to reverberate all the way from Remus' chest down to Sirius' mouth. <br/><br/>Then, he was coming in hot ropes into Sirius' mouth. The salty tang hit Sirius' tongue and he greedily drank it down, craving the taste over and over again because it was so fucking good. Even better, though, was the rush of <em>Sirius</em> from Remus' mouth; a brief vulnerability that made Sirius' hairs stand on end and his stomach turn over in delight. <br/><br/>Sirius sat back and looked at Remus—<em>looked at his handiwork</em>—with a feral grin. Remus looked fucking undone; shirt rucked up, cheeks flushed, only highlighting that delicious set of marks that Sirius wanted to adorn with his own, scrape his teeth against and pull red and purple bruises from the skin. One of Remus' auburn curls had fallen forward onto his forehead, and Sirius thought he looked fucking beautiful; like some god in one of those Muggle paintings—<em>Pre-Raphaelite</em>, that was it—that Sirius loved so much. <br/><br/>He lifted a hand and wiped his mouth with the back of it. "Good?" he asked.<br/><br/>Remus let out a laugh, the lightest laugh Sirius had heard from him all evening, and panted. "What the fuck do you think?"<br/><br/>"I think," replied Sirius slowly, as he placed his hands on Remus' thighs and moved his thumbs gently back-and-forth, "that I didn't do too badly for an old man with forced chat-up lines."<br/><br/>Remus laughed again and stared up at the ceiling, wide-eyed and grinning. Sirius stayed where he was, continuing with the little gesture with his thumbs, waiting for Remus to ride the crests of these waves of pleasure. <br/><br/>For Sirius' part, he was fucking hooked. He couldn't stop looking at Remus like this, all those layers of sarcasm and careful confidence pulled back until Remus was revealed, unburdened, undone. The scars across the side of his face glittered a little more—<em>glowed</em>, almost—and Sirius wondered for not the first time that night whether they were the result of magic or of misadventure. <br/><br/>After they had sat in silence together for a few minutes—comfortable, easy silence, it must be said—Remus glanced back down at Sirius. He cocked his head to one side. "You sure this is all you want?" <br/><br/>"Positive," Sirius affirmed, pushing himself off his admittedly-aching knees and stretching. He slipped his feet back into his suede shoes, and moved lazily to lean over Remus, pulling from him a long, slow kiss. Sirius knew that Remus could taste himself on Sirius' tongue, and the thought of that made him almost shiver. <br/><br/>"Heading back to your girl, are you?" asked Remus, and Sirius couldn't tell if there was bite behind the words.<br/><br/>"Maybe," Sirius hummed and nipped at Remus' jaw. "Maybe going to find someone else, see where the night takes me." <br/><br/>Remus chuckled. "<em>Maybe</em>. Lot of things tied up in that maybe, it sounds like." <br/><br/>Sirius stood again. He stuffed his hands into his pockets and rolled his shoulders lazily. “I see you're a pretty face and a mind-reader, apparently. Don't think too hard on <em>maybe</em>, kid, it won't do you any good." He wandered to the door, and glanced over his shoulder, smirking. "Maybe I’ll see you around here again, Remus Lupin.” <br/><br/>Remus gave him a wolfish grin from the bed. "Maybe you will, Sirius Black." <br/><br/>Sirius didn’t hang around long once he was back downstairs; he felt that need to be home, to tell Marlene <em>everything</em> about tonight. He glanced around the still-packed room, trying to spot her mop of wayward blonde curls. Nowhere to be seen, he approached the bar, sliding up alongside where Dorcas Meadowes had just ordered a drink. If Marlene wasn't with Dorcas...<br/><br/>“Marls not here?” he asked Dorcas.<br/><br/>“Headed out,” she replied with a smile. “Hell of a woman, your girl.” <br/><br/>“Don’t I know it,” winked Sirius, giving Dorcas a kiss on the forehead. “You need me to walk you home or anything?” <br/><br/>Dorcas shook her head, gesturing over to where a leggy brunette was chatting to Kingsley. “Emmeline and I will take the Floo, don’t worry.” <br/><br/>“Mmkay. You two should come over and have brunch one weekend or something.”<br/><br/>Dorcas laughed. “Look at you! All grown up, inviting us to brunch like you didn't fuck my girlfriend last month.”<br/><br/>"If that's a disqualifying factor for brunch, then I dread to think what the impact will be of you fucking <em>my</em> girlfriend for the past eighteen months." <br/><br/>"Get out of here, you arsehole," chuckled Dorcas with a light slap on Sirius' arm, "before I tell your girlfriend you've been sassing me." <br/><br/>Sirius said his goodbyes to the others on the way out—Kingsley, with his arm around John and talking to Emmeline; Fabian Prewett looking awfully cosy with Benjy Fenwick by the bar. As he approached the exit, he noticed Caradoc Dearborn standing near the door, puffing clouds of violet smoke out of his trademark pipe. <br/><br/>"You alright, Doc?" Sirius asked, and Dearborn turned. He had a look on his face as though he was surprised to find himself not entirely alone. <br/><br/>"Sirius Black! I'm alright, old pal, how about you?" <br/><br/>"Never better," grinned Sirius. He stepped to one side as a gaggle of witches walked into the club, and caught Dearborn's arm. "Hey, Kingsley mentioned they picked you up last week. Questioned you." <br/><br/>Dearborn rolled his eyes and let out another plume of glittering smoke from his nostrils. "Fuckers picked me up out of the Leaky last Monday. Kept me in an interrogation room at the Ministry for six fucking hours—I missed my pick up with the Finnegans because of it, so I'm all out of Doxy Drops." <br/><br/>"Who was it?" <br/><br/>"Oh," Dearborn chuckled darkly, "at least they did me the courtesy of sending someone important to ask me questions." He stuck his nose in the air and put on an affected tone. "Lucius Malfoy,<em> Head</em> of the Department for Magical Morality."<br/><br/>"Wanker," muttered Sirius. "You're alright though, yeah?" <br/><br/>"Of course," Dearborn grinned. "They threatened to suspend my Healers' license, of course, but they've been threatening me with that for years. All because I won't work out of St Mungo's. Well, that and the fact that I'm supplying to the seventeen-year-old kids of half the Ministry, but I'm not sure <em>they</em> know that for certain." <br/><br/>Sirius laughed, and clapped Dearborn on the shoulder. "Take care of yourself, Doc." <br/><br/>"You too, kid." <br/><br/>Sirius stepped out of The Auror, looking left and right. Then, with a sharp turn on his heel, he vanished. </p><hr/><p align="justify">Sirius stood under the shower for a long time—half an hour, perhaps, maybe longer—and relished the way the water pounded hard against his back and shoulders. He'd charmed the shower the day they moved in, joking that Marlene liked to be physically assaulted by the pressure every time she stepped under the water. Once clean, Sirius rolled his head from side-to-side under the stream one last time, and reached for his towel. <br/><br/>He felt like he always did when they came back from The Auror—steadied back into equilibrium. It was the best thing he and Marlene had decided to do. Their early years had been electric and passionate and jealous, and utterly, utterly exhausting, because they loved fighting as much as they loved making up. <br/><br/>That said, Sirius and Marlene were always going to end up together. That's what James would say when he teased them; he'd say that they both just enjoyed making him suffer as third wheel. But really, Sirius knew there was a kernel of truth under the joking—he and Marlene were the sort of people that couldn't help but be drawn together, some kind of gravitational pull that meant they simply couldn't keep away. She was tornados to the heat of his fire. <br/><br/>It had started casually—Sirius wondered if there was any other way. He'd sneak down to the common room in Gryffindor Tower when he couldn't sleep, folding himself up on the hearth rug and staring into the dying embers of the fire. Sirius had never asked how Marlene had known he was there; it was seventh year, and he was angry all of the time, and there had been something so good about the way she would come and sit behind him, wrap her arms around his chest and press soft, slow kisses to the taught muscles of his shoulder blades. <br/><br/>After a while, of course, it had progressed to her sitting in his lap, one hand at the back of his neck and the other carding through his dark hair. He let his grey eyes slip closed, mouth going slack at the sensation, because he'd never felt more loved than the moments when Marlene didn't seem to need to say anything, just needed to be there, with him. And in being loved—as is so often the case—Sirius learnt to love in return. <br/><br/>That was nearly ten years ago, of course. Now they had a flat that they shared with James, and they strolled hand-in-hand down Diagon Alley on Saturday mornings together, and they fucked other people. Some things change, and some things stay the same, Sirius thought. <br/><br/>Sirius tiptoed into the dark bedroom. He noticed her damp towel piled on the floor, and smiled—she'd never change, he thought, as he picked it up and hung it over the radiator. He padded to his side of the bed, pulling back the covers and slipping under them. Marlene lay with her back to him; her chest rose and fell in the steady rhythm of sleep, and Sirius almost decided to forgo the usual routine of waking her to tell her he loved her. <br/><br/>“Hi,” Sirius murmured against the exposed skin of Marlene’s shoulder, where her night shirt had slipped to reveal constellations of freckles. She stirred a little beneath him. <br/><br/>“Hi,” she whispered, her voice soft with sleep. “Did you have fun tonight?”<br/><br/>“I did,” whispered Sirius in return, scooting closer and wrapping his arms around Marlene’s waist. He could smell the apple scent of her shampoo from her still-damp hair mingling with the sandalwood soap on his skin. <br/><br/>“Who was the guy?” <br/><br/>“Remus Lupin,” Sirius replied, stifling a yawn. “Not long around, apparently. Came with the girl Jimbo was chatting to.” <br/><br/>“Redhead, right?” <br/><br/>“Yeah, that’s the one.”<br/><br/>“Well, I’m glad it was a good night,” yawned Marlene, rolling over so she and Sirius were face-to-face. Sirius looked down at her, wrapping his arms around her and pulling her flush to his chest. <br/><br/>“I love you,” he murmured. He bent his head and pressed a gentle kiss to her lips, feeling as ever the gentle sparks of fire in his stomach as their lips met; dulled, a little, by sleep, but nonetheless there and real and <em>his</em>. <br/><br/>Marlene hummed. “I love you too.” <br/><br/>“Forever?” <br/><br/>“Forever.”</p>
