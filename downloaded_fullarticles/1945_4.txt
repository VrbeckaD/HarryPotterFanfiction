    <p>So, she may, or may not be, completely lost. Which is hardly surprising, given that this was her first time venturing into this whole new world. Still, you'd think her parents would have kept a closer eye on her, what with all the bustling children, parents and random animals wandering about.</p><p>But no, she was lost, after having wandered out of the store to get some air, before getting caught up in a wave of fast-walking shoppers. She'd finally managed to jostle her way out, but had lost sight of the shop she'd left her parents in. Huffing at the inconvenience of it all, she decided to take a look around, hoping to find someone who was willing to help.</p><p>Unfortunately, everyone was so consumed by their own business, that they barely spared a glance in her direction, let alone stopped to offer aid.</p><p>It was only when her jumper was yanked by the arm, that she realized she'd wandered into a particularly dark area. An instant feeling of blood-curdling dread came with the tugging, and she was immediately terrified</p><p>"Hallo, love. Care to keep a poor man warm, in this 'ere chilly alley?" She turned her head just slightly to catch a glimpse of the man who'd grabbed her; spying rotten teeth and a crooked nose. Fetid breath hung in the air, punctuated with the smell of rotten cloth. Before she could say anything, though, the smoothest, most silky voice she'd ever heard caressed her ears; nothing short of commanding, despite how softly the words are spoken</p><p>"Unhand that girl, immediately." There is a sudden chill in the air, seeming to freeze the man in place, as his dark brown eyes widen in fear. He regains his composure enough to shove her harshly towards the new arrival, before scuttling off into the darkness. She has no choice but to stumble face-first into a corseted chest, and is ever thankful for the comfortingly warm arms that wrap her up easily</p><p>"Are you alright?" the sharp edge has gone from the mystery woman's voice, leaving liquid white chocolate in its wake. She makes to right herself, nodding as she raises her head to thank her savior. But all movement, all time stops when their eyes meet. She stares, helplessly into the most stunning blue she has ever seen; as it seems to twinkle in the dim light of their impromptu meeting place.</p><p>The older woman seems equally as flustered as her, despite the outwardly composed visage she exudes. She watches, as the woman's throat bobs with an audible gulp, before the shell-shocked elder releases her, muttering about how she'd help find her missing parents. </p><p>They walk in silence, the unnamed heroine with such grace and poise that she feels out-of-place next to such beauty; and yet, there's nowhere else in the world she would rather be. Soon enough, her name is called from somewhere within a throng of people, and she waves her parents down with a beaming smile. She turns to the older woman, and feels her body tingle at the gentle smile aimed at her. She is about to speak, to thank the woman for her help, but is beaten to the punch, as the blonde speaks first</p><p>"Be safe, Hermione". With that, the elegant elder is gone. And Hermione has never loved the sound of her own name, quite so much as when the enigmatic heroine says it. She feels herself swoon, as she relays her tale to her parents, and wonders briefly if she'll ever see the woman again. </p><hr/><p>Narcissa felt dirty, rotten to her core, as she attempted to scrub her own thoughts away during her bath. The young girl she'd met was just that, a girl, a <em> child </em>. But that didn't stop her mind from travelling to horrid places, terrible places better suited for her husband; or the woman she had formerly known as her sister. </p><p>She was not like this</p><p>She was not some filthy pervert, she was not depraved. But her body had responded. Had buzzed with undeniable attraction when their eyes met.</p><p>She scrubbed harder, hoping to cleanse her mind and body of its vile desire.</p><hr/><p>Apart from one or two stolen glances on Platform 9 3/4 over the years, the pair managed to completely avoid one another, as they parted ways with family for the school year. But not within the confines of their own minds.</p><p>Hermione was plagued night and day with shimmering blue eyes, her name spoken like a prayer in the silence of her subconscious. Narcissa suffered similarly, as chocolate brown eyes ensnared her very soul, the gentle scent of Jasmine tickling her nose; a reminder of the scent of the young girl's hair. </p><p>They hoped for vastly different outcomes; Hermione that they would meet again, Narcissa that they never would.</p><p>Destiny seemed to favor Narcissa for a time, before it all came crumbling down at the Quidditch World Cup.</p>
