  <span>‘Mr. Potter. Cease your incessant moaning… I’m sure Mr Weasley and Miss Granger have gotten more than used to your constant prattle, but I for one won’t tolerate it. You may be </span>
  <em>
    <span>the Chosen one</span>
  </em>
  <span> but that doesn't give you the right to interrupt my class.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Yes, </span>
  <em>
    <span>sir,</span>
  </em>
  <span>’ Harry bites out, trying to hold his tongue but failing, he adds ‘though perhaps if you were to make lessons a little less mind-numbing I wouldn't feel the need to “incessantly moan”... </span>
  <em>
    <span>Professor</span>
  </em>
  <span>’ he spits out with instant regret realising it is a Hogsmeade weekend.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Ten points from Gryffindor and detention, Potter. You should know by now where arguing with me gets you.’ comes the snide reply through gritted teeth. Harry doesn’t reply, resorting instead to glare at Professor Snape for the remaining five minutes of the lesson. ‘Potter, remain after class to sort out the details of your detention.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the last of the class head for the exit, Harry leans on the bench pretending to find his old copy of ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>Magical Drafts and Potions</span>
  </em>
  <span>’ to be an enthralling read. As the heavy dungeon door creaks shut Harry looks up from his book, and when he couldn’t find Snape he turned around to see him sitting on the stool by the door with his arms crossed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Did you want to tell me what that was about, Potter?'</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Not particularly.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I’d have thought you’d prefer to have gone to Hogsmeade tomorrow,’ Snape paused, stood up and walked to the middle of the room. ‘You were riled up since the start of class, so I suggest you tell me what the bother is, I may be able to solve it and finally get some information about moonstones through that thick skull of yours.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I’d really rather not talk about it, professor.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Very well then, Saturday detention it is. Although Dumbledore has informed me that you are to start learning occlumency this term’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘What’s that?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Really, you’d think after being raised by Muggles and being introduced to the wizarding world the least you could do is pick up a book. Occlumency is the magical defence of the mind against external penetration. An obscure branch of magic, but a highly useful one.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘What! I’m not mad, and I’m not being possessed! Ginny said you black-out and I haven't.’ Harry shot back ready to fight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘We all know that Potter, but the headmaster still thinks it’s a good idea’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Of course he does,’ Harry rolled his eyes, ‘so then who is going to teach me?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I am.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘You? Why you?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Because Potter, I am a master Occlumens. We will meet once a week and you are to tell no one of this especially Dolores Umbridge’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘What about Ron and Hermione?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Fine, but ensure they keep their blabbering mouths shut about it… and if anyone should ask, you are taking remedial Potions. Monday evenings at six, my office; and seeing as you are my only Saturday detention... So far, you will come to my office and read the theory.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Remedial potions though? You have got to be kidding me, can’t we just say I have ongoing detention or something?.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Well, it isn't as though anyone who has seen you in my classes can deny your need for extra tutoring, but I suppose that would do just as well, and if someone should ask what you did to deserve ongoing detentions?.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I’ll say… I’ll say I started the rumour about you being an animagi bat that sleeps upside down in the old potion classroom.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Not enough to constitute ongoing detentions, what if you attacked me?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Wouldn’t that hurt your pride, the knowledge that I, a lowly fifth year managed to get a hit?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘More than the students thinking I’m a bat? Besides, </span>
  <em>
    <span>I</span>
  </em>
  <span> know you could never land a hit on me.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Fine, you know, I think you like being called a bat,’ said Harry making his way to the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘And Potter, If you should ever need to talk… about whatever it is </span>
  <em>
    <span>boy wonder</span>
  </em>
  <span> is having trouble with, you </span>
  <em>
    <span>can</span>
  </em>
  <span> talk to me. I know I haven’t been kind to you these last few years but I will be truthful.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Umm thanks, professor… I’ll keep that in mind.’ Harry eyed him before turning and leaving through the dungeon door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Finding Ron and Hermione just around the corner arguing about something potions related Harry decided to just keep walking hoping they would leave the episode in class be for now, he could tell them about the Occlumency lessons later… right now he just wanted to get to his History of Magic class because at least there he knows he can't get himself into any more trouble.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Come on guys class will be starting in a minute’ Harry moaned walking up the stairs, Ron and Hermione following, finally deciding to stop their arguing in order to fawn over Harry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘So what's the prognosis, Harry?’ Hermione said catching up to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Detention tomorrow and some new Voldemort stuff I gotta do.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Damn! I was really hoping he’d at least just give you detention tonight so you could come to Hogsmeade tomorrow. Hermione and I don’t really get why you said anything though, He wasn’t even being </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> mean, he just wanted us to stop talking.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Yeah, I know. I’m kicking myself for it already, can we just get to class?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘What about this Voldemort stuff?’ Hermione Asked trying to catch up to Harry’s fast-paced walk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘It’s secret so I’ll tell you guys after class.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Alright, you know that Ron and I are here if you wanna talk about anything if anything is going on or…’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘I don’t want to talk about anything, I’m fine.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Okay but mate there has to be something going on, you don’t just backchat Snape for no reason, the Greasy git loves to give you detention.’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>'I said I don’t want to talk about it, Ron!' </span>
</p><p>
  <span>'Of Course, Harry, whenever you’re ready… just as long as you know that Ron and I are here for you if and when you need to talk.'</span>
</p><p>
  <span>'Sure, when you’re not fighting, seriously it’s like we’re back in third year and Ron can’t find Scabbers,' and with that Harry stormed ahead and walking in with the rest of the class took a seat in the back corner away from everyone else. He could use some time to think.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There was a poke on his shoulder and Hannah Abbott handed over a note 'Uhh thanks Hannah' he whispered, unfolding the note.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘You sure you’re okay mate?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Sorry about the arguing and all</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>We just wanna be here for you’</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry looked up to see Ron turned around in his chair giving him a sympathetic smile, harry returned the look and got his quill and inkpot out of his bag to write his reply</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Yeah mate I’m sorry</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I'm just going through my own stuff right now and I’ll tell ya when I’m ready. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I've got some interesting stuff to talk to you two about after class I think maybe outside would be the best place to talk so there won't be anyone around and look I’m really sorry about before, you and Hermione mean the world to me and I really appreciate you guys sticking with me… no matter what right?’’</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As they were getting ready to leave the Common Room geared up with their scarves and coats Harry decided to talk to Hermione before Ron came down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Err Hermione, I just wanted to tell you something before Ron comes down because well I’m not really sure about anything and so I don’t want him knowing and you know, being all Ron about it. And I mean I know you guys are close so if you don't think you could not tell him that's fine it can wait until later it's just… well yeah I don't know how he’ll react or anything and um or what he’ll say…’ by this point, Harry had started shaking and a couple of tears and streamed down his thankfully mostly covered face</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Harry It’s fine, calm down and breathe. You can tell me anything, I won’t tell Ronald’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Alright well, the thing is… Merlin this is ridiculous. I can’t even say it’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Just take a deep breath’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Okay, I…well I think I might be gay’ he let out in a whisper that even Hermione, though only inches from his face could barely hear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Oh Harry, that’s okay… you know I don’t care, well I do care of course… Look, you love who you love and aww Harry come here!’ She pulled him in for a hug ‘I love you no matter what, now will you get that through your thick skull and stop being so snarky’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pulling away from the hug and tears streaming down his face he took a deep breath ‘Thanks ‘Mione and don’t worry I will’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘Will what?’ Ron had joined them holding a bag of lollies containing his last remaining sweets from his Honeydukes collection ‘Blimey mate, are you alright?’</span>
</p><p>
  <span>‘He’s perfectly fine aren’t you harry? He was just telling me that he’s going to try and have a bit more patience with us’ Hermione stated with a smile to harry ‘now come on you two we better go if we’re going to make it back in time for dinner’ and with that, they headed out of the portrait hole and towards the grounds.</span>
