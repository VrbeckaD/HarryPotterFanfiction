    <p>Blaise Zabini is born into a life of luxury.</p>
<p>That does not mean he is born into a life of love.</p>
<p>Blaise has never really heard the full story of how he was conceived, just that his mother was not allowed to “get rid of him”. His father was his mother’s second official husband. He’s never dared to ask more than that though.</p>
<p>For that reason he spends most of his childhood at the households of other Pureblood children, working under tutors, and generally trying to avoid his mother’s eyesight. She’s never around to see his accomplishments, only turning up for the occasional stiff and silent dinner, cutlery delicately clinking in the oppressive silence.</p>
<p>Otherwise he spends his time with the other Pureblood children, learning lessons along with them, and learning that if he is too loud, he is liable to get cursed and locked in his room for an unforeseen amount of time.</p>
<p>His first ten years pass by in such a way. He spends time with them, but never really becomes friends with them. Malfoy rules with an iron fist (or so he thinks), ordering them around, chasing peacocks, childish things like that. </p>
<p>But at the end of the day, Malfoy’s parents are always there with a small smile, a soft touch on his head, even as they continue to act as they should. When the other children are all sent home, they are greeted with that same small smile, the soft touch. Only Nott and himself steel themselves to return home.</p>
<p>There is a part of Blaise that hopes that Hogwarts will be different, that since he will be free of his mother’s constant presence, then he can allow himself small luxuries.</p>
<p>It is not to be though.</p>
<p>The day he leaves for Hogwarts, his mother stops him with her nails digging into his shoulder. Blaise doesn’t allow himself to flinch, although he feels himself going absolutely still as his mother lowers<br/>
her face to hiss in his ear.</p>
<p>He’s not sure if there is any blood in his face when he enters the train and his hands are tremble minutely.</p>
<p>
  <i>you embarrass me, i’ll kill you. sinistra will keep me abreast of what you do. </i>
</p>
<p>He will never be free of her.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>/\/\/\/\/\</p>
</center>Sometimes, it feels like he’s floating through Hogwarts. Malfoy rules, Potter causes trouble, and Blaise finds himself on the outside looking in more often than not.<p>He’s only peripherally aware of what Potter and his gang get up to, he just knows that it’s something to do with the end of the year and the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>Usually. He hears the rumours about Lupin of course, what with Malfoy running around like a headless chicken. But it never actually affects him. His mother warning hangs over his head as though she has actually cursed him. </p>
<p>So Blaise does nothing.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>/\/\/\/\/\ </p>
</center>He goes home during summer breaks and avoids his mother.<p>After his first year at Hogwarts, he doesn’t dare go back to Wilkes Manor, instead fleeing to one of the summer homes. The summer home he chooses, in Varese, becomes his safe haven. His mother never comes here, believing it to be for a lower-class person. Blaise doesn’t even notice the low quality, too busy sinking into the welcoming embrace and smell of apples that the summer house greets him with.</p>
<p>It’s the only time he feels safe during his school years. He spends time, so much time, carefully crafting and caring for the wards, for the house, for the grounds. He even starts to craft his mind after the grounds, using the plants as memories, as doors and passageways.</p>
<p>The library is dusty, but Blaise diligently works to restore each book, learning how to with charms that the summer home helpfully provides. He finds it easy, calming to work with them. At least books won’t hate him.</p>
<p>When summer is over, he goes back to Hogwarts, back to the politics and delicate stepping that is required, back to constantly watching his back from other Slytherins, from other students, from Sinistra.</p>
<p>And every time he returns to Varese, he’s greeted with the smell of apples.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>/\/\/\/\/\</p>
</center>It all comes to a head seventh year. Or perhaps more accurately, the beginning of the end was back in fourth year. But Blaise was able to ignore it until the Dark Lord comes right out to take over the Ministry and Hogwarts.<p>But even then, with everything going insane, with all the students on one side or the other, with the teachers silently rebelling as best as they can, Blaise does nothing.</p>
<p>When the Battle of Hogwarts is fought, Blaise stays inside the library, diligently protecting the books from any spell fire. Madam Pince doesn’t bother to kick him out, too busy working on other portions of the library and keeping them safe from any stray spells.</p>
<p>When the battle is over, and the Death Eaters are kicked out, Madam Pince gives him a tired, but grateful smile, one that Blaise returns. </p>
<p>He wants to stay in this moment forever.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>/\/\/\/\/\</p>
</center>But then his mother steps in. And Blaise finds it all crashing down.<p>He presents himself to the Dark Lord, still drenched in the blood of some nasty smelling muggle. The Dark Lord greets him with what he probably thinks is a smile, but Blaise can only think of a snake. </p>
<p>And willingly, Blaise bows himself before the Dark Lord and promises to serve him.</p>
<p>In some part of his mind, Blaise wishes to be back in the library in Varese.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>/\/\/\/\/\</p>
</center>Looking back, Blaise can say that it all started to change for him when Draco turns to Potter’s side. There’s a new uneasiness to the other Death Eaters, although no one dares to say anything out loud. But the knowledge that someone as high-standing as the Malfoy heir is willing to switch to the blood-traitors and mudbloods is concerning.<p>It makes Blaise start to think. And about things that Blaise doesn’t want to think about.</p>
<p>The fact that Malfoy turns to the blood-traitors and mudbloods irritates the Dark Lord, if his increased tendency to throw around cruciatus whenever anyone mentions Draco is a sign.<br/>
Irritated being a major understatement.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord starts to go through the ranks, searching for weak links, weak constitutions, being weak in any way. Blaise looks the Dark Lord in the eyes and doesn’t allow him in, standing there under the mental onslaught.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord stops and exits his mind, staring at Blaise with an unreadable expression, “Are you hiding something from me?”</p>
<p>Blaise lowers his head demurely, “No my Lord, I wanted to demonstrate my ability to help you and this cause with what I have to offer. If you so desire, I will lower my shields for you.”</p>
<p>There is silence, and the other Death Eaters behind Blaise are absolutely silent. No one even dares to breathe.</p>
<p>Finally, what passes for a smile appears on his face, “Show me you aren’t hiding something from me.”</p>
<p>Blaise drops his shields and allows the Dark Lord entry into his mind. It feels like oil, like snakes, like sludge is sliding down his spine, like his mother is slowly leaning in close with a blank expression on her face. But finally, finally, the Dark Lord leaves Blaise’s mind, and in the safety of his own mind, behind his walls, Blaise lets out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Blaise isn’t sure if that’s a good or bad thing that the Dark Lord starts to not pay as much attention to him.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>/\/\/\/\/\</p>
</center>He starts to shut away everything, carelessly going through the motions, through whatever the Dark Lord assigns him to do. He doesn’t even know how stained his hands are anymore.<p>His mother greets him one day, leaning into his space as her eyes search his, looking for something that only she knows. Blaise can’t even find it in himself to care. His mother slowly smiles, a proud tilt to her lips, and then leaves without another word.</p>
<p>Why does it feel as though as though he has just sold his soul to the devil?</p>
<p>And why is it that he just knows that his mother still won’t acknowledge his presence and will still hate him? </p>
<p>His mother invites him to stay for dinner, and then the night. And it is as though the beginning years of his life never happened, as though she never threatened him. He wants to say that this means that it will all be fine, that it will all work out.</p>
<p>But the Wilkes Manor has never felt like home. And even now, with his mother’s tentative approval, it still feels as though the Manor is testing him, testing him and finding him lacking.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>/\/\/\/\/\</p>
</center>At some point, Blaise realizes that he hasn’t gone back to Varese in a while.<p>He’s too scared.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>/\/\/\/\/\</p>
</center>He doesn’t know what mission this is, why they’re doing it, nothing. He simply nods at Rookwood, who is nearly bouncing with excitement, and waits for the Dark Lord to give out the specifics. The two of them haven’t worked together before, so there’s no small talk between them.<p>The Dark Lord sends them to France, to Lyon. Rookwood has been itching to do something, and has apparently been bugging people around him to tell him about their exploits and how it all goes down. It’s a miracle neither of them are cursed for his annoying tendencies.</p>
<p>Rookwood is ecstatic for the mission.</p>
<p>Blaise is not.</p>
<p>Rookwood picks the house; following a father as the man returns home from work. The house is private, out in the country. There is ivy crawling up the side of the house, crickets chirp softly in the distance. The house is old, bricks old and faded, some of them crumbling apart. Inside the house, the lights slowly turn on as the family moves behind the curtains. Rookwood wants to rush in now, but Blaise manages to make him wait at least a little bit, ostensibly to give the family time to relax before they burst in. Blaise isn’t really sure that’s why he stops Rookwood. Perhaps it’s how the father bends down when his son comes running out, a tender expression on his face as he runs a hand over the kid’s hair.</p>
<p>Regardless, they wait until the sun is just about to set before Rookwood blasts open the door. Pieces of the door catch the older kid in the arm, sending him to the floor. The mother instantly dives for him, hauling him up and behind her as she places herself between them and the two kids. As the father comes running in, Rookwood sends him backwards and flying into the doorframe. It catches the father in the head, causing him to start bleeding.</p>
<p>Blaise only finds himself standing there, wand half-raised.</p>
<p>Rookwood turns to the mother and the children, a sick smile crossing his face as he stares at the three. The woman is slowly backing the children up, aiming for another doorway leading further into the house. She doesn’t let her gaze waver from Rookwood.</p>
<p>As Blaise watches, the father gets up, blood pouring down the side of his face, and snags an old clock from the counter. The expression on the muggle’s face is one of determination, of knowing that he probably won’t be able to actually do anything, but determined to try anyways. He then takes the clock and bashes it against Rookwood’s head.</p>
<p>Rookwood goes down, nearly hitting his head on the corner of the counter.</p>
<p>Blaise finds himself freezing as the muggle turns to him, clock in hand, face set as he moves to stand in front of his fallen family. The woman is silent, pale as a ghost as she clutches the small child to her. The older child is trembling, hiding behind his mother as blood pours down his arm.</p>
<p>
  <i>why is it that muggles are more loving than his own mother</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>what did he do wrong</i>
</p>
<p>Inexplicably, Blaise finds himself lowering his wand. The father doesn’t move though, trembling slightly, but the clock stays at a ready. Then Blaise steps over to Rookwood, bends down, and apparates the two of them out of there.</p>
<p>They’re in Varese, just outside the old summer home. Rookwood is missing an arm, and Blaise staggers to the side as the exhaustion hits him all at once. He looks down at Rookwood, and then walks away, entering the wards of the summer home. He doesn’t even notice whether or not it smells like apples.</p>
<p>That night, Blaise gets spectacularly drunk and wakes up the next morning feeling as though a herd of hippogriffs stomped all over his brain.</p>
<p>He doesn’t even bother leaving the home for a little bit, just stays in bed, hiding away. It’s only the burning of his mark that finally gets him moving, throwing on some clothes and pretending that he isn’t hungover. Rookwood is nowhere to be seen when he apparates back, and he takes a moment to be infinitely grateful that he isn’t back.</p>
<p>When the Dark Lord asks for Blaise’s report, he doesn’t hesitate to tell the Dark Lord that Rookwood attacked him and then disappeared. He hasn’t seen the other man in hours. The Dark Lord is clearly displeased, shooting a crucio at Blaise almost half-heartedly, but Blaise clenches his hands, bites down on his lip, and refuses to scream.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord gives a kill on sight order for Rookwood, and that’s the last anyone sees of Rookwood.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>/\/\/\/\/\</p>
</center>(unknown to Blaise is how the wards of the summer house react to finding Rookwood attempting to stagger inside.<p> </p>
<p>how the wards read Rookwood’s intentions, how the wards read Blaise’s heart, his intentions, and then utterly wipe Rookwood from the earth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>wards [magicks] have never been understood. Their protectiveness goes unnoticed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>if only Blaise would act.)</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>/\/\/\/\/\</p>
</center>A small child is the reason the first resistance hideout falls. Carelessly, he asks his mother to repeat where to go if he ever needs a place to hide. But the Death Eaters who overhear are impatient and so they go immediately, not waiting to tell the Dark Lord about it. This turns out to be their downfall because the majority of the rebellion escapes into the night, only losing three people.<p>The Dark Lord is furious with the lost opportunity and kills the five Death Eaters who instigated the attack.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>/\/\/\/\/\</p>
</center>The next time the resistance hideout falls is unpleasant, for everyone.<p>There’s a pitched battle happening in a small village, near Hogsmeade. It has a small wizarding population, nobody important, but is a strategic standing point to get closer to Hogwarts. The rebellion is using tactics that Blaise doesn’t recognize, popping out of windows and over the roofs to throw spells at the invading Death Eaters. </p>
<p>Blaise isn’t sure who figures it out, only hearing some of the Death Eaters start yelling about how the secret keeper is here, how it’s one of the Patil sisters. It’s easy from there to tell that someone has found her; one of the Death Eaters who Blaise doesn’t recognize has grabbed the sister around the waist, hauling her backwards in an attempt to get out of the anti-apparition wards. She is fighting viciously, a curved knife waving in the air as she attempts to stab the Death Eater. She does manage to sink it into his shoulder, but the man doesn’t even pause. Someone else comes over to help, ripping the knife out of her hand and grabbing her legs.</p>
<p>Blaise finds that he can’t move, watching as the Patil girl is slowly being pulled towards the edge of the barrier. The rebellion members are doing their best to get to her, someone who Blaise thinks might be Lee Jordan is particularly vicious as he cuts through the Death Eaters. But the Death Eaters are equally vicious as they keep everyone from getting close enough to help.</p>
<p>And Blaise only watches as they finally manage to drag her out of the barrier and promptly apparate. Jordan lets out a scream and unleashes a barrage of explosive spells that has everyone ducking for cover. Jordan goes on a rampage from there, making even the people on his side flee away from him.</p>
<p>The Italian wants to do something, anything, but his mark begins to burn and he hurries outside the barrier to apparate back to the Selwyn mansion.</p>
<p>The scent of blood greets him.</p>
<p>The Patil’s are Purebloods, from a long line of well-respected wizards, both in Britain and India. But the Dark Lord has no care for that, only for himself and how much he can rule.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord has him enter Patil’s mind. It’s well-organized, a giant library that resembles the hidden library of Alexandria. She is sitting in the one chair available, delicately sipping at a cup of tea. She must be Padma.</p>
<p>“Zabini. Are you here to break my mind?” she asks in an almost pleasant voice. If Blaise were anyone else, he might even be convinced that Padma is helpless. But her voice has a steel note to it, the titles of the books on a closer look are more orientated towards combat spells than anything else, the knives hanging on the wall seem to be dripping blood, the windows in the library showing a raging storm.</p>
<p>“If you just tell them, then they will be kinder to you, I promise you that,” he tells her, carefully approaching her. </p>
<p>She only takes another sip of tea, “I am a Sikh. And I do not bow before the face of injustice. The rest of the rebellion will have already fled to a new location. My death will only make it so that they can find a new secret keeper. I’ve already spoken with Parvati at length about what would happen if such an event would occur. I will give the secret in ten hours. By then, the rebellion will have moved.”</p>
<p>Zabini stares at her, sees how she trembles slightly as she sets the teacup down.</p>
<p>Then he kneels in front of her, staring at her pleadingly, “Please Padma, you have to know he will only torture you until you give the secret, please.”</p>
<p>She stares at him as though she has never seen him before. Then she reaches out and places a palm against his cheek. Their skin colours are close to matching, he recognizes distantly.</p>
<p>“I will die knowing full well what to expect. Can you say the same thing for yourself?”</p>
<p>Then she pulls back from him, “Go tell him that I have nothing to say.” Blaise takes a second to close his eyes, wishing that he was brave enough to do something, anything. When he opens them again, she is watching him with almost a sad look on her face.</p>
<p>Then he exits her mind. He stays kneeling in front of her for a moment, watching as she sucks in a breath, eyes still closed. She opens them briefly to look at him, and then closes them again, dismissing him.</p>
<p>“Well Zabini?” the Dark Lord says, not bothering to move from his seat.</p>
<p>Blaise hesitates only a fraction of a second, the slight twitch the Dark Lord makes towards his wand making Blaise continue, “She is the secret keeper.”</p>
<p>Never before has a sound left him with such a feeling of despair, Padma’s soft exhale behind him making him wish he could find it in himself to do something, anything. A smile, if it could be called that,<br/>
slowly rises on the Dark Lord’s face. Slowly, lethargically, he rises from his seat, black robes swishing about him as he approaches Padma. He barely spares Blaise a glance as he flicks his fingers towards Blaise. Hurriedly, the Italian gives one final glance to Padma, and in return, she gives him one last thought. A book, a page, and then she closes her eyes, breaking the connection. Blaise hides behind some of the other Death Eaters. The Dark Lord approaches her, wand raised. </p>
<p>And as the Dark Lord tortures her, Blaise looks away.</p>
<p>It’s the longest ten hours of his life.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>/\/\/\/\/\</p>
</center>He goes to Varese.<p>It doesn’t smell like apples.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>/\/\/\/\/\</p>
</center>He finds the book, finds the page.<p>The Dark Lord has horcruxes. Blaise lets the question of if it is all worth it cross his mind once before he swiftly crushes it.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>/\/\/\/\/\</p>
</center>Then Theo starts appearing at meetings, and Blaise wonders, because Theo is unmasked for one, and was very definitely on Potter’s side, for two. He doesn’t say anything to anyone, just stands around and smirks in an unsettling way.<p>It reminds Blaise of fifth year with Umbridge, when Theo found first years and gave them detentions just because he could.</p>
<p>And the Dark Lord is always pleased with Theo, no matter what he does. And Blaise realizes, even if Theo never says, that Theo, Theo is the one who told the Dark Lord that Padma was the secret keeper.<br/>
After all, Theo is the one to suggest to the Dark Lord to put the Selwyn Manor under a Fidelius Charm, just like the resistance.</p>
<p>Blaise has never hated someone as much as he hates Theo-Nott- when Nott gives the Dark Lord a sincere smile. He no longer knows where the Selwyn Manor is, just that he knows how to get there.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>/\/\/\/\/\</p>
</center>The Dark Lord doesn’t enter Blaise’s mind anymore, not since the one time he tested Blaise, and Blaise takes a moment to be grateful for that. It means he can take a moment to go to Varese and get some purple hyacinth and return to Britain to lay it on Padma’s grave.<p>He kneels there for who knows how long, simply gazing at the headstone. And for the first time, he truly starts to wonder if this is worth it. If all that the Dark Lord is working towards is actually something he wants to be a part of.</p>
<p>And for months, Blaise visits with purple hyacinths and sits and thinks. He likes to think that Padma would be okay with it.</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p>/\/\/\/\/\</p>
</center>Nearly a year later, Blaise has to make a decision. He has to act. Because this time, the secret keeper is a muggle. This time, Nott drags in the muggle by her arm, the woman fighting him even through her obvious nausea.<p>They’re all kneeling around the Dark Lord’s throne, listening to him tell them what to do and how they should proceed when Nott bursts in.</p>
<p>“My Lord, I have found the Muggle,” he announces proudly, like a cat bringing a dead animal to its’ owner. The Dark Lord rises as the muggle is shoved forward, the muggle daring to shoot Nott a glare as she straightens.</p>
<p>“Why did you run, Muggle?” the Dark Lord has the curious tone of attempting to sound light-hearted, attempting to sound friendly, but it makes everyone twitch just slightly.</p>
<p>The woman stares at the Dark Lord with seemingly no fear, and Blaise just wants to shake her, to get her to realize how dangerous that is.</p>
<p>“I was a lone woman walking home and someone started following me, of course I was going to start running.”</p>
<p>She must be insane.</p>
<p>“Was it because Harry Potter approached you?” the Dark Lord asks, the venom when he says Potter’s name audible to everyone, but the muggle only looks around in confusion.</p>
<p>“I don’t know anyone named that.”</p>
<p>There’s a pause, and Blaise doesn’t know how well the Dark Lord reads social ques, body language, but Blaise has the sinking feeling that this woman really doesn’t know Potter. That she is going to die because she bares a passing resemblance to some muggle that might be the secret keeper.</p>
<p>And when the Dark Lord pulls out his wand, Blaise braces himself for what happens next.</p>
<p>“Crucio!”</p>
<p>The muggle is screaming. Blaise has to lock down on everything, force himself to not move, not breathe, to not do anything. His nails dig into his palms when she hits the floor and finally lets himself take a breath when the Dark Lord stops the spell.</p>
<p>“Now. Will you tell us what we need to know?”</p>
<p>There’s a pause before the muggle speaks, her voice hoarse from the screaming, “I told you, I don’t know who you’re talking about.”</p>
<p>The Dark Lord kneels next to the muggle, blocking everyone’s view as he says, “You had contact with Harry Potter, about ten months ago, did you not?”</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t meet anyone like that,” she insists, and Blaise wonders if it would be worth it to grab the muggle and apparate away, to apparate to some far away place where the Dark Lord couldn’t find either of them as she begins screaming again.</p>
<p>Finally the Dark Lord stands up, spinning to face Nott, “Nott. I thought you said this was the Muggle that Potter approached?”</p>
<p>Nott hurries to bow, “My Lord, I assure you, this was the girl in the photo.”</p>
<p>The Dark Lord makes a humming noise as he thinks, spinning to look at the muggle again, “Perhaps she has been obliviated?”</p>
<p>Blaise closes his eyes and wishes for a moment that he hadn’t proven himself with Occlumency and Legilimency to the Dark Lord because Blaise just knows that he will have to enter the muggle’s mind.</p>
<p>“Would anyone be aware if a secret keeper can still keep the secret if they are no longer aware of it themselves?”</p>
<p>Well leave it to the Dark Lord to continue to think of more horrifying ideas.</p>
<p>“Does no one have an answer for me?” the Dark Lord suddenly hisses when no one answers him fast enough. But no one wants to actually answer him, especially about something that none of them have obviously thought about before.</p>
<p>“It’s never been tested my Lord,” one of the other Death Eater’s offers. In response, the Dark Lord throws a crucio at him and Blaise takes a second to be glad he hadn’t spoken up.</p>
<p>Of course, then the Dark Lord immediately calls on him, “Zabini, get over here and check.”</p>
<p>Blaise approaches, his face carefully blank.</p>
<p>The muggle looks up at him, fear and defiance warring for the dominant emotion. As he enters her mind, he is hit suddenly with the remembrance of the muggle father, determined to protect his family even knowing that it would probably be futile, with Padma in her mind and refusing to break.</p>
<p>The two are standing in a muggle train, the smell hitting him all at once and causing him to inwardly gag at the filth around him. The muggle is standing next to him, hands wringing together as she stares down the train.</p>
<p>Blaise blinks at the sight of Potter walking down the train. Sitting next to the muggle, he starts a conversation with her. Then he gets up and walks away. </p>
<p>It takes him a half second to realize that the memory had been fake.</p>
<p>And that’s only because the muggle sags in relief next to him, her relief palpable here in her mind. That’s also when he realizes that the nerves she had was not for him being in her mind, but more directed towards the scene in front of him.</p>
<p>“That was an excellent job,” he says, and watches as the blood drains from her face, taking a half step away from him, “Your nerves were what had me looking deeper, you need to redirect them to nerves of the person reading your mind, that will cause them to not look where they should. Anyone else won’t be aware of the intricacies of muggle transportation.” He says as though he knows the intricacies of muggle transportation, which is probably the most ridiculous thing he’s ever implied in his life.</p>
<p>“Are they going to kill me?” she asks in a near whisper.</p>
<p>Blaise sighs as Padma’s face goes through his head, “Unless I can come up with a good enough excuse to keep you alive, probably. We have some time here where we can talk, but not much. You’re holding up really well by the way.”</p>
<p>The muggle gives him a tired smile, and Blaise can only compare how similar Padma and this muggle are, “I made a pinky promise.” Because that sounds like a real thing, “If I die, will the secret be safe or will he need to make another one?”</p>
<p>“Make a new one. What happens after a secret keeper dies is that each person who is aware of the secret then becomes a secret keeper themselves. And since Nott is a traitor, the Dark Lord would know exactly where to go.”</p>
<p>And if Blaise can figure out how to kill Theo-Nott-whatever then he would do it in an instant because it’s his fault that Padma died. Not that he’s ever had any confirmation for that, but how else would the Dark Lord know about Padma?</p>
<p>“Can you get word to them that I’m here?” she asks, interrupting his thoughts.</p>
<p>Blaise shakes his head, “I don’t even think Potter knows I’m on his side.” Blaise wants to say that Potter has no idea that Blaise is ready to break some Death Eater bones, but also knows that is not going to make the muggle feel any better, “I don’t dare try and make contact with him to tell him. There may be other resistance members in the Death Eaters, but none have made it into the Inner Circle.”</p>
<p>She brought her hand up to her mouth and began chewing on a nail. Inwardly Blaise cringes because that’s super gross but doesn’t say anything because it is a serious situation. Allowances can be made.</p>
<p>“What if…” she stops and looks at him before continuing, “What if I told you the secret. You then got out and went there and told them.”</p>
<p>That…might work. But at the same time, with how the Dark Lord has lived so far, through everything that has happened, with all that is going on with the horcrux, with the ever continuing possibility that the Dark Lord could easily demand access to Blaise’s mind in order to prove his loyalty, things couldn’t be simple.</p>
<p>“The problem is, the Dark Lord is semi-immortal. Potter and his resistance are still searching for the last piece. Once it is found, then the Dark Lord can be killed. Having Potter lead a frontal attack at this time would be ill-advised.”</p>
<p>Hesitantly, she offers an idea, “Perhaps…perhaps you send a letter to him, through the port, the norm…muggle way. Then tell the Dark Lord that it looks as though my mind has been tampered with, but you aren’t sure. It would require delicate work as you worked through my mind.</p>
<p>There’s a part of him that takes notice of how she uses his terminology, how she adjusts her speech so that Blaise is able to understand quickly and use the information in a useful way, and he decides to think about that at a later point in time, “The second part, for keeping you alive could work. I cannot promise you that it will be painless, in fact it might even get worse from here.”</p>
<p>Knowing the Dark Lord, it was almost a guarantee.</p>
<p>She lets out a nervous breath, but nods, “Do it. Will the letter idea work?”</p>
<p>Blaise hesitates, but gives a small shrug, “I will work on it though.”</p>
<p>The muggle gives a couple nods, wrapping her arms around herself, then whispers to herself, before squeezing herself tightly, “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>And Blaise has never been a touchy person, has never felt comfortable with people, but he can’t forget how broken Padma was, how much this is going to hurt the muggle, how much it is going to hurt himself, and allows himself to wrap an arm around her, squeezing her once.</p>
<p>Then he breaks the spell and watches as the muggle sucks in a breath, her eyes frantically searching his.</p>
<p>“Well Zabini?”</p>
<p>For a moment, Blaise wonders. Wonders if it would just be easier to tell the Dark Lord. Wonders if it would simply be kinder.</p>
<p>Then he stands, and turns to look at the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>“There seem to be some sort of block in her mind. I hesitate to simply tear through them, due to the nature of the fidelius. With your permission, I would ask that I am able to search through her mind to<br/>
find and destroy the blocks while leaving the information intact.”</p>
<p>The Dark Lord doesn’t like his answer at first, “Is she the secret keeper?”</p>
<p>Taking a moment to steel himself, Blaise answers, “It is… possible, my Lord. But I hesitate to say yes for now. It may be that she came in contact with wizards before, perhaps was in a relationship with one that ended badly and needed to be covered up.”</p>
<p>“Did she meet with Potter?”</p>
<p>“It is possible. About ten months ago, she was approached by someone who appeared to resemble Potter, but it wasn’t an exact likeness.”</p>
<p>Please, please, please, please, <i>please</i></p>
<p>“Very well Zabini. Do not disappoint me.” Nodding, Blaise goes back to the circle, pushing down the panic of what he has just done, what he has just committed to doing for who knows how long.</p>
<p>“Look at that girl. You might be useful after all.”</p>
<p>There’s a silence as the Dark Lord just looks at the muggle, examines her as though with one look he could peel her open and discover all her secrets.</p>
<p>“Why are you not scared of me Muggle?” the Dark Lord finally asks almost conversationally. The woman doesn’t answer, and Blaise takes a moment to appreciate that at least she doesn’t mouth off to the people who could kill her with two words, but it seems that the Dark Lord actually wants her to answer because when an expression of rage crosses his face, the muggle hurries to speak.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell when you wish for me to be silent or when to speak. I figure it’s better to stay silent rather than to make some inane comment that won’t help my situation.”</p>
<p>There’s a pause as the Dark Lord thinks, then he turns fully to face the Death Eaters, “Dismissed! Keep on with your original duties.”</p>
<p>As Blaise leaves, he risks a look at her, hoping that he doesn’t have to be the cause of another person’s death before he too leaves the room.</p>
<p>The screaming starts a minute later.</p>
