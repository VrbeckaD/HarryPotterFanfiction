    <p>Draco wasn't sure what to expect when he stepped into the Romanian dragon sanctuary. He correctly assumed that the director would be happy to see him and that Harry would be late. He was set up in an unused office that he would use as an interrogation room of sorts.</p><p><br/>
After the war and his trial at Wizengamot, Draco stopped trying to live up to his dad's expectations. He flipped himself around and became an Auror. In only five years he fought his way to the top, becoming one of the best Aurors the Ministry had. He even worked with Ron and Neville a bit. After doing a mission together, they addressed their pasts and ended up acquaintances. It was more than Draco could have ever asked for. Even the old mark on his arm was now nothing more than a faint scar. A Healer estimated that it'll be gone by his mid-twenties and he was already twenty-three.</p><p><br/>
After some small talk with the director, he asked about the sleeping arrangements put in place by the Ministry. After all, it was their idea to send an Auror. Once word got out about Harry’s newest mess, the Ministry had a fit. They assigned Draco to stay in Romania "until further notice", which he knew could imply years. Aurors were typically sent on missions that would last months or years, but with the ability to Floo home, it wasn't that bad. It was only a matter of time before Draco received his first long mission, and here it was.</p><p><br/>
The Ministry had been repairing itself since the war, and the last thing they needed was something strange going on. A human befriending dragons definitely fell into that category. Dragons were known to hardly tolerate the presence of humans. They are wild and cannot be tamed, and those dumb enough to try always end up dead. Not even the dragon that lived in Gringotts was tamed, but tortured into servitude. The only way to subdue a dragon was for half a dozen wizards to perform a stunning spell, and even that was temporary. Yet somehow, Harry had befriended three baby dragons.</p><p><br/>
When the director mentioned that he was to share a space with Harry, Draco let out a laugh. "Are you serious? The Ministry thought that was a good idea?"</p><p><br/>
She gave a sad smile. "Harry isn't happy about it either. The older members of the Ministry, the ones more likely to agree with Voldemort, this was their idea. I think the younger members saw this as something they could agree on; it wasn't worth fighting. I tried to tell them I had spare shacks you could live in, but they wouldn't listen. I think it's a petty form of revenge from the older ones. A way of embarrassing you both."</p><p><br/>
Draco didn't even have to ask why they wouldn't like him; they considered him a blood traitor. During his trail, it was revealed that Draco was very unwilling to do many of the things Voldemort wanted him to. It was also revealed that he intentionally screwed up when he didn't want to go through with the plans. Death Eaters labeled him a saboteur and a blood traitor, which he was fine with. He considered that the reason why his mark faded while no one else's did.</p><p><br/>
The blonde sighed, "Well, living with Potter can't be the worst thing."</p><p><br/>
"Oh, it can be. What if he snores?" A familiar voice interjected.</p><p><br/>
Draco turned to see the goofy smile of Charlie Weasley. "Weasley? You still work here?" He wasn’t exactly excited or displeased. He knew Charlie was a Dragonologist, but he didn't realize he worked at the same sanctuary as Harry.</p><p><br/>
Charlie nodded. "Ron's told me a bit about you. Said you finally stopped being a massive cunt."</p><p><br/>
Draco rolled his eyes, a bit playfully. "You can't tell me Ron wasn't annoying."</p><p><br/>
"You got me, there." He admitted. "Harry used to room with me, before all this. He doesn't snore, by the way, I just like messing with him. But his dragons'll stay up till midnight."</p><p><br/>
Draco blinked a few times at the implication. "Potter lives with those dragons? They live inside?”</p><p><br/>
Charlie nodded with a small grin at Draco's shock. "They also follow him around while he works. They hate being separated from him. He's had to learn to shower in five minutes because if he doesn't get out soon enough, they'll try to go in."</p><p><br/>
The director tilted her head. "Weasley, is there a reason why you're spending your lunch break here?"</p><p><br/>
"I'd like to chat with Draco, that's all." He spoke in a pleasant voice, though his eyes were not. Draco couldn’t quite name that emotion carried in them but it was something that made his stomach uneasy. It wasn’t unfamiliar. Not at all. It was an expression he hadn’t seen since Hogwarts was nearly wiped off the map.</p><p><br/>
The director seemed to understand, and stepped away for a moment.</p><p><br/>
Draco suddenly realized that under that goofy smile, there was a man who worked with dragons. The same man who's friends and family were bullied by Draco.</p><p><br/>
Charlie's smile dropped when the director left and he stepped forward. "Listen, Malfoy. I want to like you, I do, I want us to get along. More importantly, I want you and Harry to get along.” He was only a meter from Draco and still stepping closer. “Harry has been through more horrors and trauma than you could imagine, and he's trying so hard to get better. That man is far too kind for his own good. He'll try to trust you, he'll try to be friends, so don't hurt him. But don't do it because I told you not to, do it because he has three dragons at his side who are now old enough to spit flames."</p><p><br/>
"Are you threatening me?" He wasn't sure if he was more afraid or impressed. His voice conveyed a bit of both. In a court of law, it would never hold that Charlie gave Draco a death threat and they both knew that. So it wasn’t surprising when a small smile graced Charlie’s face, as sly as a fox with it’s jaws around a chicken’s neck. He was completely in control of the situation and they both knew it. Neither Draco’s name nor occupation could save him. He was in Charlie’s territory.</p><p><br/>
"Threaten you? No, don’t be obvious." With that, Charlie left and the director returned only a few seconds later.</p><p><br/>
"Scary isn't he? I can’t believe I thought Bill was the tough one, with the face scars and being a cursebreaker. But, no. It's Charlie you've got to watch out for." She smiled as if she found it all so amusing, as if it was a game to her.</p><p><br/>
Draco decided he was a bit afraid of the both of them.</p><p><br/>
Finally, after a few awkward seconds had passed, Harry came down the hall.</p><p><br/>
Draco hadn't expected how much Harry's appearance could change in only five years. His hair was a bit longer and somehow even messier, his body tanned with a more muscular build than before, and he'd grown a dark and full mass of stubble where a beard was recently trimmed. He still wore his nerdy round glasses, but his scar had matured with the rest of his face. It healed into raised, white skin that tapered off into something more akin to real lightening. It was almost as if his forehead was split open and never healed correctly. He'd also stepped up his wardrobe. No oversized muggle clothes or long robes. Just a cream lace-up shirt that revealed the top of his chest, ripped black pants that fit his thighs well, scuffed boots, and a long hood made of dark green scales.</p><p><br/>
Draco had never seen so much dragon skin before. The largest dragon-skin product he had ever seen was ankle-length boots. It intimidated him to think about what Harry might have done to get a prize like that. It paled in comparison to the eyes that shone behind those glasses; bright green with a hint of golden-brown by his pupils. It was the same as the green scales and golden horns of the dragons that accompanied him. It was as if Harry himself, was a dragon.</p><p><br/>
Draco always thought that Harry was attractive, but this wasn't the same boy he went to school with. No. This man was nothing short of enticing. He looked like he belonged on the cover of some lewd male magazine that Draco would never admit to having bought. He looked like he belonged in Draco's wildest dreams. He was erotic yet clothed.</p><p>Perhaps, living with Harry wouldn't be the worst thing that's happened to him.</p><p><br/>
Harry was also surprised by the sight of Draco. The first thing he noticed were the deep blue eyes that stared back at him, and the stark blonde hair that was a bit longer than before. He wore long and dark Auror robes fit him very well, no doubt he had them tailored to his body. He was as lean and lithe as when they were in school, but he seemed slightly muscular. Even so, he still looked as soft and posh as ever, likely due to all the expensive lotions he used. It was nice to see that some things never change.</p><p><br/>
Harry was about to try and greet Draco, but his three dragons stood before him and growled at Draco. They were the size of Great Danes at only six months old and very strong. Their sharp teeth bared to keep this new person away from Harry, who hissed at them in Parseltongue. “Retreat. He is a friend.”</p><p><br/>
Before Harry could apologize for their behavior, Draco opened his mouth, “You can control them?!" He sounded horrified and looked like he may faint.</p><p><br/>
Harry smiled. "Dragon's are uncontrollable, but these three'll listen to me when they want to." He stepped forward and held out his hand. “Nice seeing you again. Ron’s told me about how you’re an Auror now, doing well for yourself too, I hear. I’m happy for you.”</p><p><br/>
Draco hesitated, but shook his hand. His own soft and pale in contrast to the tan and callused one. “Right. And you ran off to be a dragonologist. You seem to be doing well. I assume you and all the dragons get along, then?”</p><p><br/>
“Well, not quite. Dragons only tolerate people.”</p><p><br/>
“Yet these three live with you, tried to protect you from me, and listen to you.” Draco stepped aside and motioned to the little office he was set up in. "If you don't mind, I need you to answer some questions so I can send in my preliminary report."</p><p><br/>
Harry nodded and went inside. He sat down on the sofa and the three dragons joined him. One on each side and a third on his lap. They seemed rather peaceful.</p><p><br/>
"Why don't we start from the beginning, how did you come upon the three eggs and how did you hatch them?" Draco asked as he sat down behind the desk.</p><p><br/>
Harry took a deep breath. "A few weeks after I finished training, which lasts four years, I was walking the west border. Well, not the west border of the sanctuary, but the border of where humans are allowed. Pregnant females will go to the west to lay their clutch in privacy. She'll lay her eggs, occasionally breathe fire on them for three weeks, and then they hatch. While I was there, I saw three abandoned eggs. A mother will only abandon her clutch of the father dies or if he proves himself unworthy. I waited an hour, but a mother wouldn't leave her eggs for longer than five minutes. I carried them back to Charlie and I's shack and set them up by the fire. We decided a constant medium heat would work and charmed the fire to keep it going. Three weeks later and the eggs hatched. Charlie stole some dragon's milk so we could feed them and after a few days we told the director about them."</p><p><br/>
Draco raised an eyebrow, "Why wait a few days?" Though he didn't say anything about it, he was unsurprised that Harry broke the rules to save dragon eggs.</p><p><br/>
"To make sure they were strong enough to survive. We wouldn't want to reintroduce them to their parents and have them die shortly after."</p><p><br/>
"Right, and how did you find their parents?"</p><p><br/>
"Dragons have either brown, gold, or green eyes. Their violet eyes are a rare mutation. We only have a few dragons capable of violet-eyed offspring, only two of which are Romanian Longhorns. Turns out, the mother abandoned the clutch because the father kept picking fights and losing. She took it as unworthiness and abandoned her eggs after laying them. We couldn't take the kids to their father because he wouldn't know or care about them. But their mother rejected them. She kicked Lupus and roared at the other two."</p><p><br/>
Of all possible reactions, Draco actually cracked a smile. "I'm sorry, did you say Lupus?" Somehow, he didn't expect that Harry would have named the hatchlings.</p><p><br/>
Harry nodded. "Yea, I named them after the stars, for Sirius. I choose Lupus for Remus. So, after being rejected, they ran back to me. We've always had theories about hatchlings. Did you know that the closest relative to dragons are actually birds and not reptiles? Many species of birds imprint on their mother when they hatch, so we suspect they imprinted on me since I was the only one there."</p><p><br/>
Draco nodded, wordlessly enchanting his quill to take notes for him. "Was there anything else before their birth that may have contributed to this attachment?" He couldn't believe where he was, he couldn't believe what he was doing. He was in the middle of Romania, interviewing Harry Potter, who had three dragons at his side, and was meant to live with the man. The situation was unbelievable, but it was also as if the weight of it hadn't hit Draco yet. Rather than worrying about it, he had a sort of tunnel vision for the present. He was focusing himself on the task at hand and decided to worry about what came after when it was time.</p><p><br/>
"Well, I often spoke to them. I would sit by the fire for hours and talk. The shells are tough, but aren't particularly thick. It's very likely they could hear me and came to recognize my voice."</p><p><br/>
"You mentioned that dragons are related to birds, but earlier you commanded them in Parseltongue. Why is that?"</p><p><br/>
Harry thought a moment, trying to figure out how to explain it. "Parseltongue is a language rooted in magic, and dragons have a very deep connection to magic. That's why they listen. But only these three." He let out a soft laugh, "Any other dragon wouldn't even respond to their own name."</p><p><br/>
"Why only them?"</p><p><br/>
"As I said, dragons have a deep connection to magic. They use it to forge very strong bonds with their parents, siblings, and mate. It connects them on a level that humans are incapable of. They can understand each other’s emotions and pain, and they can silently communicate. With the silent communication, it isn’t like telepathy. It’s more of a silent understanding. Like if a mother wanted her children to follow her, the hatchlings would know to do it. Since I’m not capable of their typical bond, the magic is finding ways around that. Though they don’t speak Parseltongue, they innately understand what I want them to do. But the emotional side of the bond seems to be happening as normal.”</p><p><br/>
Draco tilted his head and got up from his seat, moving to lean on the front of the desk. "Have there been any other side effects of this bond?" He was a bit more comfortable around Harry, but as he got closer, the dragon on Harry's lap eyed him.</p><p><br/>
"They look identical, but I can tell them apart. They're also comforted by my scent. Dragons have these pheromone glands on their necks, they sniff each other's as a greeting. One of the first things they did after hatching was try to smell my neck. Now, if there's a problem, they won't calm down until they've got my scent."</p><p><br/>
Draco nodded at this, watching the dragon on Harry's lap get a bit antsy. The dragon let out a mewl and grabbed onto Harry's shirt, pulling itself forward to nestle into Harry's neck. Harry was unfazed and began stroking the dragon's back. "They're getting nervous." Harry explained, "They don't know you. Before you set up in our shack, you'll have to let them get your scent."</p><p><br/>
The blonde had his eyes trained on the sight of Harry's open and revealing shirt be pulled down even more. He couldn't deny that the sight of small abs peeking over Harry's shirt delighted him very much. He tried to distract himself before his staring became obvious. "Might as well get it over with now."</p><p><br/>
“Right. Then crouch down and let them sniff your neck.” Harry looked down at his dragons, hissing out instructions that made their eyes train on Draco.</p><p><br/>
The blonde was on the floor with three dragons staring him down. He was momentarily afraid. The dragons crowded around him, sniffing at him as he turned his head to the side and tilted it back. He was uncomfortable, but didn’t complain.</p><p><br/>
The dragons retreated when they got his scent and Draco stood back up. "Anything else before we can leave?"</p><p><br/>
Harry seemed to think a moment. "I suppose I should explain the rules, here. Never approach a dragon, and you already know to stay out of the west end. Avoid the southeast as well. After courtship, a dragon couple will head southeast for a few weeks of sex. Dragon's are also incredibly vain. They bathe often, use leaves to shine their horns and claws, they also go into hiding to molt in private. That's done in the north, so avoid that too. The shacks are in the northeast, more east than north, far enough not to bother the dragons. There are signs showing you when you're getting too close to a forbidden area."</p><p><br/>
"Right. Wouldn't like to witness the miracle of life in any of its stages." He commented in reference to the areas for fornication and birth.</p><p><br/>
Harry gave a shrug, "Well, not all the sex will yield children. Dragons are gay, sometimes. About twenty percent, which helps population control since dragons live for centuries."</p><p><br/>
Draco blinked in surprise. "No wonder dragon-skin products are so rare."</p><p><br/>
"Actually, when a dragon does die, their bodies become susceptible to fire and the other dragons will burn them. They'll stand there until every last ash blows away. The only way to get dragon-skin is to kill them yourself, which nearly impossible." Most dragon-skin products are hundreds of years old due to how rare it is.</p><p><br/>
Draco looked at Harry's long and dark green hood with a brief look of horror. "Then how the bloody hell did you get that?"</p><p><br/>
Harry grinned. "There was a fight. A Longhorn got his ear ripped off and I stumbled upon it. I skinned it and had a tailor make it into a hood."</p><p><br/>
Draco nodded, seeming relieved. "Right then. Let's go on to this ..... shack." He obviously wasn't happy about the arrangements.</p><p><br/>
Harry stood up and his dragons followed him out. "It's a ten minute walk from here." He said as he took Draco outside. "We call them shacks but they aren't actually that bad. It's a sitting room and kitchen, the bathroom's behind the kitchen, and there's a bedroom on either side. I know it isn't much, but there's a Floo if you'd rather be at home." As Harry spoke, one of the dragons began chasing a hare. It slowly followed their prey before burning it alive, feasting on the cooked flesh. Harry looked upon the slaughter with a fond expression, proud of the little one’s kill. “You know certain dragon species, like the Romanian Longhorn, are some of the only animals besides humans that prefer cooked meat.” Harry mentioned as he watched the dragon eat their kill. He praised the dragon in Parseltongue and it wiggled in glee.</p><p><br/>
“What did you tell it?” He was a bit perturbed by how easily the dragon killed the hare, but even more so by how Harry was unfazed by it.</p><p><br/>
“I told her that she did a good job. She’s very good at hunting down prey. Very patient too. She’ll wait up to half an hour for a good time to strike, phenomenal at staying quiet and hidden. Lupus is less patient, but very clever. He seems to plan out his hunts, forcing his prey right where he wants them, trapping them before he goes in for the kill. Atlas is good too, but lacks any patience or tactical skills. He chases down his prey and they seldom escape. I’m very proud of them all.”</p><p><br/>
Draco couldn’t quite believe what he was hearing. He couldn’t believe that Harry was so genuinely proud of his dragons, how he treated them like they were his own kids. “So, you consider them to be your children?”</p><p><br/>
Harry nodded. “Of course, and I love them very much.”</p><p><br/>
“What are their names, again?”</p><p><br/>
“That one’s Atlas.” He pointed at the one who was walking ahead of them, sniffing around. “The girl is Lyra, and this is Lupus.” Lupus was walking right between Harry and Draco, nuzzling Harry’s legs.</p><p><br/>
There was a moment of silence between them. The rustling of trees, birds chirping, and the distant groans of a few dragons were the only noise to be had. It was a peaceful day. They both seemed to have the same thing on their minds, but neither wanted to address it.</p><p><br/>
Eventually, Harry remembered he was a Gryffindor, and decided to be brave. “For the record, I’m glad they sent you. I’d rather it be you than some stranger.”</p><p><br/>
Draco gave a silent nod before finally saying what he's wanted to for years, “Thanks for speaking at my trail. You saved my arse.”</p><p><br/>
“Oh, it was no problem.”</p><p><br/>
When Harry defended him, he put up a very compelling argument. He questioned whether Draco was truly acting of his own will. He compared the two of them. He made a point of describing how neither of them had a choice in anything they did. The only difference was that they were on different sides of the war. He described all the people he’s hurt and the laws he broke, while Draco had breakdowns in the bathroom. He let everyone know that his crimes were greater than Draco’s, but Draco was the only one of them to feel remorse. It was a dark and troubling set of arguments, but in the end, it was enough to make everyone see that Draco had never really been a bad guy. At least, not of his own will.</p><p><br/>
Not even a threat from Charlie could stop Draco's curiosity. “Those things you said. About all the laws you broke, and how you don’t feel any remorse. Is that true?”</p><p><br/>
Harry shrugged. “I couldn’t lose to Voldemort. No matter what came my way, I did what I had to do to ensure he wouldn’t win. When you’re desperate enough, remorse becomes a forgotten luxury.”</p><p><br/>
That was one of the most horrifying things Draco has ever been told. The more he thought about the journey Harry went through, the worse he felt about his side of the war. “I’m so sorry for everything I put you through.”</p><p><br/>
Harry let out a stale chuckle. “Don’t bother, it wasn’t up to you.”</p><p><br/>
Draco took comfort in the fact that Harry still had faith in him.</p><p><br/>
When they arrived at the shack, Harry showed Draco to his room. “I know it isn’t much, but it’s got everything you need. The dragons are slight night owls but they won’t wake you up early.” Harry was about to say something else, but Atlas began head-butting the backs of his legs. He frowned and looked at the dragon, seeming to know exactly what he wanted. “Hey, no. I’m not going to do that.” It didn’t matter that dragons can’t speak English, he still spoke to them as if they were his children. Lyra joined her brother in headbutting the back of Harry's other leg, trying to push him towards Draco.</p><p><br/>
Draco raised an eyebrow, amused by how little control Harry had over his dragons. "What do they want?"</p><p><br/>
"They want me to take your scent. They want to know that I like you too so they know you aren't a threat. I can feel that they want me to, and I know they feel my apprehension, they just don't care cause they're little shits.” Eventually, Harry was knocked off balance, and would have toppled over, had Draco not been there to break his fall.<br/>
The two crashed into each other, pushing Draco to lean against the bed to keep them up. He cracked a small smile, not minding how close Harry was to him. Dark curls, bright green eyes, his somewhat exposed chest; Draco would never confess how excited it made him. “If they want it, I don’t mind. It's not my first time having someone on my neck." He joked.</p><p><br/>
Harry couldn’t stop a small laugh from coming forward, “If I didn’t know any better, I’d think you were flirting with me.” He leaned in and pressed his face against the cool flesh of Draco's neck. His breaths were soft and sent a shiver down the blonde’s spine before he pulled away.</p><p><br/>
“<em>Me</em>, flirt with <em>you</em>? Preposterous!”</p><p><br/>
Though Harry would never say it out loud, he was quite attracted to the expensive cologne he could smell. “Good thing I know better.” Harry remarked before leaving with his dragons to let Draco get settled.</p><p><br/>
They were both quite pleased with their living arrangement.</p>
