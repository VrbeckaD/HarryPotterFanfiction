          <div class="userstuff"><p>Severus was just finishing putting the fairy lights on the Christmas tree, when something rustling and glittering slithered around his neck. </p>
<p>“What the…” He grabbed at the thing and tugged it away. He was holding to a piece of long red tinsel. The other end was at Harry’s hand. A very naked Harry in a Santa Claus hat. Severus raised an eyebrow. </p>
<p>“It’s not that I don’t appreciate the view, but may I ask what brought this on?” Severus eyed Harry’s form appraisingly. </p>
<p>“I got bored.” Harry smiled impishly. </p>
<p>Severus’ responding smile made Harry shiver in anticipation. “I’m sure we will find a way to dispel your boredom.” Severus weaved the tinsel around Harry neck. “And I think I know a better way to use this thing.” He took the other end and weaved it lightly around Harry’s half-erect cock. </p>
<p>Harry moaned. He was just sure that whoever invented tinsel didn’t think it would be used this way.</p></div>
