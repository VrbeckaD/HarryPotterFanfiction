    <p>Barefoot, Newt walks by the shore of the lake; it’s a small body of water close to his parents’ house, the same one that belongs to his brother now.</p>
<p>He’s watching Dougal as the creature jumps back and forth to feel the cold water while Pickett is complaining over his left shoulder about the other bowtruckles that live inside the case.</p>
<p>As he’s trying to ease Pickett and convince him the others are not going to attack him in the middle of the night, he catches out of the corner of his eye a figure apparating in front of his brother’s house.</p>
<p>The figure quickly turns into a familiar shape as it approaches, then Newt smiles and waves both arms to catch the man’s attention. It would be more practical to cast a patronus, but an unexpected spell only would make any wizard to react badly, especially if said wizard is an experienced auror.</p>
<p>“Mr. Graves!” He shouts, grinning while he does. “Over here!”</p>
<p>Theseus had told him that Percival Graves would pay a visit; they had become friends during the war and write each other every now and then.</p>
<p>The man stops, it looks like he got petrified and Newt realizes too late that Graves has no idea who is he; because he never met the real Percival Graves.</p>
<p>“I’m Newt Scamander,” he says and watches as the auror blinks once, twice before walking all the way down to the lake. “I’m ‘Seus brother.”</p>
<p>Graves stares at him a couple of seconds, enough for Newt to wonder if it’s something wrong with him. Perhaps it’s just the fact that an auror with impeccable taste in clothes, and a reputation of being a perfectionist, probably does not expect to be faced by someone with messy curls over his face and wet clothes.</p>
<p>Instead of the frown Newt’s expecting, the wizard takes one more step forward with a huge smile on his face and a mischievous spark in his eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s a pleasure, Mr. Scamander,” he says, staring right at him, making Newt feel a little flustered.</p>
<p>“Just call me Newt. Everyone does.”</p>
<p>“Only if you call me Percival, it’s fair.” The Director insists offering his hand.</p>
<p>“Alright,” Newt agrees, taking his hand, but just when he does, instead of shaking it, Percival kisses his knuckles, prompting him to blink in shock.</p>
<p>He blushes to the tip of his ears.</p>
<p>“My brother is at the Ministry,” he blurts out, taking a step back. “If you want to see him-”</p>
<p>“I rather keep you company,” Percival cuts him off. “If you don’t mind.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I can make you some tea, I won’t offer you coffee because 'Seus says I don’t know how to make a good one,” he giggles.</p>
<p>Percival’s eyes go wide at the sound, he smirks, but shakes his head.</p>
<p>“We can wait for him here,” he says and Newt can’t help but to grin in excitement. “You were clearly busy when I arrived.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure? I mean you don’t-”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” Percival assures, waving his hand to cast a spell and when Newt looks down, his clothes are completely dry again.</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>By the time Theseus comes back, Newt already finished telling Percival everything about demiguises; Dougal is the first one to approach him and to Newt’s bewilderment, the creature decides to trust him immediately.</p>
<p>His brother narrows his eyes at both of them right before he greets his old friend.</p>
<p>“I thought you were going to arrive tomorrow,” he says as Percival takes Newt’s hand to help him get down from the tree he had climbed.</p>
<p>“I wanted to surprise you,” the auror replies, eyes still on the younger Scamander.</p>
<p>“You sure did,” Theseus concedes, while a suspicious frown begins to form on his face.</p>
<p>The three of them return to the house; Newt is glad Theseus offers to make the drinks and just when he finishes his Earl Grey, he rises from his spot to feed his creatures.</p>
<p>But then Percival Graves offers to help and Newt stares at him for a couple of seconds because none of Theseus guests have ever done something like that.</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you,” he manages while he sees Theseus glaring at his friend.</p>
<p>Percival not only makes an effort to learn every single name Newt tells him, he ends up being very good at taking care of magical creatures and the majority of them seem to like him.</p>
<p>He also makes a lot of questions, but Newt thinks that’s part of his nature as the best auror in America.</p>
<p>“Seraphina told me she offered you a job,” he comments as he pushes Newt’s curls off his eyes. “Did you accept?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he says and watches the moment Percival’s smile turns into a smirk.</p>
<p>“Do you have suitors?”</p>
<p>Newt chokes, surprised and looks back at the auror to see if he has heard him wrong.</p>
<p>“N-No.”</p>
<p>“What about auror Goldstein?”</p>
<p>“She’s just my friend,” he assures and blushes as Percival stares back looking really pleased with the information.</p>
<p>Newt doesn’t know how to interpret that.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Percival decides to stay a week in which he manages to read Newt’s book in its entirety and earns the trust of every single one of the creatures inside the case, he even makes Pickett stop glaring at him.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Theseus starts to act a little bit weird, it looks like he does the best he can not to leave the two of them alone; he’d be more concerned if he didn’t know Theseus acted like an overprotective idiot sometimes.</p>
<p>But on the third day his brother comes up with the most ridiculous idea he has ever heard.</p>
<p>“He likes you,” Theseus blurts out, half irritated half amused at his own words. “Of course he does, he’s not even subtle about it. But you know… I can accept it, I mean he’s a good wizard and at least I know you’d be safe around him, but that doesn’t mean he can just stare at you like that while I’m in the same room… You’re my little brother-”</p>
<p>“What are you babbling about, 'Seus?” Newt cuts him off.</p>
<p>“Percival Graves,” he says, like it’s obvious. “He’s in love with you.”</p>
<p>Newt rolls his eyes and stops hearing whatever Theseus is trying to say. Sometimes his brother likes to imagine the most ridiculous things.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It turns out, it’s not ridiculous at all. And he was right all along.</p>
<p>Percival has to go back to MACUSA and even though he offered Newt to go back together, the magizoologist still has to do a few things before going to New York.</p>
<p>He just finished packing his stuff when he joins Newt inside the case, takes both hands in his and stares at him in the eye with the most intese look Newt has ever seen.</p>
<p>“Newt Scamander, I’d be happy if you agreed to marry me.” He says and doesn’t even give Newt the time to process his words when he adds: “I know this could be surprising for you, but trust me when I tell you that I’m completely sure about this. I won’t ask you to marry me yet, I just want you to give me a chance to convince you.”</p>
<p>“Convince me?” Newt blurts out, face completely red.</p>
<p>“That I can make you happy,” Percival whispers as he leans forward.</p>
<p>Newt has always considered Percival Graves attractive, he also likes his company and he can see himself falling in love with a man like him, but he knows Graves would get tired of someone like him quickly.</p>
<p>“We just met,” he protests, but Percival’s grin doesn’t vanish.</p>
<p>“Newt, I knew the moment I saw you,” the auror assures and the magizoologist be almost melts at the words.</p>
<p>“What if we’re just f-friends?” He asks, getting flustered when Percival presses their foreheads together.</p>
<p>“Alright, we can be friends for now,” he nods and Newt fights the temptation of rolling his eyes at that man’s stubbornness, but when Percival’s smile turns into a predatory smirk Newt regrets accepting that job. It’s going to be very difficult to work with that man around. “I love challenges.”</p>
<p>Newt gasps as Percival kisses his hands and hopes the Director will have forgotten about that by the time he goes back to MACUSA.</p>
<p>He also makes sure not to mention anything about that to Theseus.</p>
