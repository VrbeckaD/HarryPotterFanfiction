  <span>“Decided to come back this year and torture us some more with that Mudblood stench of yours Granger?” Malfoy snarled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You are the only one I see who knows anything about torture.” Hermione flashed her eyes. “Now move.” Hermione had forgotten her self inking quill on the train and gone back to retrieve it, only to find on her way back out that Malfoy was guarding the exit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think I would rather make you ride the train back to London. It would most definitely make the school cleaner,” he smirked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, but then who would you get to verbally assault?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You think I enjoy these little banters? Ha! I would much prefer if I had never laid eyes on your Mudblood face.” Malfoy moved his eyes from the top of her hair to her toes to size her up. Then he saw it, the red badge pinned to her robes, “they made a bloody Mudblood head girl?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Contrary to what you may believe, head girl is not exclusive to pure-bloods, I swear.” She rolled her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Finally occur to you that the idea of blood purity is ridiculous?” </span>
  <em>
    <span>Doubtful.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hell no, Granger, I just realized that if they made you head girl it doesn't mean anything that I'm head boy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me?” Her head began to spin, </span>
  <em>
    <span>why on earth would they make someone as foul as Malfoy head boy?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'm head boy,” he gestured to his own pin, “and your filthy blood is defiling my position.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You are ridiculous.” She smoothed her robes, “Dumbledore will be announcing the heads to the school soon, we should go.” He would not ruin this for her. She was too proud of her accomplishment, and even if it was outlandish to trust Malfoy with any amount of power, she would not allow him to see her true feelings. She turned on her heel. “We will be able to continue this banter back at our dormitory.” The witch laughed, knowing how much sharing a common room with someone with ‘unclean blood’ would unravel him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though he was slightly unraveled, he didn’t let on. “Do not tell me what to do. But make sure you eat at this feast, if I must share this position with you, the least you could do is look like more than a skeleton,” he snarled at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He noticed. She hadn't really been able to eat much lately. Her mind elsewhere, and her stomach constantly in knots. “Shove off.” Harry and Ron either hadn't noticed or didn't care enough to mention it. At first she assumed that if they had noticed they didn't find it too alarming, but if Malfoy had noticed she must have dwindled more than she thought. She walked quickly to the great hall and slid into a seat at the Gryffindor table. Ron sat awkwardly as Ginny and Harry talked about their summers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Finally,” Ron turned to her, “find your quill?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hum, yes.” She stuffed the quill into her bag with an Undetectable Extension Charm on it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The great feast went as usual, but when Dumbledore announced Draco as the head boy Hermione had to kick Harry under the table. He was making a scene. Of course she knew he would be upset, but gracious. He was grabbing at Ron with his eyes wide and acting like Malfoy would murder her in her sleep. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I really cannot deal with him and his incessant overreacting.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Once Dumbledore had finished speaking Harry uncrossed his arms, placing his hands firmly on the table. “If he,” his eyes flashed to the Slytherin table, “so much as lays a hand on you I swear to Merlin it will be the last thing his hands do.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Really Harry, you let him get you so worked up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I </span>
  <em>
    <span>let</span>
  </em>
  <span> him get me worked up? You can’t be serious, he’s a Death Eater!” Harry rubbed his forehead with his hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rolling her eyes Hermione exclaimed, “Again, we have no proof that he is a Death Eater, I’m so fed up with this pissing match.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Ron squirmed, “Uh, Death Eater or not, he’s walking over here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry and Hermione stopped bickering and their eyes followed Ron’s gaze to see the wizard walking straight toward them. He sneered, “No need to stare, just retrieving the Mudblood for Professor Flitwick.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Hermione shot both Harry and Ron a glare and they shut their mouths, knowing that whatever pleasure they would derive from hurling a curse or at least an insult at Malfoy wouldn’t be worth the wrath of Hermione they would have to face later. Her lips curled to a soft smile and she spoke gently, “I’ll see you tomorrow, I suspect we need to be shown to our dormitory.” As she turned and walked away she could hear the boys whispering in an angry tone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah, Miss Granger, so nice to see you. I do hope your summer was well.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Professor, good to see you as well, and I hope the same for you. I am excited to begin class, I’ve already read the first few chapters of the book you’ve chosen and--”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Malfoy cut her off, “As much as I would love to start Charms class early, I really am exhausted.” His haughty voice dragged a little, “Can we go?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If Hermione hadn’t known Draco for so many years she would have thought he was actually tired, but she knew how manipulative the boy could be.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right. Apologies. This way.” Professor Flitwick smiled as he walked the pair down a long hallway and stopped in front of a large round painting. A pale woman with light hair and eyes stared back at them. She gently raised her eyebrows, indicating that she was waiting for the password. “The password is ‘pumpkin juice’, feel free to change it anytime, just” the professor looked at the two of them sternly, “tell each other.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They both nodded, though scowling, and turned to the painting now swinging open.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you professor,” Hermione called back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As soon as the painting closed behind them Malfoy glared at her. “Stay out of my bloody way.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As much to your disdain, we are both heads, and this is my living space too.” She crossed her arms and her lips thinned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t say it wasn’t.” Malfoy glared, “I am well aware of the situation we find ourselves in, I said stay out of my way.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p><em><span>I will not allow him to walk all over me. </span></em><span>“No.”</span> <span>With finality in her voice she allowed her eyes to move away from his and examine the common room they would share; mesmerized, she allowed her bag to fall off of her shoulder. The room had two of nearly everything: desks, bookshelves, windows, and staircases. The walls were of dark stone and cream drapes hung on the walls. She supposed that the common room had been decorated to not imply affiliation with any of the houses. She instinctively turned to the right staircase and began ascending when she heard Malfoy speak again.</span></p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Granger.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She did not turn around, “I am done arguing tonight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know. But--” She looked down at him. “You left your purse.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t need it.” She kept moving.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Granger,” she turned ready to yell, then seeing his face, paler than usual and eyes wide, closed her mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I- I can’t really do clutter.” He was clearly uncomfortable.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Clutter. That’s what gets under Malfoy’s skin?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pushed air out of her mouth. He was annoying, and he was being ridiculous, but she didn’t want to argue. She quickly walked back down the stairs, collected her bag and retreated to her room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>_______________________________________________________________________</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Malfoy woke suddenly. It was dark and he was slick with sweat. The nightmare he had just awoken from still haunted him. Knowing he wouldn’t be able to fall back to sleep he slid out from under his covers and walked quietly down the stairs. He was almost certain Granger hadn’t charmed her room yet, and as much as he didn’t like the bushy-haired Mudblood, he didn’t want to wake her up and be subject to her endless questions. “Lumos” he whispered, and ran his finger across the spines of the books he had filled his bookshelf with earlier. He didn’t want to read for class - he wanted a distraction. Finally deciding that he had nothing interesting enough to distract him from his nightmare, he abandoned his bookshelf, sat on the couch, and stared into the darkness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He startled when he heard the witch running down the stairs. She stopped abruptly when she saw him. Malfoy had fallen asleep on the couch hours after waking up in the middle of the night. His blond hair wisped in every direction and he had dark circles under his eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you okay?” Her voice was gentle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>How could she be so kind so suddenly? She hated him.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He groaned, still partially asleep.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Should you go to Madam Pomfrey?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not bloody sick.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You don’t really look well, are you sure?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t sleep well, okay? Now quiet.” It was bloody early. Well, to the looks of it it wasn’t that early, Granger was already clothed and had a bag of books slung over her shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not a fan of mornings, are we?” Hermione giggled, eying his bare chest. There was something not quite right about it, but she couldn’t decide what it was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck Granger.” Malfoy pulled himself to a standing position. “I’m bloody tired. I just woke up. I only got 3 hours of sound sleep before--” He stopped mid sentence. He was still drowsy, and he almost let the fact that he had been having this nightmare recurrently slip. “I’m not used to it being this warm while I sleep.” Luckily he had already thought about the inconvenience that it was being so used to sleeping in a dungeon. He did get fairly warm last night, but that was not the reason for his insomnia.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sorry. You may want to hurry though, first day of classes and all.” She gave him a slight smile then exited the dormitory pinching herself to ensure that she was indeed awake. Malfoy hadn’t been nice, but he wasn’t cruel like he normally was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Any hope Hermione had of keeping things civil between the two of them vanished when she walked into the Great Hall for lunch. Distractedly thinking about the weirdness of Malfoy’s chest she accidentally walked into him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Filthy, rotten, Mudblood.” He snarled, “Now I have to burn my robes.” He held his hands as if he was contaminated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She rolled her eyes, “Sod off.” Unwilling to allow his ignorant belief in blood status to affect her, she turned and walked to the Gryffindor table and met her friends.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Draco dropped his hands. He didn’t actually care that she had touched him. He had purposefully positioned himself so that she would, aware that her head was somewhere else. He needed to throw some insults at her, since this morning he was too kind. He didn’t want her to think they were becoming friends, that would be too dangerous. He was unaware, however, how affected he would be by her touching him. She had definitely lost weight since last year, but he hadn’t realized how much until he felt the lack of substance behind her step. Robes could be both beneficial and dangerous in that they had the ability to hide quite a lot from judgemental eyes.</span>
