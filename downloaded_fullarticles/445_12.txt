    <p>Chapter 1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <i>Bellatrix Lestrange stalked towards her, a twisted, rage filled expression on her face. She wanted the prophecy for her master, but she wouldn’t get it. Hermione turned to her friends, ready to shout ‘Run!’, but when she looked, no one was there. Her heart jumped into her throat as she turned back around, her mind emptying. She couldn’t think of a single spell, couldn’t think of a single way to defend herself. Her muscles froze. Just then, Bellatrix sprang toward her. The walls of the Department of Mysteries disappeared around her, changing into the cold interior of Malfoy Manor. Cold, hard, wood dug into her spine as she was pressed into the ground. </i>
</p>
<p>
  <i></i>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	<i>“What did you take from my vault?!” Bellatrix screamed. She was so loud Hermione felt like her eardrums were going to burst, and spit flew from Bellatrix’s mouth onto Hermione’s face. Bellatrix shook her, slamming her head into the floor. “What did you take, you filthy Mudblood?!”</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <i>	“I didn’t take anything!” Hermione cried. Bellatrix shifted to cut into Hermione’s arm with her wicked knife, flashing with light from the chandelier above them. A wave of desperation welled in Hermione. “I didn’t take anything!”</i>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	<i>Bellatrix’s knife felt like fire in her arm, and she tried not to scream. But, as Bellatrix continued to cut, a scream ripped its way out of Hermione’s throat.  All she wanted was for Bellatrix to get off her, move, please, but she didn’t. As the pain continued to grow, the poison spreading through her, Hermione jerked and tried to wrench away, her throat hoarse from screaming.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>	<i>Just when she thought it would end, Bellatrix raised herself off of Hermione, done cutting into her arm for the moment, and raised her wand high over her head.<br/>
“What did you take, Mudblood?” She demanded. Hermione could see Greyback leering from behind Bellatrix, just waiting to have ‘a bit of her’. She hoped she died before then.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>	<i>“Nothing!” Hermione was crying. She didn’t want to see her arm, but out of the corner of her eye she could see red pooling. Bellatrix’s face contorted even more - how can one person hold so much rage?</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>        <i>“You’re lying, you filthy Mudblood! You’ve been inside my vault at Gringotts! Tell the truth, tell the truth! Crucio!” And suddenly every nerve in Hermione’s body had been cut, every bone cracking, fracturing, breaking, every muscle clenching and releasing like they were being pulled apart and then shoved back together. She screamed, jerking and convulsing on the floor, her body slamming back into the ground. Vaguely she wondered how much she could take before ending up like Neville’s parents. And suddenly, it ended.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>        <i>“What else have you got? Tell me the truth or, I swear, I shall run you through with this knife!” Hermione vaguely felt tears running into her sweaty hairline.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>       <i> “We didn’t take anything, it’s a copy, just a copy!” she sobbed. The movement hurt her, but in the next moment, that pain was inconsequential.</i> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <i>        Bellatrix rained down on her with her short, silver knife, again and again. It hurt too much to be a regular knife - it must be cursed, or poisoned or-</i>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	“Hermione!” A voice yelled. Strong hands were shaking her, urging her to wake up, and for a second she couldn’t tell what was real. Quickly she grabbed the wrists of the person shaking her and threw them off, pushing them away. They stumbled back and Hermione grabbed her wand off her pillow and stood up, shouting, “Petrificus Totalus!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>	The person’s limbs snapped together and they froze, falling to the floor with a thud. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>	“Hermione?” A wary voice said softly from the doorway. As Hermione swung around, wand at the ready, the person raised their hands in the ‘I surrender’ position. Hermione could feel her heart pounding, her body burning, her lungs working too quickly, and, for a second, she swayed. The figure in the doorway took a step closer, hands still raised. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>	“Don’t come any closer!” Hermione said fearfully.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	“It’s alright, sweetheart. Listen to me now.” Hermione stilled. “I know you’re scared, but I need you to take a deep breath for me. Can you do that, love?” Hermione inhaled painfully. Her breath made a wheezing sound like she’d run a marathon. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>	“That’s right, love. Do you know who I am?” The soft voice asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	After a moment Hermione spoke, her voice hoarse. “Mum?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	“That’s right, Hermione. I need you to lower your wand all the way, there’s a girl. I’m going to turn on the light, okay love?” The light flicked on, and Hermione squinted in the bright light. She quickly swung around to look at the figure on the floor. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>	“Dad!” She cried. She quickly spoke the counter-curse and backed away, the hand holding her wand behind her back and the back of her empty hand covering her mouth as her dad sat up stiffly. She looked between her two parents, who looked steadily back at her. Hermione could tell they were trying to be brave for her, but she could see a hint of fear on their faces. “I’m so sorry!” Hermione’s voice cracked as she spoke. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>	“It’s alright, love,” her dad said, standing slowly. He moved to stand beside his wife and put an arm around her, steadying the both of them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	“I’m so sorry,” Hermione said again. She sank to her knees, heels of her hands trying to push her tears back into her eyes. She heard her mum murmur something to her dad, who left the room quietly. Hermione almost couldn’t hear him take the first squeaky step of the stairs over the sound of her ragged breathing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>	Her mum walked slowly over to her and knelt down. “Hermione.” She waited until her daughter looked up before continuing. “I know this is hard for you right now. I don’t know what happened out there, and I don’t know how to help you with this.” Hermione wiped away a stray tear that leaked down her face. The tenderness on her mum’s face made her feel like her insides were cracking. All traces of fear on her mum’s face had disappeared and a quiet strength took its place. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>	“I know, Mum,” she said. She felt guilt rise up in her stomach, clenching her stomach. She had just gotten her parents back, and now she was scaring them. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>	“None of that, Hermione.” She tucked a piece of her daughter’s bushy hair behind her ear, smoothing it away from her sweaty face. “Your father is downstairs making some peppermint tea. We are going to go downstairs and talk about what we can do for you, okay?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	Hermione tilted her head back, staring at the ceiling to keep more tears from falling. “I don’t know, Mum. Maybe I should go away for awhile.” She looked back into her mother’s face. “I know you just got back, but I don’t want another night like this. Maybe I should go stay at the Burrow until I feel better. We can still see each other during the day.” She gestured helplessly with her hand. Her mother caught her wandering hand in her own and held it to her cheek. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>	“We want what’s best for you, sweetheart. If that means staying away for a while, your dad and I will accept that. We just want you to feel better.” She ran her fingers down Hermione’s Mudblood scar, shining white in the light. Hermione hadn’t shown her parents the scar; in fact, she actively covered herself so her parents wouldn’t see, but she had shucked her sweater off in the dark hours of the night, unable to get comfortable in its bulkiness. Hermione gasped as fire swept through her. Her mother immediately let go, removing her hands like they had been burned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	“It’s okay, Mum,” Hermione said with tears of pain in her eyes. “It wasn’t you, it’s poisoned-” She stopped herself. “It’s okay.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	She watched the expressions pass over her mother’s face, confusion, understanding, fear, anger, and finally such a heavy sadness that Hermione had to look away. Her mother didn’t comment, just took Hermione’s hands and pulled them both to their feet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	“If going away for a while will help you, Hermione, your father and I will support you 100%.” She looked right into Hermione’s eyes. She could see the haunted look that had made its home there, and the desperation for her to understand. A relieved look came over her daughter’s face and she smiled. “Just so long as you come home for dinner on occasion. Your dad and I aren’t quite ready to be empty nester’s yet.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>	Hermione quickly agreed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	The next morning she sent an owl to Mrs. and Mr. Weasley, explaining the situation to them. (She had bought an owl the day before she went looking for her Mum and Dad to keep in touch with everyone, though the journey had been quick.) Mrs. Weasley had sent the owl back with a note, enthusiastically agreeing that Hermione come stay with them. Mrs. Weasley had been feeling a little down herself with over half of the family moved out, so she was happy to accept Hermione. She gave instructions to come by floo that afternoon. After a large brunch with her parents (she had spent the night packing, she didn’t want to go back to sleep and risk another nightmare), she gave a tearful goodbye and was swept away in a flash of green flames.</p>
