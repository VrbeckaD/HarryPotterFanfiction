    <p>The sky's almost dark again. Amongst the pink clouds stands Lupin- his silhouette only a black line that could be blown away by the next breath of wind. He takes a deep breath and tries to forget his day and the handsome smile thrown his way in the coffee shop he’d gone to on a whim, wanting a hot chocolate made without shaking hands for once. Lupin takes another breath and exhales the question of if he could, or should, return to the cosy corner cafe again, along with the growing sense of loneliness pressing down upon his chest. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There’s a job to be done once the sun finally dips beneath the horizon. In preparation, he runs his hands over the pistol at his belt, checking the silencer’s still in place and that he’d packed the right number of bullets. Taking them out of the chamber, he lets each bullet sit heavy in his scarred hand. Their weight settles something inside and the breeze on the rooftops doesn’t seem so cold anymore. He doesn’t shiver with them in his hand- with the familiar feeling of smooth metal against his skin. As far back as he can remember, he’s had no problem dealing in metal and blood. Of course, Lupin knows normal people don’t solve their problems by signing up for (legal) hit jobs. He’s seen the looks he gets when he heads to the office to check in and give the rundown on the latest job. But at the end of the day, he doesn’t see a way out anymore that isn’t paved in red. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A flicker of movement on the otherwise empty street below catches his eye and all of his attention. Someone darts out from an alley- a small streak breaking the uniform grey of the tarmac. Fast, Lupin reaches out in front of him onto a fire escape and slides down the railing onto ground level. It’s not quite the time he’d prefer to do this as the sun’s not quite set yet, but the person he’s after had made their move, and this is his only chance for the next month.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the past few months Lupin had traced the movement of people entering and exiting the garage he now stood in front of, dressed in the patched suit he reserved for these occasions. Once a month, everyone except the big boss was sent out for an hour at least. For what reason, it had been impossible to tell. But with the last of them gone, he now has an hour to take his shot- long enough to keep him on his toes but not really short enough that he has anything to worry about. And with only one person- hopefully- on the other side of the metal door, there shouldn’t be a problem with being overwhelmed either. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s a nice, tidy job. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, it would be if you ignored the murder…” Lupin mutters under his breath, steadying himself for a moment before giving a curt knock that rings out down the road, announcing his presence to the pigeons chattering up above which scatter to the skies as though they know what he’s about to do. They scatter like they can’t stand Lupin’s presence any more than Lupin can stand his own presence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The birds don't see the blood. They don’t see Lupin look the surprised big boss in the eye right as he pulls the trigger. There’s no hesitation anymore before the muted shot rings out, just a slight tug in his gut reminding him of the monster that’s eating up a little more of his heart each time he watches the light leave someone’s eyes. And as he’s cleaning up, the sun decides it doesn’t want to see him either, even after being so keen to hang around and see the show.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once the body’s safely stowed in a handily placed closet, he’s alone with a small pool of blood and a ticking clock, reminding him that time’s running out. At least when he gets home there’s no red on his shirt- the stuff’s a pain to get out of white cloth. Frankly, Lupin’s not sure why he still bothers with white shirts, what with the number of times he’s ended up having to just ditch them. There’s only so many times spilling ketchup works as a cover story, and when one time his jacket had got ripped off in a more rigorous job, even spilling wine wouldn’t have explained the mess on his train ride home.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lupin likes to hum to himself at this stage of the work, with just him and a cloth to clear up all that’s left. As there’d been no struggle, there’s not long before he’s left with a clean concrete floor and slightly pink hands. He likes working with his hands; there’s something people always underestimate about the beauty of a job that’s been hand finished. It’s quiet and peaceful and that’s all Lupin needs, even if somewhere inside his head he knows it’s not enough. The books on his shelf, about a life beyond grime, gloss, and guns, are the only indication he wants something more. Well, aside from the hot chocolate earlier.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finished in the garage, Lupin contemplates stopping off at the cafe for another hot drink. After all, if some people go there for a coffee every five minutes, why shouldn’t he visit the place just once more? The smile spreading across his face at the thought of returning there has nothing to do with the grin promising danger he’d received earlier from a guy in a motorbike jacket just tight enough to hint at wiry muscle underneath the leather. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Shaking his head, he moves out of the ‘crime scene’. If the police are eventually called then a special team will move in to cover up his part in the operation, sighting a mysterious serial killer who handily only seems to kill those who’ve posed a threat to the government as the murderer. The scene’s clear of his DNA and he’s left behind a corpse; his job here’s done. Anything else that happens here is officially above Lupin’s pay grade.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He needs a drink. He’d say a strong one, except for the fact that Lupin doesn’t think the coffee shop sells anything stronger than a double espresso- especially not if he’s trying to avoid being remembered. So he sets off down the street to catch a bus, hoping it’s not too full of people heading out on the surprisingly warm summer’s evening and musing over his menu options. Given the heat, something iced sounds incredibly good, and only gets more tempting when the bus arrives packed full of youngsters ready to party. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s only been a couple of years since that was him. Well, he’d never quite managed the whole partying scene so much as endured it once or twice with the help of Peter before-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well. Before Peter wasn’t part of his life anymore. And for all of his talk of loving and supporting his friend, Lupin hadn’t really been willing to accompany him on big lads nights, instead choosing to stay home or head out on a job without being disturbed or questioned. And now he’s got nobody to drag him out to one of the ‘Lupin appropriate’ clubs and get him into the fun shirts a group of guys at the back of the bus are all wearing that Peter had devoted most of his wallet to acquiring. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lupin shakes his head as the bus slows down once more, the announcement of the stop going over his head as his mind’s still caught up in cobwebs. Whirling about, Lupin struggles to see out of the window from where he’s standing so that he can gauge where they are. Snatches of long black hair and a light blue motorbike catch his eye as the vehicles both slow down to approach the next corner- Lupin’s stop.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pressing the stop button a little frantically, Lupin weaves his way to the door releasing a small flurry of excuses as he squeezes past other passengers and gets spat out onto the pavement as soon as the bus pulls up to the stop. Wheeling about, he finds himself face to face with the stupidly handsome man from earlier, complete with a baby blue bike gleaming in the orange glow from a nearby lamppost. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hey there beautiful, almost crashed into you there. Though I wouldn’t object to you falling for me-” begins the guy, speaking like he knows every bit of how good he looks and throwing in a wink that scrunches up his face in a way that Remus is sure is a criminal offence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wary of how close they’re standing, Lupin springs back and begins scrabbling together apologies to make him sink back into the background. “I’m so sorry I didn’t see you there with a bike and everything- the bus was just so packed I really wasn’t thinking when I stepped off. Are you alright?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It comes out hurried, before Lupin really hears what the biker guy said, and there’s a blush he can feel rising from his collar as the stranger’s words sink in. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Beautiful? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Deadly maybe, but Lupin knows he’s not beautiful. When it’s useful, he’ll be charming and polished, but all the charm in the world doesn’t make up for the scars littering his body. Yet this man in front of him had just called him beautiful as though the thought of Lupin being anything other than that hadn’t crossed his mind for one second. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Maybe I should be asking you that, looked like you were on another planet for a minute there. You back with me now?” The stranger asks with a crease between his eyebrows. His face so openly betrays his emotions that Lupin can see the concern leaking from the guy’s features into his words. Someone being concerned over him almost sends Lupin off into a crisis, but he knows that he can’t afford to stand out anymore than he already does- not with his job being one for ghosts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dusting himself off, Lupin manages a nod and looks the other guy over properly. Dressed all in black, Lupin thanks God that skinny jeans were invented and that this guy knows how to wear them. He's got one hand on the bike and all of his focus on Lupin. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em> All of his focus. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Good to have you back, don’t suppose you’re heading to the cafe I first saw your charm in this morning?” With another wink, the tone shifts and Lupin feels the edges of his lips creeping upwards, because not only is the man beautiful, but he’s charming too. The guy’s voice is deeply earnest, giving away everything in a way that makes the listener give something back. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lupin considers lying for a second and forgetting about the drink now that there’s someone who recognizes him, but the night’s still hot and he wants so badly to get to know this charming guy- surely one drink wouldn’t hurt?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sure am,” Lupin confirms, before continuing “and by my charm you can’t mean the sour face you saw this morning because I know that before ten there’s no charm at all to be found anywhere near me,” letting a trace of a smirk accompany his words. If the stranger was already flirting at him, then who’s Lupin not to flirt back- especially when the guy has jeans that manage to make his legs look that divine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The guy’s smile widens as he replies, “Well, luckily I’ve got the gift of seeing charm even when it’s hidden away,” and adds in a wink just to send Lupin’s heart racing when he thought he’d caught his cool. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m Sirius by the way,” he adds on almost as an afterthought, running a hand through shoulder length black hair and moving to lock up his bike in a seamless motion. His eyes stay locked onto Lupin’s face though, and Lupin realises that he’s waiting for a name in return.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Can Lupin give away his name? Sirius wouldn’t recognise it, but Lupin wouldn’t be able to disappear after this with his name given away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He bites his lips and releases the name on the tip of his tongue- the one that’s not drenched in blood and hasn’t had someone to hear it in twelve years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Remus.”</p>
