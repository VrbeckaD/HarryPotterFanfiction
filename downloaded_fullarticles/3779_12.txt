    <p>Really, it all began in third year. Draco Malfoy never showed up to any of the boggart lessons; most of the Gryffindors would laugh and say it was because he was too scared to face his fears, but not Harry Potter. The green eyed boy cornered Draco in the library until he spilled. And despite the fact that what Harry heard was awful, he doesn't regret because of what he has now.</p><p>Currently Harry and Draco were lounging in front of a roaring fire, in the room of requirment. A thick green blanket covered their naked lower halves. Harry's head was resting on Draco's pale chest, his hand trailing the dark tattoo blossoms.<br/>Draco was combing his thin fingers through his boyfriends dark curls. His eyes were on the fire, however his mind was far away.</p><p>   "What you thinking about?" Mumbled Harry into Draco's skin.</p><p><br/>   "Us, the future."  Draco tore his eyes from the fire to look into the emerald eyes he loved so  much.</p><p><br/>   "What about us?"</p><p><br/>   "What will we do when this year ends?" Draco didn't want to admit it but he was terrified of Harry leaving him, he wouldn't manage. Couldn't.</p><p><br/>   "I was gonna talk to you about that," Harry picked himself up to sit across from Draco,<br/>   "Would you-would you like to come and live with me and my uncles in Grimmauld place, maybe just until we get a place, just the two of us? Or any other suggestions?" Harry was so nervous, there was a dark blush forming on his face.</p><p><br/>   Draco searched Harry's eyes, filled with hope and so much love, Draco could barely hold it.</p><p><br/>  "YES YES YES!!! In Merlin's name YES!!!" Draco leaped at Harry, wrapping his arms round his lovers neck. He could feel tears streaming down his fave, tears from his overwhelming happiness.</p><p><br/>   Harry's back hit the fur, the suprise of having his  lover in his arms. Draco started kissing him all over, peppering them all over his face.</p><p><br/>   "So that's a yes?" Smiled Harry. Draco mock glared at him, though it didn't do much since he was still smiling.</p><p><br/>  "Yes," and then Draco kissed him deeply.</p><p><br/>* * * <br/>"God I love you so much," sighed Harry, his arm wrapped Draco's waist.</p><p><br/>" I love you too," smiled Draco kissing Harry's forehead. They were sharing a last kiss before leaving for lessons. Standing in the doorway of the room of requirment, neither of them wanting to leave eachothers arms.</p><p><br/>"We gotta go," pouted Draco, though he we would never admit it.</p><p><br/>" I know I know, astronomy tower at eight, though?"</p><p>"I wouldn't miss it for the world," and with that Draco exited before Harry left a couple moments after him.</p>
