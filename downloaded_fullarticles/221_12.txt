    <p>The gold was everywhere, and it was scalding.</p><p>Harry’s skin was on fire as he and Griphook landed atop a pile of burning hot treasure; the sword of Gryffindor and Hufflepuff’s cup went soaring from his hand in their fall. Griphook struggled to remain on his shoulders, desperate to avoid the rising tide of boiling metal. But there was too much, it was too late—Hermione and Ron were waist-deep in broiling coins, suits of armor, and other fake artifacts. They were being pushed against the vault’s door, beyond which the clanking was growing deafening.</p><p>They had to get out. Now.</p><p>“The sword!” Harry shouted to Griphook. “Where is the sword? It had the cup on it!”</p><p>Griphook spotted it first, near to where Hermione and Ron were being buried… and that was when the world seemed to turn in on itself.</p><p>It all happened quickly.</p><p>Griphook lunged and grabbed the sword. The cup, which had been hooked around the blade by the handle, was flung into the air, landing far from Harry’s reach.  </p><p>The door to the vault swung open. Fake treasure flowed out into the hall, raining down upon the goblin guards that had opened it. It took Ron, Hermione, Griphook, and surely both the sword and cup with it. Screaming filled the air.</p><p>
  <em>“Harry!”</em>
</p><p>The door began to close.</p><p>Harry watched the scene unfold, wide-eyed with horror. Hermione was struggling to get to her feet, shouting his name; Ron too was panicking, reaching for his wand—Harry opened his mouth to shout something back, he tried to run over the burning piles of gold—goblins were screaming and wizard guards were arriving and a dragon roared—</p><p>The vault’s door shut with a resounding <em>clang</em>… and then, silence.</p><p>Utter silence.</p><p>It was like the world had suddenly frozen. Harry stared, astounded to see that the treasure had stopped multiplying. Had, in fact, mostly disappeared. The curse had abruptly stopped. The moment the door closed everything had returned in an instant to its proper place. The vault was as pristine as it had been when they’d first entered.</p><p>And it was deathly quiet.</p><p>Panic seized Harry’s heart. “Ron! Hermione!” he called, banging on the vault’s door. It did not budge. “Griphook! Open the door! <em>Open the door!”</em></p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Breathing fast and hard, Harry went to reach for his wand—only to find, to his horror, that it was not there. It must have fallen from his pocket amidst all the chaos; must have gotten dragged along with the fake treasure, his friends, the horcrux, the sword, and the traitorous goblin.  </p><p>He was trapped in a vault and <em>he did not have his wand.</em></p><p>Harry ran a shaking hand through his hair. They would open the door at any moment. They had to. Wouldn’t they? Whether it was the Gringott goblins or Hermione and Ron or a fucking Death Eater, someone would want this vault open to get him out. To save him or kill him remained a question, but they wouldn’t leave him in here.</p><p>Harry swore. His scar prickled. He wiped a hand over his forehead, and only then realized how sweaty he was. He was drenched. Though the treasure had stopped multiplying, it was still astonishingly hot in the vault.</p><p>Perhaps there was some other way out? Doubtful, Harry thought, but he turned to begin his search anyway.</p><p>Then he saw it.</p><p>There, sitting in the very middle of the vault, alone on the floor… was the cup. It had not been there just moments before. Harry stared at it. He had been sure that it too had been poured out of the vault with the wave of fake treasure… evidently, this was not the case.</p><p>“How did you get there?” Harry asked. The cup, of course, did not answer.</p><p>Harry gave the horcrux a wide berth as he moved through the vault. The sword, was the sword here too? Amazed, Harry saw it sitting high on a shelf, on a display—but then his spirits instantly fell. No, Griphook had held the sword in his hands when the door opened. This sword here was a replica. A fake.</p><p>Harry went and grabbed it anyway. He pulled it from its display and swung it experimentally once, twice. It felt real, at any rate.</p><p>“I don’t suppose I’d get this lucky,” he murmured, turning to face the cup. “But I guess I have nothing to lose.”</p><p>With one almighty swing, he brought the sword down upon the cup of Hufflepuff. It made a loud <em>clang</em> when it collided, sending the cup soaring across the room and banging into the suit of armor and that just moments ago was replicating, nearly killing them all. It rolled across the floor until it came to a sad, anti-climactic halt. It looked perfectly intact.</p><p>“Fuck,” Harry swore. He let the fake sword fall from his sweaty palm. “Fuck.”</p><p>Of course it wouldn’t work; the sword was not real. Harry shot the fallen cup a glare before turning his attention back to the door.</p><p>“Hermione!” he shouted again, banging on it uselessly. Why was it taking so long for them to open it? “Ron! Let me out! Griphook, you bastard! Let me out! We had a deal!”</p><p>Harry yelled and pounded and even—regrettably—kicked the giant metal door, trying with all his might to get them to open up. But he had a terrible feeling that they could not hear him. This strange silence that had suddenly encapsulated the vault, he assumed, must have made it impossible for them to hear him too.</p><p>And it was so hot! Why was it so hot in this vault? Scowling, Harry approached the suit of armor. He touched it, then immediately retracted his hand. It was no longer scalding, but the metal was warm, very warm. It was radiating heat. Upon inspecting the artifacts next to it, Harry realized this was the case for everything in the room. All of the ancient treasures in the Lestrange vault were exuding a deep, penetrating heat, making the space feel like an uncomfortable sauna.  </p><p>Harry turned to go back to the door, about to begin shouting again, but stopped short.</p><p>The cup was back in the center of the room.</p><p>He had just hit it; Harry had just swung it to the other side of the vault, angrily… but it had <em>moved</em>. It sat exactly where it had been before, unscathed, standing upright. The fake sword was also back where it belonged, returned to its display.</p><p>Harry gawked at the cup. When had it moved? <em>How</em> had it moved? How had the <em>sword</em> moved?</p><p>“No,” Harry said, pointing at the cup accusingly—as though denying that anything strange had happened would make it so. “You did not move. That is not possible.”</p><p>The cup, being a cup, did not respond.</p><p>“Fuck,” Harry said again, once more running his fingers through his hair. His hands were shaking. How on earth…</p><p>Then it dawned on him. If this horcrux had moved itself on its own…</p><p>“You’re doing this,” he whispered, pointing at it again. “You opened the vault door, you closed it afterward, locking me in here, you’ve cast this spell of silence… You made everything go back to the way it was and you’re making the room hot, even now…”</p><p>Harry shook his head. Warily, he turned his back on the horcrux and returned to the door. “Let me out!” he screamed again. “Ron! Hermione! Open the damn door!”</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Frustrated and afraid, Harry pulled his t-shirt off. It was so sweat-covered that he practically had to peel it from his back. He wiped his face with it, then tossed it aside.</p><p>He was going to die in here.</p><p>He was going to die of dehydration before Lord Voldemort ever got the chance. Swearing several more times, Harry turned, ready to look for something, anything to use to escape. The cup had not moved again… but there was something different about it. Harry approached it with utmost caution.</p><p>It was no longer empty.</p><p>The cup of Helga Hufflepuff, a horcrux, was now full of what appeared to be water.</p><p>The sense of thirst that accosted him was nearly crippling in its severity and abruptness. Harry’s chapped lips suddenly felt far drier; his throat burned with a ferocity he had never known before. The heat in the room seemed to escalate in a moment, growing hotter still.</p><p>Harry shook his head at the cup. “Oh, hell no,” he said, backing away from it. “If that—if for one second—if you think I’m going to drink some fucking mysterious horcrux juice, <em>you are out of your fucking mind!”</em></p><p>The cup glittered innocently at him.</p><p>Harry swallowed hard. His tongue felt like sandpaper when he licked his lips, trying pointlessly to wet them. He crossed his arms and glared.</p><p>“No,” he said again.</p><p>The cup remained quite still.</p><p>“No way.”</p><p>No one was arguing with him.</p><p>Harry began pacing, his mind reeling and his heart racing. How long would he last in here? How long could go in this cursed, heated room without water? He was already beginning to feel light-headed.</p><p><em>Why</em> were they not opening the door?</p><p>Harry slumped to the floor, sitting cross-legged in front of the horcrux. He looked at it with narrowed eyes, examining the emblem of Helga Hufflepuff. The badger seemed to be mocking him with its adorable eyes.</p><p>This was a trap. This was a horrible, <em>obvious</em> trap. He could not seriously be considering drinking the liquid that had just mysteriously appeared in a known vessel of Lord Voldemort’s broken soul…</p><p>…Could he?</p><p>He would not stay alert for long otherwise. Harry’s mind felt fuzzy; he was becoming weaker and more delirious with each passing second. It was so hot.</p><p>He was so <em>thirsty</em>.</p><p>They weren’t opening the door. He was going to die. He would pass out first, probably, and then he would die.</p><p><em>I have no choice,</em> Harry realized.</p><p>Slowly, he reached for the cup. The golden metal was blissfully cool to the touch; the exact opposite of the sweltering air in the vault. Harry swallowed thickly before raising it to his chapped lips. He closed his eyes and, after another moment of hesitation, drank.</p><p>Harry nearly moaned when the liquid touched his tongue. It was the sweetest, coolest water he had ever tasted. It was heaven pouring down his throat. He drank the cup dry, and when the goblet was empty had to resist the maddening urge to lick the interior metal clean. Instantly, his mind felt clearer. It was astounding what just a small amount of water could do.</p><p>Harry lowered the cup. Then, somehow, as though from right behind him, Harry heard a voice. Words spoken in such a soft whisper he barely heard them.</p><p>
  <em>Equal exchange…</em>
</p><p>He dropped the goblet. Harry jumped to his feet and whipped around, frantic, his eyes scouring the vault. “Who said that?” he shouted. <em>“Who said that?”</em></p><p>There was no one there.  </p><p>Harry turned back around, slowly. His pulse was racing.  </p><p>The cup, though he had just dropped it, sending it rolling away again, was right back where it had been. In the center of the room.</p><p>Once more full of glittering, beautiful water.</p><p>“What the fuck,” Harry whispered.</p>
