    <p>At last--</p><p>"Potter, Harry!"</p><p>Harry tried to ignore the whispers that broke out all over the hall. As he sat on the stool, he saw loads of people craning to get a look at him. Then the hat was dropped over his eyes. He waited, staring into the blackness.</p><p>The hat spoke for a little bit before asking, without really speaking to Harry, "So, where shall I put you?"</p><p><i>Not Slytherin</i> thought Harry, <i>Anywhere but Slytherin </i></p><p>"Not Slytherin, eh?" The hat laughed. "Gryffindor would suit you well, yes, but Slytherin will help you to greatness."</p><p><i> I don't want great--</i> But Harry's thoughts were cut off by the hat's shout.</p><p>"SLYTHERIN!"</p><p>Harry felt a sinking feeling in his stomach. The hat was gently pulled from his head and he found the entire hall was staring at him in stunned silence, except for a few clapping Slytherins. McGonagall briefly put a hand on Harry's shoulder.</p><p>Harry walked shakily to the Slytherin table, making sure he was far enough away from Malfoy so he could ignore the other boy.</p><p>"Hi, Harry." A boy with light hair and a long face opposite Harry smiled at him. "I'm Theo Nott." Harry nodded to the other boy, nervous.</p><p>They watched as the rest of the group was sorted. Harry had a fleeting moment hope when Ron was called; maybe Ron would get put in Slytherin, maybe just maybe-- But the hat called out, "GRYFFINDOR!" and Ron headed to another table, glancing at Harry and giving him a sad smile before he sat near a group of redheads. </p><p>"Can't believe you're a Slytherin," Theo said to Harry. "Most of the people here have had entire families in Slytherin."</p><p>"Yeah, I can't believe it either," Harry said quietly.</p><p>The talk during the feast was very animated. But no one spoke of their upbringing, so Harry decided not to bother mentioning that he was nervous, having been raised by Muggles.</p><p>"The beginning classes won't be so bad," Gemma Farley, a prefect, was reassuring Goyle. The boy sat next to Malfoy and was looking nervous. "You'll be starting small."</p><p>Harry let his gaze wander to the High Table, where he spotted Hagrid, Dumbledore, McGonagall... and Quirrell, who was speaking with a teacher who had greasy black hair and a hooked nose.</p><p>Suddenly, the teacher looked from Quirrell to Harry, and Harry suddenly felt a pain shoot across his scar. Harry put a hand to his forehead, crying out.</p><p>"Alright there, Potter?" one of the older boys, Flint, who looked a bit like a troll, asked. The teacher looked away from Harry as Harry looked back up. </p><p>"Yeah..." Harry had never felt anything like it before. The pain had faded, but the look on the teacher's face--calculating, cold, and almost dislike--stayed on Harry's mind. </p><p>"Who's that talking with Quirrell?" Harry asked.</p><p>Flint looked over. "That's Professor Snape. He's head of our house and teaches potions. He's brilliant, really, but sort of scary. He's been mad for Quirrell's job for years, since I got here, at least."</p><p>"My father was prefect while Professor Snape was at school," Malfoy announced in a boasting voice. "He spoke very highly of him."</p><p>"He seems very full of himself," Theo muttered. </p><p>Harry nodded, grateful that not all the Slytherin first years were fond of Malfoy. "If Malfoy's father is anything like Draco, I'm not sure I'll like anyone he speaks highly of."</p><p>Dumbledore eventually gave some last announcements, mentioning to Harry's interest that the third floor corridor was out of bounds.</p><p>"We should go exploring sometime," Theo whispered, eyes twinkling.</p><p>Farley shot him a look. Nicolas Grimmett spoke up. "Don't lose us any points, Nott."</p><p>After they sung the school song (Harry and Theo were some of the few Slytherins who joined in enthusiastically), Farley and Grimmett led them out of the hall. On their way, they passed the Gryffindor first years, being rounded up by a tall boy with red hair--one of the Weasley brothers, Harry assumed. Ron caught Harry's eye and gave him a nervous look. Given all that Harry had heard about Slytherin, he didn't blame him. But he hoped they would still be friends--Harry liked Ron.</p><p>They were led to a stone wall in the dungeons. "The password is 'Salazar'," Farley told them, and then spoke the word to the wall. A passage revealed itself, and the first years followed the prefects into the Slytherin common room.</p><p>Harry looked around, amazed. The room had a slightly green tint which, upon looking out the windows, seemed to be due to the fact that they were underwater. The sounds of moving water occasionally muttered throughout the room, which was oddly soothing. They must have been under the lake, Harry realized.</p><p>"I wonder if we'll see the giant squid," Theo commented.</p><p>They were directed down a passage and stopped outside a door marked "Slytherin First Year Boys." Harry and Theo were to share the room with a boy named Blaise Zabini, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. Harry quickly claimed the bed between Blaise and Theo; he wanted to put space between him and Malfoy as much as he could. If Malfoy turned out to be a nicer person than his first impression suggested, Harry would make more of an effort. But the boy put Harry on edge.</p><p>"Look," Theo said to Harry, pointing out the window. Harry watched as a group of creatures he'd never seen before swam by.</p><p>"Wow," he muttered. </p><p>Harry got into bed and lay awake as the others fell asleep, listening to the sounds of the lake and watching the reflections from the water in the windows on the ceiling. He smiled, thinking that despite being in the house that had the worst reputation, everything would turn out alright.</p>
