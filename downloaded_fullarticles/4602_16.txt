When he goes to investigate what's broken, he finds Harry crouched near one of the end tables, holding a fractured frame.</p><p>"I'm sorry-" Harry looks guilt stricken, an expression Draco hasn't seen on his face since their school days, almost two decades ago, and it's not hard to understand why. It's one of the last pictures of Astoria and Scorpius before her death.</p><p>Draco wants to yell, scream at the top of his lungs, because he told Harry to be careful. He knew this would happen, and Astoria-</p><p>Draco closes his eyes for a moment and sighs. She's dead and Harry looks like a kicked puppy. "We're wizards, Potter. We can fix it." He takes the frame from Harry's hands and puts it on the table. "After dinner," he adds.</p><p>Harry smiles brightly. "And after closing the window."</p><p>"Yes, we wouldn't want to do more damage to the manor." As Harry closes the window, Draco looks back at the frame.
