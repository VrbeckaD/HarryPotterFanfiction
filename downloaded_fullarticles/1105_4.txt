    <p> </p>
<p>Harry slowly opened his eyes and saw a white place. The first thought that came to his mind was that he was in heaven. After all the shit he had gone through in his very short life, he deserved to be in heaven.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He shook his head to clear his thoughts and got up carefully and looked around; he was surrounded by white fog.  Everywhere he looked, there was only white fog.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He really was dead then.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For some time nothing happened, but soon he heard faint whimpering. He turned in the direction from where the voice came and flinched as he saw what was making the noise. A small, red, baby like thing was whimpering under a bench. He walked towards it to help it, but was stopped by the very familiar voice of Headmaster Dumbledore.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry looked behind him, and there was Albus Dumbledore; looking absolutely fine. He turned back towards the thing whose cries pf pain were hurting him. He wanted to help. He needed to help it. He had a feeling he knew what it was. He just didn’t want to admit it. Dumbledore called him again and he reluctantly went to the old man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dumbledore explained everything about the Horcruxes, Deathly Hallows, his relationship with Grindelwald, and how he now had the choice to either move on or go back. He was only vaguely listening though. His mind was on the shard that had died. His suspicion was true after all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You can’t help, Harry,” Dumbledore said gently when Harry kept on glancing back at the horcrux. “You shouldn’t pity the dead. Pity the living.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry wasn’t in the mood to listen to Dumbledore’s speeches anymore. He had already made up his mind. He grimaced and got up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dumbledore furrowed his brows in confusion. “Harry?” He called the seventeen year old’s name but got no response. He didn't know what Harry was thinking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry didn’t bother answering and went back to the bench under which the horcrux was still suffering. He bent down and carefully picked up the red burnt thing. He refused to call it an infant. It wasn’t.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To his surprise, it quietened instantly. He smiled gently at the horcrux and Dumbledore’s eyes widened in horror.</p>
<p>Harry looked back at his headmaster and wasn’t surprised to see that the man was looking at him as if he was Voldemort himself. He shook his head and turned back to the thing in his arms. He caressed the head of the thing and grinned again.</p>
<p>As soon as he did that, the burnt thing vanished and in its place was a beautiful baby. The baby blinked its silvery grey eyes at him and gave him a toothy smile. Harry's heart melted as he saw that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>I will save you, Tom. Don’t worry. I will care for you. I will love you like a lover. Give you so much love and happiness that you’ll never become what you did.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>I have a feeling you wouldn’t have ended up cracked if your parents hadn’t died.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As soon as Harry thought those words, a hooded person appeared in front of them. Harry looked surprised, but his reaction was nothing compared to Dumbledore’s. The man started shivering as he saw the hooded being. He was already horror struck after seeing Harry smiling gently at the burnt horcrux. Then, for some unfathomable reason, the thing had changed into a normal baby.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Professor, you said there is no such thing as Death.” Harry tilted his head towards the hooded man. “Who is that then?” he softly asked Dumbledore.</p>
<p>For the first time, Albus Dumbledore didn’t have anything witty to say. He was at a loss for words.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It seemed the hooded figure had enough of their presumptions about him and decided to take off his hood. Harry gasped as he saw the beautiful man now standing in front of him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was tall, 6'4 maybe, pale, had short, golden brown hair that reached just past his ears, high cheekbones and a strong jaw. The entity was smirking at him and Dumbledore, his ocean blue eyes shining in amusement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry lowered his head as he realized there was a high chance the man? Death? might have heard his thoughts. This was embarrassing. So, what if Death looked like a human being ? Who said that Death had to be a person who looked like a skeleton and was holding a scythe? Harry doubted anyone had even seen Death.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Master, I can grant you your wish. You wish to save Tom Marvolo Riddle.” Death’s rich baritone brought Harry out of his reverie. Harry looked curiously at Death but the man just smiled kindly at him.</p>
<p>“It’s not a trick. I came as soon as you made up your mind, my friend.” Death chuckled then. “Even you should know, no one can ever master death. To even think that is the height of arrogance. But, I see you as my friend, you who possess all three items I helped in making, so I can grant you your wish. You are a good human.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry nodded while Dumbledore was now looking at Harry with newfound respect.</p>
<p>“It can really happen?” Harry asked softly. “What I want?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Death looked amused. “Yes. Just say the word and I will kill the wizard who tried to defeat me and named himself Voldemort. He is unconscious now; but if you wish it, he will never open his eyes again. He’ll come here with you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry grinned widely at that. “Good, war will stop then. Everyone will round up the Death Eaters and Tom and I will get another chance.” He smiled sadly for a minute. “I’ll miss Ron and Hermione, but they’ll understand. Yes, they will understand.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Are you sure?” Death asked Harry. His master really was a kind person. No, not master, his friend. No one can master death, they can delay it but can’t master it. He had helped the Peverell brothers when they’d summoned him. But, even they had died, the original creator of the Hallows. He’d blessed their creations with his magic and that’s what had made them special.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah, I am sure.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Death smiled good naturedly at the two before bowing his head in Harry's direction and disappearing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harry.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry looked at Dumbledore and was surprised to see tears in the man’s eyes. “Professor?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dumbledore shook his head and got up. He walked to where Harry was standing at patted his head. “You are wonderful, my boy.” He looked at Harry’s empty hands and his eyes softened. “If it’s you, you can change Tom.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry then realized that his hands were empty. He looked down and frowned. He hadn’t even noticed when Voldemort’s horcux had vanished. He looked at Dumbledore for answers, but the man just gave him a small smile.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The soul piece of Tom Riddle found peace. It has rejoined with the others and the main soul.” He let out a chuckle. “I am sure we’ll see him here soon.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry’s mouth opened in an o and was surprised when the entity came back with an annoyed look on his beautiful face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s done, master. Voldemort is no more.” Voldemort was making him restless. He really was impressed with the man and maybe the man could have lived forever if he’d stopped after he’d opened the Chamber of Secrets. But, the brilliant wizard became greedy and tried to cheat death again and again and again. Herpo was still alive after all. Mean existence, but alive nonetheless.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Death curiously looked at Harry then. “Would you like to talk to your parents, master?” He knew the kid loved his parents.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry’s eyes brightened as he heard Death’s question. “Yes, of course.” He’d never known them. Would be nice to talk to them once. He suddenly thought about Tom’s parents and blushed as Death bowed his head. “It will be done, master.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Next second, four people appeared in the clearing. James and Lily Potter ran to Harry as soon as they saw him. They engulfed him in their arms, unwilling to let go. Their son really was kind. They were very proud of him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tom Riddle Sr was looking at the boy incredulously. They’d seen what the seventeen year old had done. They knew what he had asked of Death. He couldn’t understand how anyone could be so nice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Thank you for saving him,” Merope’s tired voice got James, Lily and Harry’s attention.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry smiled sadly at the two who were both victims. Merope looked like she had in the memories. Tom’s father, though, looked older and wary. He looked around in his late thirties, not like the young man he was in the memories of Bob Ogden.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I refuse to believe he would have turned into a monster if you both had cared for him.” He looked at Tom’s father who averted his eyes as he heard that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t blame you, you know. Anyone in your position would have done the same. Nobody deserves to be violated in the way you were.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>James, Lily, Dumbledore and Merope flinched as they heard that.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Death grimaced as he looked at Voldemort’s parents. Tom Riddle Sr was standing with both arms wrapped around his body, they could all see the man was trying to control the tremors going through his body.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Merope started crying and Harry gently disentangled himself from his parents embrace. He walked to the woman and gently wiped her cheeks and shook his head. “If you realize what you did was wrong, then that’s all that matters, Lady. You do know what you did was wrong? Don’t you? What you did was nothing but a crime.”</p>
<p>The woman looked at Harry as if he was an angel. She slowly closed the gap between them and embraced him.</p>
<p>She was sorry. She was so sorry.</p>
<p>Her abuse didn’t give her the right to rape another man. That's what she had done. She had had no right to turn Tom’s life into a living nightmare; just like hers had been. Her actions had condemned the wizarding world and only brought death and destruction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry rubbed soothing circles on her back. Merope wasn’t a bad person. Neither was Tom’s father. Just because he was arrogant didn’t mean he was a monster. Voldemort was just unfortunate in everything. Harry clenched his hand. He won’t let that that happen again. He won’t.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Death grinned as he heard Harry, but didn’t say anything.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry looked at Voldemort’s father who looked exactly like his son had at one point. “As I said, you were both victims. You know the abuse she went through. She did pay for her crimes too.” Harry saw as the man’s eyes clouded in anger.</p>
<p>Tom Riddle Sr clenched his hands. Of course now he knew what Marvolo and Morfin had done to their family. He knew his…wife was not all there. But he didn’t have to pay the price for her illusion of peace.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry patted Merope’s back again before going back to his parents. James dropped a kiss on his head while Lily put her arm around his shoulder.</p>
