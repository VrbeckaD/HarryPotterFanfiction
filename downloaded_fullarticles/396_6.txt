          <div class="userstuff"><p>'Don't lie to us, Harry, Hermy and I know that we're right!'</p><p>The Griffindor suddenly blushed, shaking his head disapprovingly. </p><p>'No, I swear ! You're wrong !'</p><p>Hermione stopped reading, exchanging looks with Ron and laughing with him. Harry couldn't lie to save his life.</p><p>'Shut up, Harry, we're right!'</p><p>'For goodness' sake, I didn't spend the night with Draco Malfoy!'</p><p>Ron raised an eyebrow.</p><p>'You're a really bad liar, buddy. And we won't believe you, whatever you will tell, so stop trying to justify yourself!'</p><p>The wizard glared at his best friend, taking his pumpkin juice glass in his hand.</p><p>'As you said, Ron, it would be sympathizing with the enemy. I hate Draco Malfoy, and you know it. So quit saying stupid things and focus on important things.'</p><p>Hermione giggled, Harry gazing at her with a dismayed look.</p><p>'Guys, I don't know why you're like this today, but you're scaring me...'</p><p>'What's bothering us, you see, is the fact that you won't reveal us the truth, since we're your best friends. You spent your night with Malfoy.'</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. He started to feel really annoyed. </p><p>'You make accusations without any proof.'</p><p>His friends bursted out laughting, Hermione saying:</p><p>'We have tons of proofs! Like the way Malfoy look at you since this morning...'</p><p>'Or your hickey?'</p><p>Harry blushed again, covering his face with his hands to hide his embarrassment.</p><p>'Oh, Hermy, I need a reminder, please!' Ron couldn't help but chuckling.</p><p>'Yes, Ron?'</p><p>'What are the colors of our beloved house?'</p><p>'Red and gold, my dear Ronald! Why?'</p><p>'Oh, nothing ! Just Harry's green and silver tie!'</p><p>The Griffindor died of shame, rolling his eyes. He didn't realized he took his boyfriend's tie while getting ready.</p><p>'Can you stop it, please?' he begged 'I think I get it ...'</p><p>Hermione took a buttered toast, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>'Weren't you supposed to hate each other?'</p><p>The younger shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>'Weren't you supposed to hate Parkinson?'</p></div>
