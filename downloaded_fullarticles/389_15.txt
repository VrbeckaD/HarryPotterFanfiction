    <p>Harry ran from the ball, beautiful music and laughter accompanying his hurried steps in echoing amongst the stone walls. The first day of the celebration was still going on, dancing, singing, and laughing, bringing joy to everyone as they celebrated the birthday of their prince. After all, he only turned 21 once and he was required to take a consort this year or risk losing all rights to the throne. Not that anyone actually expected that to happen, no matter how long it took for the boy to make his choice, but the precedence was there.</p><p>The prince was well-loved by his family and the people despite some of the rumors about his temper. He always seemed ready to help the people who’d fallen down. His mother’s story had instilled in him a passion for the poor and a love of his people. He was still aloof, but his manners made him stand out, head and shoulders above the rest.</p><p>Needless to say- anyone should have been flattered to have been the man’s chosen. When Harry had realized his heart had gone through the ceiling and floated with the stars. Until reality came crashing down hard at the sight of a very familiar face.</p><p>This prince thought the dark-haired boy was a noble in status, at least. But Harry wasn’t anything special. He was a freak, a no-good orphan of a servant. He had nothing, so he hadn’t exactly expected the crown prince to ask him to dance.</p><p>Harry hadn’t even known who the handsome stranger was when he had first been asked to dance, in fact, he probably would have turned him down had he known. But the gorgeous gentleman had pulled him aside without questions. And when he had recalled the man’s name- “Tom” hadn’t even triggered a connection to the Prince Thomas Marvolo Riddle.</p><p>When the man had asked to introduce Harry to his family, Harry had easily agreed, thinking of nothing but the minutes of happiness and a chance at freedom. Until he’d realized he’d been heading toward the thrones that sat overlooking the dancers. His feet had frozen in place causing his dance partner to glance at him in question. Harry’s brain had quickly pieced together the worst solution and he swallowed heavily before nodding at the King and the King’s son-in-law.</p><p>“You…You’re the prince?”</p><p>Tom had shrugged, “Technically, but I prefer not to think about it to be honest.”</p><p>Harry just stared, what were the odds. This was what happened when you let a crazy noble with his wand ask you a favor. This was what happened when you stepped outside your comfort zone. You were placed in a moment where you hung suspended between a broken heart and high treason.</p><p>Just then the clock chimed over. Harry looked up in time to see the clock tick until it stood at five minutes to twelve. He felt a buzzing over his ears and could sense the static in his hair as it began to stand on end against the charms holding it flat (Well flatter, anyway) He had to get out of here.</p><p>“If you’ll excuse me, your highness. I’m afraid I must leave.”</p><p>The prince startled, “What? But you said you would-.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, but-.” He glanced around finding the nearest door, “I must go.”</p><p>“Is it because I am the prince?”</p><p>“Yes, I mean no, I mean… It’s complicated! I really must leave. I’m sorry!” Harry gently wrested his arm away and disappeared into the crowds.</p><p>Harry made his way across the floor, past the dancers and food and the few people he had spoken with. He was standing at the acceptable entrance, guarded by two tall men, sooner than he would have liked. He had hoped this evening could have continued. He had to pause at the doors, not knowing if he could really go back to the life that lay beyond them.</p><p>But he didn’t have a choice.</p><p>He shook his head and made to move on, but his wrist was caught in the tight grip of a gloved hand. He turned to look into worried brown eyes that held the slightest red tone around the pupils blown wide. He felt his heart clench at the worry and anxiety that lay within those orbs.</p><p>He gently pulled the prince’s fingers from his wrist giving a gentle squeeze to the gloved hand before he turned again to flee.</p><p>“You’ll come back? Tomorrow?”</p><p>“Perhaps.” He was starting</p><p>“Please?”</p><p>The guards seemed to stand straighter at that and Harry would hazard a guess that it was only years of training that prevented their turning to stare at the boy who made the prince say ‘please.’</p><p>Even so Harry couldn’t answer. He gave a slight smile, that he feared showed everything he was feeling, before he shoved out the doors, ignoring the warm voice calling for him to wait.</p><p>Which had led Harry to this moment, hurrying down the halls, trying to avoid the man who had made him feel wanted, appreciated, for the first time. Unfortunately, the prince had not been willing to accept Harry’s silence as an answer. Which was fair seeing as Harry didn’t believe it to be much of an answer either.</p><p>The prince seemed to be determined to have his way and made chase after the fleeing boy. He caught up only moments after the main castle doors had closed. The doors swung open at his approach but Tom could only curse from the top stair as he could not even spy a carriage, or horse, or even a person racing down the driveway.</p><p>He cursed under his breath and cast a reveal charm, only to find no trace of his flighty dance partner. Apparently, this partner was more than worthy of him if he could either afford this level of magic cast upon him or cast it himself. He frowned as he scanned the castle paths once more before reluctantly turning and re-entering the celebration.</p><p>Just beneath the banisters the flowering rose bushes hid the shape of a dirty servant boy, knees and fingers sore from scrubbing the ballroom floors all day, soft clothes made that way through constant use rather than a fine dollar, hair falling in an untidy nest rather than styled coifs. The only reminder of the boy who had danced so comfortably with the prince was the jagged scar across his forehead and green eyes dimmed now in resignation as the royal figure retreated to his party.</p><p>****</p><p>****</p><p>…A week earlier…</p><p>Harry wasn’t going to lie to himself. He could have been far unluckier following the death of his parents. He could have been sent to a prison, to work for a slave master, or even to have been left abandoned on these streets.</p><p>Instead he was taken in by his mother’s family. A noble family who had maintained their rank despite turning their nose up at what they believed was an abnormality. An ‘abnormality’ which had provided their rank in the first place.</p><p>An ‘abnormality’ that his father had inherited, and his mother had been lucky enough to attract his attention with a slight talent herself. Or unlucky enough if you listened to his aunt and uncle. Of course, that marriage was the reason they were living in such a nice place, not that they would ever tell you that.</p><p>Harry had long since determined that the only reason they kept him was fear that their lack of the ‘abnormality’ would result in their being stripped of their title and lands. They understood that so long as they had their nephew around people might believe that he too possessed the ‘abnormality’ although to be fair more people referred to it as ‘the gift.’</p><p>So he got to live in his grandparent’s manor following their death along with the rest of his family. They all enjoyed the fine ornamentation, high class food, and servants waiting on them hand a foot. His uncle was a merchant and traveled selling tools to those who were not blessed with the gift. He was a proud proponent of the idea that one did not need to pay people to magic a solution.</p><p>Harry on the other hand enjoyed his small room in the basement next to the boiler so that he could continue to stoke it throughout the night. He dressed in his cousin’s tailor-made hand-me-downs that were belted around his frame using any spare twine he could find. He ate whatever his family deemed to give him when they felt he deserved it (which meant he relied on the cook and maid to give him leftovers from their meals when they could). He spent the majority of his day practicing the skills the family gardener had taught him before he’d been asked to move into a better position at another household.</p><p>No one blamed the older man for leaving, a majority of the staff had found work elsewhere within a year of the family moving in. They were horrid to their staff and to anyone they thought below them. In the end, the only ones who stayed were Mrs. Weasley, their cook, and Mrs. Figg, their maid. Mrs. Weasley stayed thanks to the fact she had five children to feed and two more who were off in the world. Her husband had a good job but could not take in enough to feed a family as large as theirs. Especially with six sons who needed an inheritance and a daughter who needed a dowry.</p><p>Mrs. Figg stayed because she literally didn’t remember how bad the family was day after day. She had a routine and she stuck to it day after day. The same day on an eternal loop. As far as Harry could tell, she was repeating a Tuesday from about five years ago.</p><p>Harry ended up picking up the rest of the slack. Mrs. Figg only ever remembered to clean the bedrooms and the office every day. Harry cleaned the halls, the bathrooms, the den, the living room, the dining room, the attic (although he didn’t know why, it’s not like anyone went up there), the conservatory, the library, and whatever else his aunt could find that was ‘not pristine.’ Then he tended the gardens and the horses, then he eventually made his way inside where, thankfully, Mrs. Weasley was usually able and willing to help with the darning and mending. Sometimes she was even able to bring her youngest daughter to help. She was a bit quiet, but Harry could see her fire beneath the surface.</p><p>Harry’s best friend was actually the youngest Weasley son, they didn’t get to see each other very often as he was apprenticing at the castle. He had been a page for a year now and was hoping to be taken on as a squire when they hosted the next contest. Apparently, he flitted from master to master as needed and was waiting for one of them to take him on fully, seeing as he was getting far past the age when all of his other brothers had been taken on.</p><p>Two of the six brothers were employed at the castle now. Percy, who Harry had met once, was a scribe. He had taught himself to read and write somehow and was quickly snatched by the royal family. Charlie was the marshal, but also doubled as a caregiver for all the animals of the palace.</p><p>So while Ron complained daily about the work of carrying trays up and down stairs and having to wait in silence until he was needed, Harry nodded and commiserated with his friend. But no one really understood, he kept it from them all, you see. Sure, they saw that he was overworked, but no one knew that in order to get his chores done, Harry slept four hours a night. Two while Mrs. Figg made the beds and the family settled for the night, and two more just before Mrs. Weasley came in to begin making the breakfast for the day.</p><p>Everyone once and a while she would catch him waking up, but she had no idea. He had to stoke the fire all night after all and there was no one else to maintain the fires at night in the bedrooms so that his aunt and uncle would have warm floors on which to set their feet. No one else to lay out his family’s clothes.</p><p>No one really noticed, but Harry always hoped that maybe if he worked hard enough and didn’t complain that his mother’s words would come true and he would find love and happiness. All he needed was to have courage and be kind.</p><p>So Harry never complained, made excuses for his family’s horridness, and snuck a sip of his uncle’s morning coffee to keep from falling asleep. For thirteen years he put up with their cruelty, learned more and more skills, and fought to keep his family from falling into ruin. One dark night in the winter of his seventeenth year he thought that perhaps it had all been worth it when his uncle and aunt received a letter from the palace.</p><p>He thanked the messenger and offered him water and a snack before he headed on his way. But the large man shook his head, Hagrid had a great many more houses to visit after all. Harry wished him a good day and shut the door only to find a boney finger pointed in his face.</p><p>“Clean yourself up, boy! We must have you looking your best. Go inform the tailor that we need three fine outfits for the upcoming ball. The prince’s twenty-first year is to be marked by a celebration that shall end in his choosing a consort.”</p><p>Harry grabbed his cloak and was trying to plan out finishing his chores with this interruption when his uncle’s voice cut through the air.</p><p>“Get yourself something nice as well. Can’t have you looking like that when you may be connected with us.”</p><p>Harry froze, one hand on the wooden surface before turning slowly to look at his uncle’s expectant look, “That’s…Truly?”</p><p>His aunt frowned, “Yes, yes. Do not spend too much. Something simple will do just find. Perhaps find something second-hand someone will sell to you.”</p><p>“Thank you!” Harry grinned, his green eyes glowing brighter than they had in years, “I won’t embarrass you at that the ball, I swear. I won’t talk with anyone or dance with anyone, I’ll just-.”</p><p>He was interrupted by his cousin’s laugh, “Mummy! He thinks he’s going to be attending the ball with us!”</p><p>Soon the rest of his family followed their son in laughter. Harry felt his smile fade.</p><p>“You, boy, are to get clothes suitable for a servant. For it is only appropriate that we offer our services to help with the preparation for the ball itself. If you do attend the ball it will be solely for sweeping the food off the dance floor.”</p><p>Harry felt his stomach fall and cursed himself for ever raising his hopes for even thinking that they might consider him a part of the family rather than a part of the household staff. He blinked away the tears even as he pushed past the wooden door and into the streets. His family’s laughter still chasing him.</p><p>He returned home that night far later than anyone could have anticipated having opted to help the tailor take measurements from the admittedly daunting line of prospective customers preparing for the ball in three weeks’ time. He was sure that Madame Malkin was beyond thankful for having the gift as she swallowed at the sight of yet another customer walking in her door.</p><p>Worried that she seemed to be overtaxed as it was he requested only the fabric for his family’s outfits. She had taught him a great deal of her skills on his frequent trips to request a new dress for his aunt or a new suit jacket for his ever-expanding uncle and cousin. She eagerly accepted the offer and handed him the fabric at a fraction of the cost with only a note on the newest styles that his aunt would want, ignoring the fact they were all from flattering on her outrageously thin form.</p><p>So Harry had now only to figure out how to find the time to create the three fine outfits on top of his regular chores. Amazingly though, everything seemed to be going right for him in the days leading to the ball.</p><p>He focused on the roses and they seemed to bloom fuller with the slightest bit of water. When he went to brush the horses, the brushes seemed to move easier and faster, the dirt practically falling off their coats and leaving them gleaming. The coach that sat in the barn seemed to have the spiderwebs pulling off the dust, the seats unreasonably well-oiled rather than the cracked mess they should be after the years of disuse.</p><p>Even inside the fires seemed to stoke themselves and Harry watched as every stitch seemed to have the strength of two and the outfits seemed to all be perfectly cut and measured despite his small talents. The dress looked just as it did in Harry’s vision and in only a little more time than it would have taken the tailor. By some miracle Harry was actually able to get a full six hours of sleep one night.</p><p>He was amazed that everything seemed to be going so well and with his family’s ball clothes packed into their wardrobes the night before he was to leave for the palace he let himself fall into bed. His curtains through which the light usually woke him at dawn, shut tight against the moon’s rays.</p><p>He awoke to the sound of his aunt’s screams and he suddenly realized that he had forgotten the new outfit for himself. Panicking he saw the leftover scraps from the clothes intended for his cousin would be far from enough. Even if he had enough, he’d over slept as it was and there would never be enough time.</p><p>The door to the basement opened and Mrs. Weasley rushed down the stairs, “Thank Merlin!”</p><p>She hurriedly pulled him to his feet and clicked her tongue at the sight of him.</p><p>“I’m so sorry! I can’t believe I overslept it’s just-.”</p><p>“No time, now. You’re to leave within the half-hour. I brought one of Ronnie’s outfits for you. I have no idea how you managed to sew those outfits in time.”</p><p>She attempted to brush him clean even as she started pulling his night clothes off his sweaty skin. But with every moment passed, the time of his departure edging closer and her time to cook dwindling, she seemed to grow more flustered. With a frown she looked to the basement door before turning back to the boy covered in soot.</p><p>“Needs must. I trust you won’t tell the Dursley’s about this.” Harry didn’t have a chance to ask what, not that he was intending to tell them anything the kind woman didn’t want them to know.</p><p>She pulled a slim stick from her apron and with a few whispered words the boy found himself dressed in a finer and more-fitting set of clothes than he had ever worn. Despite the fact they were easily four inches too long in the legs.</p><p>“Ah, I’d been afraid of that.”</p><p>The legs folded with another swish as they hemmed themselves. Harry stared at her in bewilderment, “You’re gifted!”</p><p>“Of course, there’s no way I could cook enough for this family otherwise.”</p><p>Harry let out a laugh and blushed self-consciously as he felt the ash fall from his face.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“Don’t mention it, I’ll care for the house while you’re gone. Enjoy the time away.”</p><p>“Thank you.” He trailed fingers down the worn fabric and was amazed at the lack of patches or holes.</p><p>Kind fingers reached out to grip his in a firm squeeze, “Go.”</p><p>He wrapped arms around her waist and nearly cried at the maternal kiss she placed upon his messy head of hair.</p><p>With a watery smile he scurried up the stairs and into the path of his aunt’s rampage.</p><p>“There you are! Get a move on will you. You’re expected in palace in under an hour. Take that old bay in the barn. The others are more than capable of pulling the carriage, perhaps they’ll keep him and we won’t have to waste the funds on feeding him.”</p><p>Harry bit his tongue in his haste to lock back the words. The horse was as sturdy as ever and was as loyal as any animal could be. Well unless you hit him with a stick. Harry turned away to hide the laugh that threatened to rise up at the memory of the bay turning and blaring at Dudley when the boy had tried to hit him a second time. Dudley had never looked more like a pig than he had in that moment.</p><p>Without further ado he gave Mrs. Figg a hug and asked her to try and remember to clean the living room curtains the next day. To which she only responded that she would never forget such a thing. Harry gave her a kiss on the cheek and headed out the front door trying to anticipate how much work he would have to do to catch up when he did come back.</p><p>Assuming the royal family didn’t try to keep him that is.</p><p>Harry laughed at his wishful thinking as he saddled up the old bay and swung a leg over his back. With a nod to steel himself he clicked his tongue and off they went leaving the manor behind him. Harry almost wished that he could call this place home. But no matter how many years he’d spent within those walls…</p><p>He arrived at the palace gates a scant few minutes before he was expected and gave a sigh of relief that he wouldn’t necessarily have to expect a beating when he walked through the gates. He gave the bay a thankful pat as he unhooked his feet and slipped from the strong back. Then he went to stand by the servants’ entrance only to realize that he had absolutely no idea what to do from here. Was he supposed to knock? Did someone know to come for him? Would the gate be unlocked if he pushed on it?</p><p>Thankfully he was saved by another servant walking up the path, well he assumed it was a servant anyway.</p><p>“Hi there! You must be from one of the local households. My name is Hermione Granger, and you are?”</p><p>Harry went to answer but choked a little bit, probably on the ashes left over from sleeping by the furnace, “Sorry, cinders.”</p><p>Hermione frowned, “Cinders? That’s an interesting name, although I guess I can’t really say much can I? Oh well, come on, I’ll show you around and then we can go see Mrs. McGonagall. She’s the one who’s in charge of the ball preparation so we’ll want to see her pretty quick.”</p><p>A little overwhelmed by the overflow of information Harry totally forgot to correct his name and blinkingly took some of the packages out of Hermione’s grasp.</p><p>“Thank you!”</p><p>The girl continued to ramble asking him if he was gifted all the while informing him of her own studies and Harry was amazed he got a word in edgewise but began to just enjoy the theory of magic as he’d never be able to experience it himself.</p><p>oOo</p><p>“There you are, quickly now, we must get started on the cooking for our guests. They’ve invited Lord and Lady Malfoy, Lords and Lady Lestrange, and – oh, I’m sorry who are you, dear boy?”</p><p>Harry gave a slight bow but was cut off from his own introduction when Hermione decided to help, “This is Cinders! He’s been most kind in helping me carry the shopping inside. He’s from the…”</p><p>All of the sudden she seemed to realize she didn’t actually know which household he was from, “The Dursley’s sent me but-.”</p><p>Mrs. McGonagall frowned, “I don’t remember that name on my list, ah well. Let’s get to it then, I’ll have you start cleaning and airing the rugs in the entrance hall. I assume you know not to converse with our guests or the royal family.”</p><p>“Of course, ma’am.”</p><p>“Good, carry on and when they’re clean come find me and we’ll find another task in need of doing.”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am.” He blinked but was actually rather pleased that he was being put to work rather than waiting around like Ron always insisted was the case.</p><p>So Harry went to work, surprisingly the rugs were not really as heavy as they looked and Harry was able to drag them out by himself and get them beaten out. Then it took only a few more minutes to get it wiped down with a damp cloth until the fibers were practically shining. It looked about as clean as Harry imagined it had before the age had set in.</p><p>Within the hour Harry had been able to scrub the floors and then he took the time to wipe down the walls where it seemed people had been running dirty fingers since the last ball. Soon enough the rugs were dry and he was able to bring the rugs back inside without dragging them through anymore dirt.</p><p>With the first project done he headed back towards the kitchens running into a sour looking older man with a hook like nose.</p><p>“You are new here. Who are you.”</p><p>There was no question in the voice but Harry answered anyway slightly concerned that this man was going to strangle him, “I’m here to help with the ball.”</p><p>“Ah yes, Mrs. McGonagall mentioned you, <em>Cinders</em>, if I care to recall. You were given an assignment already, were you not?” The words were practically a dare against any correction. His eyes just daring to glimpse his scant frame over the bridge of the prominent nose between them.</p><p>“Yes, sir, but I was to report back to the kitchens when I finished.”</p><p>The man’s eyebrows furrowed, “And you decided to just take an unsolicited break in the meantime I suppose?”</p><p>Harry shook his head, “No, I-.”</p><p>“We do not allow dunderheads or laziness in this castle, Mr. Cinders. As such we shall have to analyze your work and report back to your Master regarding your behavior today.”</p><p>The young boy could tell that this man was as willing to listen to him as his aunt and uncle were, which meant to say not at all. So instead of protesting his relationship to the Dursleys (he would never refer to the man as his master. He did not even want to refer to him as ‘uncle’ a majority of the time) he followed along silently and waited for his work to be critiqued. Aunt Petunia did the same thing, no matter how long or hard Harry worked there was always something not done correctly.</p><p>“You were to clean the rugs, is that correct?”</p><p>Harry nodded as the man walked forward and, using the white kerchief from his pocket, ran a soft cloth against the fibers searching for a speck of dust. Harry watched as he frowned at the white kerchief and could just imagine him analyzing the few specks of dirt Harry had left behind. Then he did the same on the floors, and tested the doorframe, knobs, and every other surface in the entrance hall.</p><p>The boy startled when the man turned an intense gaze upon him and soon the man’s long fingers gripped his shoulder painfully and shoved him down the halls towards the kitchens.</p><p>“The boy has finished his tasks. Set him to preparing the guest rooms and I will then like to speak with you, Minerva.”</p><p>Mrs. McGonagall frowned at Harry in much the same way the hook-nosed man had, “He’s finished you say? And you found it acceptable?”</p><p>The man gave a head raise that seemed to be neither acceptance nor rejection and merely intoned, “Passable.”</p><p>Mrs. McGonagall nodded her eyes suddenly wide before narrowing, “Miss Granger. Please take Mister Cinders to the guest rooms. He shall be cleaning the Green Room-.”</p><p>The man cut in with a shake of his head, “I believe he would do better in the Snow Room.”</p><p>Mrs. McGonagall started, “…very well. The Snow Room then. Please show him where all of the supplies are.”</p><p>Hermione nodded obviously shocked by the turn of events, but Harry had absolutely no idea what had upset these people so greatly. Hermione nonetheless led the way from the kitchen to the servant’s stairs and soon enough they found themselves entering a small hallway that Harry suspected ran the length of the wing alongside the rooms. Hermione paused, “I don’t know why you’re being given this room. But it is the most important guest room in the castle. This is where the visiting royalty stay, the one the prince places in the highest regard. More than likely this room will be occupied by our future king or queen.”</p><p>Harry swallowed, that did not seem like a room a visiting servant should be trusted with. What was going on in this place.</p><p>“This is a test of something. I would suggest not failing. Supplies are found in the closet and in the dumbwaiter at the end of the hall by the stairs. The first bucket has been filled for you most likely, but you will have to change it when it becomes unusable. Make sure to freshen the sheets and fluff the pillows. The carpets need to be spotless, the draperies cleaned and checked, the wardrobe aired out, the personal bath scrubbed, and everything needs to be dusted.”</p><p>Harry frowned, “This has to be a three-person job at least.”</p><p>Hermione shrugged, “Usually it’s done by Mrs. McGonagall. She is the best at perfecting everything to standard. Asking her to give it to you means something…”</p><p>She frowned as though the answer was right there but she just could not quite figure it out.</p><p>Harry could not really care less at the moment though, this room was going to take hours to clean and he had no time to spare for pointless thoughts. He frowned as he looked at the small bucket and semi-warm water. He shook off the worry and rolled up his sleeves.</p><p>At least he didn’t have to take time to dump the water outside and then travel to the well every time it got dirty.</p><p>****</p><p>****</p><p>“Are you certain this is wise, Severus?”</p><p>The dour man gave a small headshake, “The only thing I am certain of in this moment is that the boy is lying. Whether it is about his identity or the gift. This is merely a test to see how much his blood has been diluted.”</p><p>McGonagall pursed her lips, “If what you’re saying is true, he may-.”</p><p>“I agree, Minerva. Which is why we <em>need</em> to be absolutely certain.”</p><p>Both watched in silence waiting for the boy to come change out the water. When the boy did not…. Severus made his way to the room while Mrs. McGonagall made her way to the throne room and their king, Marvolo Gaunt.</p><p>She knocked on the door gently, listening carefully for the quiet whisper of the elderly king’s voice. With a nod at a perceived answer Minerva made her way into the room and gave the deepest curtsey her aging knees would allow her.</p><p>When she did raise her eyes, she took in the elderly man and his likely still angered son-in-law who stood aside from the throne. The young Riddle man had married into the Gaunt family believing he would gain status and power. His mother possessed the gift of Sight and had foreseen him seated on the throne. As such he had eagerly returned the affections of the young Merope.</p><p>But the King could not allow one from common blood to take his throne. For his daughter had wedded the wealthiest man she could but he had not a stitch of the gift. The man’s mother lived barely long enough to foresee the exact copy of her son in the form of her grandson. Merope had died giving birth to the child and Gaunt would have thrown them both out, but the young Morfin had succumbed to insanity mere weeks before which meant unless Marvolo miraculously conceived another heir the throne would pass to his grandson.</p><p>The young boy, who had been given his father’s name (despite his grandfather’s attempts otherwise), was proud, smart, and aloof. Likely due to the fact the only ones to speak to him were the servants. He was not to be seen and Minerva suspected that he was tucked away in the library avoiding the pressures of his family and the upcoming ball.</p><p>“Your Highness, we believe we might have discovered a truly gifted one.”</p><p>The elderly king sat eagerly forward, “An old family name then?”</p><p>Minerva slowly shook her head, “No, it’s from one of the servants of the lords sent to <em>assist</em> us in our preparations.”</p><p>The man sat back with a sigh, “It is no matter then, just another who desires the status of being gifted.”</p><p>“Your Highness, I-.”</p><p>“Leave.”</p><p>Pursing her lips, the woman never less nodded before making her way back out the door from which she had entered. The king would not be assuaged without facts. They needed to prove that the boy had the old magic and there was only one way to do it. She nodded to herself and couldn’t help but be thankful that the ball was still a day away.</p><p>****</p><p>****</p><p>Harry worked on the Snow Room until well into the afternoon, opting to skip his afternoon meal in an attempt to get farther than he had. But finally, it was done. The carpets were practically glowing with their white threads, the bed looked positively divine (Harry wanted nothing more than to lay amongst the fluffed quilts and pillows but refrained knowing that he’d have to start again), and the windows were spotless as the sunshine radiated through the room.</p><p>Confident that he had done all he could for the room and feeling like he still had some time before anyone could expect him to move onto his next task, Harry moved back to the servants’ hall and made his way down the turning corridor opening doors occasionally to see what’s going on behind them. He’d always loved exploring but the last decade had revealed all of the secrets of the manor in which he lived. The castle though, the castle he was sure he could move through the rest of his days and still make discoveries.</p><p>Which is how he stumbled across the library. Or the top floor of it. Seriously they had a balcony that encircled the top floor of their two-story library. This was the kind of place Harry had only ever read about in stolen books, he’d never been more thankful that he’d had to clean up after Dudley than during his tutor’s visits, which left him free to listen in on the lessons and learn while he absently picked up plates and broken toys. He wiped his hair away from his forehead before attempting to wipe his sweaty palms on his pants. Leaving black streaks along his sides from the blacking he used in the fireplace.</p><p>He gave a sigh as he realized he very likely had just smeared the blacking across his face. He wasn’t going to be able to touch any of the books in here either. And he probably needed to go clean every single door he’d touched since leaving the white room….</p><p>So much for sneaking away for a few more minutes. He was going to disappear through the hallway again. But… since he was already here it wouldn’t be that bad to take a look. So long as he didn’t touch anything, it would be fine. A quick glance at the titles almost had him squealing as he took in the magical history section right next to magical lore and magical beasts.</p><p>He hadn’t made it halfway down the first row before a voice from behind him nearly sent him tumbling over the rail and to the floor below.</p><p>“I thought you’d have left by now.”</p><p>Harry barely chocked back a curse as he remembered where he was. Refusing to turn around he shook his head slightly and hunched over, hoping in vain that the other man would leave.</p><p>“My apologies I was merely lost on my way to the kitchens.”</p><p>A delicate snort was his response, “I very much doubt that. Regardless there is an understanding that this room is to be empty at this time.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, I was uninformed. Although I have to admit it’s strange that you are here to catch me if it’s supposed to be empty.” He could have bitten his own tongue as his mouth ran away from him. This man could be anyone and Harry had no idea, but it was guaranteed that he stood higher on the totem pole than a visiting servant.</p><p>Harry winced a little and turned around ready to apologize, he really needed to learn to curb his tongue at times. But his apology (feeble as it may have been) was cut off by the sound of a faintly amused chuckle. A chuckle that fell from an amazingly beautiful face. Warm eyes, dark brown set over stunning cheekbones, thick black hair that seemed to almost fall into perfect waves around his face before the length was gathered at the nape of his elegant neck.</p><p>“I have a feeling you don’t know who I am then?”</p><p>Harry shook his head at the question trying to jump start his brain, “Sorry, am I supposed to?”</p><p>The young man shrugged, “Most do. Leave it to say that it’s usually empty because I’m here.”</p><p>Harry frowned, “That’s sad. Don’t you get lonely?”</p><p>Harry watched as the older boy’s interested smile twisted into a full-blown smirk.</p><p>“I might, but most people don’t concern themselves with that. So long as I look nice and act polite it doesn’t really matter, does it?”</p><p>“Of course, it does! No one should feel sad or lonely. It’s miserable and frightful way to pass the time, I should know!”</p><p>The man’s smirk softened, “Are you lonely too then?”</p><p>Harry shrugged and blushed at his sudden words. He brushed his hair out of his face again as his eyes fell to the floor and his shoes softly pushed the soft hairs of the rug side-to-side.</p><p>“I might be, but it’s not as bad as all that. I don’t mean to sound ungrateful.”</p><p>The older boy frowned openly at that, “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Well, I don’t see many people but then I get a chance to work on all of my chores and I get plenty of time to myself. And Mrs. Weasley, she’s our cook, makes the best breakfast anyone could hope for!”</p><p>“Why are you here then?”</p><p>“My family thought it would be good to donate help for the prince’s party. They aren’t able to afford any gifts you see, or at least nothing suitable for a prince.”</p><p>The boy closed his eyes and face turned slightly away as a muscle twitched in his jaw, “So they can afford at least two servants and yet they couldn’t think of a better gift than to ship you here?”</p><p>“Well they can’t pay me, I don’t think they pay Mrs. Figg either to be honest. But she gets free room and board. Mrs. Weasley gets some though, because she has so many children, you see.”</p><p>“No, I don’t see. How can they get away without paying you? It’s wrong, especially since they obviously overwork you as well, look how thin you are!”</p><p>“It’s how I earn my keep, they keep me in room and board, you see. And well, Mrs. Figg is too tired now and she sometimes forgets to turn down the sheets, so I help her with her chores because otherwise they’d throw her out and-!” Suddenly his eyes widened, “Oh please! You can’t tell anyone, she doesn’t have anywhere to go and it’s not that bad, I swear!”</p><p>The man pinched the bridge of his nose, holding up his other hand palm out to stop the flood of words, “I won’t tell anyone, but you should. They send extra help to households that need it, remember?”</p><p>He shrugged, “My family’s too proud, plus we do okay, really!”</p><p>The boy seemed ready to protest again but Harry suddenly remembered that he had some doors to clean off still, “I’m sorry I have to go, but it was great talking to you!”</p><p>With that Harry practically ran from the library and was amazed at how fast he managed to get through the servant’s entrance and into the back hallway. The door shut behind him as he barely registered the voice echoing behind him.</p><p>“Wait! What’s your name?”</p><p>oOo</p><p>Harry came breathless into the kitchens, an apology on his lips but was cut off by three shocked faces.</p><p>“I’m sorry I took so long, I’m afraid I got a little distracted.”</p><p>Hermione frowned, “You’re finished? But Mrs. McGonagall-.”</p><p>“Silence. Very well, Mr. Cinders, if you are certain you are finished, you would not mind showing us your work.” The dark man seemed to cower the entire room with his voice. If Harry didn’t know better, he’d assume this man was in the royal family.</p><p>Harry shook his head, not at all surprised that they’d want to inspect his work since it seemed like such an important room.</p><p>Hermione still looked slightly flabbergasted and her cheeks were reddened by the reprimand of the dark-haired man, who Harry was pretty sure he <em>still</em> hadn’t heard the name of…</p><p>He followed them up the stairs and winced slightly when he saw the small puddle of dirty water that had fallen onto the stairs. He might get beaten for that, at home something like that usually meant a day and night in the basement without food and having to catch up on everything the next day.</p><p>Maybe they’d be nicer here? He scoffed at the thought, this was the royal family he’d be lucky if he wasn’t flogged. Then again these were the servants’ stairs so maybe it wouldn’t be as bad?</p><p>He ducked his head and tried to avoid seeing any other spots where he might have dripped on his way and meekly followed the others up the stairs and to the room. He couldn’t believe no one had yelled at him yet for that. Still he figured if he kept his head down maybe they’d forget about it?</p><p>With any luck he would have made something wrong in the room and it would make them forget about the water on the stairs. Just a small mistake though…</p><p>He waited in the hallway as they walked in, his hands were still dirty and he couldn’t imagine the trouble he would get in if he managed to get a black handprint on the white draperies. He watched as McGonagall and the man (seriously did he not have a name?!) took in every detail of the room. Then he watched as they both shared a raised eyebrow in a glance and turned back to back. They raise their wands and cast. Harry watched as the whole room began to glow with green sparkles.</p><p>They seemed to hover above every surface just floating there, and Harry had the momentary terror that if they were to touch the surface the sparkles would <em>never</em> come out. Just as soon as he though it everything disappeared.</p><p>Hermione whirled on him eyes blazing and Harry took an involuntary step back from her anger.</p><p>“I thought you said you <em>didn’t</em> <em>have</em> magic!”</p><p>Harry blinked, “I don’t. My family are all muggles. I can’t be gifted. It just doesn’t make any sense.”</p><p>He turned to the two others in the room, looking for help and he suddenly found himself falling back into random memories. Walking through their home, tending the garden, talking to a snake, cleaning the house, laying in his room, and who knows what he was doing in that last one. Just a series of moments that seemed to mean nothing to Harry.</p><p>Then all of the sudden he found himself sitting in his old cupboard listening in to the conversation when he finally learned the truth about his parents and his aunt and uncle and there was no way he wanted to listen to that again.</p><p>“Stop!” The sudden shout startled Harry and he found himself sitting on the ground staring up at three faces, one shocked, one calculating, and one seemingly confused.</p><p>He rubbed at his temples before blinking slowly, “That was so weird…”</p><p>“That, Mr. Cinders is perhaps the most educated statement I have heard from you.”</p><p>McGonagall actually gave him a small smile, “Well this is a most wonderful day! It seems that though magic may have skipped some of your family you have truly old magic in your bones. I do believe that we shall call your family up instantly and-.”</p><p>“No! Please, please,” Harry was suddenly terrified of everything that could happen.</p><p>If he really did have magic, and let’s face it Harry would not be living with his aunt and uncle if that were the case, his family would kill him. They would reject him. He would no longer be able to live in safety. Granted it wasn’t a nice place, but he got fed and he got to see his friends and everything.</p><p>“I don’t… I can’t…I’m not… No.”</p><p>Suddenly there were arms wrapped around him and Harry fell unhesitant into the woman. The hug reminding him so much of the brief reprieve this morning with Mrs. Weasley.</p><p>“What have you done to upset this boy so?”</p><p>McGonagall actually sounded distraught as she replied to the scolding tone, “I promise, Poppy, this was not our intention. We assumed it would be exciting news.”</p><p>“Exciting it was. Would you like a rest, child?”</p><p>Harry shook his head and pulled himself from the embrace, welcoming as it was. He took a steadying breath and shook off the excitement.</p><p>“I’d rather get back to work, please. Is there something else I can help with?”</p><p>The woman who had been holding him shook her head, “You shouldn’t be working. I can see from here that you are overworked and exhausted. When was the last time you ate, child?”</p><p>He frowned, “It was my fault. I worked through lunch.”</p><p>“I do not believe you answered the question.”</p><p>Harry flinched at the cold man’s voice, “I… I’m not sure how to answer, sir.”</p><p>“A truthful answer would be most appreciated.” The new woman gave a gentle smile despite her firm tone, but Harry still didn’t know what to say.</p><p>The boy shrugged and turned away, double checking his work with the black which he still had not gotten off his hands. He frowned and looked down, but his chin was caught between two fingers and directed up to meet Mrs. McGonagall’s warm eyes.</p><p>“When was the last time you ate, Mr. Cinders?”</p><p>“I… I had some of the vegetables from the garden. But not a lot is growing right now.”</p><p>The tall man stepped forward, “I believe we are asking about your last proper meal. A plate of food.”</p><p>Harry shook his head, “There’s-I mean- please? I don’t know…”</p><p>His breaths felt heavy as he took in the disbelieving and angry stares. They thought he was lying. They were going to tell the Dursleys and that would be as bad as having the gift. Or worse…He couldn’t breathe, how could they just stand there? Didn’t they notice the blackness drifting through the air? His eyes rolled back, and Harry barely felt hands reaching for him as he realized he wasn’t standing anymore.</p><p>*****</p><p>*****</p><p>Harry woke up on a small cot, in a small room, behind a small curtain. Beyond it he could see the natural light and make out the sounds of the kitchen.</p><p>He did his best to tidy the sheets on the cot and snuck out from behind the curtain and came face to face with the comforting woman from before.</p><p>“Oh, hello dear. I’m Madame Pomfrey. I’m in charge of keeping people healthy here in the castle. I was just coming to check on you.”</p><p>Harry nodded and let himself be herded back into the room by the caring hand. She pulled out a slim stick and Harry was surprised to find yet another gifted person in the castle.</p><p>“I’m just going to check and see how you’re doing, okay?”</p><p>He shrugged and soon the stick was waving and Madame Pomfrey was referencing a parchment in her hand and the sparks drifting around him. She nodded once to herself making a note before continuing her exam and Harry watched as her smile grew a little more forced with every mark that decorated her parchment.</p><p> Eventually she got up with only a pat on his arm and a request that he eat the food he’d been given. He was suddenly aware of the full plate beside him. A bowl of soup, a slice of bread and a glass of juice! He took as much time as he dared to enjoy the meal, wanting to make sure he ate as much as he could before it was taken. Even so it was not long until the thought of another bite sent panic through his stomach.</p><p>Reluctantly, he set his spoon down and allowed the moment to settle. He waited patiently for someone to come and tell him what to do. He took the time to make sure his bag was packed, the extra set of clothes he’d brought just in case still folded nicely along with Dudley’s schooling books he was working through.</p><p>He figured they’d given him a nice meal to make up for the embarrassment there was going to be when they sent him home. It was a nice thought, especially since he highly doubted there was going to be a meal waiting for him.</p><p>Harry groaned at the thought of his embarrassment. He had been hoping to perhaps be invited to stay permanently, as unlikely as that was. And then what does he do? He gets blackening all over the servants’ hall, spilled water on the stairs, insulted a person who was probably a guest, and passed out. He’d put them through so much work when he was supposed to be lessening their loads.</p><p>There was a long moment spent imagining that they were going to offer for him to stay here. That maybe they’d felt pity for the little servant who tried. But that was all gone when he took note of the serious faces that crossed the curtain. The serious man, Mrs. McGonagall, and Madame Pomfrey all appeared before him. And he sighed.</p><p>“I’m ready to go back.”</p><p>Apparently, that was not the response they were expecting, “Excuse me?”</p><p>“You’re sending me back because I’m too much trouble, right?”</p><p>The man shook his head, “We are not at leave to reject any assistance sent our way. Your lack of energy causes us to take you away from your original duties. As many of the guests are arriving as we speak you shall be assisting one of our guests who always fails to bring a servant of his own. Miss Granger typically assists him. However, she has been specifically requested to assist one of the other guests.”</p><p>Harry blinked for a long moment, how was it that dark haired man made that sound like a punishment? Even Harry knew that being a personal assistant for a guest was actually a huge responsibility. But they were just going to trust him? He didn’t even know what to do when being a personal servant to a guest.</p><p>The older woman stepped in, “Miss Granger is currently meeting her guest upstairs. You are going to shadow her until your guest arrives.”</p><p>Harry swallowed and set his bag down once again. McGonagall caught him with a single hand on his shoulder.</p><p>“Don’t worry. You’re going to do fine and if you do make a mistake this guest is likely not going to even notice. He’s very laid back however he is from a prestigious family. Just take this time to relax a little, alright?”</p><p>The small teen blinked, not really sure how to take her words. Was this a trick?</p><p>She cleared her throat, pulling her hand back and schooling her features back into a commanding expression.</p><p>“Miss Granger is expecting you, Mr. Cinders. Hurry now.”</p><p>Shaggy hair shook as the boy nodded scurrying off to the entrance hall where he hoped he’d find the girl, “Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>oOo</p><p>The boy who’d requested Hermione was a lot younger than Harry suspected. He’d guess that he was about their age. He found from listening that his parents were arriving soon as well, but the blond boy had wanted to attend this celebration separately, hence his request for the girl.</p><p>Harry was mostly intrigued by the way they talked to each other. Hermione seemed determined to maintain an appropriate distance, and the blond seemed the same but almost excessively? It was like he was goading her to see if she would break propriety. Hermione was good though, she avoided all of the other boy’s tricks with an elegance, she seemed to enjoy disappointing the blond.</p><p>She tapped him on the shoulder as they were heading to the kitchen to get hot water for the young aristocrat’s bath. She pointed towards a man entering the palace with shoulder length brown hair and a beard that appeared to be more from a lack of desire to shave than a statement. But what caught Harry’s attention were his warm grey eyes and the obvious laughter in his expression.</p><p>“That’s Sirius Black, he hates being called Lord Black but that’s what you should address his as first, then he’ll tell you what to call him. Wait until he’s done speaking to the Longbottom’s and then you can introduce yourself and take him to his room. He’s staying in the gold room, it’s three doors past the grey room that Draco’s in.”</p><p>Harry nodded before blinking and smirking slightly at the girl’s slip, “Draco?”</p><p>He felt the side of his mouth lift further as the blush colored Hermione’s cheeks, “Shut up.”</p><p>He laughed as she scurried off and found a shadowed corner to wait until Lord Black made to leave the Longbottom’s.</p><p>It was several long minutes before Lord Longbottom excused himself, his wife, and his son to freshen up before the dinner tonight. The boy reminded Harry of the textbook definition of perfection. He was gorgeous but looked as though it was a rather new reality and as such he was still quiet and in the background. Harry thought he and the boy could have been good friends. Perhaps if it wasn’t for the voice of his uncle ringing through his ears, they could have been closer than that.</p><p>He was startled out of his thoughts by a sudden voice by his ear, “And hear I thought you were supposed to be catering to my every whim. Can’t blame you for being intrigued though. That Neville is growing into a fine young man.”</p><p>He found himself nearly falling as he struggled to look at the source of the warm voice, he barely noticed the grey eyes were even warmer up close before he dropped his gaze back to the ground. He nodded his head in a careful bow before speaking.</p><p>“Lord Black! I apologize I seem to have been lost in my thoughts. I’m supposed to be escorting you to your rooms for the duration of your stay.”</p><p>“Please, call me Sirius. I hate being called the Lord anything. Never did like the last Lord Black so I’d rather avoid the title. Did they put me in the grey room again? They usually do, it’s one of the colors in my family crest, supposed to make you feel more at home or something but it’s just ridiculous if you ask me.”</p><p>“Umm… actually I’ve been told to show you to the gold room? The grey room is already in use…”</p><p>The older man practically started vibrating in excitement at the news, “Wonderful! I haven’t been inside that room in ages. Lead on!”</p><p>Harry couldn’t hold back his grin at Sirius’ excitement, “Yes, sir.”</p><p>oOo</p><p>The temporary servant was in constant motion from that point on. It wasn’t hard work, per say, but Sirius was a hard person to help. Harry found himself constantly trying to anticipate the Black lord’s wishes in the hopes that he might actually let Harry do his job.</p><p>Unfortunately, some concessions had to be made. So while Sirius poured his own drink Harry scrambled to pull out the nice robes for the evening meal, put the rest of the man’s robes away and begin polishing the shoes he’d be wearing while they sat at dinner.</p><p>Although why they needed to be polished when they would only be seen by the bottom of the table was beyond Harry. Still he was determined that they would find no fault with his service of his Lord. The man was in the middle of a monologue concerning some childhood escapades with his dear friends when he suddenly trailed off.</p><p>“I miss my dear friends… Moony, Wormtail, Lilypad, and Prongs. They all seemed to have trickled off one by one. Moony is still around but we only see each other occasionally. Wormtail went mad though. Went off on a rampage concerning a rising lord and ultimate reward. Prongs paid the price. He was killed trying to protect his son, wife, and his friend. Lilypad then died trying to save her son. They say that it was her dying scream that shook Wormtail back into reality. He turned his wand on himself upon seeing the bodies of his friends.</p><p>“Their son, the little Prongslet, he survived but was taken. Carted off only moments after his parent’s deaths. No one knows where he went. I think it was the fault of whoever poisoned Wormtail. For whatever reason they wanted the child and he was gone. I spent years looking but I could never find him…” He glanced over at the boy polishing his shoes, “I always thought he’d look a bit like you actually, Prongs’ ne’er-do-well hair and Lilypad’s eyes.”</p><p>Suddenly he cleared his throat, “I believe I may have had a tad too much to drink already. How long until dinner?”</p><p>“It’s in an hour, sir. Refreshments and <em>hors d’oeuvres</em> will be served at any moment.”</p><p>One nod and the man pulled his wand from his pocket clearing the evidence of his trip to the past and the sleepless night from his eyes. Harry pulled his hair back in an elegant sweep and the man was off.</p><p>“You need not wait for me. Just set the fire and I’ll handle myself.”</p><p>Harry nodded but agreed to nothing. He fully intended to be waiting right here when the man returned. But he should probably get something from the kitchen, perhaps they would allow him to finish his soup from earlier?</p><p>Green eyes scanned the room and seeing nothing out of place he hurried from the room and into the servants’ hall. Which is where he found himself suddenly under a giant pile of fine cloth and a flustered Hermione.</p><p>“Thank God! You have to help me. Draco needs these repaired and I can do the charm, but I’ve only ever practiced it in a mirror on my clothes! I can’t mess up and…”</p><p>The smaller boy flinched away slightly as her hands flew through the air attempting to highlight what a big problem this was.</p><p>He caught her hands as they attempted to knock his glasses off again, “Hermione! It’s okay, what do you need? How can I help?”</p><p>“Can you put on these robes?”</p><p>Okay he wasn’t sure where he thought this was headed, but that wasn’t it, “I’m sorry?”</p><p>“The only charm I know is one that’s for like last-minute fixes, which means someone is wearing them, please?”</p><p>The small boy shook his head, “I can’t be seen wearing something like that. I could get in huge trouble…”</p><p>“It’ll only be a moment, I promise. Just, please? I need… I just need your help.”</p><p>The teen chewed his lip it was definitely not allowed for him, Orphan Harry, a nobody to put on a Lord’s robes. He could be in huge trouble if he gave in. But Hermione had been so nice (if a little touchy) since he arrived and she seemed to really want to impress the young lord in training…</p><p>“Alright, but only for a few seconds!”</p><p>She squealed clapping her hands once before throwing her arms around him, “Thank you, thank you, thank you! Here.”</p><p>Harry followed obediently as she led him down just one more room, “This one’s empty until tomorrow. You change and I’ll be right back, I left my wand in the kitchen. I’ll be right back!”</p><p>She was gone, muttering some bizarre words as the door clicked shut behind her. Harry cursed his inability to refuse anyone as he laid the fine clothes onto the light blue spread. Glancing down at his dirtied fingers he realized his face was probably the same and putting on silk robes was bad enough without dirtying them as well.</p><p>He let his eyes trace the room, settling on the basin upon the bureau. He ran his fingers through his hair, undecided, but when they came out greying with dust he winced and made up his mind. One mental reminder to change the water the next morning and Harry dropped his hands in only to yank them out a moment later.</p><p>He stared in disbelief as he lowered his hands in once again. The water was hot. As if someone had pulled it off the fire not two minutes ago.</p><p>“I love magic…”</p><p>Harry rushed through the rest of the washing. Scrubbing the ash and sweat off his skin and shaking the dust off his hair. He wet it down, attempting to tame the nest. Eventually he felt good enough to reach again for the robes. He was careful as he pulled on the delicate fabric, his motions slow but steady as he dressed. Long moments passed before the robes were draped carefully over his shoulders.</p><p>Which begged the question, where exactly was Hermione? She was only going to the kitchen after all. Unless she got caught up in something else…</p><p>The dark-haired servant found his mind racing. There were so many things that could go wrong. What if McGonagall needed to talk with her. What if Draco saw her and ordered her to do something else. What if Sirius was looking for him to help with something</p><p>The teen shook his head, no. Nothing was going to go wrong. He just needed to stay calm and wait patiently. The wall would be opening any second.</p><p>Which was when he heard the click of the latch. He felt the tension leave his shoulders and he let out the breath. He smiled at the wall.</p><p>Which was when he realized the wall wasn’t opening. The door behind him was, not the hidden door to the servants’ hall. The door to the rest of the palace. Panicked green eyes lit around the room desperately hoping for an escape, but he knew from experience that trying to hide only postponed the punishment, at best. Typically, it made everything worse.</p><p>With a deep breath he turned to face his judgement which was when he recognized the brown eyes which landed upon him. It was the young man from the library.</p><p>The boy frowned seemingly trying to understand this sudden change in his plans, “My apologies, I was under the opinion that this room was empty until tomorrow.”</p><p>Harry blushed, “I am under the same belief. I- I was looking for somewhere private for a moment. I suspect my friend will be coming to find me shortly.”</p><p>The boy nodded, “Are you here for the outrageous party they’re throwing?”</p><p>“Technically, yes. I was sent here for the Prince’s birthday celebration.”</p><p>“The Prince’s?” The boy’s frown was confused and slightly amused.</p><p>“…Yes?”</p><p>“My name is Tom.”</p><p>Harry blinked at the sudden introduction, “Er…hello? I’d give you my name, but I’ve been given so many the past few days I am not quite sure which to share.”</p><p>The warmest smile appeared then, and Harry couldn’t help returning it, thinking that this boy was amazingly even more attractive than Heir Longbottom, “I actually understand that. Would you mind accompanying me to the meal?”</p><p>“I should wait for my friend, as I said she’ll be looking for me soon enough. It was wonderful to meet you though.”</p><p>The boy’s- Tom’s expression went from slightly confused to absolutely gob-smacked in two seconds flat. Harry felt incredibly uncomfortable, almost guilty, with the way Tom looked at him as if he just admitted to seeing a unicorn in a garbage heap.</p><p>So he gave a tight smile and looked subtly at the slightly opened door behind Tom. The gob-smacked look faded slowly into wry amusement once again.</p><p>“It would be quite rude of you to forget your friend. I will be seeing both of you later, perhaps?”</p><p>Harry blinked, not really sure why the older boy would care but gave a slight nod. He’d seen the boy before so it wasn’t unlikely that they would see each other again. Although seeing as he seemed to think Harry was actually a guest here that didn’t actually seem to be all that likely. He wondered if Tom had any idea that this supposed guest was actually the servant who’d been caught in the library.</p><p>He thought back to his blackening smeared face and the way his hair had seemed almost grey this morning. There was no way the boy would connect the two and for that Harry decided to be grateful.</p><p>Suddenly though he recalled their meeting and the few words they’d shared before Harry had needed to run. <em>‘Are you lonely too, then?’</em></p><p>It must be so sad to be in a castle like this and not have anyone. Perhaps Harry could make it back to the library tomorrow? The boy said he was usually there, that might be the perfect time to say hello and rectify any poor conclusions that might have come up.</p><p>He was spared from any further trouble when the wall behind him opened up to reveal a flushed Hermione.</p><p>“Sorry! Mister Snape wanted me to bring a tea service to the Lestranges. I don’t know why, they’re serving refreshments already but you know nobles. Let’s get this fixed now, shall we?”</p><p>But once again Harry just let himself drift through her words as she did what she needed. Hermione had already proven she didn’t actually need another person to have a conversation after all.</p><p>All in all, Harry figured he’d been in those robes for fifteen minutes when he finally got the chance to take them off and made Hermione clean them just in case. The girl had rolled her eyes but cast her perfect freshening charm she had bragged about before rushing off to the grey room and leaving Harry to finally make his way to the kitchens.</p><p>He hadn’t made it a step in when he was being gently shoved into a chair and told to eat while he could. There was someone keeping an eye on the guests who would inform them if Lord Black left, giving Harry enough time to return to the rooms.</p><p>The boy felt bad as he watched everyone still running around prepping for tomorrow’s ball. But when he’d tried to stand up, Mister Snape had appeared and told him he was serving as a taste tester for the feast and he was not to move until every course had been sampled.</p><p>Harry had only frowned at that before continuing, these people checked for problems with magic. Why would they need a taste tester for poison when they had the gift?</p><p>He shook his head, Mister Snape was confusing. Maybe he wasn’t as mean as he seemed? Was he trying to be nice to the little servant boy? No. Harry refused to think that. He was probably just keeping him out of the way in case he messed up again.</p><p>Just as Harry finished the last course a blue hare appeared out of nowhere and spoke to McGonagall. Harry couldn’t help but stare.</p><p>“The meal is finished, and some are returning to their rooms. As usual Lord Black is leading the retreat.”</p><p>“Very well, Mr. Cinders. You may now return. Be sure to be here early to eat before Lord Black arises.”</p><p>Harry could only nod as he made his way to the hidden stairs. What kind of people insisted on servants eating three times a day? Was this a trap?</p><p>His thoughts wondered over the possible tricks that could be lying in wait as he helped the Lord to undress and ready himself for bed. Happily brushing the older man’s hair when he admitted that the one thing he missed most was people brushing his hair for him. And helping Sirius into bed still telling stories of these absent friends of his.</p><p>Regardless, Harry thought as he doused the lights in Sirius’ room, he would enjoy it while he could and expect nothing but bad news. This way they wouldn’t catch him, but he could enjoy the full stomach until after the ball. It was only four more days after all, he could put up with it until then.</p><p>He sighed, he only hoped his stomach didn’t get used to eating so much again. That would only make going back all the harder.</p><p>Harry took one glance back at the sleeping Lord and gave a slight smile as a light snore filled the room. At least someone would have no trouble sleeping tonight. He shut the servant’s door and disappeared down the hall.</p><p>Taking the little cot that had been named his for his stay, Harry pulled up the soft sheets and stretched. He’d have to be up about half-an-hour before dawn, but that still left him about six hours of sleep. A boy could really get used to this kind of work. His last thought before he went to bed was caught on the young man he’d met in the library. Was he having a good sleep tonight?</p><p>*****</p><p>*****</p>
