    <p>Harry got in the train, his gaze lost in the crowd of proud parents and relatives. He envied all those people in his train had family that actually loved them, that didn't think they were a freak. At least they had friends. </p><p>The young boy had no luck, adding to the fact that he add a bloody awful family who hated him, he didn't have a single friend, even his fellow Gryffindors liked to bully him, especially when that Weasley boy, who liked to push him against the brick walls of Hogwarts when he wasn't sucking up to the-boy-who-lived, Neville Longbottom.</p><p>Then again, that Neville boy was nice to him, but so was he to everyone else. Gosh he hated Hogwarts, and the hellish house he lived in at Privet Drive. There was never a place where he felt safe. He was going to begin his sixth year and was not going to take much of that shit any longer. Many times, after getting beaten, he thought of suicide. It seemed like the only option.</p><p>Lost in his thoughts, he had not noticed Neville talking to him. Hell, he didn't realize he was there in the first place or the train parting.</p><p>"-Hiya Harry! Can I sit here? "Said the Golden Boy</p><p>-"Um? Yeah,yeah sure go ahead", he said, going back to looking out the window</p><p>-"Thanks", said shyly Neville.</p><p>Harry did not mind the company, plus, he had to say, Neville was quite the sight. He had started working out over the summer and looked nothing like the chubby scared boy he had met in first year. He would even go as far as supposing that every girl in their grade, no in their whole school, was probably drooling over those muscular arms. Especially Ginny Weasley, you could see her everywhere, arm linked to The Savior, which said boy did not seem very comfortable with.</p><p>He wondered though, why was Neville not with the rest of The golden trio, which consisted of Hermione Granger, an annoying little miss-knows-it-all and the Weasley bully.</p><p>He ignored the thought and just started reading a book silently, not attempting to talk to the strong boy in front of him</p><p>~At Hogwarts~</p><p>Harry was relieved to see that he hadn't been assaulted yet. Not taking any chances, he left early dinner to get to the dorms, hoping not to bump into Weasley. But knowing his luck, guess who he saw as he turned a corner? The ginger aimed straight at him, and pushed him violently on the wall. It hurt. It hurt so very badly and he hated it. Without realizing, while looking to the ground, he noticed tears pouring on his glasses.</p><p>He ran towards the girl's bathroom. He knew it was abandoned and that Moaning Myrtle would try to comfort him, like she always did. He felt so much sadness. He was starting to believe that maybe it was true that he was a freak, maybe that was why he was treated so poorly at school.</p><p>He pushed the door and hid in one of the stalls. He cried and cried for a long time. He didn't know for how long exactly since he was so lost in his tears, but he knew it had been a long time. </p><p>Once he felt he could no long leak water from his body, he went towards the sink and looked at his puffy red eyes before splashing his own face with water. After many attempts at trying to make his eyes normal looking, he just gave up and ran towards the dorm.</p><p>He laid on his bed before noticing that something was poking his back. He lifted the sheets, praying it wasn't a prank that Weasel had left, but was surprised to see that it was a box of chocolates bigger than his head and attached to it was a note. It said the following words</p><p>           "    Dear Harry<br/>
You are by far the most beautiful creature my eyes have ever seen. Your pure white silky skin and your perfect pink cheeks have caught my gaze. I long for your plum red lips and your small figure. Your raven hair is so dreamy. I could get lost in Those beautiful green eyes. But what makes me desire you the most is your beautiful smile, the way you always stare into something, observe it like nothing else matters, the way you always blush and look away when someone stares at you. I wish to have you. I will send more gifts until I decide to meet you. For now, enjoy the sweets. These are the most fine chocolates that I could find, they are enchanted to give those who eat it wonderful dreams.<br/>
With all my sweet love,<br/>
Your secret admirer."</p>
