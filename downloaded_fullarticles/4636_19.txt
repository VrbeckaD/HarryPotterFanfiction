    <p>SETTING: A REMOTE MAGICAL FOREST, 2014, SOMETIME AROUND EIGHT A.M.</p><p>Snooky the Fairy Dragon poked the snail. The snail opened one slimy eye and looked at Snooky. He opened the other eye. Waggling his eyestalks, he bit the offending toe (Snooky’s pinky toe, to be exact). Snooky howled. The snail (named Stanley) blinked up at Snooky innocently, then pulled a face at him when Snooky turned away and sobbed. Snooky ran into the trees. Stanley smiled.</p><p>Snooky was a wailing wreck – and he was almost an adult. He sat down in his magical fairy dragon cave with the pretty sparkling fairy lights and thought and thought and thought and thought and thought and thought [oops, sorry, technical difficulties, apologies from the Authors, just assume he kept thinking].</p><p>His seemingly unending train of thought was interrupted by a loud, shrill screaming, like thirteen prisoners had just been horribly tortured (this was, in fact, what the sound was). Normally, this would cause considerable panic, but this screaming he recognized.</p><p>“It’s only the school bell,” he muttered, screwing in a tiny blue light bulb onto the cord of the fairy lights. Suddenly, he dropped the light bulb.</p><p>“IT’S THE SCHOOL BELL!” he screamed, the noise now indeed causing considerable panic. “OH ME, OH MY, WHAT CAN I DO?! I’M LATE FOR FUCKING SCHOOL!”</p><p>Quickly, he grabbed a few books and his tuba case and his lunchbox full of cookies (he loved to bake) and flew off to Camelback Mountain to meet Camel, who was his <del>only</del> best friend and also happened to live conveniently close to school.</p><p>Camel was, shockingly, a camel, and though the willingness of camels to spit has by now become an absurd stereotype, Camel was a whiz with a wad of chewing gum. He could hit wasps out of the air from five feet. He also had an unfortunate habit of shooting wads at people, but Snooky was by this point used to such occurrences. After all, he liked <del>having someone who was willing to talk to him</del> someone to walk to school with, even if it was only an emo camel who spit at him sometimes.</p><p>There was a small problem though. Snooky’s school was The Phoenix School for Young Dragons. And, as I think we’ve established, Camel was a camel.</p><p>Even so, Camel had managed to beat the system (at least a little bit). His very fierce ex-military mother had managed to convince the principal, The Moose King Thranduil (not a dragon at all) to allow Camel to attend half of all the school days. [It is at this point uncertain if a) money, b) sexual favors, c) drugs, or d) general verbal abuse traded hands.]</p><p>So despite the fact that Camel only was in attendance every other day (leaving Snooky without lab partners in chemistry much of the time – he was sure the teacher scheduled labs specifically on days that Camel wouldn’t be there), Camel still waited for Snooky every day. If it wasn’t one of his days to suffer in a classroom, he decided to instead suffer outside in the hot desert sun directly outside the campus with his favorite cactus, Foofy, who was a runt and only had one arm, but Camel liked him anyways.</p><p>A discerning reader may wonder whether Camel got any sort of education on the days he did not go to the school, and the answer for such a reader would be: no he did not.</p><p>Thankfully for Snooky, who had noticed that there was a chemistry lab that afternoon, Camel would be accompanying him to school that day. For some reason, The Moose King had blown much of their school budget on things like Cool Sunglasses for Everyone, shitty assemblies twice a week (on topics such as “Yeah, Just Don’t Be A Dick Kids” and “Drugs Aren’t Swag, You’ll Become A Hag”), his own personal moose stable, and doormen who opened the door for students and danced elaborate and strangely compelling greeting jigs to tunes from Madagascar Four, instead of scissors that worked or teachers that had passed middle school. Camel, who was very sentimental, dragged (a potted) Foofy along with a leash into the school as they passed the door greeters.</p><p>The pair of them went to get breakfast in the cafeteria and found that it was chilidogs, a perfectly understandable meal for 8:00 AM. Camel tripped over his big clunky hooves and dropped his breakfast, leaving a blast radius of chili twelve feet around it. Of course it was at this moment that the fairy janitor chose to walk in.</p><p>“Get out!” he screeched, chasing Camel out of the cafeteria and brandishing his feather duster. “I! HATE! CHILI!”</p><p>Two teenage girls, who had once gone camping (and eaten putrid chili) taught Remedial Texting. When they heard the janitor’s cries they, of course, sympathised and posted pictures of the janitor on Instagram with the hashtags #janitor #fairy #screeching #featherDuster #chili #gross #YOLO #noFilter and #hashtag. This inspired their students (mostly third grade phoenixi (visitors from the Dragon School For Young Pheonixi)) to new levels of social networking and led them all to earn A+’s in Texting class, an interdisciplinary course involving such things as Basic Twitter Skills and How Not To Lose Followers.</p><p>Camel was skipping class. He was mostly slinking around the halls, avoiding the janitor and the iPhone™ wielding teenage girls. He only kind of felt bad that it was chemistry he was missing, leaving Snooky to do a dangerous experiment by himself (the chemistry teacher was a very strong believer in the survival of the fittest and also of explosions of massive proportions).</p><p>He was sulking in a deserted hallway, trying to hide behind his backpack when he heard footsteps approaching. He tentatively lifted his head to see who it was and gasped.</p><p>Buster Posey, his hero since as long as he could remember (okay, since last year, but still), was standing in his (sometimes) school, not five meters away from him! Camel nudged Foofy excitedly, then wished he hadn’t as Foofy’s spines dug into his shoulder. He spat a well-chewed, rubbery wad at the wall in exhilaration and it bounced off and stuck in his unruly, shaggy dyed forelock that was always in his eyes. Not caring in the slightest, he licked a hoof and tried to run it through the hair. His hoof stuck in the vaguely minty blob in his hair, and, growling despite his basic dromedarian biology, if wrenched it free.</p><p>He stood, Foofy trailing behind him in a resigned sort of way, and began to clop nervously down the hall toward his hero, feeling like his heart was at the top of his very long throat, the faint smell of chili still following him.</p><p>“I’m so happy to see you!” exclaimed Buster Posey when he saw them. Camel, thinking it was him being addressed, walked faster. “It’s been ages, Snooky.”</p><p>Gasping, Camel stopped in his tracks. Snooky had just snuck out of the chemistry classroom and was RIGHT THERE. His idol knew Snooky and Snooky hadn’t told him. He quickly chewed another wad of gum and spat it at his friend. However, Snooky was scaly so the gum didn’t stick. While Camel was having his angry moment, Buster Posey and Snooky were chatting about the influential people they knew and how amazing it was to know them, despite the fact that Camel was right there.</p><p>Now don’t get the wrong idea about Snooky. He was a good friend and wouldn’t snub Camel on purpose. He just had zero social skills.</p><p>“Yeah, and the other day I was talking to Artemis Fool (not Fowl) and he said -” started Buster.</p><p>“Oh yeah, I haven’t seen him in ages!” said Snooky happily. “How’s he doing? It’s so amazing to know him”</p><p>“Fine, he got over that cold,” Buster said. “And he was saying that Oil Drum – you know, that cat of his, weird thing, too – had helped him finish off that pony thief in his area. He apparently hopped onto her shoulder and knocked her over so she fell off the moving train into the coal bin.”</p><p>“Really?” asked Snooky. “I didn’t know that. I thought Artemis knocked her off the train with a stunning spell. Apparently, Snape threw him his wand, and when Artemis had used it, he demanded a really good sandwich – with pickles. So the stolen Pegapony flew down and kicked him into the river. Or that’s what Rita Skeeter said.”</p><p>“Rita Skeeter?” said Buster Posey.”Ha! Since when can you trust what she says? Naw, I heard it from the guy’s own mouth! Have you heard from the Texas senator lately?”</p><p>“Oh, yeah,” said Snooky happily. “It sure is GREAT to know someone as INFLUENTIAL as HIM!”</p><p>Despite the fact that he had no social skills and only an emo camel for a friend, he sure seemed to know a lot of very important people.</p><p>Camel began to back away slowly. “I know, right?” said Buster. “Oh, and the president invited me to dinner on Thursday evening, and she said I could bring a friend. Wanna come?”</p><p>“Sure,” said Snooky. “Sounds great. I’ve been meaning to catch up with her.”</p><p>Then, Camel (and Foofy) ran. He galloped down the hall, past the rows of lockers, and dove into the first open door he saw. As it turned out, it was the door to the dungeons. He tripped and fell down the stairs, landing on top of Foofy, who thankfully, wasn’t hurt by Camel’s leggy bulk.</p><p>So he never heard Snooky say to Buster Posey, “Hey, could I bring my friend, Camel, along? He’s really great.”</p><p>And he never heard Buster Posey say, “Sure. A friend of yours is a friend of mine,” either.</p><p>Camel curled up into fetal position and sobbed. Snooky, confused, realized that it was time for Remedial Social Skills II and had to go. Camel stayed in the dungeon for two periods and missed Supplementary Dragonness and Applications of Amateur Questing. Eventually he decided that he would call his mom and ask her to pick him up and unenroll him from the school. He hoped he wouldn’t see Snooky on the way to his locker.</p><p>Once Camel arrived at his locker and called his mom, he decided to have a tantrum. He found a conveniently busy lecture hall and stormed in it and started screaming and throwing books and pots of ink. If he had known that Buster Posey was giving the lecture he probably would have behaved differently. The stunned students stared at Camel. It was well known he had emotional problems, but no one had ever seen them in action. After about five minutes, Camel quieted down. Buster Posey took this as a good moment to tell the class a story.</p><p>“So, the other day I was doing stretches and then ET pops out of the sky and he’s all like ‘Buster I’m having my yearly Flying Bicycle Party. You gonna come?’ And I was all, like, ‘Duh I’m coming. I’ve come every other year!’ And ET was, like, ‘Great, dude. Winston Churchill’s ghost is coming. And Frida’s coming with Diego.’ And then when I showed up at the party we ate soup and danced. And so the moral of the story is ‘go to ET’s parties because they rock!’”</p><p>That story led to rousing applause from the dragon students and confusion and utter embarrassment for Camel. Camel was trying to find a nearby hole to throw himself into. When Buster Posey turned to him. “So, you’re Camel?” Camel nodded with embarrassment. “Cool. I can’t wait to see you at the president’s dinner party. He hired Cats Are Weird for entertainment. Their newest member, Tartufo, will be there.”</p><p>Camel nodded mutely. He had no idea what was going on. “Wait-” said Buster Posey, “Are you Mrs. Camel’s son?” Camel nodded again. His neck was starting to ache from all that nodding. “Wow. Euphemia and I go way back. Tell her she’s invited too.” And at that Buster Posey turned back to his students and told the story of when he met Ford Prefect and they blew up Mars.</p><p>Camel stared dumbly at the ground. He didn’t move. He couldn’t. He sat there, his eyes bugging out of his head. Then he hugged Foofy and stared some more.</p><p>He sat there so long that his mother showed up to pick him up, and when she couldn’t find him at his locker or in the office or at the class he should have been at, she went to the old, deaf, dusty dragon behind the desk in the office. The grouchy old dragon screamed Camel’s name into the intercom, saying he was to report to the front office immediately. The other dragon yelled that Camel the Camel was to report to the front office immediately. Camel, however, didn’t hear. He was still in a state of shock. So his mother started panicking and running and screaming. Then she pulled out her iphone 15s and called: Artemis Fool and his kitty, the Jedi, the SWAT team, the park ranger, the crew of The Heart of Gold and the Order of the Phoenix. And the council of Elrond and the Three Musketeers. She also called the NYPD but they explained that Phoenix was out of their jurisdiction and also they didn’t want to deal with this right now, so she hung up with a resounding huff.</p><p>Just as they all showed up (by private jet, star cruiser, van, a park service car, Apparition, horse, and on foot), the grouchy dragon screamed Camel’s name into the intercom again.</p><p>Camel didn’t hear it this time either, but Buster Posey did. He steered Camel out by the shoulder. In the hall, they passed Saphira, Toothless, and Snooky. Only Snooky noticed.</p><p>“Camel!” he shouted. “Camel! Where are you going?”</p><p>By this time, Camel had recovered slightly. But only slightly.</p><p>Snooky flapped over to them. “Camel!” he panted. “Are you sick? Are you? Or are you in trouble? But you wouldn’t get into trouble without me, would you? Wait do friends do that? Huh?”</p><p>Camel elected to ignore him. When they got down to the office, Buster handed Snooky over to his mother. Instead of yelling at Camel like he had expected, she sat him down in a chair. Then she hauled off and slugged Buster Posey in the jaw.</p><p>He stood there, rubbing his jaw. “I guess I deserved that,” he said finally.</p><p>“You very well did,” spat – quite literally – Mrs. Camel. “I haven’t heard from you in years! It’s bad enough that you -” she looked at Camel and broke off.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” said Buster. “Make me the bad guy. But I had my career to pursue and I didn’t have time for friends.”</p><p>“Friends?” screeched Mrs. Camel. “I’ll show you frien-”</p><p>“Hooooooold up,” said a voice. They turned to see Sirius Black standing there, sporting a black eye for some reason. “So you don’t actually need us here?”</p><p>“Like, we actually have really important things to be doing,” added Anakin Padawalker. Behind him, Mad Eye Moody and Gimli nodded primly.</p><p>“For example,” said Remus Lupin, stepping forward. “Myself, Sirius, Mad Eye, and Mr. Snape have to defeat the one and only and very fabulous Lord U-No-Poo.”</p><p>“Yup,” said Sirius, lowering his wand from where he had been pointing it at Snape’s face.</p><p>“Don’t!” yelped Moody, “put your wand down! You could lose a buttock!”</p><p>Sirius rolled his eyes.</p><p>“For real,” he said, “literally everything bad that could happen to me does happen to me, but I still have both butt cheeks, thanks very much.”</p><p>“That makes one of us,” muttered Moody under his breath.</p><p>“What?” asked Snooky, looking concerned.</p><p>“Nothing,” snapped Moody.</p><p>“And, like,” butted in Anakin like that awkward conversation had never occurred, “me and Obi have to do important stuff with lightsabers and guns and spaceships and stuff.”</p><p>“It’s ‘Obi and I’,” corrected Obi-Wan absently. “And don’t call me Obi.”</p><p>“Sure thing, Obi.”</p><p>“We’ve got orc to kill,” added Aragorn helpfully (it wasn’t actually helpful, he just thought it was).</p><p>“And disembowel!” said Legolas.</p><p>“And chop up into tiny pieces!” said Gimli.</p><p>“And stick arrows into!”</p><p>“And decapitate!”</p><p>“Nonviolence is the key to living successfully,” said Tauriel reproachfully, cleaning blood off her knives.</p><p>“Excuse me-” said the SWAT leader, who was promptly silenced by Camel blowing a raspberry.</p><p>“I have to do something with jewelry,” said Frodo, “Or, I thought I did already, seeing as I’m a therapist now.”</p><p>“I have bratty teenagers to deliver,” announced a wormhole before spitting out Draco Malfoy, Harry Potter, and Justin Bieber, though the last can no longer be at this point considered a teenager, but he was when this was originally written. Thank you for your patience, time is fake anyways.</p><p>Everyone stopped boasting about what they were all going to do and all started exclaiming aggressively at Justin Bieber.</p><p>When they were done roasting him for being a sorry excuse for a musician, making the wormhole feel bad enough that it took him back, Draco Malfoy started whining about how hard his life was, seeing how he was expected to kill Dumbledore (Gandalf, who was there, adjusted his fake beard and looked slightly worried). The wormhole was no longer there to take him back, so Snape took pity on him and gave him a sandwich.</p><p>“I have some eyeliner to deliver,” proclaimed Artemis haughtily as Oil Drum meowed his agreement. Neither cared about bratty teenagers. Never mind that that is exactly what they both were.</p><p>“I need to find some drinkable tea on this spaceship,” said Arthur Dent.</p><p>“I need to arrest a bear,” said the park ranger. “Nothing else happens in my forest.”</p><p>“I need to find me a silicon buttock,” said Mad-Eye.</p><p>“Or, like, we could just have a dance party,” offered Anakin.</p><p>Everyone seemed to think that was a good idea because they all leapt into action trying to make this suggested dance party a reality. Mad Eye Moody started pulling down all the drapes in the office while Sirius turned out the lights. The grumpy dragon secretary grumbled about millennials ruining everything and left.</p><p>Remus conjured a disco ball and a bunch of streamers and confetti and Snape made a plate of pickle sandwiches appear, much to Draco’s despair (“I don’t like pickles!”). Remus then started his favourite record (the soundtrack of Frozen), but once he hit play, his face warped into an expression not unlike The Scream. This wasn’t spontaneous, in case you were worried. He did this because Yoda had switched his Frozen record for a dubstep version of the Star Wars theme.</p><p>This led to some confusion among the SWAT team, as the only magic they were used to was magical wormholes out of which popped bratty teenagers. Obi-Wan, however, took it in stride and started teaching anyone who was interested how to dance to dub.</p><p>Another freak wormhole opened and out popped Miley Cyrus who managed to sing two lines before Draco (who had returned from eating sandwiches) helpfully returned her to the nether realm from whence she came.</p><p>“About the wor-” began the leader of the SWAT team but got no further than that before Eragon (who had come into the school to visit Saphira) started his drum solo.</p><p>The hit entertainment group Cats Are Weird showed up, and its six members (Yeppi, Sammy, Eddie, Seppi and Tartufo) started attacking people’s feet, as their manager, Cat (a rather large dog with a tendency to eat fecal matter, and not an actual cat at all), ate the remaining sandwiches.</p><p>It was then discovered that Artemis had brought a camcorder and was recording the entire thing to post on his YouTube channel, The Story of Doom.</p><p>“Okaaay. Now that we’re all done dancing and bragging about our respective roles in the universe. I need to say something,” Buster said. The music slowly wound down, and Sirius helped it along by blasting the record player to tiny pieces with his wand. Lupin started yelling at him until he realized that everyone was staring at him. So he stopped.</p><p>When Remus had stopped screaming, everyone stared at Buster Posey instead because he, after all, had announced that he had something to say. So he said it: “Hem hem. Didn’t all of your stories already pass because we’re in a parallel universe?”</p><p>There was some embarrassed muttering and one very British person (Snape? Sirius? Malfoy? Arthur Dent?) said, “You sound like Umbridge.”</p><p>“As I was saying” said Buster, “You guys can stop complaining because your stories already happened.”</p><p>“Oh,” said Snooky.</p><p>“Oh, yeah,” said Sirius.</p><p>“That makes sense,” said Aragorn.</p><p>“Yes, it certainly does,” agreed Gandalf (actually Dumbledore in disguise), once again straightening his false beard.</p><p>“That’s kinda weird when you think about it,” said Anakin Padawalker.</p><p>“This whole thing is kinda weird when you think about it,” shot back Artemis Fool.</p><p>“So let’s not think about it!” said Snooky with the air of someone who has just discovered something new and amazing.</p><p>“Aragorn,” said Leggy loudly. “I’ve got a Grindr notification, so we have to leave now.”</p><p>“Or we could keep dancing,” pointed out Gimli.</p><p>“Yeah, but the record player’s broken and I got a Grindr notification and he looks like Orlando Bloom, so we should go,” argued Leggy.</p><p>“I think,” offered Moody. “That this dance party is a diversion for an attack! Don’t put down your wands and don’t let either buttock out of sight!”</p><p>Harry Potter, busy punching holes into the receptionist’s files, snickered at the word “butt”. He wasn’t quite sure what the second part of the word was, but the word sounded like “butt”, which, as everyone knows, is an immensely hilarious word.</p><p>Draco Malfoy tugged on Snape’s sleeve urgently. “I don’t like pickles,” he whined. Snape shook him off. In the background, Yeppi and Sammy, the members of Cats Are Weird, continued their age-old feud by throwing pickle sandwiches, stolen from Cat, and also their guitars at each other. This seemed to give everyone else permission to start throwing food around, with Sirius and Snape nearly killing each other with the little toothpicks from the sandwiches. The SWAT leader ran around desperately and uselessly trying to get everyone to settle down. Obviously, it didn’t work.</p><p>“How about we just leave?”suggested Leggy to Aragorn. “Nothing’s happening here anymore.”</p><p>He thought he had said it quietly, but suddenly everyone stopped throwing pickle sandwiches and cats and agreed with him. The wormhole opened obligingly to take them away. On his way out, Snape tripped Sirius, who fell into a desk, hitting his head and sending about 500.4 papers into the air. As they settled around him, he managed to get seven papercuts.</p><p>The leader of the SWAT team started sobbing in relief. When everyone was filing out the door into a wormhole, he stayed behind and wrung Camel’s hoof and clung to him, thanking him profusely. Then he too stepped into the portal, heading back to his task of filing photos of dead presidents’ cousins.</p><p>“Well, that was interesting,” said Snooky, watching the wormhole close almost on Sirius Black. Had the portal closed a few seconds earlier, it is probable that we would only ever see the front half of Sirius again. As it was, it just scraped some skin off his heels and shaved off all the hair on the back of his skull.</p><p>Ignoring this near catastrophe, Snooky watched Mrs. Camel and Buster Posey, who seemed to know each other really very well, reminiscing about stuff they had done. They talked about going camping at Waldo Lake (where a bear ate their breakfast), and about going to baseball games and aquariums.</p><p>Camel hugged Foofy and stared at Buster Posey and his mom in awe. He would have thought his mother was much cooler if she had ever mentioned being BFFs with Buster Posey, his hero. All of this was causing him to make some minor (ok, major) edits to how he viewed this famous figure.</p><p>“Who are you?” he finally asked Buster Posey, interrupting a story where they had gone to IKEA and thrown meatballs at employees.</p><p>Buster Posey knelt and looked into Camel’s wide brown eyes. This reminded Camel that he wanted to get ice blue contacts.</p><p>“Camel,” he said softly and earnestly, “Besides being a widely successful major league baseball player, I am your father.”</p><p>This dialogue prompted Snooky, Toothless, and Saphira to debate the relevance and accuracy of Star Wars quotes and whether or not the prequel series ruined Star Wars (and thus, life) as we know it. The general consensus was that they were always welcome even if they weren’t accurate (so long as it was established that Han definitely shot first) and that yes, they definitely had.</p><p>Camel, however, was staring wide-eyed at Buster Posey, his gum stale and forgotten in his mouth. “Really?” he breathed.</p><p> </p><p>Let’s take a break at this crucial moment in Camel’s life. Normally, this might be considered cruel, which the authors are not, but this is a very important interruption. You see, there are two characters that have not yet been introduced: the aforementioned authors themselves.</p><p>Imagine, if you will, a cluttered room filled with books, paper, Legos, and towering piles of stuffed animals. Or don’t imagine it. We’re spelling it out for you here – and it’s really actually happening.</p><p>Not all of the writing takes place in this cluttered little room – but some of it does. You know, a cluttered environment actually stimulates creative thoughts and processes. Little known fact.</p><p>Let our descriptive eyeball go in through the window as though a swooping camera shot in a dramatic movie intro. Inside we see two – preteens? Teens? Instead of writing at one of the many laptops, iphones, or typewriters throughout the room with soft creatively stimulating piano music playing in the background, our authors are engaging in violent dance party/lightsaber fight. Blasting over the expensive speakers is Remus’s stolen Frozen record. Over the loud dramatic music, Anna and Miranda are yelling to each other about the meaning of life and flavors of ice cream.</p><p>“Wait,” screams Anna, lobbing a stuffed wolf at Miranda’s head, “isn’t this a paradox?”</p><p>“What?!” shouts Miranda, ducking the wolf’s trajectory. They expertly block a lightsaber thrust from Anna while simultaneously dabbing.</p><p>“I said!” bellows Anna, stepping back onto a lego and crying out in pain. “That this is a bloody paradox!”</p><p>“Yeah I know!” yells Miranda, lowering their lightsaber. “How can this be happening if we’re not writing it?”<br/> “Like, do we even exist?” screams Anna, limping to the extremely dangerous place where the record player is electrically wired into the surround sound.</p><p>“Why is pistachio gelato so underrated?” screams Miranda back, looping their conversation back to their topic from earlier.</p><p>Anna haphazardly rips the cables from the record player, cutting Elsa off just before the stunningly dramatic musical climax and the only reason she got popular at all.</p><p>“And, like,” she yells,” “you just dabbed, and yet that shouldn’t come along for another four years or so!”</p><p>“You’re still yelling,” points out Miranda in a normal conversational tone. “But yes, I see your point.”</p><p>“Fucking good,” mutters Anna, kicking a lego.</p><p>“Wait,” says Miranda, frowning, “you just said ‘fucking’, yet in 2013 or ‘14 or whatever you never swore like that.”</p><p>“Fuck,” realizes Anna, “you’re right.”</p><p>“Sooooooooo,” Miranda waits a moment to make sure everyone listens. “What’s going on?”</p><p>“Well, we are the authors,” says Anna, “and if you’ll notice, we’ve switched from past tense to present tense so I think that maybe we should just start writing.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>“I’ll get the ice cream,” says Anna, getting up and going to the conveniently placed fridge (next to the grand piano).</p><p>Miranda sits down and starts typing while Anna-</p><p> </p><p>“Haha, this is so great,” said Anna, tapping away at her keyboard rapidly.</p><p>“We’re writing writing ourselves writing.” Miranda snorts. “This is our all time high.”</p><p>“Um, yeah.” Anna stopped to scratch her hairline. “But now I want ice cream.”</p><p>“You made me dab,” noted Miranda. “Why?”</p><p>“Why not? Anyway, it alluded to the fact that it wasn’t real because dabbing wasn’t a real thing in 2014 so-”</p><p>“Yeah, whatever, it was invented in the 1920s during the Jazz Age and has only very recently resurged in popularity. We all know this,” said Miranda impatiently. “Just get back to the story, why don’t you. Don’t leave poor Camel hanging.”</p><p>“Right,” agreed Anna, her tongue poking between her teeth. “I’m on it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really?” asked the breathless Camel, gazing with awe at his hero.</p><p>Buster Posey guffawed loudly. “Naw, I’m just yanking your tail,” he said, chortling. “And, man, you should have seen the look on your face.”</p><p>Camel immediately assumed a look of crestfallenness.</p><p>“No no no, human beans and camels don’t really mix,” he said. “Wrong number of chromosomes and also, like, no offense, but ew.”</p><p>“That’s fair,” said Camel, letting the crestfallenness slide off his face like sparkly, fiercely minty green toothpaste.</p><p>“But, like,” added Buster hastily. “Here’s some free tickets to some Giants games for you and Snooky and your mom if you want, and, like, we could go, er, fishing or something sometime.”</p><p>“Really?” Camel was overjoyed to the point that he started dancing.</p><p>“Oh, and by the way,” added Buster Posey without pause, “the other day I was, like, talking to King Arthur and he said, like, that he wants me to come and attend a proper party at Camelot with all the Knights of the Round Table — oh, btw, have you heard those rumors that Sir Lancelot is really gay? Like who would’ve thought it, eh? But apparently he’s dating some really rich prince sooooooo- where was I? Oh yeah — so I’m supposed to attend this really cool party so I can dance on the Round Table and also ol’ King Arty wants me to come and give ideas for a new kind of crop distributor. I’m, like, super qualified, cuz even though I don’t know shit about agriculture or peasants, he saw he holding a bunch of carrots on my LinkedIn profile pic, so you know how it is. Can’t let down a king, right? And I’m sure my super huge genius intellect will make me ace this thing, but, uh, do you have any ideas here? Just asking.”</p><p>“I just wanna get out of this goddamned country!” yelled a backpacker before backpacking into the sunset.</p><p>“That’s nice, dear!” called Mrs. Camel after him.</p><p>Buster Posey nodded quickly. “Yeah, actually, that might be a good option too.”</p><p>Suddenly, the school’s building shook violently. This lead to screaming hordes of dragon students panicking and running in circles wailing about the apocalypse.</p><p>“Moody’s obscure reference several pages back was accurate!” screamed Snooky. “The dance party and the wormhole and everyone here was a diversion! We’re under attack!”</p>
