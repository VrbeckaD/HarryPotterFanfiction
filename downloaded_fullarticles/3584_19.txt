    <p>“Hey, Tom,” Harry ruffled his boyfriends head (who laid on the couch), heading towards the kitchen.</p><p>Harry Potter. Wizard, Past Gryffindor, auror, proud bisexual, lover of treacle tart and Tom Riddle, and most importantly... A millenial. </p><p>“Hmm,” Tom turned the page of his book, bringing his knees up and sitting up somewhat properly to make room for Harry to sit when he returns.</p><p>The toaster button clicked.</p><p>Tom Riddle. Wizard, Past Slytherin, Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, reluctant homosexual, lover of reading, the dark arts, maybe his boyfriend and most unfortunately… also a millennial</p><p>The toaster popped, black bread springing out.</p><p>The terrible smell of burnt toast quickly filled the room. Tom shook his head as he heard the trash bag being ruffled. Assuming Harry tossed the bread out, he prepared himself to read another page since his boyfriend would be making more.</p><p>Predictably, the toaster once again clicked. </p><p>A few minutes Harry entered the living room, sitting next to the other with toast on a napkin in hand.</p><p>He quickly glancing from his toast to his boyfriend. </p><p>“We’re out of bread...and avocado.” </p><p>Tom hummed, closing his book to place it on their coffee table in front of the couch. He leaned over, indicating he wanted a bite. </p><p>Harry obliged and allowed him the first bite.</p><p>“With how much avocado you buy and place on your toast, it’s no wonder why this economy is in shambles.” Tom rolled his eyes fondly.</p><p>Harry smiled, taking a bite himself, “Shut up.”</p>
