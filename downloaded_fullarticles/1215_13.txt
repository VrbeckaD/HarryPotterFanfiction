          <div class="userstuff"><p>Our story starts in Albus Dumbledore's house, his close friend Severus Snape is visiting.</p><p>Albus asked, "Why have you come here today, Severus?"</p><p>Severus told him, "It's about the war, I don't want it to end with Gel... Grindelwald's death."</p><p>Albus sighed. "If it could end nicely, I would make sure that happened."</p><p>Severus scowled. "It doesn't have to end badly, Albus."</p><p>Albus smiled slightly. "You have changed recently. If you can find a way for this to end better, then go ahead and share it with me."</p><p>Severus stated, "You know as well as I do that I don't want him to die because I'm in love with him."</p><p>Albus gasped. "Y-You and Grindelwald?"</p><p>Severus nodded and said, "I'm here without his knowledge, Albus. But, I'm here to bargain for him."</p><p>Albus inquired, "Is this your first love since Lily?"</p><p>Severus replied, "It is."</p><p>Albus beamed, "Then you have bargained with me enough, Severus. I will spare his life for you."</p><p>Severus responded, "Thank you. I think that Gellert will be pleased."</p></div>
