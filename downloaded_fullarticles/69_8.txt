    <p>It was the 31.07.1980 in a small house in Godric's Hollow when Lily Potter just bore her son.</p><p>"Ahhrrrgggg, James Potter you dirty crap guy!  You put me in this situation for you will be sleeping on the couch now!! Ahhhhhh."  Lily barked at her husband fighting another woe came. James, on the other hand, was pale alone by his wife's cries of pain.</p><p>The Medi witch of Lily helped calmly said " Ah, now my dear inhale very deeply, press one last time and ..."; " Blw√§hhhhhh" screamed the newly born baby. It had a small raven-black head of hair. The witch cleaned the child and placed it in his mother's waiting arms. The newly baked parents both looked down at their baby with tears in their eyes.</p><p>"Welcome to the world, Harry James Potter." Said James in a soft voice and held his son's small hand. Harry opened his eyes and Lily's emerald green started the two as Harry saw his parents forming a sweet toothless smile.  </p><p>Lily went through a dazzling pain in her stomach and she felt like she wanted to push again. She screamed " Aaahhhhhhh, there's one more coming!" . The Medi Witch immediately entered into action.</p><p>Five minutes later, another black-haired boy saw the light of day.  Unlike his brother, this violet eye had small galaxies in them that shine, but unlike Harry, he was much smaller and more slender.</p><p>Now both babies lay in Lily's arms. James and Lily looked down on their twins with a slight shock. The midwife told them that Harry was apparently lying in front of the other boy in the womb and also received more nutrients and was therefore larger, so they didn't notice the smaller one. </p><p>James suddenly burst into laughter, Lily just looked at him in disbelief, "Sorry but the situation is just too ridiculous. The Dark Lord is out there and probably looking for us, it's too dangerous to have ONE child and now we have TWO!" he explained. </p><p>Lily continued to look at him briefly until she turned to her children. " Yes, you're probably right but look at how they hold hands, isn't that absolutely amiable?  Oh James i don't care if it's right or wrong but I both love so much now. Whether it's one or two babies, I'm both going to pour in so much love and see how they grow up, everyone can tell me what they want."</p><p>"Well, if you think so, I do. One question remains, however, how do you want to call our little surprise?".  James asked his wife.</p><p>Lily thought briefly. "Keith Akira Potter." They both smiled at their two little wonders: "Harry and Keith you both will change the world I know." Said James and held his wife wrapped around him in his arms.</p><p>                                                                       XIOXIOXIOXIOXIOXIOXIOXIOXIOXIOX</p><p>However, this idyll did not last long. On Halloween night in 1981, Voldemort managed to find the Potter residence. When James tried to stop him, however, he gave up his life. Lily was quiet in a room in the house, holding her two sons protectively in her arms. She heard her husband screaming and pushing her boys closer to her, and shortly afterwards the room door opened and Voldemort stepped in. She quickly put the twins behind her and stood protectively in front of her.</p><p>"Go to the side or join your husband.". He raised his magic wand and pointed to the two boys behind Lily.</p><p>She looked briefly at Harry and Keith. "Just about my corpse!". </p><p>"Like you want stupid girl, Avada Kedavra!". Green light filled the room and Lily collapsed on the floor. He turned to the boys with his magic wand, who hugged and looked at their mother with tears in their eyes. Once again, the green light lit up the room with the death curse, but instead of meeting the twins, it bounced off them and was sent back to Voldemort and hit him himself. The dark lord disappeared. </p><p>                                                                        XIOXIOXIOXIOXIOXIOXIOXIOXIOXIOX</p><p>Later in the night, a basket with two little boys was placed at the door of Ligusterweg number 4.<br/>
This is where our story of brothers, magic, wonders, pain and above all love between family and friends and their togetherness begins.</p>
