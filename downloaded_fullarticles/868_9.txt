  <b>The music pulsed and her body moved in the summer heat.  She was searching for something she could never find for herself.  Forgiveness.  Freedom.  Memories.  Forgetfulness.  </b>
</p><p>
  <b>Oh, how she wanted to forget...</b>
</p><p>
  <i>Hermione lay back on her bed, her parents gone for the next year on an extended tour of Europe for the NHS Dentistry section.  The Drs. Granger would be visiting other clinics and dentists throughout Europe to find the latest and best methods and write an extensive report of the feasibility of including those practices in the NHS as standard.  Some, she was certain, would be sufficiently good and inexpensive to replace some of the methods they had complained about – and she really couldn't say what because she and her parents hadn't really discussed the practice the past two years.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>If she were honest with herself, and she usually was, Hermione would recognize the serendipitous nature of this tour.  She wanted to resent the National Health Service for destroying her Christmas holidays with her parents, but she couldn't help but be happy they were gone.  Sixth year had shown the war was heating up, and she was worried about their safety.  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>Her plan, the one she would tell everyone about because she hadn't had to use it, had been to Obliviate them, give them false lives and identities, and send them off to Australia until the war was over.  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>She relaxed into her bed and smiled.  A Christmas without friends or parents to bother the hell out of her, pull her out of the research she was doing for Harry and the Order, and otherwise get in her way.  This just might be the best Christmas of her life.  Shortly after that thought had wormed its way past her mental defenses – she employed them even against herself and her less-charitable nature – she drifted off into a very happy, very peaceful sleep.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Hermione's hips twitched in her sleep.  Her back arched and she groaned softly as she slowly came awake.  Of all the times for those old dreams about Professor Lupin to surface, this was one of the worst.  Or perhaps the best.  There were no roommates to bother if she decided to let herself indulge in a bit of harmless lust, no one that she would have to worry about Obliviating or casting privacy charms on her bed.  This was the perfect time to indulge in a little fantasy about whether or not a werewolf's tongue in his human form was as long and flexible as it was in his lupine form.  She moved her left hand – she knew Lupin was a Lefty and liked the authenticity of it – down to her –</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Wait.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Brown eyes snapped open in panic.  Her hand wasn't moving.  She tugged and pulled both of her hands, but she was still stretched out on her back, knees high and wide apart, hands somehow pinned to the mattress.  She couldn't move.  SHE COULDN'T MOVE!</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“So you're awake, little witch,” growled the voice from between her legs.  “Good.”  A rough, wet tongue slid over her folds once and Hermione drew in a breath – “Ah-ah-ah, none of that,” the voice warned.  “No screaming.  I know where your parents are, little witch, and it wouldn't be the matter of a moment to find them.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Hermione felt her eyes grow wide as she stared blindly into the dark at the darker shadow between her legs.  She squeaked in shock as that tongue slid over her folds again.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Let's get acquainted, little witch...” he murmured before burying his face and all of his attention between her legs.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Hermione's usually fine, organized, quick mind shorted out as she felt the touch of another for the first time...and hated it.  And loved it.  She moaned for him, whoever he was.  She came for him.  She had thought she had given herself an orgasm before, but apparently she hadn't.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She came for him, moaned for him, writhed for him, and did not once ask his name.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“What a sweet little witch,” the voice between her legs crooned.  “Now, little witch, do you believe I want to harm you?”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“N-n-no,” Hermione managed between ragged breaths.</i>
</p><p><i>He kissed her quivering flesh and she moaned as her hips jerked up to meet him.  A soft laugh.  That wicked tongue laving her again, finding all of her secrets and making them his.</i>  His <i>little place to the left of her clit, the one he tongued so lightly and rhythmically, making her draw sharp, quick breaths as her eyes rolled back.</i>  His <i>spot right under her hood, the one the point of his tongue burrowed into, making her shake and moan.</i>  His <i>delicate entrance, the one he rimmed so delicately and teased without entering.</i>  His <i>little nerve bundle, the one that he sucked so gently as she cried out with pleasure, writhing under his mouth.</i>  <b>His.</b>  <i>He made that sweet space between her legs </i>his,<i> and she had no idea how he was able to do that.</i></p><p>
  <i>Hermione whimpered as he again turned his attention to driving her mad with pleasure.  She screamed for him again, coming hard against his tongue, aftershocks ripping through her as he laved her clean.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Do you believe I will help you, little witch, as you fight the Dark Lord?”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Y-y'ssss,” she barely managed to hiss.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“What a perfect little witch.  Do you know what perfect little witches get?”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“N-no,” she panted.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Perfect little witches get rewards.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Again and again he questioned her, she answered, barely coherent, and he brought her to screaming, writhing orgasm with only his mouth.  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Do you believe I will come to you again, little witch?” he whispered as she barely hung on to her consciousness.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Yyyeh,” she managed, a tiny nod accompanying what could be an affirmative sound.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“What a smart little witch.  What do smart little witches get?”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She whimpered.  “Rewards.”  The word hadn't left her lips fully when he sucked hard on her sore little clit, making her scream and scream as orgasm racked her body over and over again.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>This time, her reward left her unconscious.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>When she woke, he was gone.  A bottle of healing potion was on her nightstand with a note:</i>
</p><p><i></i>Take one dram, no more.  I will come to you again in the night, little witch.  Be ready.</p><p>
  <i>She had stared at that note for a long time, her mind whiting out as her body trembled in anticipation.  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>Unexpected nocturnal visitor or not, Hermione Jane Granger was no fool.  She carefully measured one dram into the cap of the potion bottle, knocked it back, and waited for it to kick in.  She didn't try to stand, knowing it would be too painful to do so.  She didn't try to deny what had happened, but neither did she allow herself to dwell on it.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>The Order of the Phoenix had a new ally, and said ally had approached her in a most convincing manner.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She would research and work, as she had planned, and let him come to her when he could.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Next time, though, she would be asking the questions...</i>
</p><p>
  <i></i>
  <b>The beat changed, the song changed, but her mind remained the same.  She wanted to forget.  She wanted to forget.  She did.  </b>
</p><p>
  <b>She did.</b>
</p><p>
  <i>Hermione woke to the feel of a warm, wet tongue tracing her newly-healed folds.  He was back already, the next night.  She moaned softly as she woke, her legs spreading wider for him as he tasted her and teased her.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Ask, little witch,” he whispered against her.  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Why do you want to help us fight Voldemort?”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>A sharp nip at her thigh scolded her for using his name.  She squeaked in surprise and felt her back curl and her legs hitch higher.  She would not want that sharp little bite to be directed at her delicate girly bits, so she whispered quickly, “Sorry.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Mm,” he captured her little clit between his lips and hummed low and loud.  She choked and moaned for him.  “Forgiven.”  He licked and tormented her for a long moment.  “I want to be free.  I never wanted to serve him, and I cannot get free without letting those I care about get hurt.  I am trapped.  I want to get out of the trap.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“I understand.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Smart little witch,” he said, focusing for long minutes on her reward.  Hermione was panting and bucking under his tongue, letting him control the pace of her reward – she had learned the night before not to try to rush him – and relaxing into the pleasure of being pleasured.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Next question, little witch,” he whispered.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Why – ” her throat was dry.  She swallowed and tried again.  “Why did you come to me like this?  Why not go to Dumbledore or someone else?”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“You are a generous witch, not like others.  Even Dumbledore wouldn't listen to me because he believes I am evil.  I'm not.  The ones I protect are not.  But you, you are a kind, even to creatures that others overlook.  You work hard for your wizard friends, helping them.  You help other students in other Houses, even Slytherin.  You forgive slights and hurts, and you do not let prejudices affect your decisions if you can prevent it.”  He turned his attention back to that sweet little spot to the left of her clit, then licked her several times from entrance to apex, making her whimper.  “I trust you, little witch, because I cannot trust others.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Th-thank you,” she managed between panted breaths. “Oh, thank you.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Gracious little witch...who will get...”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“A reward,” she moaned.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>A low chuckle made her shiver in anticipation.  He burrowed the tip of his tongue under the hood of her clit and waited for her to start moaning loud and long before flickering his tongue quickly over the exposed little bundle of nerves.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Hermione screamed as her reward whipped through her, making her writhe against the sticking charms he had cast on her wrists and back.  She arched and moved as her body spasmed, but the charms held firm.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>That wicked tongue didn't stop, though it did gentle and carefully clean the evidence of her pleasure from her body.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Hermione floated down gently from her place among the stars and relaxed as he took care of her.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“What kind of information can you give us?” she asked after several long minutes of simply feeling his tongue against her skin, not pushing her to pleasure, but comforting and relaxing her.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“I know where certain items are stored and the counters for the curses that protect them.  I can lead you to them.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“For a price?” she asked.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Mm.”  He was silent for a long minute, unmoving.  His tongue left her while he thought and she felt bereft.  “No.  No price.  Not to destroy him.”  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“So the price will come later,” she said.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Such a bright little witch,” he murmured, laughing softly.  “Yes, the price will come later, but the reward for smart little witches will be you...coming...” he applied his lips just so and sucked hard and fast on her clit, she arched hard and screamed as the pleasure slammed into her again, “...coming...” he sucked again and again, until she was crying for relief, “...NOW.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>And she did.  Hard, fast, wild – she came on his tongue, screaming loud and long.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>He didn't let up.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She didn't stop screaming.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>He didn't let up.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She didn't remember anything after three minutes of being held in orgasm.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>When she awoke, she saw a new note next to her healing potion.  Her clit was throbbing with her heartbeat, begging her for mercy.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Hands shaking, body still weak from his nocturnal onslaught, she measured the dram of potion out and drank it quickly, sighing in relief as her clit twitched twice in thanks and fell mercifully, numbly, from her perception.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Hands steady now, she reached for the note.</i>
</p><p>Item number one: a cup.  Ugly gold thing.  Godric's Hollow, third house down from the ruined home of the Potters.  Since he is preoccupied with tormenting the Potter boy from afar, and some other grand scheme which will probably fail fantastically, you should be able to get it today without any problems.  Disillusion yourself with the wand I put in your shoe.  The little frog pillow is your Portkey to the house.  Activation word is “Hollow.”  <u>Do not be seen.</u>  Eyes are everywhere, but I shall endeavour they be focussed well away from the Hollow today.<i></i></p><p>
  <i>Instructions on how to get past the curses and protections followed, and Hermione studied them for a long time.  Finally knowing what she had to do, she got up, managed to walk to the bathroom on steady legs.  Her knees were a little bit wobbly at first, but she was mobile, and that was all that mattered.  A shower, some breakfast – was it really only nine-o'-clock? – and she was as ready as she could be.  Except for clothing.  Right.  Knickerless in only a large t-shirt was not really appropriate for picking up...whatever she was going to get.  Right.  Ugly gold cup.  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>As she dressed, Hermione let her mind wander where it would.  It didn't, as one would expect, drift back to the night of mind-blowing pleasure and bondage and forced orgasms.  Instead, it reviewed the information she had been given about her first mission.</i>
</p><p>***<br/>
Hermione Granger's mind did not function like most teenaged girls' minds, or most over-twenty adult witch minds, either.  She did not spend vast amounts of time emoting over circumstances, boys, tasks, or her appearance.  Most of the time, she ignored emotion, unless she was under severe stress, like third year when she slapped Malfoy and cried so easily.  Let Ron shag half of Hogwarts – and she didn't care which half, either – and let Harry do something utterly daft that she'd have to fix for him later.  Let Seamus and Parvati snog one another brainless (not that Parvati had a brain most of the time, but she did at least have a functioning brain stem, hence the breathing and heartbeat and her continued existence as classified as “living”), let the first years be experiments for Fred and George – she didn't care about it the way everyone thought she did.  Rather, she didn't care for the reasons they though she did.  </p><p>Ron shagging half of Hogwarts was <i>not</i> good idea because apparently his family was quite fertile on both sides of the family tree.  A pregnant girlfriend or one-night-shag was not something he could handle without making her life messy.  Therefore, she tried to keep Ron from dating and/or shagging and put on the jealous act.  So far, it was working and the closest Ron had come to shagging had been Lavender in a broom closet, and Lavender was very, very good with her contraceptive measures.  She was even better with contraception when she wasn't getting laid, but only licked, sucked, fingered, and snogged.</p><p>Harry doing something daft was unavoidable, but at least she could keep track of his tendencies for this particular daft adventure this year – he was fixated on Malfoy – and nag him about it so that a) he thought she cared (she did love him, but he could be a complete ninny at times) and b) she could later let him tell her she had told him so without having to say it herself.  That pattern had held up quite well over the past five-and-a-half years, so she was more than happy to <i>keep</i> that pattern.  It didn't interfere with her research and study schedules.  However, if she could, on the off chance <i>prevent</i> said daft scheme from occurring, she would be one up on the whole business and, with that particular stress missing, perhaps even be able to entertain more than one daft scheme the next year.</p><p>Seamus and Parvati snogging she had no problems with, as long as they didn't make a mess on the common room couches, what with the drool and other bodily fluids.  They were quite fun to watch, usually, and oddly proper about it all, so the lower years got an education without any stupidity on their own parts, namely trying to do what the sixth year couple was doing.  </p><p>Fred and George were bloody brilliant, and she was more than willing to admit that, if only to herself.  No, the objections she had to their experiments on the younger years was <i>not</i> that it was wrong or unethical, but that they needed to make sure the kids weren't actually going to get hurt or that they didn't have a bad reaction to any of the ingredients.  Sensible precautions ensured a healthy, willing, continuous set of guinea pigs for the boys, and so she shrieked at them whenever they went against her carefully plotted set of criteria for test subjects.  They'd figure it out.  Eventually.</p><p>Hermione's head always, always, always overruled her heart and her emotive centers, and, usually, her endocrine glands, including adrenaline.  She was a sensible witch to the point that she defined the category labeled Sensible Witches.  True, she had been something like sexually assaulted, bound, and tormented by orgasm, but she was in possession of two things that overruled any silly emotional reaction to that situation (well, any negative emotional reaction, since she was rather enjoying the mystery ally's attentions quite a lot): She had an ally/mentor about which the Order (meaning the nosy and meddling Dumbledore) did not know, and her ally had access to particular information that she knew was vital to the cause, even if certain people (everyone who still looked at the three veterans Harry, Ron, and herself as children) didn't want her to realize it.  Being a Sensible Witch, Hermione chose to act on the information given and let the whole oral-sex-'til-she-passes-out part wait for consideration.  It could wait indefinitely.  She was that good at separating emotion from thought and action.</p><p>***<br/>
<i>Information in hand, mission known, and girly bits mercifully numbed for the rest of the day, Hermione Granger got dressed in sensible clothing, put on her sensible hiking boots, picked up her sensible wand, sensibly picked up her new apparently unTraceable wand, sensibly used it to Disillusion herself, and took hold of the Portkey firmly in one hand.  As soon as she whispered the activation word, a magical fishhook the size that could have been used on Moby Dick gouged its way through her navel and she was reeled through space in a nauseating, gut-wrenching ride.</i></p><p>
  <i>From there, it was a matter of simplicity itself to keep from vomiting, use the counters, and get home without anyone the wiser.</i>
</p><p>
  <b>Another change of rhythm, this time a wicked, pulsing Latin number that felt like sex.  A hard, male body pressed up against hers, the hard length in his tight jeans making her remember.  She wanted to remember.  She did.</b>
</p><p>
  <b>Didn't she?</b>
</p><p>
  <i>Another night, another visit.  Another night, another visit.  On and on, over and over, he had come to her, pleasured her into passing out, and left her with information and clues about what to find and where to go.  Every question she answered, every question she asked, she was rewarded.  Every successful mission, she was rewarded.  Everything she did, she was rewarded.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She had forgotten what it felt like to sleep through the night without coming against his tongue, sometimes with long, torturous teases between orgasm, sometimes with orgasms forced out of her, one after another after another, sometimes with him sucking so hard and long on her clit that she was held in ecstasy for minutes at a time until her body simply could not take the pleasure any longer.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Who are you?” she breathed on the tenth night after he woke her with his particular attentions.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>He paused.  Kissed her thigh.  Stayed silent and still for a long time.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Little witch,” he murmured, his voice a sad rumble from the shadows, “if you knew who was giving you this help, if you knew who was giving you these rewards, you would scream in terror.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“No,” she denied, whispering into the shadows.  “No.  You mean me no harm.  You are helping me, the Order – “</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“If you knew, you would scream in terror.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“No...”  She didn't want to believe him.  She wanted him to know he was safe with her.  That she felt safe with him.  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Shh, little witch,” he said, kissing her thigh again.  “Take what I can give you.  Set me free.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>He bent his head to his self-appointed task, and, this time, as she moaned in pleasure, she felt her heart breaking.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She was starting to love her shadow-lover...her mystery lover.  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>As she moaned for him, she knew she could never tell him...never let him know...never tell anyone.  Ever.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>And her heart screamed in denial.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She screamed in pleasure.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Once again, she was left boneless and sated, sore and unconscious, from his attentions.  Once again, he left a note: the snake was the only one left.  The only one she hadn't collected and stored oh-so-carefully.  The only one she didn't have to destroy on her own.</i>
</p><p><i></i>Destroy these.  Use the Gryffindor sword.  It was used to kill the basilisk under the school, so it will work.  If you can't get the sword, basilisk venom will work.  Shove the fang through the objects and wait.  Make sure you're outside a protective ward-ring first.  Use magic to shove the fang through.  Repeat for each object.  Do not try to destroy more than one at a time.</p><p>He will never know.  He can't feel what's in these anymore.  He is too evil and too broken.</p><p>Free me, little witch.</p><p>Please.</p><p>
  <i>Hermione had closed her eyes and begged Fawkes to hear her.  The phoenix had.  She let the phoenix perch on the kitchen chair and told him everything.  She spoke of her mystery lover helping her.  She spoke of her quests to collect the evil objects.  She spoke of the Sword of Gryffindor or the basilisk fangs.  She asked the phoenix for his help.  He looked at her, nodded once, and disappeared in a flash of fire.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>He returned with the Sword of Gryffindor in one talon, a basilisk fang in the other.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“You think I'll need both, then?” she asked.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Fawkes blinked at her, dropped the items lightly on her kitchen table, and waited.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“You want to watch, then?  Make sure I don't screw it up?”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>This time, Fawkes nodded at her.  She smiled back at the mythical bird – no, not mythical, magical.  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Thanks, Fawkes,” she whispered, extending her hand and letting him push his head under it for a good scratch.  The bird sighed and she smiled.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Think we can do them all today?” she asked as she pet him.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Fawkes tipped his head, looked at her, bobbed his head once, and then butted at her hand imperiously.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“But first more pets.”  The bird sighed again and Hermione drew strength and comfort from her contact with this surprisingly perceptive magical bird.</i>
