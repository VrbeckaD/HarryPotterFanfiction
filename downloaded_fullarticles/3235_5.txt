    <p>::SCENE ONE::</p>
<p>Once again, Harry found himself hiding behind a tapestry in the seventh-floor corridor. He had had no luck thus far in figuring out what Malfoy was doing in the room of requirement. Crabbe and Goyle had stopped guarding the door nearly an hour ago. It was a half hour past curfew. Harry had been hiding since before dinner, waiting for his chance to ambush Malfoy and put a stop to his nefarious plotting. Harry Potter was tired of waiting. <br/>He was close. Something was different about today, he just knew it! Not even ten minutes later Harry was proven right. Darkness had fallen and the corridor was cast in shadow. A strip of light streaked across the hall as Malfoy opened the door to make his way out and Harry seized his opportunity. He lunged out from his hiding place and tackled Malfoy back into the Room, the door closing with a thud behind them. </p>
<p>“What the HELL… Potter?!” Malfoy shouted, trying to put himself to rights. There were piles and piles of broken and dusty items discarded everywhere. The ceiling must have been nearly 8 meters tall. Harry couldn’t judge its length because the piles towered overhead as far as he could see. </p>
<p>“What are you doing in here Malfoy?” Harry practically growled holding his wand pointed at Malfoy who reached for his own. It probably wasn’t his best approach to answers, Harry thought in hindsight. However, he hadn’t actually thought he’d make it this far and was playing the situation by ear.</p>
<p>“I could ask the same of you, Potter. Stalking me again, are you?”</p>
<p>Harry ignored the jibe for that is exactly what he had been doing. “I know you’re up to something and you’re going to tell me what.”</p>
<p>“Give it a rest, Potter. There’s nothing to see.” Draco said tightly.</p>
<p>Malfoy gave himself away as he glanced to the side, a tell he never would have made if he wasn’t so exhausted. He looked the part as well. His blond hair was disheveled and falling into his face. His normally pressed white school shirt was wrinkled and untucked. His face was gaunt and he looked like he hadn’t been sleeping, or eating for that matter. Under different circumstances Harry might have felt sorry for him. As it was, he took off down the narrow path between the stacks that Malfoy had accidentally given away.</p>
<p>“Potter! Get back here!” Draco took off after him. </p>
<p>The problem was, Harry didn’t know where he was going or what he was looking for. He passed stack after stack of broken chairs and desks, random cushions losing their stuffing and shelves full of torn and molding books. There were many small pathways like the one he was on that branched away and he took a wider one that veered right. </p>
<p>“Potter! You imbecile! You have no idea—” Draco stopped short.</p>
<p>Harry had stopped in a small clearing. They were surrounded on all sides by the Room’s decrepit items. Even the path they had entered from was hard to orient. There was a tall black cabinet with fine detailing and rune work etched into it pushed to one side and a small rickety wooden chair with Draco’s school robe draped over it. He must have forgotten it when he was leaving. There were books littered all over the floor. New texts with advanced runes, pages open and annotated lay grouped together. More battered shelving and few rolls of carpet made the base of one pile that towered high above them with chests and multiple crates full of trinkets stacked together. </p>
<p>“What is all this Malfoy? What are you working on for Him?”</p>
<p>Harry’s tone was less aggressive than before, but it was the wrong thing to say. Malfoy was livid.</p>
<p>“Saint Potter,” Draco was stood blocking the only exit. He had his wand held steady aimed at Harry. “Got me all figured out, eh Potter? …You know Nothing!”</p>
<p>Draco sent a spell flying in Harry’s direction so quickly Harry almost didn’t block it. He threw up a shield just in time and it was deflected. He fired back and Draco was forced to try to find cover. He dove behind the rolls of carpet leaning against the tower. Their duel went on, spells flying past and crashing into the walls and debris around them. Draco fired one last spell, an Expelliarmus. Harry, who was recovering from nearly having his head blown off, was surprised as his wand flew from his hand. Draco caught it and smirked. He might have attempted a snarky remark but Harry charged at him intent on prying his wand from Malfoy’s fingers if he had to. For the second time that night Harry tackled Draco and they flew backwards into the rugs Malfoy had been using for cover.</p>
<p>They toppled to the ground and the heavy looking chests and crates started to fall around them. Large and small items were raining around them; Harry could see it all as if in slow motion. He didn’t have his wand. If he had had his wand, he thought, then he could have cast a charm to protect them from being crushed to death under the weight of decades worth of broken and forgotten things. </p>
<p>He’d landed on top of Draco. Harry was sprawled across Malfoy’s stomach when he felt a trickle of what felt like sand fall across his neck and over his head. He looked down and saw that it was sand. All over Harrys hair and clothes and falling onto Malfoys chest and face was tiny specks of glittering sand. As Harry moved to sit up Draco’s hand moving like a shot unbalance him. He barely has a chance to see a round piece of metal with markings he can’t make out before there is a bright near blinding light and the world implodes on itself.</p>
