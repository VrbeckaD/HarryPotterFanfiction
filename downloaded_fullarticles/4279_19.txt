<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p>When Draco walked into the common room after Easter break he immediately grabbed a few bottles of fire-whiskey and joined the circle of despondent Slytherins sitting by one of the fireplaces in various forms of dismay. Opening a bottle and drinking from it passing it to their left became a reflex for the seventh-year Slytherins before any had worked up the urge to say anything about their thoughts, however dark, <strike>or light, for that matter</strike>.</p><p>Eventually, Blaise arrived via floo and joined in bringing his own bottle of alcohol, something that glitters in your favorite color as you hold it, a gift from his mother to pass around when things start getting interesting or depressing his mother had said it works for either.</p><p>"I don't want to be on this side of the war," Draco said as he passed the bottle to Pansy. "We're losing, and it's stupid anyway." </p><p>Blaise nodded, "Let's trade secrets then?" </p><p>"My father is hitting my mum again. I wish he would just, stop breathing sometimes ya'know? Or maybe not, I don't know." Theo drank from the bottle he'd been handed and passed it to Blaise.</p><p>"I know a spell for that. <em>Sufoxis</em>. Comes in handy when your uncle tries to sneak in a strapping young man's rooms too," Blaise said as he pulled Theo in close as he drank and spoke, "Mother gave me this to share with my closest friends so that I can have blackmail on them if necessary, and yet I am telling them that I was created with a ritual between her and my other mother. Irony." </p><p>"Ah, to be young and fucking dumb!" Daphne shouted from on top of both Crabbe and Goyle's laps, apparently, they're quite cushiony and warm. Daphne always was a bit of a lightweight.</p><p>Slowly the children diverged their fears, honestly, and completely. "I saw Voldemort kill Warrington. A slow death curse was on the tip of my tongue before father pulled me from the room." Pansy said</p><p>"I let Git live. I knew who he was but, I just, I couldn't ya'know?" He gulped the shiny liquid down his friend had given him down, "I've lived with that no-nose moldy egg for long enough, gods know who would even be able to survive a world ran by him, let alone who would <em>want</em> to."</p><p>In the morning, when Severus snuck in to check on his children he found there was a pile of his oldest Slytherin <strong>children</strong> passed out in front of the fire.</p><p>These children, because that's what they were, should probably be woken up, and sent to their rooms, but Severus too was tired, tired of this war, of bad decisions, and wrong-sides, and dark lords, and genocide.</p><p>Tired of being evil, tired of being the bad guy, just infinitely tired.</p><p>He wondered if the children would enjoy the reading material he had left them.</p><p>But if he stayed he was well aware that he would never willingly leave.</p><p>So he pulled his cloak tight and left the Slytherins to sort themselves for once. Though before he left the room he noted that they looked almost like a particularly dangerous pit of snakes infuriated by their masters and preparing to strike, idly he wondered if these children would be the ones to attack.</p><p>They are, after all, the future, and at this point, the only ones who can truly do anything to save it.</p><p>Too heavy a burden to ask children to shoulder he has long-since figured out the hard way, but perhaps, together, they will overcome it.</p><p>If nothing else a man can hope.</p><p>Maybe he could think of something to do if he'd just let himself have a bit of hope.</p>
<hr/><p>"Fuck." Said at least three Slytherins who'd woken up with headaches, tangled up in blankets, and limbs, and gods know what else.</p><p>Slowly everyone else woke up as well to see parchment of ideas they'd put together still in front of them with nearly illegible writing, candy wrappers are thrown about, cold bowls of spilled soup, empty bottles of whatever they'd gotten their hands on their side. The Slytherins took turns showering, handing out hangover cures, and changing clothes coming downstairs to see everything except their plans and an odd book had gone back to whence it came and whatnot.</p><p>"Hey, why don't we actually put some of these to work," Blaise said from where he'd been reading through the pile, burning whatever was useless, "I mean, none of us are happy with where we are right?" At the nods from various Slytherins, and murmurs of agreement from the rest everyone sat down, parsing out what was stupid, what was the last chance idea, and what just might work.</p><p>And thus marks the third time in a century an entire house skipped out on classes. </p><p>(The first one being when Tim Barvolo Ridiculously Creepy But Also Hot Dude let out the basilisk, the Slytherins stayed in the safety of their common rooms. The second when <strike>James Fleamont Potter</strike> The Mauraders made the Ravenclaws sleep before NEWTs in return for a certain book about a certain strain of human transfiguration so to speak from a certain middle-aged professor who happened to be able to shift into a cat occasionally. Hypothetically of course. Many students credit those four boys for the reason they passed, but none would accept the credit. They just locked a couple of doors after all.)</p>

Many months later</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>"The DA got the food, and the water thing is flowing fine, the merfolk have agreed to cast fresh water magic on the flow, everyone is doing good on the lesson plans from Potter for us to teach everyone, you were right to bring up dark spells Pans, thank you." Draco handed some papers that needed looking over to Theo and Adrian, still walking around checking on everyone, "Good news my friends, we've got word from them, and the diadem has been secured." Cheers erupted all around,</p><p>"Bad news," Groans erupted all around, and Draco smirked a little. "We're still behind in the Harry trap-" Pansy cut him off. "It's not a trap if it helps him Draak." Draco rolled his eyes. "It is if it traps him, now hush. Has anyone got anything new to add on that front?" </p><p>The Slytherins had heard about the Horcruxes from their parents and found that destroying them was moderately easy depending on how desperate, or talented one was.</p><p>"Yes Vincent, what've you got?" Vincent Crabbe had been writing his reluctant death eater father about Horcruxes as the only adult the children knew they could trust. After all, mister Crabbe had always taken the pureblood <em><strike>and half-blood</strike></em> children in if they needed a hand, they know he's trustworthy, and though The Malfoys and Zabinis would absolutely help, they were far to close for comfort. Nobody likes the older Knotts <strike>for good reason</strike>, and the Parkinsons are under ministry watch for some reason.</p><p>"My da said fiendfyre would definitely destroy a Horcrux, and he told me the instructions to start it, but he hasn't found the instructions to stop it yet so that's a good last resort. My da said we should look into goblin rituals, they have cleansing things that young wizards and witches are given to make sure the child is unburdened by foreign magics." Draco nodded and wrote that down on the charmed chalkboard. </p><p>Only the current Slytherins could see it, and none could talk about it outside of safety.</p>
<hr/><p>Sammy, a second-year Slytherin from India had a cousin who spoke parseltongue record a few words so that they could use the chamber of secrets, which they shortly found extended to include a living-quarter big enough to house their entire house (Hogwarts-magic is suspected. Hogwarts The Castle tends to do weird physics and magics defying things with seemingly little to no reason quite often really. She's, and the castle is a she, still upset about the stair thing in third year.) several studies included.</p><p>The chamber was thus cleaned up, fixed up in some places, and reopened, they'd slowly smuggled as many people in as they could, though the general consensus was that they were hidden in the Room of Requirement. An understandable, but incorrect assumption. </p><p>One no-one sought to correct the misconception on.</p>
<hr/><p>On the day of the battle, every fourth year and under were taken to the chamber, and when Harry showed up to see several Slytherins trying to escort them down there he stepped in wand raised at the adults in their way, quickly stopping them in their tracks.</p><p>"There is no safer place within this castle Snape," Harry had really had enough of Snape's shit, he didn't feel like dealing with him right now. "Move." Draco, who'd been watching the interaction between his godfather and his, and Harry noticed an odd glow in his eyes, something not quite, entirely human. He decided to ask later though.</p><p>"Thanks, Potter. Think you could hiss this open? We lost our recording." Remembering that Malfoy had saved his life not long ago he nodded and hissed <em>open</em> to the faucet. He waited around to close the sink after Malfoy, but Malfoy wasn't going in. "Aren't you going in?" Malfoy shook his head and said, "Come on, you've got that sword that kills the Horcuxes right because we found the diadem." Harry followed as he is wont to do.</p><p>"She was right you really do let your guard down around me. Why?" He asked as they walked, quickly and mostly silently, many students waved, Slytherins, Hufflepuffs, Gryffindors, Ravenclaws, it didn't seem to matter, and not for the first time Harry wondered what exactly had been happening while he was gone that had Ginny kissing Blaise before charging to battle, he was surprised though slightly upset she didn't even say hi. Honestly, it's not like they'd essentially become siblings or anything like that. He definitely wasn't all but adopted by second year. </p><p>Draco who could see Harry's face, and thus his pouting <em>I'm-jealous-but-not-gonna-deal-with-it-in-a-healthy-way-because-what-kind-of-person-do-you-think-I-am?-A-healthy-one?</em> face, granted it wasn't his <em>Okay-but-could-you-kiss-me-instead</em> face repeated his question with a shake of his head. </p><p>Harry thought for a second before he answered "You let me live." </p><p>"You did this even when we were kids Potter." He said immediately dismissing Harry's answer.</p><p>"I don't know, you never really felt malicious. Except for that one time, when 'Mione punched you, that was an odd day all around. Besides, I'm well aware he summoned Sirius from the mirror Malfoy, and it wasn't one of us." Draco nodded at the answer, he remembered that day, he'd brewed a potion the exact opposite of Liquid Luck with Severus that morning. </p><p>In other news, he also invented a potion that day. And the towers were shooting the bad luck concoction on all the unsuspecting Death Eaters. Fred and George are brilliant.</p><p>When they arrived in the Room it was nearly empty, and there was a waterfall. "Come on Harry this way." Malfoy pulled the shocked Harry to the waterfall careful not to get wet.</p><p>'Course he still cares what he looks like the ponce, I bet his robe will be in tatters by nights end.' Harry shook his head as he walked, fond amusement that his arch-nemesis is still so, himself even after all that'd happened.</p><p>When Harry stopped under the waterfall he felt tired, so bone tired, it was like the adrenaline that had been ushing him before had drained from him.</p><p>"I'm sorry Harry, but, I can't ask you to die for us," Malfoy said as he carefully used his wand, a backup from his father, to lay him down under the water. "Please don't be mad." Harry's eyes seemed to glow with that odd light yet again as he watched Draco.</p><p>Draco would later swear it felt like his entire being was stripped bare by the darker man's gaze.</p><p>"Please stand back Heir Malfoy." Draco was shocked out of his staring contest and when he looked back Harry's eyes were closed, so he stood back, near the edges of the room as the goblin began the ritual. 'Please let this work.'</p>
<hr/><p>It worked, but Harry still slept for seven hours as expected. Draco was the last line of defense to Harry, and he hoped everything would go according to plan so that he would be unnecessary.</p><p>When Harry started to wake up Draco quickly brought the water over to give him. "Hey, Harry, how're you feeling? Sick? Dizzy? Hot? Cold? G-" Harry interrupted him with a great sigh reminiscent of his house mascot. "Malfoy please shut up, and where are my clothes?"</p><p>Draco, clearly nervous, pointed to the table beside his bed and turned around to give Harry privacy. "The goblins threw the other ones out, but Ginny had these round-up for you. We weren't 100% certain that you would be awake so soon though. Thought you might sleep all day as you tend to do according to your friends. Luna says that's what happens when <em>Ingles</em> get stuck on your magic though." Malfoy said as though he completely believed and accepted this line of logic. Then again Harry can see horses that can only be seen after witnessing death. Maybe being pale and blond and otherworldly enables you to see strange things, who fucking knows with The Wizarding World.</p><p>"I only do that when it's safe we've figured out, there's still a war going on after all. What exactly is going on Malfoy?" Draco pointed to the letter on Harry's table when Harry turned him around.</p><p>While Harry read, and drank the various potions Draco was handing him he considered what he had seen so far. The school was very put together in its attacks, and every minute detail seems to have been thought of. Every move anyone made. 'Who planned it?'</p>
