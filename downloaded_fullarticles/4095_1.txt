    <p>The night the Montgomery boy dies, Remus runs.</p><p>Having been unable to prevent the boy's death, he now can't bear to be anywhere near the werewolves, or the camp. He runs, still half-naked post-transformation, with an energy he didn't know he possessed.</p><p>He's got to get away. He'd crawl out of his own skin if he could.</p><p>He runs, out into the forest, where he's stowed his wand in the hollow trunk of a dead tree.</p><p>Disapparates.</p><p><em> Away,</em> he thinks. <em>Home.</em></p><p>There's only one place in the world he might feel clean again.</p><p>He is not surprised when he opens his eyes to find he is in front of her door. </p>
<hr/><p>She's asleep when she hears knocking.</p><p><em>A knock on the door in the midst of war cannot be a good thing,</em> she thinks. Surprisingly poetic for a tired auror being dragged out of bed at four in the morning.</p><p>To her amazement, it's him.</p>
<hr/><p>She ushers him in, and he is only now becomingly dimly aware that it's so late it's early, and she must've been fast asleep, and he must look terrifying.</p><p>He begins to apologise, but she shushes him, pushing him down onto her bed.</p><p><em>Beds are dangerous</em>, his brain offers, unhelpfully. </p><p>She is doing a great many things at once - lighting candles, summoning a first aid kit, kindling the fire.</p><p>Remus watches her moving in the soft glow of the flames, and thinks he's never loved anyone like he loves her.</p><p>Then he closes his eyes and doesn't think anymore.</p>
<hr/><p>It takes him a long time to come to. He keeps swimming to the surface of consciousness, but every time he drops down again, not ready to face the music. </p><p>When he opens his eyes, it's getting dark. </p><p>It's quiet, it's warm, and he's sleeping in an actual bed again, so he lets his eyelids fall shut once more. The pillows smell like her. </p><p>When he opens his eyes once again, the fire's been lit and she's back. She's moving around the room quietly, laying places at a table he's never seen before, by the hearth. The smell of something warm and meaty wafts over and Remus realises he's starving. </p><p> "'Lo." He manages to croak out, voice hoarser than ever.</p><p>Tonks jumps, dropping the jug she was holding, which shatters and soaks her feet with water. She looks at him with a mix of relief and exasperation.</p><p>Despite himself, he grins. </p>
<hr/><p>She helps him to the table, despite his protestations.</p><p>He's quiet as they eat, but when she reaches towards him to pile his plate a second time he catches her hand and presses a kiss to the inside of her wrist. </p><p>"Thank you." He whispers, his voice still hoarse.</p><p>It's such a small gesture. It's nothing, really, but it's so intimate in its simplicity it makes her heart ache.  </p>
<hr/><p>Later, when he's full and warm and still fuzzy-headed, he watches her, sitting across the table from him.</p><p>Silence has fallen between them, and he watches her fiddle with her glass, rolling its stem round and around in her hand.</p><p>She'd been chatting animatedly just a moment ago, her cheeriness belying the sad droop of her still brown hair. </p><p><em>My being here makes her happy,</em> he thinks.</p><p><em>It's because of you she's colourless in the first place,</em> comes the voice of worn rationality that's been his life-long companion. </p>
<hr/><p>"Thank you." He says again as she begins to move around the room, putting everything back to rights. He tries to get up. "Let me help you."</p><p>"Don't be ridiculous." She pushes him back down by his shoulders, firmly.</p><p>So he watches her, sat by the fire, lulled by her movements. He sits and pretends to himself that this is his life, not a masquerade that will be over by morning.</p>
<hr/><p>Later, he's back in her bed, his head resting on her chest, her hand smoothing his hair away from his face.</p><p>He doesn't care if it's weak, if it would only mean being safe in her arms for the rest of his life. </p><p>He can feel the words tumble out his mouth before he can stop them.</p>
<hr/><p>He wakes at dawn. </p><p>She's still asleep, face and body turned towards him, utterly open to him. </p><p>He shifts away, willing himself not to look at her, as waves of longing wash over him.</p><p>
  <em>Stay with her, be with her. Keep her safe from harm.</em>
</p><p>But it's impossible, so he puts his rags back on, finds his wand, and leaves.</p>
