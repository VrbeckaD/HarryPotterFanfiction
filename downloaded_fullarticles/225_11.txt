          <div class="userstuff"><p>Draco Malfoy took a deep breath. He was a little bit nervous, to be honest. And who wouldn't be? He didn't want to say what he was about to, but--he needed to. He had already put it off long enough. </p><p>"I have to tell you something," he murmured.</p><p>Harry looked up, furrowing dark eyebrows slightly. He sounded serious. </p><p>"Before we get married there's something you should know." Draco continued. </p><p>"Okay," Harry said simply. </p><p>"You can't laugh."</p><p>"I won't!"</p><p>"Promise me," Draco said. </p><p>Harry sighed. But he raised a hand to show him that he meant it. "I promise," he promised. </p><p>"...I don't tan. If I'm left in the sun, I get as red as a tomato."</p><p>Harry blinked. "Well that's pretty anti-climactic," he said, blunt but honest. "Honestly I was expecting something darker... not...redder."</p><p>Draco stood up and glared at him. </p><p>"I don't want to get married anymore!"</p><p>But he was grinning, just a little bit, and that made Harry smile too. </p></div>
