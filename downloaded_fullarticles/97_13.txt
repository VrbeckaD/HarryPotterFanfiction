          <div class="userstuff"><p>Harry was so tired. Tired of running from what he knew he was going to face one day. It was written into him. </p>
<p>Tom Riddle was his fate. <br/>His opposite. <br/>His mirror. </p>
<p>When they touched it was like the heavens singing <br/>Meeting was an accident, a brush of shoulder in Gringotts six years ago when Harry was only thirteen. But he’ll never forget it. <br/>The burning on his side, the telltale sign of a soul-mark appearing. And as Harry quickly glanced back the reddest eyes bore into him. </p>
<p>And he knew then. He was wanted. By someone. But before he could do anything, he was pulled away. </p>
<p>Away. Away. Away.</p>
<p>Always away from his person. </p>
<p>Harry didn’t know then, but it would be years of secret meetings, and rendezvous for him and his lover.</p>
<p>He knew who he was. </p>
<p>Of course, he did, how could he not. But Harry didn’t care what his man did or does. It’s all for Harry. All of it.<br/>Harry just wants to be adored.</p>
<p>This would be the last night he was away from him. Harry had decided that he was going to run away for good.</p>
<p> Defect if you will. </p>
<p>As Harry runs his old family towards his new love, Tom Riddle, the name scarred into his side by fate, he thinks just one thought.</p>
<p>“I’d walk the fire for you”</p></div>
