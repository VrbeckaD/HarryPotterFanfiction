    <p>
  <b>Day One</b>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco blamed Harry Potter for many miserable occurrences in his life, but he could no longer remember a single one -- well, except for maybe his hands.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>See, like many others, Professor Slughorn decided to return to Hogwarts after the war.  Unlike many others, he was there for profit -- selling student-made potions, no less. Naturally, the NEWT level classes were the most profitable.  Draco was sure their seating arrangement was purposeful -- the worst students were paired together, Greg and Weasel, for instance, while Slughorn profited off of their betters.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And that left Draco with Harry Potter.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>While he was loathe to admit it, Potter was a decent brewer.  Perhaps even good. But that didn’t make up for the fact that he was so </span>
  <em>
    <span>fucking</span>
  </em>
  <span> distracting.  Like when Potter cut up roots or stems, he didn’t curl his fingers and </span>
  <em>
    <span>Draco</span>
  </em>
  <span> had to make sure he didn’t slice a finger off.  It would surely be </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span> fault if the Chosen One lost a finger.  Or, after about thirty minutes into lab, Potter would roll up his sleeves and </span>
  <em>
    <span>neglect</span>
  </em>
  <span> to wear his dragonhide gloves.  Honestly, the man was going to scald himself.  Or poison. Or burn.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And it would all be </span>
  <em>
    <span>Draco’s </span>
  </em>
  <span>fault.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter had long fingers, too.  Draco figured he’d be a good piano player.  Not that it mattered.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, when Draco arrived at Hogwarts after break -- he’d crashed at Zabini’s flat, far away from his father -- he considered throwing himself off the astronomy tower, Dumbledore style, before going to class.  Slughorn would surely find it hilarious.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But, of course, he found himself at the back table in the Potions classroom, Potter at his left, trying not to watch as the Chosen One scribbled notes a loose piece of parchment.  Potter’s penmanship was simply terrible, yet watching the formation of each letter was oddly fascinating. Draco, like on most days, neglected to take notes.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He blinked long and hard, finally looking up from Potter’s parchment.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“... and so, thanks to Professor Sprout’s handiwork, each group will be given the next month to brew their own batch of Veritaserum.  Now, I must warn you, this is no small undertaking. I expect you will be spending many extra hours on this class. In addition to being a percentage of your final grade--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Groans rang through the classroom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“--I have decided to add a little extra incentive.”  He paused for effect. “Students who successfully manage to brew this potion in the 28 days allotted will be allowed to use one drop -- just one -- on their partner to ask a single question of their choosing!”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slughorn grinned widely.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco blinked slowly, glancing over at Potter whose hand had stilled.  This could not possibly be happening.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Perhaps Draco could </span>
  <em>
    <span>accidentally</span>
  </em>
  <span> pour an entire vial of rose water into their cauldron to diminish the effects…  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But sir,” he heard Granger call, distantly.  “Is that legal?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slughorn chuckled.  “Oh, it’ll be fine, my dear, just fine.” She tried to interrupt, but he cut her off.  “Now, I suggest you and your partner get to work! The clock is ticking...”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco waited for as long as possible to talk to Potter, pretending to thumb through his book to read the instructions, but his finger caught the edge of the parchment, ripping skin.  He cursed, sucking on the wound. Fuck it -- he didn’t need to read the instructions anyway.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, Potter turned to him.  “Well, I guess we should gather ingredients…” Potter trailed off, eyes on the finger still in his mouth.  His eyebrows raised.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Paper cut,” Draco supplied.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco rolled his eyes. “... So we should probably go to the greenhouse--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good idea.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“-- gather things from the potions closet --”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“ -- and get a room.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Er, what?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco narrowed his eyes.  “To make the potion. We can’t do it all in class periods -- Veritaserum is a very complicated potion that takes a lot of time to complete.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right, yeah, Slughorn said something about that.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco grabbed a scrap of parchment and started scribbling down ingredients.  He didn’t look at the recipe once.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why don’t you get these from the stores and I’ll handle the vicious plants,” he said, thrusting the list at Potter.    </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter frowned.  “You sure you don’t need help?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you ever worked with a Slimming Merribite?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“... No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve got it.”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span></p><p>
  <span> “So you have, then?  Worked with one?” Potter asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco grimaced. “We, ah, had a greenhouse at the manor.  Before… everything.”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” he said.  “Right.” Potter ducked away towards the storage closets, black hair flipping over his eyes.  Since the war, he’d finally gotten rid of those stupid glasses he always wore. Now he wore some sort of muggle device that sat </span>
  <em>
    <span>in</span>
  </em>
  <span> his eye.  Draco shook his head as he left for the greenhouse.  Barbaric.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>… </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At lunch, Draco received an owl -- a little brown and white barn owl with a heart-shaped face, its huge brown eyes staring up at him longingly.  He rolled his eyes, feeding it a sausage before he untied the note attached to its claw. It nibbled at his finger and flew off, contented.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy frowned at him.  “Who’s that from?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do believe that is none of your business.  Even so, I have no idea.” Draco stuffed the note in his pocket for later.  If Pansy got wind of something even mildly interesting, it would be known all over the school by sundown.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pouted. “How about you, Zabini?  Anything interesting?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Across the table, Zabini’s hand covered his forehead, plate untouched below him as he read a piece of parchment.  He groaned. “Fuck, ah… My step-dad’s dead. Dragonpox, this time. Not exactly original.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Salazar’s pants… that sucks, mate,” Draco said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sighed. “Yeah, it does.  He was nice -- sent me chocolate frogs for Christmas.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy’s eyes were wide.  “Isn’t this the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fifth</span>
  </em>
  <span> husband she’s killed?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pansy!” Daphne elbowed her in the ribs.  “You can’t just say that!” She hissed.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blaise just snorted.  “Allegedly, this is the sixth husband.”  He crumpled up the paper and shoved it in his pocket.  “I’ve got class,” he mumbled before exiting the hall in a quiet storm.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Me too,” Draco said, taking Zabini’s exit as his own opportunity to leave -- Pansy likely had enough entertainment for the morning, and wouldn’t go following him around the castle.  At least, he hoped.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he was safely on his way to History of Magic, he pulled out the letter and frowned, recognizing the sloppy penmanship.  But that wasn’t what stopped him cold. Potter had taken it upon himself to find a room for their Veritaserum.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco hadn’t been to the Room of Requirement since Vince died.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The worst thing was that he couldn’t back down now.  He cursed himself for not taking the initiative soon enough.  Just thinking about that corridor on the seventh floor made his mouth dry, made his heart pound at his ribs.  The fire, the cabinet, the death eaters. Potter.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter knew, didn’t he?  He must have realized that Draco would be…  apprehensive about returning to that secret door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco scowled.  He could play this game.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He continued on, forcing his heart rate to slow.  Now he certainly wasn’t going to sabotage their potion.  No, no, no -- now he wanted his single question.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But as Draco approached the last corner on the seventh floor, it felt exactly like sixth year, like nothing had changed.  Like he was going to fix the cabinet, destroy the school, kill Dumbledore.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No -- the Dark Lord was dead, the Death Eaters vanished, the cabinet destroyed by fiendfyre.  But so was Vince.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco closed his eyes.  Sure, they weren’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>friends</span>
  </em>
  <span>, per say, but Draco had felt a certain responsibility for Vince.  It was Draco’s fault he was dead, Draco’s fault Greg wandered the halls at night, never sleeping.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sucked in a breath and turned the corner.  His wand was out, but he didn’t even notice.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everything was as it had been, the door perfectly materialized on the wall without even a thought.  He already knew what would be inside and his heart pounded ever louder with each step he took.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The doors opened without his bidding, swinging wide, sending a wave of oppressive heat crashing into his body.  The fire burned bright as ever, hot as hell, shapes moving within its mass and all he could think was he left Vince there to die.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Waves of heat crashed over him and he found himself being pulled in.  Despite the heat, despite the fear, despite the voice in the back of his head screaming his name, Draco took a step forward, and another, and another.  When he crossed the threshold the doors would close, trapping him inside the place where nothing was hidden. He could find Vince, he could beg his forgiveness. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe the flames would forgive him, if no one else would.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sound of his frantic heart grew louder in his head as he took the final step.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But cool wind whipped through him as his body flew back, hitting the floor with a thud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the fuck were you thinking?” A voice cut through the ringing in his ears.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he looked up, the door had disappeared and in its place stood Potter, red-faced and panting.  The anger in his face gave way to something else as Draco fought for words.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh </span>
  <em>
    <span>shit</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Potter turned back to the now blank wall.  “I thought the Room would save us some time setting up lab, but Godric…” He ran a hand through his hair, eyes on the ground.  “I guess I forgot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco couldn’t help the strangled laugh that bubbled up from his throat.  “Forgot, Potter? You forgot?” He stood, his guilt giving way to anger. “It’d be easy for you, wouldn’t it?” he growled, and yanked up his left sleeve.  Potter just stared.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You see this?  </span>
  <em>
    <span>This</span>
  </em>
  <span> ensures that I will always be blamed, or suspected, or punished for anything that goes wrong in this god-forsaken country!  I don’t have the luxury of forgetting. Do you know how hard it is to abandon your family, Potter? That is a choice I had to make -- my mother did nothing wrong, and yet I can’t speak to her without the Ministry breathing down my neck.  My father, he’s a bastard, but he’s my father. And now he’s locked in Azkaban. Of course, you wouldn’t understand that, would you? Your parents are in the fucking ground.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco expected Potter to yell, or at least to flinch, but he was silent.  He scoffed and turned away, walking briskly in the opposite direction. Potter didn’t say a thing as Draco turned the corner, eyes suspiciously wet.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>… </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco supposed he really had a thing for breaking down in bathrooms.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’d gone to ask Slughorn for a group change, to work alone, to do anything that didn’t involve looking Potter in the eyes, but of course Slughorn refused.  The bastard probably knew he’d have more potion to sell if he just split them up. But no -- Slughorn wanted to watch Draco suffer. He was sure of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco splashed his face with cold water, waiting for the red veins in his eyes to fade.  Then, he heard a soft creek behind him. The door. Draco cursed, ducking into a stall. </span>
  <em>
    <span>If it’s fucking Potter -- </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Tucking his wand in his sleeve, Draco emerged in a whirlwind, but it was just a fourth year Hufflepuff.  The boy blanched and ran into a stall, practically whimpering. Draco scoffed. What a waste of space.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>By dinner time that evening, Draco had almost convinced himself everything was normal until that bloody owl intruded once again on his meal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That one again?” Pansy asked, eyes glittering.  “You must have an admirer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco scoffed.  “Please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why’s that so hard to believe?”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span></p><p>
  <span>“Well hm, let’s see… there was that one time I bullied every Muggleborn in this school, became a death eater, attempted to assassinate the headmaster, caused untold destruction to school property and knowingly committed treason against the government.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Exactly!  You know, a lot of people are into bad boys.  There’s been some juicy talk in the girl’s dormitory--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Blaise interrupted.  “I’m eating. Could you just… not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco frowned.  “Yeah, I’m good too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, come on!”  Pansy whined. “No one ever listens to my gossip!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Daphne snorted.  “Pansy, sweetie, the entire school listens to your gossip.  Not that you give them much of a choice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, but my </span>
  <em>
    <span>friends</span>
  </em>
  <span> don’t.  Really, you should show some appreciation for the woman who buys you booze.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blaise shook his head.  “Pansy, my queen, savior of Slytherin house quidditch parties, my comrades and I greatly appreciate your efforts to promote house intoxication.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pansy pretended to tip her hat and continued on about her new girlfriend, but Draco was too busy scowling at Potter’s messy script to pay attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Malfoy,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Despite how circumstances seem at the moment, the room situation truly was a fuck-up on my part.  I’m really sorry about that. If you want to switch partners, I get it. If not, I’ve got a cauldron in the fifth-floor classroom next to the portrait of Eros and Psyche.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>-Harry</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco laughed mirthlessly.  He didn’t have much of a choice, it seemed.  But, if he had to work with Potter, he might as well avoid him as much as possible.  That evening was the first quidditch match of the new year: Gryffindor vs. Slytherin.  He could easily slip out unnoticed and complete the first stages of the potion.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco sighed.  He hadn’t played quidditch since he quit in sixth year to work on the cabinet.  He found himself missing the wind in his hair, the adrenaline of competition, and, of course, the chance to beat Potter.  But he doubted they’d let him back. He wouldn’t lower himself to begging.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He dodged his fellow Slytherins as they filed out to the quidditch pitch, turning instead towards the dungeons, where he collected his Slimming Merribite vines and a bottle of Firewhiskey from the case he kept disillusioned under his bed for bad days.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he made it up the winding staircases to the fifth floor, he scowled at the painting of the two lovers.  It was rather seductive for a school full of pubescent teenagers, Draco thought -- Psyche laid bare, wisps of cloth barely covering her body, as she reached up to Eros who cupped her head and breast, his majestic wings spread outward.  The detail was striking, the lighting bright despite the age of the painting. Draco, however, wasn’t a fan of that particular myth.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His displeasure deeped when he opened the door to the classroom to find it already occupied.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Potter?”  Draco’s scowl deepened.  “What are you doing in here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Er, well I’m… stirring.”  He nodded to the cauldron where his </span>
  <em>
    <span>gloveless</span>
  </em>
  <span> hand was stirring the base counterclockwise.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Potter, what are you doing </span>
  <em>
    <span>here</span>
  </em>
  <span>, as in not on the quidditch pitch.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shrugged.  “I quit before break.  The whole thing just seemed… trivial after everything, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not particularly.” Draco dropped the bag of greens and on the table next to their ingredients.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You miss it, then?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco didn’t respond -- he was evaluating the color of Potter’s base.  It was deep blue. Of course it was perfect. Or maybe not -- maybe it was cyan.  Draco squinted.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why didn’t you join up again?”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span></p><p>
  <span>Draco resisted the urge to groan and die.  “Why do you think? Use your common sense for once.” He sneered.  “You know that most Slytherins aren’t just okay with the fact I conspired with the Dark Lord to murder the headmaster.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dumbledore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know his fucking name,” Draco growled, tipping his head back, a deep burning already threatening his eyes.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco pulled out the Firewhiskey and slammed it down on the table.  Potter jumped at the noise, glaring up at him.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco forced himself to take a deep breath, cooling the anger and rage and fear threatening to bubble over.  He never had the chance to talk about what happened that night -- his parents weren’t exactly viable options, and the Slytherins tended to avoid that particular subject.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Chosen One shook his head.  “Look, Malfoy --”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just shut up about it, Potter.  Let’s just get this over with -- therapy isn’t part of the deal.”  He uncorked the Firewhiskey and took a swig. Then, he motioned for Potter to scoot over as he tended to the next steps.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see self-medicating </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> a part of the deal.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jealous, Potter?” Draco sneered, swishing the liquid around in its bottle.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He snorted.  “You wish.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Somehow the pair managed to work in an only mildly tense silence.  As Draco added in the last bits of dried jade vine, turning the potion to a fluorescent blue, Potter packed his bag.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve got a DADA quiz tomorrow, so I better get going.  You staying here?”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span></p><p>
  <span>Draco nodded absently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll leave the potions book with you, then”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Take it.  I don’t need it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter raised his eyebrows.  “So you </span>
  <em>
    <span>have</span>
  </em>
  <span> made this before, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco scoffed.  “Subtle, Potter.”  When it seemed he would wait until Draco gave him a real answer, Draco continued, eyes narrowed.  “The only thing this needs to do is simmer for twelve hours. Unlike some, I don’t need directions to figure that part out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco’s lips quirked.  “Please. Your pet Weasel would have to look up ‘simmer’ in the dictionary.  Frankly, he’s incapable of making it into the Auror Academy on merit -- he’ll have to use you in place of an application.”  Draco strolled around his table, hand casually in his pockets. Potter was fuming. “And, of course, the Ministry would do anything for the Chosen One.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Potter growled, striding towards him.  “You have no right-- ”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have fame and glory -- you could ask for any job in the ministry </span>
  <em>
    <span>today</span>
  </em>
  <span> and they would give it to you.  Frankly, I don’t know why you’re still here.  If I walked into the ministry, I would likely be arrested.  I need to get seven O’s on my NEWTS to even be </span>
  <em>
    <span>considered</span>
  </em>
  <span> for a position in the entirety of Britain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You made a choice, Malfoy,” Potter said.  “You made a choice, and now you have to live with it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t have a choice!  Can you honestly tell me that if your parents were alive, you would abandon them?  That you would abandon your family, perhaps to face them on the other side of a battlefield, can you honestly tell me that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would do what was right--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You would do what was necessary!  You would do what was necessary to stay with your family, to protect the people you care about, even if that meant fighting for a maniac.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You could have changed their minds, Malfoy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He laughed.  “You’ve met my father, how do you think he would respond to that?”</span>
  <span><br/>
</span></p><p>
  <span>“Then I don’t understand how you could have stayed!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why did you stay with the Dursleys?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?  How do you know about that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Draco rolled his eyes.  “I know Pansy Parkinson.  Why did you stay with the Dursleys?  Why didn’t you leave when you were older, report them to child services, or hell, stay with a neighbor?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Er, Dumbledore--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You had plenty of opportunities to leave before the headmaster told you to stay in that hellhole.  When did you realize they were abusive?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What does that have to do with anything?” Potter growled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just answer the fucking question!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Dursleys weren’t abusive, there were just...”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yes, they were so very misunderstood, forcing a child into indentured servitude and Salazar knows what else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you saying?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m saying many people in abusive relationships don’t realize they’re in an abusive relationship, or if they do, they justify it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And when did you become so fucking insightful?”</span>
  <span>
</span></p><p>
  <span>“That’s not the point, Potter, and you know it.  You can’t just blame me for loving my fucking father even though he believed that propaganda shit!”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even though he killed?  Murdered behind a mask?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can you say with complete confidence that your parents never killed someone for the Order, Potter?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck off.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll take that as a no.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I said fuck off.  They would never kill someone like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bollocks!”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Stupefy!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Protego.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The spell bounced off his shield charm and hit the wall with a deafening boom.  When Draco recovered from the shock blast, Potter had already fled. </span>
