    <p>Two figures were walking the streets of London. They were quite obviously foreigners, with their accented words and their strange appearances. The smaller of the two had hair the color of spun gold and eyes a similar hue, and was dressed in obnoxious red and leather, while the other donned a full body suit of armor, and was carrying two suitcases. It was an unnatural scene, and many stopped and stared. The two figures paid no attention, however, as they were used to the stares. And so they continued their foreign conversation, that had the smaller gesturing wildly as they spoke.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>It defies all the laws of alchemy!</em>” Edward Elric exclaimed with a wide gesture of his arms, to a brother who had already heard this protesting many times before. “<em>There is no equivalence! I read through a few of the textbooks, and they can change one thing to another with no regards to its components!</em>”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His brother, Alphonse, sighed, shaking his armored head as Edward continued rambling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>Brother, you’re making a scene.</em>” He interrupted, in the very specific tone of voice he used only for Ed. The blond boy stopped mid-rant, and huffed childishly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>Yeah, yeah. I get it. I’ll shut up now.</em>” Ed told his brother, in that just-barely-softer-than-usual tone of voice he reserved for his brother (and, though he would not admit it, that pretty Xingese prince that he had found annoyingly endearing.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The two walked in relatively quiet companionship, occasionally commenting on things that caught their eye - the technology mostly, everything was just so <em>advanced</em> outside of Amestris - until they reached their destination. It was a run down pub, with a a hanging wooden sign with a faded cauldron and equally faded, calligraphic text that read, with a bit of concentration, <em>The Leaky Cauldron</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>This is where the headmaster said we would be staying, right?</em>” Alphonse asked, looking down at his brother for confirmation. Ed nodded, staring up at the sign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>Yeah, that’s what the old man said. Come on,</em>” He replied, looking around (wasn’t this place supposed to be warded against - what did the old man call them, <em>muggles</em>? - non magical people? wouldn’t people be weirded out by two people just disappearing or something?) before twisting the knob, pushing the pub’s squeaky door open and entering, Alphonse following close behind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The two, led by Ed, approached the bar, where a balding, honest looking man was standing, cleaning a glass. He looked up (or down, as Ed was most definitely shorter than him by a bit) at Ed, then up at Alphonse, and seemed to already know who the two were.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re Edward and Alphonse Elric, correct?” He asked. Ed nodded hesitantly, and the man continued. “Albus already told me about you two, there’s already a room set up for you upstairs. Here’s the key.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Thank you.” Al said as Ed grabbed the key in question, heading to the rickety stairs that surely led up to the rooms. Ed lead the way, scanning the room numbers for the one that matched the one on the tag attached to the key. Halfway down the hall they found the room in question, and Edward unlocked the door, pushing it open. It was a plain, bare room - wooden flooring with not a carpet in sight, two beds on opposite sides of a small window. There was a door to the side that presumably led to a bathroom. A dresser with a lamp on it, as well as a simple, padded chair were the only other things in the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The blond alchemist made his way over to one of the beds, not even bothering to shrug his signature long, obnoxiously red coat off before he flopped down on it, legs dangling over the edge as he propped himself up with his arms. He looked over at his brother - who had just set the suitcases at the foot of Ed’s bed - and grinned. This was such a <em>strange</em> situation to be in, even with everything that had already been going on in his life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(At least everything else could be explained, but this was <em>magic</em>.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He, the absolute <em>child</em> he was, couldn’t help but wonder, for a moment, what kind of mischief he could pull had he been a wizard. Then, his grin falling, he couldn’t help but wonder if this magic could help restore Alphonse’s body. He didn’t really care about his limbs anymore - he just wanted to fix this mistake and get his brother back to normal. Hogwarts had an extensive library, the old man had said, maybe he could find something there?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was then reminded of something else the old man had said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>“</em>How,<em>” Edward had asked, automail hand resting on his hip as he regarded the headmaster, “</em>Am I to keep from boredom, in the what, week and a half between my departure for London and my arrival at this magic school of yours? I will surely finish the basic books you gave me on the classes being taught before even one week is up.<em>”</em></p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p><em>Dumbledore had laughed, eyes twinkling, as he stared down at the young prodigy. “</em>There is a bookstore in Diagon Alley, which is accessible from where you will be staying. I do believe there are many a book that you would find interesting.<em>”</em></p>
<p>
  <em> </em>
</p>
<p>Edward sat up, jumping off the bed as his grin reappeared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>Hey Al, I’m gonna go find that bookstore Dumbledorf mentioned, see if there’s anything interesting there.</em>” He told his brother, heading towards the door. “<em>You wanna come with me</em>?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His brother shook his head, sitting down clunkily by the suitcases, opening one of them to reveal a bunch of books.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>I’m gonna reread some of the books Mr. Dumbledore gave us, I really liked the one about magical creatures.</em>”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>Alright. I’ll try and bring you something back, then.</em>”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>Have fun, don’t hurt anyone for calling you short!</em>”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ed didn’t respond, but he made sure to slam the door shut, <em>hard</em>, causing the walls to rattle. He heard Alphonse laughing behind the door, and he stomped indignantly down the hall, and then down the stairs, scowling the whole way. He was <em>not</em> short.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was only when he had reached the foot of the stairs when he realized he had no idea how to <em>get</em> to Diagon Alley. All the questions he had asked the old man, and this important question wasn’t one of them. He wanted to hit himself in the head. (He didn’t.) “Fuck.” He said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A kid, a short, skinny thing who could be no more than like, thirteen who was sitting nearby with a mug of hot chocolate in his hands turned to look at him, staring at him with a raised eyebrow partially hidden by his mess of black hair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Are you okay?” The kid asked, and Ed shook his head, frustrated beyond relief.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>No</em>, no I am not. I just realized I don’t even know how to get to the stupid Diagon Alley, let alone where it is.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh.” The kid replied, taking a drink of his hot chocolate. “I could help you, I know how to get there.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Would you?” Ed asked. The kid nodded. “Thanks, I guess. That is awfully nice of you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No problem. I don’t have anything to do anyway.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ed nodded as the kid finished his drink, setting it down on the table and standing up. He walked to a back door, and then opened it. Ed followed him, hands shoved in the pockets of his coat. He watched as the kid took out a stick - a wand, the old man had called them - and tapped a very specific brick in the brick wall.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Ed noticed that it was the third brick to the left, just above the trashcan.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The wall began to pull apart, bricks moving until an archway had appeared. Through it, a bustling street could be seen, full of witches and wizards alike.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ed followed the kid through, staring around at the magic alley. There were shops everywhere, people chatting everywhere, and it was so <em>vibrant</em>. He’d never seen a place like this - even Rush Valley hadn’t been this colorful and bright, it was just mostly automail.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Pretty cool, right?” The kid asked, as Ed turned to look at him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah, I suppose.” He replied, his golden eyes returning to the kid. “Oi, what’s your name, kid?” The boy frowned a bit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m not a kid. I’m Harry.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You are like what, thirteen? Definitely a kid. The name is Ed.” The blond said, rolling his eyes as he began to walk away, determined to find the bookstore. This also, coincidentally, happened to end the conversation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ed, satisfied, made his way through the bustling alley, ignoring the various conversations that were going on as he searched for the bookstore, looking through windows for the telltale signs of a bookshop.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He finally found what he was looking for - a cluttered looking bookshop by the name of Flourish and Blotts - and entered the shop with barely contained childlike glee. Oh, how he loved bookshops. The attendant - a girl with bright blue twin puffs of hair and darker skin - seemed busy, trying to wrangle a monstrous looking book out of a cage filled with several others, the book trying to bite at her thick leather gloves, seemingly for a student. He ignored that, instead diving straight into the various shelves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He didn’t know how long he spent, looking through the books and picking out the ones he wanted. He ended up with a sizable stack when he finally emerged from the shelves, barely visible behind the books as he made his way over to the counter. It was still bright out, he noticed, so he had not been in there a horribly long time, which honestly was a relief because he wasn’t too sure he wanted to leave his brother alone for too long, especially in such a foreign place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He set the stack of books down on the counter, rummaging through his pockets for the bag of money he usually brought with him as the attendant rung up his books. Then he froze, realizing that wizards definitely had a different currency, and he had yet to exchange any of his cens to European currency, let alone wizarding currency.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>Fucking hell</em>,” He murmured to himself, hastily asking the attendant to hold the books for him real quick because he had to go do something <em>very important</em>. Then he ran out of the store, his footsteps mismatched. He paused when he realized he had <em>no</em> idea where the wizarding bank was, if there even was one here, and looked around, trying to see over people’s heads. He noticed a huge, very obvious, white building, and figured he should head that way. So he did, and when he was close enough to the building he noticed a sign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gringotts Bank.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Blessing his usual terrible luck, he entered the massive bank, noticing right away that, sitting at the many tall desks, were some sort of not-human creatures that reminded him severely of Chimeras. He walked up to one of the desks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Excuse me,” He asked, steel in his voice, “But do you do conversions with Amestrian currency?” The... thing looked down at him (something he did <em>not</em> like) with a strange look, but said nothing as it pointed to the right.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That is a matter for Gerlnak. Four desks down.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ed nodded and thanked the creature, then approached the appropriate desk, repeating his question. As it turned out, they <em>did</em> do conversions with Amestrian currency, and so he pulled out his bag of cens. Perhaps he could phone Colonel Bastard later and ask him to convert some of his research funds into wizarding money. He got the money converted, and left the bank.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He returned to the bookshop, apologizing to the attendant, and payed for the books, deciding he was done with this magic alley for the day and began to head back to the wall he came from. He didn’t exactly know how he was going to get the archway to open up again, but after asking someone to do it for him (using the excuse that his hands were <em>very</em> full right now) he was back at the Leaky Cauldron.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As he was ascending the steps, he thought he could hear someone calling his name, but he continued anyways because honestly he wanted to put those books down. And then eat. Eating sounded wonderful right now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He returned to the room, greeting Al as he set the books down on the dresser, carefully pulling out the ones he picked out for his brother and giving them to him. Satisfied, he told his brother he was going down to get some food, and returned to the bar.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then promptly froze when he saw that Harry kid from earlier, talking to a very familiar prince.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ling!” He exclaimed, golden eyes widening as he spotted his annoying(ly endearing) friend. “Ling?” He repeated quickly, a more questioning tone in his voice now. Was this really Ling, or was it the Homunculus? He proved to be Ling, as the prince stood quickly, tackling Ed in a hug with a grin. The alchemist froze momentarily, but relaxed, because this was his friend, who he had missed dearly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” He asked, pushing the Xingese prince off of him with a faint blush that was barely noticeable under his sea of freckles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I followed you.” Ling replied, that stupid smile still on his face. Ed blinked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You <em>what?</em>” He asked, slipping into Amestrian mid-sentence, his voice rising as he processed the words.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>I followed you. I was curious, and Greed wasn’t in control.</em>” The prince told him, almost pouting. Ed stared at him in shock, like he was a total dumbass (which Ling was,) and then promptly facepalmed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>Ling, you idiot! What were you thinking?</em>” He asked. “<em>I’m going to a fucking magic school in a week and there aren’t any trains that leave back to Amestris that soon! What are you going to do when I’m gone?</em>”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ling stared at him like <em>he</em> was the fucking idiot, and then laughed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>I’ll be following you, of course!</em>”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>No! No you won’t be - what if it’s found out you’re there, huh? You’ll get in trouble and I’ll get in trouble and- and it’s a fucking magic school! With lots of magic and shit!</em>”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ling laughed again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“<em>Aww, are you worried? Don’t be, I’ll be fiiiine.</em>” He said teasingly. Ed huffed, turning away, his face <em>totally</em> not bright red, and stomped his way back up the stairs, ignoring Ling calling after him as he made his way back to his room, slamming the door behind him and ignoring Alphonse’s inquisitive head tilt, in favor of falling face-down on the bed he had claimed as his.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He didn’t realize he had fallen asleep until he was waking up the next morning.</p>
