    <p>There once was a boy, who was born to a small yet happy family. The mother after having had unfortunate complications during her pregnancy, was told never to have another child lest she wished for an early grave. The father, dreaming of a large family would have to be content with his one and only child, and as such they lived together in their quiet little farm in the middle of the quaint yet unpredictably weathered English countryside, until such time as the boy was of age for school. </p><p>The boy's name was Severus Snape.</p><p>Severus would effectively grow up in a lower middle income setting, though his life was simple, it was happy, with both of his parents being more than he could ever ask for. Yes there were no other children for him to play with for kilometres around, however this did not deter him from using his imagination, which was inspired by the simple ideal lifestyle he was growing up in, to formulate new ways of satiating the ever monotonous boredom that a child of seven years old would be forced to endure. </p><p>Nonetheless, he found himself one day looking at an odd sight, he had met a girl, and not just any girl, but a red-haired, crying, damsel in distress like girl, you know, like the ones in one of those clich√© story books his mother used to read to him as a child with the pictures? Yeah, she looked similar to that. Except instead of wearing a dress, she was wearing pants and was sitting by the giant tree by the pond that he would go exploring for frogs and fish. He never understood why it made his father happy when he brought home frogs, but apparently he would sell them to the French at a premium and the more he brought back, the more lollies he was awarded, but that was beside the point. He was looking at a girl who was crying at a place he would frequent, and she was his age, so given his experience with kids his age, which was effectively none, he asked.</p><p>"Are you a ghost?" </p><p>Confused, the girl stopped crying and stated, "Uh, no? Why?"</p><p>"It's just I'm the only child for kilometres around, so if you're here alone that must either mean you're an apparition caused by some sort of horrific trauma, or you were abandoned by your family and left to die." He stated. His outlook on life tended to be influenced ever so easily by whatever literature he'd been reading you see, since he's quite an avid reader, however he had recently discovered his mother's old collection of supernatural mystery novels. As young as he was impressionable, he was also incredibly intelligent for his age.</p><p>"Or I could have just recently moved into another farm up the road somewhere and am crying because I'm so new that I lost my way and ended up here." She offered as a more reasonable explanation.</p><p>"That too."<br/>
"My name is Severus, Severus Snape. What's yours?" Severus stated.</p><p>"Well Severus Snape, I'd say it's a pleasure to have met you, however I'm very much in distress over being lost, I don't wish to bring worry to my family, moving here was enough of a stress for them already." She stated.</p><p>Still not knowing her name he offered, "Well, I am a local of the region, perhaps I can be of assistance, afterall when somebody cries, it is the duty of those able to help."</p><p>"Let me guess, The Millennial and I: How to keep up with the ever growing need for political correctness in our modern society?" She asked.</p><p>"Wait, there's a book about that?!" He exclaimed.</p><p>"No, however my grandfather does tend to complain about millennials a lot, so I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it existed with him as the author." She chuckled.<br/>
"My name is Lily by the way, Lily Evans." She finally answered.</p><p>"Well Ms. Evans, where is it exactly do you live?" He asked.</p><p>"A place called the Pembelton Estate." She replied.</p><p>Pembelton? The same Pembelton that owned the largest farm in the local Borough? I mean he wasn't the wealthiest man in the region, but the size of his land wasn't anything to sneeze at, his estate however had to be cut up and sold due to his passing away and not having any heirs, so the Government must have taken it and sold it off in smaller pieces to gain more wealth. I mean he supposed the National Health Service had to be funded somehow.</p><p>"Yes, I'm aware of it, it's literally just past those thick patch of old wood forest trees." He said pointing towards the nearby woodland area.</p><p>"I tried that, however the forest is rather disorienting, and no matter how many times I tried, I always came back to this tree by the pond." She sighed.</p><p>"That's because there are landmarks you have to follow that aren't as apparent as the marked route that I assume you've been following all this time. Here, I'll lead the way." He said as he started marching through the woodland, telling her to come and follow.</p><p>After about fifteen or so minutes they arrived at her home, it was an upper middle class home, however was somewhat of a small mansion when compared to Severus' own home. As thanks, Lily decided to invite Severus over for afternoon tea and introduce him to her family, starting with her mother, father, and finally younger sister.</p><p>"Hello, my name is Severus and I'm the boy who lives on the small farm beyond the woods, it's a pleasure to meet you." He said.</p><p>Lily's mother in turn stated, "My, such a polite young boy. I would like to meet your family too one day, though one preferably later down the week as me and my husband are still pretty busy moving into this lovely new home of ours, however I'm sure the girls would love to play with you." She answered with a polite smile before heading back to arranging the interior of the house.</p><p>And that was the first time that Severus ever met Lily, and how they would eventually form a bond that would cement their status as 'Best Friends' later down the track.</p>
