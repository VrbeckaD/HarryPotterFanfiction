  <u>Prologue</u>
</p><p>While the Hogwarts professors may loath patrolling the corridors during the final shift of the night- a time which was deemed too late for most shenanigans- Minerva enjoyed the peace of it; a boring patrol shift was a good one in her book.</p><p>Walking down the familiar halls however, McGonagall was met with some familiar noises. Minerva had caught students ‘in the act’ before, it never got any less embarrassing for the parties involved, however. Usually, students would conduct such, intimate meetings in their own dormitories, however, inter-house couples were known to make good use of the many empty classrooms the school provided. Reaching the closed door of such an empty classroom Minerva took a deep breath before giving a sturdy knock, “I will give you two minutes to make yourselves decent.”</p><p>After two minutes of rustling and furious whispering McGonagall, true to her word, opened the classroom door to see Draco Malfoy and Beauxbatons Professor Ardoin.</p><p>Tonight was not going to be a boring shift.</p>
