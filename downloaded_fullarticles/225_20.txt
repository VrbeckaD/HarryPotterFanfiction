    <p>She’s four, sitting on the floor, the toddler with bright too wise somber eyes. She giggles as the others cry, she rocks back and forth. Her relatives are terrified of the young girl. As she plays with her toes, a swat and sent back to the cupboard. </p><p>She’s Seven, taught her self to read. Hasn’t set foot in a school, hands curling around the thick hard back tome. Eyes watching from behind round glasses too big for her face. Dressed in scraps, her body small. The fingers nails dark greens, little discarded silver rings decorated her skin and bony fingers. </p><p>She’s nine, running from her cousin and his friends. “Harrie” hunting, they called it. She’s laughing lightly, hands balled into fists. Dancing past people on the streets, a crack in the same glasses she had sense she was six. Shoes too big, skirt too big, shirt too big. Wild bobbed hair black as the night sky. She makes a wrong turn, a first connects with her side. He’ll pay for that. </p><p>She’s eleven, a letter in her hands. The gold colored nails picking at the seal, a curl joke. A man shows up later, tells her she’s a witch. She laughs in his face, tells him he’s wrong. She’s just her, no need for fancy titles. He shows her magic, she stares eyes blank, she finds it funny. Takes her to a magic shop place, gets her school things, a wand for a shop she didn’t bother learning the name of. Holly for the wood,  Phoenix feather for the core. Then when her guide was a bit distracted she wondered down to another shop. Leaving with a Blackthorn and yew wand with a Thunderbird feather for the core. </p><p>She is Eleven and is boarding a train to go to a magic school. She has no friends. Wants new? A red headed male sticks his head in the compartment door, asks if he could sit. She says no. He still sits, she ignores him. Pretends he’s not there. </p><p>Shes Eleven, and meets an Italian Boy. He makes her giggle, if not on purpose. He is kind to her, respects her silences. Let’s her read, and watch. His eyes are the color of her nails, an odd purple. She giggles at that. </p><p>She is Eleven and sits on a stool. A hat placed on her head, he says she has an odd personality. He says he’s put her in Slytherin if he’d didn’t worry for peoples health. </p><p>She is Eleven, has a Purpled eyed, Dark skined Italian friend. She has Killing curse colored eyes, large cracked glasses, inky black hair that goes slightly past her ears. She’s eleven, and the hat yells out Hufflepuff. </p><p> </p>
