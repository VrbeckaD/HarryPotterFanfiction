  <span>“No.”</span>

  <span>“Oh come on, you can’t say that. We’re literally standing at the fireplace. I’ve got floo powder in my hand!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Scorp? What’s wrong? Talk to me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think I can do this.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do--”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I mean, what if they hate me? I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if they did. It’s no secret that my dad was an absolute pillock to your dad all throughout school. I wouldn’t be surprised if he hexes me on sight just on the virtue of my name! Al did you tell them who I am? If they don’t know I’m coming and it’s a surprise and--”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey--”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“--they’ll forbid us from ever speaking again or--”</span>

  <span>“Hey!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“C’mere, Scorpius. Just breathe, okay? There you go. My parents know exactly who you are. Neither of them are the type to hold a childish grudge, it’s all water under the bridge now. I promise.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Better?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mmmhmm.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“...”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ready?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No. But let’s do this anyway.”</span>
