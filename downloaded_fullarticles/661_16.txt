    <p>The Quidditch World Cup had long since dissolved into chaos by the time Caia Morgenstern roused, her head thick and heavy from having been hit hard enough that she had collapsed. With a muffled whimper, Caia rose on an elbow and glanced around. Smoke and tents and flames licking the sky were all she could find in focus and struggling to her feet, she pulled her wand from her boot, lighting it with a hissed ‘Lumos’.</p><p>Her friends were long gone, she doubted they’d even noticed her absence in the chaos that had been the Deatheaters arrival to the after celebrations of Ireland’s victory. Caia near stumbled over a lump shrouded by the darkness and when she glanced down, she wished she hadn’t. Pale eyes stared unseeing back up at her and she felt her stomach lurch. The witch hadn’t been dead long, the colour had yet to drain from her cheeks and her mouth was only faintly bluish. Caia’s stomach threatened to unfurl and she pressed a fist to her lips, whether in salute to the dead or to keep her dinner from resurfacing, Caia wasn’t sure.</p><p>Hurrying away from the body, Caia kept her wand drawn and at the ready as she slipped between burning tents and back out into a clearing. Stiffening at the sound of something breaking underfoot, and not her own, Caia slowed her pace warily. There was someone close to her, she could hear them breathing heavily and their stumbling footsteps. Ducking around another corner, she came face to face with that someone, her wand rising faster than theirs as she stared furiously into-</p><p>“Harry Potter? What the fuck?” The Gryffindor hero-to-be, boy extraordinaire and local village idiot stared up at her, his eyes confused before it seemed to dawn on him just who he was looking at. His face filled with relief that made her relax her stance a little, he seemed just as freaked out as she was and judging from the blood trickling down the side of his face, it was likely they’d been in similar situations. The boy-who-lived was remarkably good looking, despite the blood and Caia was almost glad to note that he seemed to have at least recognised her.</p><p>“Morgenstern? You okay?” His eyes lingered on her face and she wondered what unknown injury she had incurred. More shouting drew both their attention, Harry raising his wand much faster this time and the Gryffindor practically stepped in front of her in a protective stance that made Caia’s eyes widen.</p><p>“No, idiot, we’re not fighting anyone. Come on, let’s get out of here!” Caia yanked Harry to her side, pulling him as strongly as she could behind her as she hurried for a gap in the tents. There was a sharp bang from somewhere behind them and it seemed as though suddenly the sky was much lighter, but neither Harry nor Caia turned to see what had happened. Caia could hear her heart beating frantically over her own heavy breathing, could hear Harry’s panted breath and the footsteps of another that she was eventually able to distinguish, coming closer still. Caia pulled to a halt, practically digging her heels in as she, wand raised and ready, turned towards the noise. </p><p>Harry was at her back within a heartbeat, his wand raised and his eyes narrowed, focused and looking more ready than Caia felt. Despite the rate of her heartbeat, her wand hand was unwavering and Caia glared into the darkness. Even her lighted wand struggled to pick up anything lurking in the shadows but by the way the back of her neck was prickling, Caia was almost certain that the darkness was not the void is might have seemed. The spell that flashed from the tip of her wand was wordless, a surge of light and Harry behind her started in surprise. Caia kept the smug look from her face, knowing it wasn’t really the time to gloat in front of Harry Potter, especially with what looked like Aurors emerging from the tent and surging towards them. </p><p>“Harry!” Caia recognised Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley as they came from the darkness, both with relief brightening their faces. Following them, a little more slowly was a surprisingly familiar face and Caia grinned broadly, allowing Cedric Diggory to pull her into an embrace.</p><p>“Morgenstern, what on Earth?” He released her, looking down at her fondly but she could read the confusion and worry in his expression. </p><p>“Someone clipped me in the back of the head when the chaos started, ran into Harry and then after there was a loud bang, we both headed to find our way out. It’s a bloody nightmare Ced, I tripped over a body, I think-” Cedric squeezed her fingers in his and she wasn’t quite sure if it was a warning but Caia trailed off, her eyes finding Harry’s. He was seemingly being interrogated and one of the Aurors was getting a little too close for Caia’s comfort.</p><p>“Hey! What, in the name of Merlin’s beard are you doing? That’s a minor, he’s just a kid! Back off!” Cedric caught at her arm but Caia’s eyes had slit in fury, the Slytherin in her raising snarling hackles.</p><p>“There was a Dark Mark put up Miss Morgenstern and-” Caia made a noise that sounded like a snort had Transfigured itself into a huff. It was perfectly undignified but she was disinclined to care, her features tightening in barely concealed rage.</p><p>“And you think Potter here, who is the worst enemy of the Dark Lord, would be inclined to put his bloody mark in the sky? Are you out of your mind? The kid’s probably never seen the Mark, let alone knows how to bloody cast it!” Her voice cracked with ice, the very tone as cold as she could manage and Caia was pleased to note she clearly had Granger’s full support. The blazing smile on the other girl’s face was rather gratifying and the two exchanged a glance, the mutual respect clear. </p><p>The Auror stuttered, clearly not quite prepared for the verbal barrage nor the complete respect for what was clearly the truth and it was then that a red-headed man, who looked a lot like the Weasley to her left and his travelling circus of siblings, moved to intervene.</p><p>“I think it's safe we assume Potter and Morgenstern had nothing to do with the Mark being put up, it's been a long night and I need to get a fair few kids home. If you’ll excuse us,” Mr Weasley didn’t really wait for confirmation, instead taking his son and Harry by the shoulders and gently, but forcefully, shoving them on their way.</p><p>“You wanna come with me, Morgenstern? You can stay at mine tonight, then you can use our Floo to get home?” Cedric offered, with a half glance at Amos, who smiled kindly at the two of them before moving to speak quietly to Mr Weasley. Caia weighed her options, she was supposed to be staying with Zubeida Khan and her family this weekend but given Zubeida was nowhere to be seen, it looked like Cedric’s was the better alternative.</p><p>“Only if it's okay with your dad,” Caia relented, as Hermione fell into step beside her. Caia gave the other girl half a glance before she turned her full attention to Hermione.</p><p>“You’re the smart one right? Must help that you’re constantly surrounded by those two idiots, reckon they make you look even smarter in comparison,” Hermione snorted, inelegantly and joined Caia in laughter a moment later. Harry and Ron shot them looks over their shoulder, eyeing the two girls before exchanging almost nervous glances and turning back around. They’d started hurrying up a hill and Caia grimaced as her calves burned. </p><p>“You’re the Potions prodigy. I’ve seen you in Snape’s classroom a fair bit, is it true you have a key?” Caia’s lip quirked upwards. So her fame had spread to the younger ones.</p><p>“And access to Snape’s personal cabinets. If you need a Lacewing hook up, owl me,” Caia gave a wink and Hermione chuckled, although there was a certain amount of respect in her eyes. Respect that Caia both appreciated and detested. She didn’t like that this fourth year admired her, not when Hermione seemed destined to be so much greater than Caia could ever be. Caia had been hearing stories about the Muggle-born since she’d started at Hogwarts, her determination and dedication towards her studies was admirable and Ravenclaw-worthy, her ambition very Slytherin and the bravery that Caia could see in her very stature made her the Gryffindor she was. </p><p>“Potions is just jazzed up recipe following, I’m sure the girl who used a time-turner last year to attend three classes at once could attest to that,” Caia noticed the flush that kept into Hermione’s cheeks and was doused with warmth. It wasn’t quite maternal but it was something almost like with a younger sibling and she felt that pride for Hermione. She would do great things, greater even than she would imagine. Caia’s ambitions were set rather high as well, she’d wanted to be a Potions Master all her life and her dream was to help create substances to replace ingredients sourced from magical creatures. It was a dream, one she’d only shared with McGonagall and Snape but both had been rather encouraging, which had only stoked Caia’s ambition. She was a Slytherin through and through with that fiery ambition, her parents were extremely proud, despite them both being Hufflepuffs.</p><p>They had reached the summit of the hill, Caia’s breath huffing out and Cedric gave her shoulder a shove when he noticed how tiring she’d found the hike up the hill. Caia grumbled under her breath, giving the sixth year a sharp glancing blow to the ribs and he coughed, spluttering a laugh.</p><p>The Weasley twins, two familiar faces to Caia, hurried up to them. Both of them looked a little worse for wear and Caia wondered if they still had the flask of the Firewhiskey they positively reeked of handy. They noticed her a moment later and in unison, identical smiles slid across their faces. Caia rolled her eyes at their leers but allowed the bear hug they pulled her into.</p><p>“If it isn’t the devil child incarnate. Caia, lovely as ever- is your face alright?” George peered at her hairline, where Harry’s eyes had been earlier and Caia ducked their gazes, she still had no idea how bad the wound was. The concern in George’s eyes made her relax her shoulders slightly and with a grimace, she reached up to poke the area. Pain flared and she hissed, wincing slightly. Fred, who’d gone to catch at her wrist to stop her poking at it, smacked her hand back down.</p><p>“Ouch, Fred!” She exclaimed angrily, only half aware of the pain as her eyes zeroed in on the blood coating her fingers.</p><p>“Oi Diggory, I reckon Morgenstern’s better off coming with us. Mum’s wicked with healing spells and Caia’s gonna have a pretty sore head if she doesn’t get this fixed up. That alright with you devil girl?” George asked as an afterthought. Caia nodded, looking a little greenish and Cedric drew nearer, concern clear in his expression.</p><p>“Yeah, of course. Probably a better idea, I don’t think either of my parents is nearly as proficient with healing spells! I’ll reach out to your parents for you Cai, let em know where you are so they don’t worry. You let me know if you need anything yeah?” Caia nodded, allowing herself to be picked up in another hug by the Hufflepuff. He smelled like the burning campground and even fainter, of ginger and she relaxed into his arms briefly. She and her parents had spent summers with him and the Diggorys in various European countries when they had been younger and she still remembered the crush she’d had on him. Exploring the city of love with the boy you’d convinced yourself you were in love with was quite a feat! Caia had been quick to recover when Cedric had first gone out with Ravenclaw Cho Chang, who was now history but was the beginning of Caia’s wakeup call to realise it was puppy love that would go absolutely nowhere. He was still familiar to her and as he released her from the hug, she realised she had missed her friend quite dearly. </p><p>The Weasleys, with the additions of Harry, Hermione and Caia, bid the Diggorys farewell on the other end of the Portkey before making a trek back down yet another hill to a house that looked like a treehouse on several Muggle drugs. Caia was rather in awe, it was an extraordinary building and with Fred and George flanking her, she entered into what appeared to be the kitchen. Mrs Weasley was solid and warm and hugged Caia very tightly, which Caia appreciated. Anyone who hugged like that was trustworthy in Caia’s book and Mrs Weasley, with her sweet smile and sharp tongue, was someone Caia liked to trust. She’d met her on occasion at Kings Cross as their parents were friends, but being in her house was another matter entirely. </p><p>Please-call-me-Molly-dear was entirely efficient in clearing space to begin working on whatever had happened to Caia’s head and after quite a few grumbles of pain from the latter, it seemed she was quite set to head to bed. Molly was a little tentative in asking if she minded staying the night in her second eldest’s room, apparently, Charlie Weasley was currently in London with Bill, her eldest.</p><p>“That would be amazing Mrs Weasley, I really am grateful to you for letting me stay! My mum will probably send you a pavlova when she finds out what you’ve done for me, thank you so much!” Another ‘call me Molly later’ and Caia was being crushed into what she thought was her final hug for the evening before she was shooed off towards Fred and George, who were taking turns sliding down the staircase bannister. They were her chaperones upstairs and George, on the way up, turned to Caia with a sly look in his eye.</p><p>“Charlie’s going to freak once he finds out a hot girl slept in his bed. Especially without him being there,” Caia rolled her eyes, shaking her head at the comment. Fred looked set to continue but they were interrupted by the arrival of the eldest currently at home, Percy, who seemed well and ready to relieve them of their duties as tour guides. The twins pulled Caia into a hug between them and scattered off to another part of the house before Percy turned to give Caia a slightly stilted smile. He had been two years above her at Hogwarts, having graduated at the end of last year and Percy had been Head Boy when she was a Prefect, she remembered him being rather bossy but otherwise a stickler for rules.</p><p>She got the feeling he was rather reserved and returned the smile kindly. He was quiet as they walked the remaining floor to Charlie’s room and then Percy, with a wave, headed up another set of stairs where Caia lost sight of him before she slipped into Charlie’s room.</p><p>It was a room about the same size as her own at home, not overly enormous and he had a large window overlooking what she assumed was the countryside outside the Weasley’s home. His bed was a mess of Gryffindor House colours and the occasional book, his Gryffindor Quidditch top dangled precariously from one of the posters of the bed. His walls were plastered with pictures of dragons, of all shapes and kinds and classifications and she eyed what appeared to be some of his own sketches on the desk. </p><p>Without thinking, she picked up a quill from the desk, dipping into the first inkpot she found and with as steady hand as she could conjure, Caia drew a little dragon on an empty page. The little dragon puffed smoke and when Caia tapped it with her wand, the smoke moved and the flames that spilt from the dragon’s tiny mouth fluctuated in size. She wondered if Charlie would appreciate the little dragon, leaving it to dry on the desk before she dropped the pack from her shoulders and pulled her jeans off. Her underwear followed and she pulled on the Quidditch jumper, hoping Charlie wouldn’t mind she’d borrowed it before she climbed beneath the mess of red and gold that was the bed and before too long, Caia found that sleep was fast approaching.</p><p>hmm i love charlie also yes i know percy was being crouch's bitch at that point but idc. i also had cedric's dads name written as asmodeus but that is in fact, a demon, like amos in the books</p>
