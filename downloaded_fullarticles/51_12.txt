    <p>It was a calm, sunny summer day in...some British town, it's not really that important. And in this unimportant town, was an unimportant house, with an unimportant household that consisted of a man, a woman, their son, and their nephew, whom they had adopted after his parents had died in a car crash. In this house, the man was not around, as adults usually have to work in the summertime, but his wife was downstairs, making lunch for her sons.</p>
<p>The two boys were upstairs in one of their bedrooms; whose it was is unimportant, since this is only the starting point for the story and the geography of the house will likely not figure into the main story at all. In fact, we're only here because...why are we here again?</p>
<p>The door explodes into the house.</p>
<p>Right, that's why we're here. The door has just exploded into the house, causing Petunia Dursley (the housewife who resides in this unimportant house in this unimportant town) to let out a shriek and round the corner from the kitchen to see exactly what has caused such an eruption.</p>
<p>The cause of this eruption is a man. Well, some might call him a man, but this man would correct them, for he is much larger than an average man; he is, in fact, a half-giant, and we dearly hope his mother was the giant half of the pairing.</p>
<p>"WHERE IS HE?" the half-giant, whom we will eventually learn is called Hagrid, bellows at the stunned housewife.</p>
<p>"V-V-Vernon's at his j–" Petunia manages to stammer out before Hagrid crosses the distance between them and lifts Petunia up by the front of her blouse.</p>
<p>"I'm not talking about <em>him</em>," the half-giant growls into her stunned face.</p>
<p>Petunia does not react as expected. Instead of quivering into herself and shying away, she gets an angry look in her eyes.</p>
<p>"YOU STAY AWAY FROM MY BOYS!" she screeches and begins hitting the half-giant over the head with her bare hands. Predictably, this does nothing but frustrate the half-giant.</p>
<p>"Stop doing that!" he barks, only to receive a fist in the nose for his troubles. "Oh, that's it!"</p>
<p>Hagrid rears back and then throws his head forward like a headbanger in a moshpit. His head collides with Petunia's, and she goes down like a housewife that just got headbutted by a half-giant.</p>
<p>Hagrid scratches his chin absentmindedly. "Now, if I were an abused little boy, where would I be..."</p>
<p>His eyes alight on the cupboard under the stairs, and he strides towards it purposefully. He throws the cupboard door open, only to reveal a bunch of art supplies, broken electronics, and two cases of Mountain Dew. His brow furrows, but then clears as he hears some sounds from upstairs.</p>
<p>"That must be Pigboy Crabshaw," he declares to himself. "<em>He'll</em> know where to find Harry Potter, I reckon."</p>
<p>So saying, Hagrid thumps up the stairs, which shake with each footfall–for while they were built to handle fat Englishmen, a fully-grown half-giant is quite a stressor on them. He comes to one of the rooms at the end of the hall and throws this door open. And by throws, I mean he literally grabs the doorknob and throws the door forward off its hinges.</p>
<p>Inside are two boys, staring at him in shock and completely ignoring their round of Mortal Kombat. It's a shame, too; Harry was one hit away from landing the killing blow and launching his finishing move.</p>
<p>Hagrid grins. "Yer a wizard, Harry."</p>
