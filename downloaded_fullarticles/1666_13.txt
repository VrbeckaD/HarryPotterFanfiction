    <p>“Malfoy?” Harry choked out the word—he could still taste the smoke in his throat.</p><p>Nothing. He swore through another cough as his stomach clenched. Harry could feel Malfoy breathing, so he knew he was alive. But he wasn't sure he was conscious.</p><p>“Draco?” he tried. “Draco, come on.”</p><p>Malfoy finally coughed out a response. Not that Harry could understand him; his face was wedged into the crook of Harry’s shoulder.</p><p>“Draco, you're lying on top of me.”</p><p>“Brilliant of you to notice, Potter.” Draco’s drawling voice was raw, but clear enough now. He had finally roused himself enough to shift his head. “No wonder you're the new poster boy for the aurors.”</p><p>Harry rolled his eyes. “I see your snark isn't injured.”</p><p>“Any more stunning revelations?”</p><p>“Your hair smells like petrol. And my ears are still ringing. And my back is killing me.”</p><p>“We both stink of petrol and smoke.” Malfoy paused for a racking cough. “My ears are ringing from that damned explosion too. And as for your back—well, you should have apparated us onto a bed instead of a sitting room floor.”</p><p>“Right. So sorry that this was the best I could manage while saving our lives.”</p><p>All he got in reply was a noncommittal grunt.</p><p>“Does that mean you’re not planning to move, Malfoy?”</p><p>“Honestly, Potter, I don’t think I can. Not without vomiting.”</p><p>Shit. That was . . . that was fair, actually. “Me either. How bad are you hurt?”</p><p>“Dunno. Reckon we’re both more singed than burnt. Don’t think anything’s broken. Could do without the nausea from the petrol fumes, though. You?”</p><p>Harry blanched. “Same. And I can hardly see—glasses are missing.”</p><p>“They’re on the floor over there.”</p><p>“Broken?”</p><p>“Probably.”</p><p>They lapsed into silence. For a few minutes, all Harry could hear was the ticking of the ghastly old clock that he kept meaning to give away. Or destroy. Or otherwise dispose of.</p><p>This is not how he expected the day to end: lying here on the floor at Grimmauld Place—covered in dust, soot and probably some dried blood—with Draco Malfoy, of all people, sprawled on top of him.</p><p>He hadn't even seen Draco since his trial, three years back. Until earlier today, he had stupidly believed that he was avoiding London and the British wizarding community. That he was traveling to places like Paris. And New York. And Buenos Aires.</p><p>All smoke and mirrors from the powers that be at the ministry. Malfoy must have seemed the ideal choice to infiltrate a group of neo-Death Eaters. He was a former Death Eater himself, after all. And Harry knew he was skilled in occlumency.</p><p>He was an animagus now too. Was that a requirement for deep cover?</p><p>Harry smirked as he thought back to the animal Draco had briefly transformed into as they escaped the burning house. He couldn't help it.</p><p>“So, Malfoy. About your animagus form . . . .”</p><p>“Fuck off, Potter.”</p><p>“No, really. It's impressive. What did you need to, uh, ferret out of that little hidey-hole?”</p><p>Malfoy scoffed. “Later. When I'm actually conscious—and this ferret thing has gotten old for you.”</p><p>“Oh, it will never get old,” Harry promised. But he stopped needling him. There'd be plenty more opportunities for that.</p><p>For now, Harry was just relieved that he'd gotten to Draco on time. He ought to have been pulled from the operation weeks ago. But the bastards at the ministry hadn't cared how much danger an ex-Death Eater was in, as long as he kept providing such valuable intelligence.</p><p>“Potter?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“How did you find out about me? Did Robards send you to my rescue?”</p><p>“No.” Robards was in charge of the operation. Harry's own boss.</p><p>Draco's voice was a little alarmed now. “Please don't tell me you went rogue.”</p><p>“Wasn't telling you anything, Malfoy. Just, you know, pointing out that you're still lying on top of me.”</p><p>Draco didn't answer that. Which probably meant he was concussed or something. Harry probably was too.</p><p>“Malfoy, don't fall asleep.”</p><p>He answered with a slurred murmur that might have been, “Not sleeping.”</p><p>Shit. Harry really should wake him. And this whole situation—if it wasn't awkward yet, it would be once they were both thinking clearly.</p><p>But there was something soothing about the way Malfoy’s breaths were changing from shallow and fluttery-fast to deep, slow, and steady. After a while, Harry's breaths started to match his, and the ringing in his ears began to fade.</p><p>The clock kept ticking. It must have disturbed Draco, because he finally piped up again. “I’m planning to thank you for rescuing me. Even if you were stupid enough to risk your career for it.”</p><p>“Planning to?”</p><p>“Trying to work out how many life debts I owe you first.”</p><p>Harry managed to move his shoulder enough to nudge him with it. “Let’s not keep score.”</p><p>Draco slid off of him—halfway, at least. “Have you met my family, Potter? The Malfoys are all about keeping score.”</p><p>“Fine. We’ll do the maths later.” Harry paused. “For now, we ought to heal ourselves.”</p><p>“We should,” Draco agreed.</p><p>“But that would require moving again, wouldn’t it?”</p><p>“It would.”</p><p>“Right.” Harry sighed. “So we’re just going to lie here, then?”</p><p>“Yeah. That’s my plan.”</p><p>It was surprisingly hard to think of a better one. Harry suspected that any serious movement would lead to the discovery of worse injuries than either of them were aware of, and he wasn't sure he could face that just yet. “All right.”</p><p>“Good.” Draco was still leaning alongside of him, so close that his breath was warm against Harry's neck. “That's sorted.”</p><p>“Except that the floor doesn’t make a good pillow.”</p><p>“Shame, that. Your shoulder, on the other hand, makes an excellent one.”</p><p>“I could shove you away, you know.”</p><p>“Doubt it. That would require you to move, remember?”</p><p>“Oh, right.” Harry managed a half-hearted attempt, though. Well, he managed to lift one arm enough to give Malfoy a pathetic little push. That didn’t work at all, so he just rested his other arm on Malfoy’s back.</p><p>Malfoy chuckled. “That’s an embrace, Potter, not a shove.”</p><p>Harry tried to shrug, but it hurt too much. “What can I say? I’m a romantic.”</p><p>“Yes, petrol, burns, explosions—you really know how to show a boy a good time.”</p><p>“Are you requesting a tamer second date?”</p><p>He yawned. “For what it's worth, I've never been to a muggle cinema.”</p><p>Harry snorted. “I suppose we can remedy that.”</p><p>Draco muttered something incoherent. He was probably back asleep.</p><p>Fuck. Sleeping was not an option when dealing with concussions. Harry knew that. He also knew that they should both be at St. Mungo’s. Why had he apparated them here? It was instinctive, he supposed. Grimmauld Place had started to feel safe again, especially after all the work he'd done on the wardings.</p><p>Harry closed his eyes. He didn't have another apparation in him tonight. He still couldn't even be arsed to try for some basic healing. So he let himself drift off, hoping for the best.</p><p> </p><p>-&gt;*&lt;-</p><p> </p><p>When Harry opened his eyes again, Malfoy was still pressed alongside him. There was a pillow under Harry's head, though, and a blanket draped over them both.</p><p>And Kreacher was standing on the other side of him, looking down at the pair with a weirdly eager sort of approval.</p><p>“Master has brought Mr. Draco Malfoy home!” The house elf’s voice was tinged with awe. “The handsome pure-blood great-nephew of my late mistress.”</p><p>Harry wanted to retch at that. “No! I mean, yes. He's here and I brought him, but—this isn't what it looks like.”</p><p>“It isn't, Potter?” Malfoy stirred enough to grin up at him. “Were you just toying with me last night?”</p><p>“Bastard.” Harry elbowed him. “How long have you been awake?”</p><p>“Not long.” He pushed himself up a bit so that he could see Kreacher. “You served my great aunt? So this is the old Black place, is it?”</p><p>“Yes, Mr. Malfoy. Will you be wanting a tour? Your esteemed mother—”</p><p>“I'll be happy to tour the house later,” he promised. “But for now, I need you to deliver a private message to Robards, the head of the aurors.”</p><p>“No, Kreacher. I’ll talk to Robards myself.”</p><p>Draco frowned at Harry. “I have sensitive information for him. Best send your elf straight away.”</p><p>“It's not sensitive now, Draco. Your cover is blown. You won't be any further use as an agent.”</p><p>“Potter, these neo-Death Eater cells don't all talk to each other. And none of them know that I'm an animagus—”</p><p>“I don't care!” Fuck, was he shouting? Where had he even found the energy?</p><p>Draco managed to sit up, more or less. He didn’t say anything, though. He just stared.</p><p>Harry pushed himself up too. And he tried to calm himself by silently counting to five. He made it to three. “Look, I know you. I know this would never be your first choice of a career—”</p><p>“Why not?” Draco's voice was sharp.</p><p>How was he supposed to answer that? It wasn't that Harry thought Draco was a coward, exactly. Not anymore. But he still wasn't the sort who would willingly hurl himself into danger. Especially without minions to protect him.</p><p>No, Malfoy didn't belong under cover. He ought to be brewing potions or repairing magical antiques or something. He was good at things like that: things that required lots of time and effort and patience.</p><p>But he had no business risking his life for a ministry that didn't even value it.</p><p>“Well, Potter?”</p><p>“You hated sixth year.” Harry hesitated and then gentled his voice. “That was—I mean, you were undercover then, in a way. And you hated it. Merlin, you were breaking down.”</p><p>Draco snorted. “Of course I hated it. You Know Who—no, I'm done with that. Voldemort was forcing my hand. He was threatening my parents. And me.”</p><p>“I know.” Harry swallowed. “Draco—look, just tell me the truth. Robards is the one threatening you this time. Not your life, but with something, right?”</p><p>“Ahem.”</p><p>Kreacher's little cough reminded both men of his presence. “Master should remember that he had promised to meet with Mr. and Mrs. Ronald Weasley yesterday evening. Master missed the appointment. They have both just apparated near the house and will soon be outside the do—”</p><p>The doorbell sounded just then. Stupid chimes were far too cheerful for this charged atmosphere.</p><p>“Go on and let them in, Kreacher.” Harry threw off the blanket.</p><p>Draco scowled. “Don't blow my cover to Granger and Weasley.”</p><p>“Malfoy, wait—”</p><p>Too late. His white-blond hair transformed into white-blond fur. It happened so fast that Harry scarcely noticed as Draco scrambled onto his lap.</p><p>“Thank you, Kreacher,” Hermione was saying as she entered the room. Ron, meanwhile, was muttering something about the annoying clock.</p><p>And then they both stopped short at the sight of Harry sitting on the floor, holding a ferret, and looking like—well, like both him and the animal had survived an explosion.</p><p>Brilliant. Just brilliant.</p><p> </p><p>-&gt;*&lt;-</p><p> </p><p>It always took Draco a few seconds to adjust to his ferret senses—everything looked, smelled, and sounded different. His eyesight was shit, really, in this form. But he could hear and smell so much more.</p><p>Potter's scent was overwhelming just now. Sweat, blood, petrol, and a lingering whiff of sandalwood that was probably aftershave. And, underneath all that, a deeper, distinctive scent that was just, well, Potter.</p><p>Draco didn't mind that scent. In fact, he nuzzled into Potter's neck to get more of it. Why not? It would annoy Potter and make himself look like an innocuous pet at the same time.</p><p>But Potter took the nuzzling in his stride. He even gave Draco a gentle scratch behind the ears as he scooped him up and, with Weasley’s assistance, struggled to his feet. Next he retrieved his glasses, sat down on a chair and deposited Draco in his lap.</p><p>Weasley took a seat next to his wife on an ugly chesterfield. “You still have to tell us what happened to you,” he was saying. “And why the hell you didn't ask me to come.”</p><p>“Ron, quiet.” Granger paused to take out her wand. “Occulus reparo!”</p><p>Well, that took care of Potter's glasses.</p><p>“Episkey!” Hermione went through several more of those as she healed the scrapes, bruises, burns and possible strains both Draco and Potter had incurred. The mudblood know-it-all had her uses.</p><p>No, not mudblood. Draco had sworn off that slur. So make that muggle-born know-it-all.</p><p>Weasley, meanwhile, was pestering Potter again. “Come on, Harry, what did you do? And how much are we going to have to hide from Robards? And what possessed you to get a look-alike Malfoy ferret?”</p><p>“Ron!” Hermione let out an exasperated breath. “Let Harry sit for a moment.”</p><p>“All right, all right. He’s a cute little fellow, though. Wait, is it a him?”</p><p>“Yes,” Potter answered. “Definitely a him.”</p><p>Draco stretched himself up along Potter’s chest and nuzzled his neck again.</p><p>“He’s beautiful,” Granger said. “And look how attached he is to you. What's his name?”</p><p>“It’s, um . . . .”</p><p>Since when had Potter forgotten how to improvise? Draco urged him to think faster by nipping him.</p><p>“Ow!” Potter grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and lifted him up until his hind feet were scrabbling for purchase. “Behave, Draco.”</p><p>“Draco?” Weasley let out a startled and delighted laugh. “You actually named him after Malfoy? That's just cruel, mate.”</p><p>“It is, Harry.” Granger chimed in, though Draco could hear a reluctant chuckle in her voice. And somehow that annoyed him even more than her husband's outright mockery.</p><p>He kept scrabbling and twisting, but suddenly stilled as he saw the look Potter was giving him. Well, not saw, exactly. He couldn't grasp human expressions as well in this form. But a hundred little things told him that Potter had just reached a decision . . . and that it had nothing to do with that love bite.</p><p>Fuck. Potter was about to blow his cover.</p><p>“I didn’t name him after Malfoy. This is Malfoy.” Potter placed Draco back on his lap as he released his scruff.</p><p>“Harry . . . Harry, you can't be serious.” That was Granger. Draco wasn't facing her, but he reckoned she was wide-eyed and outraged now. “You didn't transfigure him!”</p><p>“What? No, of course not.” Harry shook his head as he absently stroked Draco’s back. “He's an animagus now. And he's been undercover for the Ministry for—I don't even know how long. And Robards left him to die.”</p><p>Draco’s brain seemed to freeze at that. So Robards considered him expendable, despite the promises he made. Promises about how the Ministry always looked after their agents. And Draco had been stupid enough to believe the man.</p><p>And now Draco was only alive, once again, thanks to Harry Potter. The chosen one was making a habit of saving him. Which meant that Draco was even further in his debt.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>He shook himself a little. Then he pressed closer to Potter and refocused on the conversation.</p><p>“So Malfoy’s the one who provided all that intelligence?” Weasley was asking. “And when you found out, you went to rescue him alone?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Harry, why didn't you tell me? You should never have gone without backup.”</p><p>“Because I knew I’d probably be sacked for this! And I thought it'd be a simple extraction.” Potter kept stroking Draco as he talked. “They had figured out that Malfoy was a spy. He was magically restrained when I found him—but I swear, Ron, that was the only impressive magic they used. Their wards were shoddy, their . . . well, it doesn't matter now.”</p><p>“So you underestimated them.” Ron didn’t sound impressed.</p><p>“Yes. I didn't expect—”</p><p>“The place to be rigged for a muggle explosion?” Granger finished for him.</p><p>“Right,” Potter admitted. “And I didn't even smell the petrol at first. Not that the petrol—I mean, I think there was an actual bomb too. Look, Malfoy can tell us more about the whole operation.”</p><p>Weasley frowned. “Are you sure that's Malfoy? I wouldn't expect him to be so, um, affectionate with you.”</p><p>Potter grunted. “Maybe we've turned a corner in our relationship. Bet he's cross with me, though, for outing him as an agent.”</p><p>Draco attempted to prove that point by nipping his finger, but Potter was too fast.</p><p>“Stop that,” he warned. “Now come on, Draco. We want to talk with you properly.”</p><p>So Potter blithely expected him to obey orders. But Draco had no desire to be interrogated by the Golden Trio, especially since he answered—in theory, at least—only to Robards or to the Minister for Magic himself.</p><p>On the other hand, Saint Potter here was the one who had risked his neck to save him, not Robards or Shacklebolt. And Potter wielded considerable influence. No one had forgotten his status as saviour.</p><p>Potter had, somewhat inexplicably, helped the Malfoys after the war. There was no reason he should help them again, but . . . well, Potter had come charging to the rescue, hadn't he? Perhaps he'd offer even more assistance. Draco would be a fool not to find out.</p><p>With that in mind, he launched himself off Potter’s lap and smoothly transformed, landing gracefully on his feet. His clothing might be grimy and torn and Merlin only knew what his hair looked like, but he was still a Malfoy. He still knew how to carry himself.</p><p>He paused a moment, coming back to his human senses, and then turned to nod at Potter's guests. “Granger. Weasley.”</p><p>“So you were never in New York, Malfoy?” Granger asked, dispensing with any niceties or any comment on his appearance. “Or Paris or Buenos Aires?”</p><p>“I was in all three, actually. New York the longest. That's where I trained to become an animagus.”</p><p>Potter stood up. “Did Robards force you to become one?”</p><p>Draco shrugged. “It's a requirement for my line of work.”</p><p>“So that would be a yes.”</p><p>“Potter . . . .” He sighed as he turned to face him. “What exactly do you want from me?”</p><p>The holy-fucking-saviour hesitated before answering, and then seemed to suck in a lung's worth of air. “To start with, I want you to tell me what Robards is holding over you.”</p><p>“Why do you care?”</p><p>“Because I pulled your arse out of the fire—literally!—twice now. I didn't do that so the ministry could just throw your life away.”</p><p>Salazar, Potter looked furious. But that fury wasn't directed at him. Draco stood there stupidly, as if he were rooted to the floor. He hadn't ever expected to see Saint Potter so righteously angry on his behalf.</p><p>“I can't—look, Potter, what do you expect me to do?”</p><p>“Exactly as I say! Tell me what Robards has on you. Whatever it is, we’ll fix it. And then we'll tell Robards and the whole ministry to go and fuck themselves.”</p><p>Draco scoffed. “Are you that determined to end your career?”</p><p>Potter took a step toward him. “You're not going back undercover. Just . . . you're not.”</p><p>“And you think you’ve got a say in that?” Draco tried to put his habitual sneer into the words, but they came out oddly flat.</p><p>Potter seemed to bite back the first response that occurred to him in favour of another deep breath. But those green eyes of his flickered with determination.</p><p>“You've got a life debt to me, remember?” he said at last. “More than one, actually. And the Malfoys, apparently, care about their debts.”</p><p>“So we're doing the maths now?”</p><p>“If that's what it takes to keep you from being an idiot, then yes.”</p><p>Weasley chose that moment to stand up. “Okay, this is starting to sound like a private conversation—”</p><p>“No, stay, Weasley. Both of you.” Draco took a deep breath of his own. “I have some conditions for Potter, assuming he's serious. And I want witnesses.”</p>
