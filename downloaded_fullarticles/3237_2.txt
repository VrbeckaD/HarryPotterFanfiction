And sort of annoying, to be honest. Finally his wife couldn’t take it anymore. She put down her book.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>He couldn’t hold it in any longer. “I think Draco has a boyfriend!”</p><p>Narcissa furrowed her eyebrows slightly. “And why’s that?”</p><p>“He said something by mistake, and…” He took a deep breath. “Oh, Narcissa, a boyfriend. Who do you think it could be?”</p><p>“You honestly don’t know? Doesn’t our son talk and talk about a certain boy in his year?” She hid her smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p>Lucius frowned. “You mean Potter?”</p><p>“Obviously.”</p><p>“…well. The Gryffindor tie I found the other day in his room makes a lot of sense now.” Lucius finished.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p></div>
