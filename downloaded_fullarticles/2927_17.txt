  <u>THE POISONING</u>
</p>
<p>     Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. For most, this is easy. Breathing is a natural instinct. For me, it is a chore. Oxygen is poisonous, scorching my lungs, eating me inside and out. I don't want it, and the same goes for for food. All of it is spider venom and cyanide made to look like honey, but no, I refuse to be fooled. I REFUSE IT-</p>
<p>
  <u>THE AWAKENING</u>
</p>
<p>     My eyes feel as if they are glued shut. The room around me pulses a cold, hospital blue, causing my heart to have a fit. In a response, the machine beside me whines.</p>
<p>     "Hello?" I say, my eyes still shut. I can hear somebody moving beside me. They grab my hand, and I resist the urge to move away, my mouth going dry from the anxiety.</p>
<p>     "Draco, darling, it's going to be okay." Hearing my mother's voice should be a relief. However, it makes my shoulders bunch and my heart begin to sputter, causing the machine's whine to heighten to a screech.</p>
<p>     My mother quickly snatches her hand away. "Sorry, baby," she mumbles. "If you're worried about your father, he isn't here. He's still in New Angeles."</p>
<p>     "New Angeles?" I manage to ask, amusement warping my voice. "Wasn't he there a week ago?"</p>
<p>     I can almost hear her nod. "Yes, but AMIT called him back for a special case... something about a CareBot malfunction, I believe."</p>
<p>     There is a brief moment of silence, and as I speak, it feels as if there are cotton balls inside of my mouth. "...Mum?"</p>
<p>     "Yes, Dragon?"</p>
<p>     "I've never heard of a CareBot malfunctioning."</p>
<p>     "Of course not. It isn't something that they put in the news. After all, AMIT doesn't want people knowing about their slip-ups. I doubt people would accept CareBots if they knew how, er, <em>emotional </em>the robots can get," she says lightly. However, the words irk me, and I can't help but open my eyes, and wrinkle my brow.</p>
<p>     "Robots can't be emotional."</p>
<p>     Ignoring the fact that I have only just opened my eyes, she inclines her head towards me and purses her lips. "Honey, I don't have time to explain to you how they can be, okay? I suppose violent would be a better word, but-" The rest of her sentence is lost to me, and everything is still before I slowly slip back into oblivion.</p>
<p>
  <u>THE ENTERING</u>
</p>
<p>     Home is cold and sterile. To me, home is where I am happy, and so far, I have found no such place. For me, there is only misery, and though that may sound dramatic, it is true. Not once have I ever been truly happy.</p>
<p>     I think of that now as I stand in front of my stark, white house, glaring at the reflective windows, my mother's hand on my arm. This time, I don't flinch away. Instead, I brush her hand off, march into the house and practically run up the stairs, eager to be in my own room. There, I will find solace.</p>
<p>     Though my mother's voice echoes through the house, I quickly close and lock my bedroom door behind me. I then turn to look at my bookshelf.</p>
<p>     You may imagine a person's bookshelf to be filled with stories though up long before they can even remember. Undoubtedly, you see it as colorful, with journals in shades of maroon and novels the color of the night sky and series shifting from rich purples to heavy, emerald greens. However, my bookshelf has been the same as since the first time I got it, filled with identical black books.</p>
<p>     I am a writer, and so words are my sword. I breathe them, and I fight with them, powerfully. They are my sword, and I am proud of them. Strangely enough, though, as I stand there, I find myself unwilling to open up one of the journals and begin to write, with unnerves me. Even in the darkest times have I been able to spout out a book the same colors as a tropical sunset.</p>
<p>     Things are changing, I notice. Things will not be the same.</p>
<p>
  <u>THE WELCOMING</u>
</p>
<p>     It seems an eternity until I hear my mother's knock on the door. At this period in time, rather than stand a bit away from the bookshelf, I am running the pads of my index and middle fingers along their old, cracked spines, inhaling the sweet scent of dust and ink. When I hear my mother walking up the stairs, for some reason, I find myself jerking away from the books.</p>
<p>     "Honey?" she says, her voice ambrosia. No. Vinegar. "The CareBot has arrived. Courtesy of your father."</p>
<p>     My stomach drops so suddenly I begin to feel light-headed. "Excuse me, what did you just say?"</p>
<p>     "I said-"</p>
<p>     "No, I heard what you said. I was being figurative. I meant, what do you mean by father sent me a CareBot?"</p>
<p>     I can almost feel her apologetic stare through the door, and it makes me want to cringe. "He thinks it's best if you have somebody — or something — watching over you at all times, even if that means we receive a CareBot. Don't worry, it's only until you're truly on your feet."</p>
<p>     "Well, I'm on my feet right now," I say sarcastically, and make no move to open nor unlock the door.</p>
<p>     I can hear her tapping her foot. "You know what I mean, Draco Lucius Malfoy. So, come downstairs this instant, otherwise we're keeping the CareBot until it breaks down entirely. Understood?"</p>
<p>     "Understood," I mumble back, and only wait a moment before leaving my bedroom. My mother gives me a knowing smile, and in response I shoot her a sneer, which makes that faux smile shift into a grimace.</p>
<p>     "Don't make that face at me, it's completely disrespectful," she snaps, but I refuse to respond. Instead, we trek downstairs to find an AMIT employee peering into the house. I feel a sharp pang of relief when I realize that it is not my father.</p>
<p>     My mother opens the front door, and the employee, with a CareBot by her side, cautiously enters the room.</p>
<p>     "Mrs. Malfoy, Young Malfoy," she says. Everything about her is cautious. The way she moves, the way she speaks, her appearance... it makes me want throw up. "My name is Pansy, and I am here to introduce you to your CareBot. His name is Harry, and he's one of our newer models. Harry, said hello."</p>
<p>     In a movement that is unnervingly human, the CareBot slowly looks up, it's bright, green eyes unreadable. "Hello," it says, and cocks its head in my direction. I refuse to acknowledge it, save for Pansy's brief introduction.</p>
<p>     My mother's frown dies, and is replaced with a glowing smile. "What a beautiful CareBot!" she exclaims, and when she steps forward to take a closer look, the robot seems to startle, moving quickly away from her.</p>
<p>     Pansy appears apologetic. "Apologies, Mrs. Malfoy," she murmurs, shooting an unreadable look at Harry. "He is made for interaction with your entire family and myself only, though it seems as if I have not coded you into his system correctly... he may be a bit skittish around you at first, but he'll warm up pretty quickly."</p>
<p>     The smile stays, but my mother's expression is now sour. "That's quite all right. Anyway, I have made a room of sorts in the closet directly next to Draco's room. Should we bring him there?"</p>
<p>     Pansy's lips thin. "I'm sure both Harry and Draco would prefer it if they could acquaint themselves further, as it is their first time meeting."</p>
<p>     "Oh... of course," my mother says, and with a gesture to attract everyone's attention, she draws us into the lounge, directing Harry and Pansy to sit on the first couch. My mother and I both sit on the one facing them.</p>
<p>     The robot looks as if it is studying it's hands as it speaks. "Mr. Malfoy said you enjoy humor, Draco, but judging from your body language, I find that difficult to believe," it says, startling me with its bluntness. "Your body language suggests you prefer more... mature things, such as chess."</p>
<p>     I smile humorlessly. "Chess is the most boring fucking game I have ever played."</p>
<p>     Pansy and my mother both visibly flinch, but Harry stays unnaturally still, raising its eyes to meet mine. Chills snake down my back, and I force myself to remember that it is just a CareBot.</p>
<p>     "Fun," it muses, sounding almost sarcastic. "Do you have any questions?"</p>
<p>     "Yes, in fact, I do." I lean forward. "How have CareBots been malfunctioning?"</p>
<p>     The robot doesn't skip a beat. "I don't have that information. Do you have any other questions?"</p>
<p>     I don't. However, as I stare into the CareBot's marble, soulless eyes, I begin to have a snaking suspicion that it is somehow lying.</p>
<p>
  <u>THE SETTLING</u>
</p>
<p>     The next week is the quietest I have ever seen in Malfoy Manor. No servants, no PleasureBots, and no friends permeate the silence, letting the dreamy, baby blue fog settle over us. Harry is, surprisingly, rarely around for the first couple days. He remains in the shadows, always watching, always silent, my only alarm that he is there being the chills that kiss my neck like frostbitten fingertips.</p>
<p>     However, on this particular day, a Wednesday so insignificant to most that it is brushed off like a pesky fly, the murmurs begin once more in the house. The first PleasureBot glides in quietly enough, its doll-like features, the plushy lips parted into an oh and the over-large eyes gaping holes of emotionlessness, making me faintly uncomfortable. I can see Harry in the doorway at the corner of my eye, who is watching the PleasureBot intently.</p>
<p>     "Can you living dolls feel desire?" I drawl, inclining my head towards the CareBot. Its gaze settles onto me firmly.</p>
<p>     "I don't exactly know," it confesses. "I haven't had enough experience. You're my first client, yet I doubt you are going to be my last, so I have all the time in the world to discover if I'm a..." It goes silent, something I have never seen a robot do.</p>
<p>     The PleasureBot gives us each a small glance before moving silkily up the stairs, and I prowl closer to Harry. He blinks down at me owlishly. "So you can't... you know... fuck anybody?"</p>
<p>     "Well, we can," it says quietly. "But it isn't a matter of what I can and cannot do. Rather, it's what my client can or cannot do. Some clients receive therapy through sexual contact, whereas others receive it through conversational activities. It's all a matter of what is best for the client themselves."</p>
<p>     "So... you put others before yourself." The idea seems delicious — if only, however, I could have somebody to put myself before. Perhaps I can find somebody.</p>
<p>     "Yes. The only thing that matters to me is my client's health."</p>
<p>     I let out a snort. "That's depressing."</p>
<p>     "I suppose you can say that. But to me, it is very fulfilling. I am programmed to do just that, however... however..." It falters for a moment, but long and heavy enough for me to notice.</p>
<p>     "However what?"</p>
<p>     It blinks again, stares at me for a moment with those emotionless, empty eyes before moving for the staircase, leaving me quite furious.</p>
<p>     "That's not a way a client should be treated," I snap, drawing its attention. It pauses and glances back at me.</p>
<p>     "Please explain."</p>
<p>     "I asked you a question, and I expect you to answer. What were you going to say?" I demand.</p>
<p>     "I cannot answer a question to which I have no answer. Good afternoon, Young Malfoy. You are scheduled for a checkup with me tonight. Please be there with the shift I have provided for you, and is currently in your bedroom." It inclines its head towards me, and leaves, leaving me there to stress over the content of its words.</p>
<p>
  <u>THE TALKING</u>
</p>
<p>     The shift I wear is uncomfortably translucent. I stare at my bare feet, with curling toes and a long, pulsing scratch along the side. Earlier that morning, I had been wandering my garden, tripped over a loose cobblestone, and tumbled into a rose bush that prickled with sharp thorns. I remember the blur of the creamy white and the velvet red before my head slammed against the pavement, leaving stars in my vision. Those white spots remain now, along with achy scratches and cuts all over my body, with ashy black creeping at the edge of my sight, but I ignore them as one would a mosquito bite.</p>
<p>     "Young Malfoy, can you please follow me into your bedroom?" Harry's voice cuts my thoughts off, leaving them hanging over an abyss.</p>
<p>     I blink once. Twice. "Hmm, I wonder what you mean by that..."</p>
<p>     "Exactly what I said." Dumbass robot.</p>
<p>     My lips twitching into a sneer, I follow it into my bedroom, kicking the door shut behind me. It motions for me to sit down on my bed. I settle down, cracking my toes by pressing them against the floor roughly.</p>
<p>     It glances at me, snapping on gloves. "Can you please drop your shift down to your waist? I need to check your abdomen."</p>
<p>     That makes me freeze. The thought of showing my chest fills my stomach with gray dread, and while my heart starts racing, I involuntarily let out a wheeze.</p>
<p>     "If you are concerned about my thoughts of your appearance, I can assure you that I was programmed to not have... have... opinions." And the stammering is back.</p>
<p>     "Th-that's not the problem," I manage to say, my head spinning.</p>
<p>     I half expect it to force me to strip down, but instead, it hands me a simple, pale blue pill. It's a cylindrical shape, with one, black stripe down the middle. I study it silently.</p>
<p>     "What is this?"</p>
<p>     "It will help you calm down."</p>
<p>     "Good." And, without any other words, I dry swallow the pill. The affect is almost immediate. My limbs go slack, and I am able to sigh deeply, my gaze dragging over to Harry.</p>
<p>     "Whatever this is, I need this every day," I joke, but the CareBot's frown tells me it doesn't understand. "Never mind. Just... I'll go on, I guess."</p>
<p>     I shrug the shift down to my waist, and watch Harry's expression. To my surprise, it looks almost sad.</p>
<p>     "You need to eat more," it says, its words heavy. "Your ribs are showing, and so is everything else. Your muscles have completely degenerated."</p>
<p>     High on the tiny, blue pill, I let out a laugh that sends a painful, wracking cough through my body. "No shit."</p>
<p>     It ignores my comment. "Okay, tell me if this hurts." When it presses a certain spot, the spots become fireworks, and I squeeze my eyes shut, hissing.</p>
<p>     Harry is quiet as it pokes and prods, most likely recording notes in that damn empty mind.</p>
<p>     "That's all over. Now, you need to show me your legs. Just turn around, and cup your genitalia if you would prefer."</p>
<p>     How unbothered it sounds faintly disturbs me, but the sense is soon awash with champagne tranquility. I turn my back to it, drop the shift and my boxers, and peer back. It has prowled closer, and is studying my thighs, prodding areas with its cold, gloved hands.</p>
<p>     The sadness and disappointment in its usually emotionless eyes deepens. I only recognize it for a second, before I am lost in induced bliss.</p>
<p>     "How bad is it?" I ask dreamily, turning my eyes to stare at the wall.</p>
<p>     It's silent for a moment. "Our next appointment is next week. I expect about four more pounds in your weigh in next week. Any less, and I will forced to be monitor you hourly."</p>
<p>     The thought should make me cringe, but my dreamy, high self wants to smile. And that's exactly what I do, even if Harry doesn't notice.</p>
