          <div class="userstuff"><p>Opposites, opposites, we've never had a thing in common personality wise</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Strange and mysterious, how you came off, arriving out of nowhere</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Better be Gryffindor!" the hat yelled out for you</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Muggleborn, that's what everyone thought you were, after all Harry Evans?, not a pureblood but a halfblood at best</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I thought you were a brash Gryffindor but wait--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Slytherin traits, and that cunning, yes it's extremely intriguing, how much of a mystery you are Evans</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Average in all of your classes, fading into the background, then came DADA, and there--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I lost, <em>lost</em>, <em>lost</em>, <em><strong>LOST</strong></em>  to a duel against you, instinct is drilled into your muscles, yes it's so clear to see--you have experience, but from <em>where</em> and <em>how?</em>, especially with <em>those</em> instincts</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You're a puzzle to solve Evans and I will solve it, but where do you keep going?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Passageways, <em>you</em> knew of passageways not even <em>I</em> knew of--but <em>how</em> did you know of them when you're so <em>new?</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mystery, you turned out to be an even bigger mystery than I expected Evans, knowledge of Hogwarts and it's secrets--but <em>how</em> did you find them? <em>When</em> did you find them? Questions, so many <em>questions</em> for you yet I can't ask you them--avoidance</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You keep avoiding me Evans, but <em>why</em>? Everyone else has fallen for my acting, but not you, <em>not you</em>--you're such a mystery Evans, <em>so different</em>, <em>so unique</em>--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ah--we have so much more in common than I thought, orphans, halfbloods, and we both can speak parseltongue--<em><strong>parseltongue!</strong></em> You're already such a mystery Evans, but <em>now?</em> Now you're even more of a mystery--but I will solve that mystery of you Evans, <em>I will</em>--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You yelled at me, angry and frustrated, but <em>what's this?</em> This <em>weird</em> feeling, like my stomach clenching and squeezing itself from the inside out, ah but wait--it's not just my stomach but my heart too--but why? <em><strong>Why?</strong></em>--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Guilty, <em>I</em> felt <em>guilty</em> over making you upset, <em>but why?</em> I don't care <em>that much</em> for your feelings...<em>do I?</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A <em>crush</em>, <em>I</em> had a <em>crush</em>--<em><strong>Me!</strong></em> But...it's not so bad since it's you Evans...it doesn't seem to be the same for you though...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Friends</em>, we became <em>friends</em> Evans, no <em><strong>Harry</strong></em>--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry, <em>Harry</em>, <em><strong>Harry</strong></em>, I hope that this won't be in vain--</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Think of <em>me</em> please, like <em>I</em> think of <em>you</em>.</p></div>
