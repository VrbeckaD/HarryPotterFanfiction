    <p>The train rattled on.</p><p>Remus was aware – in a rather vague, distant sort of way – that he was not alone, and yet, he kept his eyes closed and his mind drifting. Maybe…Yes, maybe, once he’d open them, he’d see <em>them</em>…Peter would be huddled into a corner, a sketchbook resting against his propped up legs, ink stains on his fingertips, his nose, his jumper. James and Sirius would be throwing chocolate frogs into each other’s mouths, or maybe plan the first prank of the year, or maybe bicker about Quidditch, or maybe, or maybe, or maybe…</p><p>The train rattled on, the sound, a fading background music, a lullaby, a song that spoke of family, and safe, and <em>home</em>.</p><p>James’ voice, hushed like a secret.</p><p>Someone answering. Was it Sirius? Peter? He couldn’t tell.</p><p>There was another person there. Smart and soft, but also strong. Lily must have joined them, then. Or maybe Marlene or Dorcas.</p><p>The train – stropped?</p><p>Remus shivered, the cold, so painfully familiar, settling into his bones, his heart, his very soul, rousing him from his slumber and he blinked. It was dark in the compartment, <em>their</em> compartment, but…<em>they</em> weren’t here, were they?</p><p>Turning his head, Remus’ eyes fell on the boy across from him and even in the twilight of the train he could see it. See him.</p><p>
  <em>James?</em>
</p><p>The name on the tip of his tongue, sweet and rich like the best of Honeyduke’s chocolate but no…not James.</p><p><em>It’s not right</em>, he thought, <em>the eyes are not right</em>.</p><p>Not James</p><p>The sweetness faded, leaving nothing but a bitter aftertaste and an aching heart.</p><p><em>James is gone</em>, he reminded himself, <em>Peter is gone, Sirius is –</em></p><p>The voices he’d heard before were still there, different now, more real. Confused. Panicked.</p><p>“Quiet!” he rasped out, trying to orientate himself in the darkness, to take it all in, to look around and see the children around him, see the clouds of their breaths in the air, “Stay where you are.” He stood up, the quickly conjured fire in his hand filling the compartment with flickering light but before he could reach the door, it slid open, a hooded figure towering over them. A Dementor.</p><p>Before Remus could properly think about what that meant, however, the Dementor took a slow, rattling breath and a body hit the floor.</p><p>“Harry!” someone cried out.</p><p>“None of us are hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks,” he announced to the Dementor. It felt wrong, saying <em>his</em> name again, after all these years. “Go.”</p><p>The Dementor did not go. Of course, it didn’t, why would it? The Ministry might have disagreed, but Dementors followed their own rules – always had, always would.</p><p>Another breath of the Dementor, the air getting colder and colder still, and Remus could feel himself giving in. He remembered the Bite, his parents’ tears, the pain of his first transformation, bones breaking and skin tearing apart only to knit itself together all twisted and wrong. He remembered the fear of being found out, long, lonely nights in the Shrieking Shack. He remembered the War. He remembered the dead. He remembered Sirius and Peter and James –</p><p>James.</p><p>
  <em>Come on, Moony.</em>
</p><p>He was still there. Somehow, after twelve years, he was still there.</p><p>
  <em>You can do it.</em>
</p><p>He remembered weekends in Hogsmeade, the taste of Butterbeer and the sound of laugher.</p><p>He remembered late nights and early mornings in the Common Room, the warmth of the fire.</p><p>He remembered seeing a big, majestic stag for the first time, and realising that he was not alone anymore.</p><p>“Expecto Patronum.”</p><p>For the first time in years a silvery cloud broke from his wand, weak, but within the smoke Remus could still make out the shape of four legs and long, shaggy fur.</p><p><em>Damn you, Padfoot</em>, he thought just before the Dementor left and the Patronus faded into nothingness and Remus let out a sigh of relieve.</p><p>It didn’t take long for the other Dementors to leave the train, clearly not finding what they were looking for and one owl to Hogwarts and several pieces of chocolate later, all the children were back on their feet, more or less feeling okay, or as okay as one could feel after being ambushed by Azkaban’s guards.</p><p>Somewhere in the back of Remus’ mind, like an echo, like a shadow, like a distant memory, James scoffed.</p><p>
  <em>Flash bastard.</em>
</p><p><em>Shut up</em>, Remus wanted to say, <em>you’re just as bad</em>.</p><p>And in his mind, James rolled his eyes and laughed.</p><p>The train rattled on.</p>
<hr/><p>Remus’ room was mostly bare. A yellow piece of parchment stuck to the wall with his classes written in dark ink. A bed in the corner, the mattress hard and lumpy. A chest of drawers, empty. His trunk, full of threadbare robes, worn and torn and patched up more times than he could count, a stack of letters addressed to Sirius, most unfinished and all unsent, a photo album, filled with memories of a life that had long since passed – Remus couldn’t bear to part from it just as he couldn’t bear to look at it, couldn’t bear to see the faces of all those who’d died, and for what?</p><p>In a way, it somehow reminded him of the apartment he and Sirius had shared after Hogwarts, the small one with the thin walls, in the heart of Camden. An old sofa with permanent blood stains that reeked of spilled beer and cigarette smoke. A table covered in used mugs, muggle magazines, and empty chocolate wrappings. A kitchenette that was barely used – <em>Sirius leaning against the counter, wearing nothing but a faded David Bowie t-shirt and boxers, long hair pulled up into a messy bun, one hand holding a cigarette, the other a coffee, smudged make-up around his eyes. He was truly beautiful. </em></p><p>
  <em>“Morning, Moony.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Morning, Pads.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You only coming in now?”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yeah.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Silence. They barely saw each other these days, constantly on missions for the Order. For Dumbledore.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Where’ve you been, then?” Sirius finally ask, careful, too careful to be truly casual.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Sirius.” Remus sighed and ran a hand down his face, shrugging out of his coat. “You know I can’t –”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Tell me, yeah,” Sirius finished the sentence, a note of bitterness in his voice, “Just like with everything else...”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Remus blinked, taken aback by the sharpness of the words, the hardness in Sirius’ eyes.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’m sorry.” And he was. He hated not being able to tell Sirius about his missions, about the Werewolf packs he had to seek out, the painful transformations, the taste of blood in his mouth, the constant fear of being found out.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Yeah.” Sirius smiled sadly, stubbing the cigarette out in the overflowing ashtray next to him. “I know.” The brunet pushed himself off the counter and walked into the bathroom, leaving Remus alone with his aching bones and the nagging suspicious that somehow, somewhere, they’d gone terribly wrong…</em>
</p><p>Shaking himself out of the memories, Remus sighed. He wouldn’t get any sleep any time soon. Instead he put on an extra worn sweater, grabbed his wand and left the room, stepping out into the quiet, dark corridor, down the familiar hallways of what once had been his home, towards the Astronomy Tower.</p>
<hr/><p>It was a clear night. The stars burned bright in the sky, oblivious to their audience.</p><p>“You should be in bed, Remus.” Remus jumped slightly at the familiar voice behind his back. Years of sneaking around too ingrained to not light a spark of fear inside of him at getting caught.</p><p>“My apologies, professor,” he muttered, turning his head just enough to see Professor McGonagall step next to him, head turned up-wards.</p><p>“There is no need for that anymore, Remus,” she said, a hint of amusement in her voice, “You’re a long way from being a student.”</p><p>He didn’t answer, didn’t know what he could possibly say so instead he looked back at the stars. There was Canis Major. Sirius, the Dog star, the brightest of them all.</p><p>“He liked coming up here.” Remus didn’t know why he was telling her this. “Sirius.”</p><p>A chuckle. “I can’t say I’m surprised.”</p><p>“He always loved the stars.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence, both Professors looking at the sky, then – “Forgive me for being too forward,” McGonagall said, “But I’d say he loved the moon even more.”</p><p>Remus blinked and turned his head, looked at his old teacher who was looking right back at him, a rare smile playing around the corners of her mouth.</p><p>“You knew.” It wasn’t a question rather than a statement, a statement that, now that Remus thought about it, should have been obvious.</p><p>“Of course, I knew,” McGonagall replied, “It was hard to miss and after seven years I’d like to think that I know my students fairly well.”</p><p>Remus nodded, it made sense, really.</p><p>“Do you –” he started but paused, not sur how ask, not sure if he should as, “Did you ever think we made a mistake?” The words came tumbling out of his mouth before he could stop them. “Did you ever think he was innocent?”</p><p>There was a look in McGonagall’s eyes, uncharacteristically soft and sympathetic and, coming from anyone else, he would have thought it was pity but coming from her? McGonagall didn’t do pity.</p><p>“I think it is the hardest thing to accept that the people we love might not be the people we think they are. I think that war does horrible things to everyone, and I think that you, all of you…you were still so young.” She sounded sad, regretful, and it threw Remus to see her so open, so honest, so pained by the thought. “But to answer you’re question,” she continued, averting her gaze to look back up, up at the night sky above them, “I certainly hoped we were wrong.”</p><p>“So did I,” Remus confessed.</p><p>They stood silently, shoulder to shoulder, eyes turned skywards, each lost in their own heads. A quiet sort of companionship.</p><p>“You really should get some sleep, Remus,” McGonagall said after a few minutes, or maybe a few hours, Remus couldn’t tell anymore, “You’ll need it. The first day is always the worst.”</p><p>Nodding, Remus pushed himself away from the barriers. “Goodnight, Minerva,” he said, “And thank you.”</p><p>“Goodnight, Remus,” the other Professor muttered absentmindedly, and Remus left her to her thoughts while he, himself, made his way back to his bare room.</p>
<hr/><p>Remus was sure that McGonagall hadn’t meant this when she’d said that the first day was always the worst, he also found that the language of Wizards was lacking in times like these. He was seeing ghosts, not the literal kind, those he could handle, those he was used to, no…the kind that followed and haunted you – the invisible kind.</p><p>There, a cupboard that they had used more than once to hide in from a teacher or a Prefect on their nightly adventures.</p><p>Here, a blackened, burned stain on a tapestry where Peter had tried to hex the Slytherin Quidditch Captain in their fourth year and missed.</p><p>The secret passageway behind the portrait of Percival Pratt, the second-floor bathroom, the ever-changing, ever-moving, ever-winding staircases, all imprinted in his memory, echoes of a past long gone but never forgotten, the shadows of what he, of what <em>they</em>, once had been, lurking behind every corner.</p><p>As grateful as he was for Dumbledore to take him in, Remus had the inkling suspicion that, maybe, he’d made a mistake coming back here.</p><p>There were so many names and faces he recognized.</p><p>Remus remembered meeting Ronald Weasley right after he’d been born. He remembered playing with the twins and Percy, he wondered how Molly’s other children were doing.</p><p>Remus recognized Neville the second he walked into Remus’ classroom, so much like Alice and Frank, it hurt to think about.</p><p>Remus looked at Susan Bones and thought of her uncle and aunt and cousins who’d died just before it all had ended.</p><p>“Settle down, class!” he called out as the third-year Slytherins filed into the classroom together with Hufflepuff. The previous lesson with the Gryffindors and Ravenclaws had gone over well enough, even if he’d had to keep Harry from facing the Boggart. It was probably better that way. The cabinet on the desk rattled, affectively hushing the children in the room as they looked on with varying expressions of worry on their faces. “In here,” he began to explain, pointing at the cabinet, “Is a Boggart. Can anyone tell me what that is?”</p><p>Several hands shot into the air.</p><p>“Mister Malfoy.”</p><p>“A shapeshifter that takes on the form of what scares you the most,” the blond answered, his voice somewhat bored but Remus could see in his eyes that he was not as unaffected as he let on.</p><p>“Correct. Five points for Slytherin.” Slowly, Remus walked towards the desk and leaned against it, facing the class. “No one knows what a Boggart’s natural shape is, as everyone fears something. Taken by surprise, a Boggart can be a great threat you, however, there is simple, yet affective way to fight it. Laugher. A Boggart’s goal is to make you scared, the way to get rid of it, is to laugh at it. The spell you’re about to learn can, if pared with the right imagination, turn the Boggart into something funny. Please, repeat after me: <em>Riddikulus</em>.”</p><p>The class echoed the word, some more enthusiastic than others.</p><p>“Very good. Now, I want you to line up and think carefully about what you fear and how to make it into something funny.”</p><p>Several chairs scrubbed over the floor as the class stood up and hurried into a surprisingly straight line. Remus did not miss the way, Draco Malfoy seemed to be lagging behind, allowing others to push him at the end of the queue.</p><p>“Mister Smith,” Remus addressed the first student, “Do you know what the Boggart will show you?” Zacharias nodded, visibly nervous. “And do you know what you want it to change into?” Another nod, smaller this time, as the boy readjusted his grip around his wand. “Then on three I will open this cabinet – One. Two. Three.” And with a simple wave of his wand, the cabinet opened, releasing the Boggart.</p>
<hr/><p>Remus had always enjoyed Halloween – first in Hogwarts with its feast, then, after they’d graduated, with his friends, in his and Sirius’ tiny flat in Camden, getting drunk and eating their weight in candies. Now, it only reminded him more of what he’d lost.</p><p>Seeing Harry didn’t help either. The boy was smart, caring, and so very much like his parents. Some part of Remus wondered how his life would have been if things had been different. He’d still be ‘uncle Moony’ instead of ‘Professor Lupin’, he’d have given Harry books for his birthdays and taught him small, harmless jinxes and hexes during the summers, he’d know Harry like his own son instead of looking at him know and seeing a stranger with James’ looks and Lily’s eyes.</p><p>It was the first Hogsmeade weekend of the year, and Harry had just left his office, clearly bothered by the Wolfsbane Potion Severus had brought, not that Remus could fault him. As far as he knew, Severus Snape was the least favourite teacher of the majority of the student body, with a particular dislike for Harry.</p><p>
  <em>Had things been different –</em>
</p><p>But things hadn’t been different, had they? James and Lily were dead, Harry had grown up knowing nothing of his true nature or family, and Severus Snape had become even more bitter than he’d been at the age of 16.</p><p><em>James and Lily would have been so proud of you</em>, he’d wanted to tell Harry, <em>being in Gryffindor, being on the Quidditch team, being such a bright kid…they’d have been proud</em>.</p><p>He remembered, when Harry had been born, how excited James had been, the healers at St. Mungo’s forcing him to take a Calming Draught while Lily had given birth to their son, and he remembered how proud he, himself, had been. A new life entering the world in the middle of a war, a reminder of what they were fighting for. And Sirius – had he already worked for Voldemort, then? Had he already planned his treason?</p><p><em>He’s your friend, Moony</em>, James’ voice reminded him gently, <em>no matter what he did</em>.</p><p>“You were my friend, too,” Remus whispered to the book in front of him, blinking away the tears that threatened to run down his cheeks.</p><p>Sighing at his own thoughts, Remus shifted in the chair and winced. His joints ached whenever it got this close to the full moon. Pushing away every and any thoughts of the up-coming transformation, Remus got up to make his way to the Great Hall.</p>
<hr/><p>Remus knew fear. He was afraid whenever the full moon approached. He’d been afraid during the war, any owl, any Patronus, could have carried the message of yet another death. Any mission could have been the last.</p><p>This was different.</p><p>It wasn’t just fear – it was cold terror, it was guilt and shame and something else, something he could not name but that left him paralyzed and covered in cold sweat, his hands trembling as he locked his door with perhaps more charms than strictly necessary.</p><p><em>Sirius was here</em>, was the only thought running through his mind, <em>Sirius was here</em>.</p><p>Not only had he broken out of Azkaban, something that should have been impossible in and of itself, but he had also, somehow, broken into Hogwarts.</p><p>
  <em>But how?</em>
</p><p><em>You know how</em>, James answered somewhat snappishly.</p><p>
  <em>Do I?</em>
</p><p>Sirius’ Animagus form was one possibility, of course, but what if – <em>what if?</em></p><p><em>What if, what?</em> James retorted, <em>what d’ya think he did? Learn some tricks from Lord Voldemort himself?</em></p><p>
  <em>What if?</em>
</p><p>It was ridiculous, the whole thing was ridiculous, Remus knew this, and yet…</p><p><em>Dumbledore should know</em>, he thought. He really should. What they’d done, apart from being highly illegal, it should have also been impossible, and telling Dumbledore would surely help him find Sirius.</p><p>
  <em>Then why haven’t you?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Shut up, Prongs.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Let me tell you why. ‘Cause it’s bullshit, and you know it. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Shut up, Prongs!</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And why would Sirius break in on Halloween while everyone’s at dinner when he really wanted to kill Harry?</em>
</p><p>“SHUT UP, PRONGS!” The glass of water he’d kept on the chest of drawers exploded into a million tiny pieces, leaving a dark, wet trail on the wood, and Remus stood in the middle of the room, panting heavily. “Fuck!”</p><p>The thing was, he also knew what it looked like. Remus hadn’t missed the way Severus had eyed him during the staff meeting earlier, the mistrust, the hatred. It didn’t take a genius to figure out to what conclusion the Potions master had come, and with good reason – no person would be able to simply walk into Hogwarts, not without help. Remus only hoped that Dumbledore wouldn’t believe the same thing.</p>
<hr/><p>As it turned out, Dumbledore didn’t believe the same thing. At least not really.</p><p>“I’m sure it comes to no surprise to you that some of the teachers have raised their concerns about your past relations to Sirius Black,” the headmaster had said after the full moon, “I have full trust in you, Remus, and do not believe in any way, that you helped Black break into the Castle, but, to calm any concerns, I feel compelled to ask if there is anything you might want to tell me.”</p><p>The calm demeanour of Dumbledore had always agitated Remus more than anything, as if nothing could upset the ever-present twinkle in his eyes as he looked over his half-moon glasses. Just like that day.</p><p>“No, sir,” Remus had answered, careful to keep his mind clear, “I’m afraid I have no idea how he could have managed that. It should be impossible.”</p><p>“Indeed,” Dumbledore had said mildly, “Just as breaking out of Azkaban should be impossible, but here we are.”</p><p>“I’m sorry I can’t help you.”</p><p>“Not to worry.” Dumbledore had smiled slightly, mysteriously, “I have no doubt that it will all turn out as it should.”</p><p>The rumour mill was buzzing with theories of how Sirius might have managed to get into the Castle, but that was to be expected, while Remus was becoming more and more certain that something was wrong. It just didn’t add up.</p><p>Why would Sirius break in on Halloween of all days?</p><p>Not that Remus had the time or the energy to ponder on such thoughts. The closer it got to the end of the year, the more anxious the students got. And then there was Harry.</p><p>“If you knew my dad, you must have known Sirius Black as well,” the boy had said after one lesson in fighting Dementors.</p><p>“What gives you the idea?” <em>What do you know?</em></p><p>“Nothing – I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too…”</p><p>Remus had relaxed. <em>Nothing important, then</em>. And yet…</p><p><em>He has a right to know, doesn’t he?</em> Remus had thought. <em>He never got the chance to meet any of us, and I’m the only one who could tell him</em>, except…he couldn’t. Not now. Not like this.</p><p>And then it happened again.</p><p>“It appears Sirius Black has once more found his way into the Castle,” Dumbledore announced, “This time, however, he also had access into the Gryffindor Tower.”</p><p>There were a few audible gasps from the professors around him while Remus barely dared to breathe.</p><p>
  <em>Why?</em>
</p><p>It was the only question that mattered, in the end.</p><p>
  <em>Why?</em>
</p><p>Because it didn’t make sense. Breaking into Gryffindor Tower with a knife of all things to – what? Slit Harry’s throat?</p><p>
  <em>Maybe he just went mad in Azkaban.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Bull. Shit.</em>
</p><p>And <em>then</em>, Remus found the Map. Their Map. On Harry.</p>
