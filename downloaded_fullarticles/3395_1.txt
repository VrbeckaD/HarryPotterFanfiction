    <p>Draco touched his cheek one last time before opening the door to the DMLE lab. His fingers didn’t feel any swelling but the area still felt inflamed to his eyeball. As he sat at his desk, he pulled the little pot of bruise paste from his pocket and rubbed another bit over his cheekbone. If ever again he saw the muggle that punched him, he’d hex his ugly muggle nose to twice its regular hideous size.</p>
<p>He stared at the paperwork in front of him, determined to finish it all before lunch so he could get in some brewing time while Lydia was off for her lunch break. She should have retired nine months ago and left the lab to him. As it was though, no one trusted him there by himself. And so she remained, driving Draco spare with her lax attitude about the safety of Aurors.</p>
<p>As soon as she left, Draco gathered ingredients for a Wideye Potion for the Aurors to use during stakeouts. There never seemed to be enough to go around. He was just crushing the snake fangs in his mortar when Potter came in.</p>
<p>“Malfoy.” Potter nodded at him, then looked around. “Lydia gone to lunch already?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Is there something I can help you with?”</p>
<p>Potter cleared his throat and set a small vial on the table next to Draco’s mortar. “Yeah, erm… We need this analysed. Today, if possible. See if it matches the sample from last week.”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” Draco said, still focused on his mortar. “Just set it in my box and I’ll take care of it as soon as this gets simmering.” He heard Potter setting the vial down on his desk, but then nothing. “Is there anything else?”</p>
<p>Potter came to lean against the table nearby. Draco added some herbs to his mortar and kept crushing the contents. His heart started to race, waiting for - well he didn’t know what he was waiting for exactly.</p>
<p>Finally, Potter said quietly, “I, er, didn’t know you were gay.”</p>
<p>Draco sighed and shook his head. Fucking <em>Prophet</em> and their nosy photographers. That flash bulb scared the muggle man he was with so much, thinking he was being set up somehow, it had earned Draco a punch in the face. “Congratulations, you’re the last wizard in all of England to learn of it. Come to make fun?”</p>
<p>“No, of course not. I just - I’ve never met anyone that was - was gay and… “</p>
<p>Draco kept grinding until he had a fine powder in his mortar, his annoyance growing with each breath Potter took.</p>
<p>“Erm, how,” Potter cleared his throat, “how did you know?”</p>
<p>Draco slammed the mortar on the table and grabbed a jar of billywig stings. He threw them into the cauldron one by one. “The usual, I suppose. I sucked a cock and I liked it. Listen, is there anything,” Draco turned to glare at Potter, “else?” he finished softly. Potter stared intently at Draco, giving him pause.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the usual sort of rude inquiry. Potter seemed genuinely curious. Or confused. Draco tilted his head to ask, “Potter, are you - “ but he cut off abruptly when Auror Johnson came in. Potter’s eyes widened and he took a step back.</p>
<p>“Malfoy,” Johnson said briskly. “Is Lydia here?”</p>
<p>“No,” Draco said, carefully ignoring Potter. “She’s gone to lunch already. Is there something I can help you with?”</p>
<p>Johnson gave an insolent shrug, “Thanks, but I’ll just wait for Lydia.”</p>
<p>Potter cleared his throat and shuffled for the door. Before he left, Draco said, “Potter, I won’t tell anyone - that I put a rush on your sample.” He paused for emphasis. “Even if that means I have to stay late tonight.”</p>
<p>Potter gave him a curt nod and followed Johnson out the door.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Draco did indeed work late, but no one noticed or cared. And it was all for naught because Potter never showed. No matter, Draco didn’t really care what Potter was after anyway. By the time he left the Ministry, a fine rain had begun to fall. Draco lamented the yucky October weather as he pulled his umbrella from his bag. He considered Apparating home, but needed to stop and pick up dinner. </p>
<p>As he opened the umbrella, he caught an odd movement from the corner of his eye where the rain wasn’t falling quite right. Walking down the street, he also saw little puddles rippling from invisible feet. Potter must be following him. Draco almost laughed at the fond memories this dredged up. He stopped off for curry - enough for two - before heading home. </p>
<p>He heard the faint echo of a second set of feet as he climbed the stairs to his flat. Pushing the door open, Draco turned to the seemingly empty space behind him. “Coming in?”</p>
<p>Potter whipped off the Invisibility Cloak and shrugged sheepishly. “How’d you know?”</p>
<p>“Next time choose a day that isn’t so rainy. Would you like some tea?” He held up the bag of food. “And dinner?”</p>
<p>Potter shrugged and followed Draco in, glancing around the single room. If he’d known he was having company, Draco would have transfigured the bed into a sofa. As it was, the bed loomed large as an erumpent and twice as explosive in the small space. Draco set the bag of food on the small table and turned to pull two forks from the drawer. Potter wandered around, touching all of Draco’s books and the pictures on his dresser before finally settling at the table with him.</p>
<p>“Nice place.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. It gets claustrophobic sometimes but I just shrink all the furniture and it’s not so bad.”</p>
<p>Potter nodded absently and began to eat. Draco waited for Potter to take a large bite before asking, “So, you want to fuck me later?”</p>
<p>As expected. Potter choked on his rice. Draco laughed as Potter spluttered. “No! No, that’s not - I wasn’t - I just - “</p>
<p>“Relax, Potter, I was only teasing.” Draco’s smile faded and he started eating, watching Potter’s blush deepen before fading to light splotches. “You want to go to a club?”</p>
<p>“Well… I tried that already. But the first time made me nauseous. And the second time I tried pushing past the queasiness and ended up having a panic attack.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“Yeah… and that’s not really safe anyway. I mean, you were caught in a muggle club, right?”</p>
<p>Now it was Draco’s turn to blush. “Yes, I was. Usually I go out glamoured. Once I took a portkey to France for the weekend.”</p>
<p>Potter sighed and leaned his head on his hand while he poked at his food. “It’s so much trouble and I don’t even know… I don’t know what I’m doing.”</p>
<p>Draco didn’t miss the way Potter’s eyes darted to the bed across the room. “Don’t you have friends to talk about this with?”</p>
<p>“No. Hermione, you know her parents are muggles… And they’re great people but… She’s said a few things that made me think she wouldn’t be okay with it. And Ron, he didn’t agree with her but he didn’t disagree either? So I don’t know what he thinks. I’m not close enough to anyone else to ask. And of course there’s always the chance someone’ll go to the paper about it…”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you afraid I will?”</p>
<p>Potter’s eyes met his. “Should I be?”</p>
<p>Draco’s lip quirked up in a half smile. “And jeopardize our budding friendship? Of course not! Your secret’s safe with me.”</p>
<p>“Thanks then,” Potter said with a nervous bite to his lip. He shoveled the food in his mouth so of course he finished long before Draco. He got up to pace nervously while Draco cleaned up the remains of their meal and stored the leftover food in the fridge.</p>
<p>“What’s through here?” Potter asked, pointing down the short hall.</p>
<p>“Straight ahead is the linen cupboard. The door on the right is the loo. The one on the left should be the bedroom but I use it as a home lab. It’s warded so any muggles that are here don’t wander in. That’s why I sleep out here.”</p>
<p>Potter glanced at the bed again, then turned his back on it. “Have a lot of muggles over?”</p>
<p>“Not really. My neighbor occasionally.” He continued with a shrug, “Sometimes I bring a one-off home and tell them I use the room for storage. But none of them care enough to look closely.”</p>
<p>Potter nodded and continued pacing. Draco transfigured the bed into a sofa and sat. After wringing his hands about it, Potter sat next to him. Silence dragged on, weighing on them both. Finally Draco had to ask, “Why me?”</p>
<p>“You’re the only one… I don’t know who else to turn to.”</p>
<p>Draco let that sink in before asking, “Anything you want to talk about? Ask me about?”</p>
<p>Abruptly, Potter shot to his feet. “Yeah, not tonight? Maybe - just some other time. I should probably go.”</p>
<p>“All right,” Draco said slowly. Before Potter could open the door, Draco reached for his wrist. “Wait…”</p>
<p>Potter’s eyes widened and Draco was struck anew by their vibrant color. Green eyes flicked down to Draco’s mouth and Potter’s tongue darted out to lick his lips. </p>
<p>Eyes on Potter’s glistening lips, Draco said softly, “Maybe just one kiss before you go?”</p>
<p>A harsh exhale was the only warning before Potter’s lips descended on his. Immediately Draco knew this was a mistake. The soft moan Potter made coursed through Draco, setting his blood on fire. As Potter explored Draco’s mouth, a hundred blissful scenes played out in Draco’s mind, interspersed with a thousand scenes where Draco was left broken and alone. Draco leaned into Potter’s hand resting on his waist and knew he would suffer long and hard for giving in to the temptation to kiss Potter.</p>
<p>“I’m always here,” Draco whispered, “if you need me.”</p>
<p>Potter’s breath came in little bursts, his eyes even wider and brighter than before. He nodded jerkily and fumbled for the door knob. Without a backward glance, he raced down the stairs and into the rain.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Draco rose before sunrise the next day for work. He always went in early on Fridays so he could leave after lunch to run errands before the weekend. Too often he was called into the Auror lab on Saturdays and so it helped to have Friday afternoon free.</p>
<p>He brewed up another batch of Forgetfulness Potion and filed his paperwork accordingly. Vaguely he made note of when Potter arrived but was not surprised that Potter made no sign of recognition. Aside from the occasional prank, the Aurors in the department had ignored Draco as much as they could in the year he’d been working there. Today would be no different.</p>
<p>After putting the final touches on the Wideye Potion, he gathered his things and made his way to the lifts. He heard the grumbles the Aurors made about his early workday, but was long since accustomed to ignoring it. Say what they would, he put in more hours than any of them and Robards did not begrudge Draco the early dismissal from work.</p>
<p>He made four Apparition jumps to his various suppliers to collect ingredients he used in his home brewing business. It had taken a while to find suppliers that could do good work, while still giving him a fair price. Being a Malfoy in the post-war world had been a tricky transition, but Draco was managing. </p>
<p>His mail order potions business had been going strong when word got out he was the one behind it. Subscriptions dropped considerably but by then, he had enough loyal customers that didn’t care who did the brewing so long as the potions worked. And thanks to journals and notes left to him by Severus Snape, they all worked better than the usual array of potions. He specialized in rare and hard to find potions that cured the odd ailments St Mungo’s didn’t know how to handle. He hoped his position at the Ministry would secure itself so he could quit brewing at home, but that day was still a long way off. </p>
<p>Leftovers were sufficient for dinner and then Draco went to the lab to package a few orders that would go out that night. And then he would decide what needed brewing over the weekend. A sharp knock at the door startled him.</p>
<p>“Oh, Potter. I didn’t expect to see you so soon.” Draco held the door wide to let him in.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I wasn’t sure either but… I just didn’t want to go home.” Potter ruffled his hair and shrugged out of his jacket. He hugged it to his body and looked around, finally sitting down at the kitchen table rather than the bed.</p>
<p>“Did you want to eat?”</p>
<p>“No, thank you. I already did.” Potter’s leg jiggled under the table and he still hugged his jacket tight.</p>
<p>Draco wasn’t sure what to do next. Hesitantly he sat at the table and waited a few moments for Potter to bring up his reasons for being in Draco’s flat. As the silence stretched on, with Potter nervously drumming his foot, Draco was once again the one to give in.</p>
<p>“Did you want to talk?”</p>
<p>Eyes on the table in front of him, Potter shook his head.</p>
<p>A grin spread across Draco’s lips. He jerked his head to the bed. “Want to snog?’</p>
<p>Nail biting joined the leg jiggle, but then Potter nodded. Draco stood and held a hand out. “Come on, then.” When Potter stood, Draco took the jacket from him and laid it over the back of the chair. He transfigured the bed to a sofa and heard Potter sigh in relief.</p>
<p>Draco sat down, pulling Potter down to sit on his left side. Draco put his left arm around Potter’s shoulders and leaned in for a kiss, his right hand coming up to cup Potter’s cheek. And fuck if his mouth wasn’t as hot as Draco remembered.</p>
<p>Potter’s arm came around to circle Draco’s waist but his other was trapped between his body and the sofa. He twisted forward to get a better grip on Draco and that knocked their knees together. Potter shifted again until he was nearly straddling Draco to get their bodies closer.</p>
<p>“I think I want - do you - “ Potter stuttered between kisses, but he seemed unable to continue. His hand gripped Draco tight and the kiss turned frantic as Potter tried to sort through the new sensations.</p>
<p>“Anything you want,” Draco whispered. Dizzy with desire, Draco pulled Potter closer, needing more. He gripped tight to Potter’s thigh, trying not to drown in the hot rush of lust as the kisses became slow and lingering. </p>
<p>“Wait,” Potter said suddenly. He wrenched away from Draco and settled on the far side of the sofa. He rested his head in his hands and took several deep breaths. “Wait,” he repeated softly.</p>
<p>Draco rested his hands on his thighs and dropped his head back with a sigh. He crossed his arms and stared at Potter, hunched in misery. “All right there?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I’m just - “ He sighed and stood up to pace. Turning to the door, he said, “I think I should go.”</p>
<p>“You can stay. Just stay. We don’t have to…” Draco pointed to the little hallway, “I was going to brew a few things. Want to keep me company?”</p>
<p>“Maybe next time. I should go. Thanks for… “ He ruffled his hair again and pulled the door open. “Bye, then.” Before Draco could react, the door slammed shut.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Draco didn’t see Potter the rest of the weekend and wondered if his big gay freak-out was already over. He hadn’t anticipated such a short run, and felt he should have at least offered Potter a blow job. He sullenly sorted potion requests and other paperwork while lamenting his lost chance at having Potter in his bed.</p>
<p>On Monday, Lydia botched yet another Wiggenweld Potion by adding too much honey at the end, but Draco was prepared and already had the requisition for more ingredients ready to file. He could brew it after she left for the day. He searched his desk for another form seeking permission to vanish the weaker brew. What if Robards was simply tossing this paperwork in his fire? Was he even building evidence that it was time for Lydia to retire? </p>
<p>He only caught one glimpse of Potter as Macmillan took orders for an afternoon coffee run. Potter turned away from him as Macmillan went through the rest of the department, but didn’t pause to ask if Draco wanted to add anything. It wasn’t unusual for Draco to be left out of these sorts of things and he wasn’t surprised Potter didn't speak up for him.</p>
<p>Not that it mattered to Draco. He didn’t even like coffee and whatever was brought back for him was bound to be poisoned. Which reminded him he had a few antidotes that needed brewing so he didn’t have time for coffee and idle chit chat anyway.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Draco trudged up the last few steps and paused outside his door to take a deep breath. The ache in his feet and back throbbed along with his heartbeat. Sinking into a boiling hot bath was all he could think about.</p>
<p>Those thoughts fled his brain the moment he opened the door to find Harry Potter sitting on the sofa, feet propped up on the coffee table as though he were in his own home where such things were allowed. </p>
<p>“I let myself in,” Potter said unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Draco set his messenger bag and the bag of food he was carrying on the kitchen table. “I see that. So sure of your welcome?”</p>
<p>Potter gave him a half-smile, “The wards let me in.”</p>
<p>“<em>Let</em> you in, or didn’t object too strongly?”</p>
<p>Potter had the grace to blush. “Maybe it was the second one.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t expecting you but I’m sure there’s enough food for us both.” Draco shrugged out of his jacket and hung it up by the door. “I hope you like Italian.” He crossed to the sink and washed his hands before finding them plates and forks.</p>
<p>“I already ate. You’re home kind of late.”</p>
<p>Draco put the plates back and sat down at the table. “I had some after hours work to do.”</p>
<p>Potter started pulling the containers from the bag, opening them like a nosy git before handing them to Draco. He snitched a piece of garlic bread but Draco didn’t comment.</p>
<p>“I came by. Before. On Saturday.” </p>
<p>“I was called into the Ministry.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, Robards must whine at you nonstop about overtime.”</p>
<p>Draco snorted, “Robards doesn’t pay me overtime.” He found his salad and the little container of dressing. The first bite reminded him how long it had been since lunch.</p>
<p>“Oh,” Potter mumbled, stuffing most of his slice of bread in his mouth.</p>
<p>Draco ate in silence, inwardly laughing every time Potter’s eyes strayed to the sofa. It was clear what he was after. How long would they play this game? How far was Potter willing to take things? And could Draco risk throwing more of himself into this mess?</p>
<p>“Come to any decisions yet? About what you want?”</p>
<p>Potter audibly swallowed the tomato he’d plucked from the remains of Draco’s salad. “Er, no… not really. No.” He coughed and ran his hand through his hair.</p>
<p>“Do you want to talk about it?”</p>
<p>“No,” Potter said, grinning, “I’m more ‘hands on’ than ‘talk it out.’”</p>
<p>“I’d certainly not turn away ‘hands on’ any time,” Draco said with a return grin. “But if you did want to talk, I would.”</p>
<p>Potter’s face softened. “I appreciate that but… I don’t know what to say. I don’t know how to sort through these things. And kissing you the other night… It was the first thing that felt right. But after…”</p>
<p>“All that shit people say came rushing back?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Potter sighed. “I hear my uncle and aunt and all their… vitriol. And I hate it because I don’t even care what they think. They’re horrible human beings and so why does their opinion count for anything?”</p>
<p>“They’re still the people that raised you, good or bad. My father didn’t take my news well and now - “</p>
<p>“Lucius has always been narrow minded. Not sure why you’re surprised he reacted that way.”</p>
<p>Although Potter’s words were true, they still stung. Draco shrugged and continued eating his ravioli in cream sauce so he didn’t have to respond. Potter must have known he’d crossed a line. He dropped his eyes to his second piece of garlic bread, tearing it into little pieces to eat. Draco almost hoped he’d choke on it, but that wouldn’t get him laid later so he changed the subject instead.</p>
<p>“Is this going to be a regular thing? You coming over here?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Draco vanished the rubbish and put his leftover food in the fridge. “Well when you decide, let me know and I’ll adjust the wards for you.” He shot a breath freshening charm at himself, then at a grinning Potter. “Come on, git, I don’t have all night.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you?” Potter asked as he followed Draco to the sofa.</p>
<p>“You only wish…”</p>
<p>Kissing a laughing Potter was more than Draco had hoped for this evening. His body still ached but that feeling ebbed away as passion rose up in its place. Potter seemed to be in a good mood and Draco took advantage of the moment to slip his hands under Potter’s shirt. He tensed under Draco’s hands but didn’t try to push him away. </p>
<p>Draco remembered his first awkward encounters with another man and how vulnerable he’d felt not knowing what was allowed and what was expected. This prompted him to babble between kisses, “You feel so good. I want to feel all your skin next to mine. I want to strip you down and suck your cock until you come down my throat. Can I take off your shirt?” </p>
<p>Not wanting Potter to feel alone, Draco pulled back to yank his own shirt over his head. He kissed Potter’s neck and whispered, “Help me get this off.” He pushed up on the shirt, and continued, “Tell me what you want. Anything… You can have it if you ask for it. Tell me… “ Potter’s shirt was driving Draco mad. It wouldn’t come off and Potter wasn’t helping, only gripping tight to Draco’s waist. Draco plunged his tongue deep into Potter’s mouth with a moan.</p>
<p>Without warning, Potter stood, shoving Draco to the floor. Draco cursed when his shoulder struck the corner of the coffee table.</p>
<p>“What the fuck, Potter?” He stood, rubbing his shoulder. “What is the matter with you?”</p>
<p>“It’s - you - you can’t say shit like that!”</p>
<p>“What - that I want you? Isn’t that why you’re here?” Draco crossed his arms over his bare chest. “Think you’re going to figure things out if we share a few kisses? Don’t you want more? Don’t you fantasize about more? Because honestly, if you aren’t wanking to the snog session from the other night, then maybe you’re not into men after all.”</p>
<p>Potter growled and tugged at his hair, “I am! I mean - I did but - fucking hell! It’s not that easy, all right?”</p>
<p>“It’s exactly that easy! I can see how hard you are,” Draco yelled with a careless gesture at the bulge in Potter’s jeans. “Don’t you want to get off?”</p>
<p>“Damn it! It’s not - this is just - it’s too fast!”</p>
<p>Instantly Draco felt contrite. “Fine, all right.” Draco held his hands up in a placating gesture. “I’m sorry.” He moved closer to hold Potter in a loose embrace. “I’m sorry. It’s been a while since I was new at this and I guess I’ve forgotten what it’s like. If you don’t want more, we don’t have to do any more.”</p>
<p>“I <em>do</em> want more,” Potter mumbled into Draco’s neck, “but I can’t just - let you… you know…”</p>
<p>Draco shook his head, “Uh-uh Potter… if you can’t say it, you can’t do it.” He dragged his lips along Potter’s jaw to his ear. He whispered, “Say it and I will. Tell me you want me to suck you off and I will.” He ran a hand over Potter’s erection and traced the skin above his waistband. </p>
<p>Potter moaned and gripped tighter to Draco’s waist. “I - I want it. You - a - blow job.  I <em>do </em> But I don’t know if I can…”</p>
<p>“With a man? Or with me? You can close your eyes. Then I could be anyone… Even a woman if that’s what you really wanted.”</p>
<p>He unfastened Potter’s jeans as they kissed again. A light shove sent Potter back to the sofa. Draco knelt between Potter’s legs and lifted his t-shirt enough to kiss the exposed skin of his belly. He hooked his fingers in Potter’s pants, ready to tug them down. “Please let me… Just a bit of fun. A mouth is just a mouth, right?”</p>
<p>Potter’s only answer was to lift his hips. His head dropped back with a sigh as Draco nuzzled the dark hairs surrounding his prick. The first lick around the head of his cock made Potter moan in a way that sent shivers down Draco’s back.</p>
<p>It wasn’t entirely true that a mouth was just a mouth. No matter how many blow jobs she’d given, a woman could never compete with a man in this area. Having a cock of his own gave Draco an expertise a woman could never match and he used all of it to make Potter squirm. Each moan and shiver made Draco harder until he felt pre-come soaking his pants. </p>
<p>“Dra - Mal - Malfoy, <em>fuck</em>... “ Draco looked up when Potter moaned his name. He clutched his shirt to his chest and watched every movement of Draco’s lips and tongue. Potter licked his lips and heaved a broken sigh. “It’s - almost - “ His hips thrust hard and fast and his head dropped back. With a high moan he came, dropping his shirt to plunge his hand into Draco’s cropped hair, the other bracing hard against the sofa cushions. “Yes, yes, <em>yes</em>... fucking hell!” His hips stilled and he dropped his hand to his side, melting into the sofa. </p>
<p>Draco stood and tugged his trousers and pants down. “Can I come on you?” he asked as he pumped his fist over his hard cock. Potter’s eyes were dazed as they met his. “Can I?” he asked again. Potter nodded, his eyes widening.</p>
<p>He was too close, too sensitive for it to last any longer. He’d hoped to draw it out, to have Potter’s hands on him, but seeing that glazed post-orgasm bliss on Potter’s face had him coming too quickly, spraying come on Potter’s belly making the muscles in his abdomen clench. And fuck if Potter wasn’t the most gorgeous thing Draco had ever seen - eyes still dazed and dilated, lips swollen and red, come on his spit-slicked cock, and his chest rising and falling with each rapid breath. </p>
<p>“Let me get my wand,” Draco said softly as he pulled his pants and trousers back up.</p>
<p>“I’ve got it.” Potter waved his hand over the mess and it vanished.</p>
<p>Draco smiled as he put his shirt back on. “Handy little trick.”</p>
<p>Potter shrugged and slowly pulled his clothes back together. “So… I guess I should go now.”</p>
<p>“Are you coming back?” Draco asked, hating how needy it sounded. He didn’t need Potter - Potter needed <em>him</em>. </p>
<p>“Yeah.” Potter stood but kept his eyes trained on his feet. “If that’s all right?”</p>
<p>“I'm always up for hands on activities,” Draco said, trying to get one last smile.</p>
<p>But Potter didn’t smile. He bit his lip nervously, nodded a goodbye, and Disapparated with barely a pop.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Draco smothered a yawn as he stirred the cauldron in front of him. Only a minute more and it would turn a blood red that indicated it was finished. And just in time too, because Draco was dead on his feet. He’d stayed up late every night for the past week hoping Potter would show up. The not knowing drove him mad, but twice he’d been rewarded with a late night visit. He hoped to sneak in a short nap during his lunch break so he could get through the rest of the day, but that was too unlikely to bet on.</p>
<p>What he needed was a strong cup of tea to perk him up. Down the hall, he heard the mumbled chorus of <em>Happy Birthday</em> from the break room. Probably half the department was there waiting on cake. He wouldn’t be welcome and grumbled to himself about the rule against food in the lab. </p>
<p>He bottled the Blood Replenishing Potion into sixteen single-serving vials, knowing Lydia would grumble because he didn’t use the one large bottle she preferred. Draco stored all his potions this way and she thought it was a great waste of space. As if wizards couldn’t conjure the bottles, shelves, and space for whatever they wanted. He labeled each one carefully, then stored them neatly in the potions cupboard and secured it with a spell.</p>
<p>After washing his hands, he made his way down the hall to the break room for his tea. Draco buried a groan when he found the six Junior Aurors still eating cake. They glowered at him and turned their backs, as if that would shield the cake from his view. But he didn’t want cake anyway. He grabbed his mug and a tea bag without comment. Briefly his eyes made contact with Potter as he left the room but neither of them said anything.</p>
<p>Draco sat on the floor of the locker room off the training center to scour his mug free of potential hexes and then filled it with boiling water from his wand. And not for the first time, wished he could enjoy his tea at a table with the others.</p>
