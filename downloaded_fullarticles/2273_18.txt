    <p>    This is one of the best times of the year.  To see the first years, walk into the Great Hall for the first time.  To see their eyes, open wide when the tall brown doors open displaying the rest of the students and staff.  Some are so eager, while others are a bit trepid.  Returning students are chatting fervently.  As they continue to catch up with one another, a few direct their attention to the head table, greeting professors with a smile.</p><p>    The hall echos with the excited chatter.  Students begin to make their way to the respective house tables.  Each is a long wooden masterpiece ornately decorated with House pride.  Appropriately colored table runners unroll and cloth banners float from the ceiling.  At the far left, the deep green banner boasts the Slytherin snake.  Hung above the next table, the badger adorns the royal yellow Hufflepuff banner.  The Gryffindor banner sports the lion on a lofty scarlet.  And the majestic blue banner flaunts the Ravenclaw eagle above the rightmost table.</p><p>    “Hi Professor Lupin!”  calls a third year, walking up from Ravenclaw table.  </p><p>    Lupin’s attention snaps to the tall ginger haired boy, tilting his head and smiling politely.  “Hello Nate, how was your summer?”</p><p>    “Oh it was wonderful; very relaxing.”  Nate exclaims.  “What did you wind up doing Professor?”</p><p>    “Oh nothing much Nate.  I’m very glad to be back at Hogwarts.”</p><p>    Nate nods and turns slightly to see the prefects ushering students to their house tables.  “I better get to my table.”</p><p>    Nodding in agreement, Lupin said, “Yes, you had better.  Stop by my office sometime Nate and catch me up on your summer adventures.”  Nate agrees and retreats to the Ravenclaw table.</p><p>    Lupin sweeps the room to find the remaining students locating seats.  The front of each table is left empty for the first years.  His eyes stop as they make contact with a young man with bright blue hair.  The young man’s hair swiftly changes from to rainbow hue back to blue.  A fourth year girl giggles at the display before finding her seat.</p><p>    “Teddy, could you sit please?  The first years will be coming in soon.”  says a blonde haired girl, Victoire.  The young man winks in her direction before find his seat.</p><p>    The Great Hall doors swing open, giving full view to Professor Neville Longbottom.  You, and the other first years, flood into the middle aisle between Hufflepuff and Gryffindor tables, following the Deputy Headmaster to the Sorting Hat.  Some of your fellow first years tremble with anxiety, while others’ happily accept the high fives of the older students.  Students eye up the different tables, pointing and whispering which one they hope they wind up sitting at.  You match strides with your friends.  Lupin takes immediate notice of the young man on your left, James Potter.  Honestly he is hard to miss, looking much like his father and grandfather.  You nudge the girl with long black hair to your right.</p><p>    “Emma!  Ooh look at the banner!”  You point to the Gryffindor banner.  The Lion roars down at the two of you.  Your train compartment mate giggles at the moving Lion.  Her eyes glistened when she points to the ghosts floating around.  “Looks like Headless Nick!”</p><p>    A playful ghost swishes down close to you and swipes the back of your head.  “Hey Lil Y/N!”  He says floating down in front of you.</p><p>    “Hi Uncle Fred!”  You grin at him.</p><p>    “Ready for Hogwarts kiddos?”  he asks says glancing between you and James.</p><p>    “Ready?!” James boasts.  “The real question Uncle is Hogwarts ready for us?”</p><p>    The ghost of Fred grins down at both of you.  “Oh it’s ready alright!  Anywho, who are you?” He turns his attention to the girl on your right.</p><p>    “Uhm… Emma.”  She stammered.  “You’re… you talk… Ghosts, they…”</p><p>    “Pleased to meet you Emma.” Fred took a bow, causing the children around to laugh.  “Anyway, all of you, have a great Sorting.  Only comes around once, and whatever you get… it’s going to be a great seven years!”  Fred swooped up again.  “Oh and Emma, nice pin.  If you ever need anything come find me.” Fred winked; Emma reached up to touch the pin that her mother gave her before she left.  It was a token to not forget where she came from, but to enjoy the new experiences, new world, and most of all new friends.</p><p>    You all pile down at the front of the Hall as the Sorting Hat begins it song.  James looks towards Lupin and gives a small smile.  Lupin returns it.  As the Hat drones on, you wonder if James will be sorted into Gryffindor, continuing the family tradition.  You watch Lupin shift his gaze from your nervous first year class to Minerva.  Tilting her head slightly, the Headmistress smiles slightly.  </p><p>    Concluding its song, the Hat looks to Longbottom who begins to read off names.  “Adams, John Michael; Applegate, Katie Rose.”  Neville reads off.  Your peers begin to go up one by one and sit down to be sorted.  When the Hat reveals the house, the older students hoot and cheer.  As the Hat proceeds, James elbows you and mumbles in your ear [“Could you imagine the fuss Aunt Minerva would have if she use Frogspawn soap?”] causing you to giggle.  The Headmistress give you and James a pointed look.  Your eyes glitter with mischief when you turn to tell Emma.  As she giggles, you look up to the staff table to find Lupin staring at you.  It a clear and burning look, like he can look directly into your soul.</p><p>    <em>Does he know who I am?  </em>You think.  <em>Did Mum or someone else ever mention who we are?  Teddy always says he’s not worth the time.  Mum says he wasn’t always that way.  James says his Dad still talks to him.  Should I?</em></p><p>    Your thoughts are interrupted as, “Lapez, Emma Rose” is called.  Soon Emma is sorted into Gryffindor.  James grins at her, mouthing that you’d both be there soon enough with her.  She just nods nervously, heading to the Gryffindor table.  Murmurs erupts as James is called up.  The whispers always come when the children of an Order member or prominent Death Eater come through, after all it hasn’t really been that long ago.  More whispers this time though, after all it was The Boy Who Lived’s first son.</p><p>    “Gryffindor!”  the Sorting Hat grunts.  James jumps from the stool, clambering over to the table where he was greeted with cheers and whoops.  You turn back around to catch Lupin visibly relax at the sign of James being sorted.  </p><p>    Not too long after, Professor Longbottom says, “Tonks, Sirius David.”  Once again whispers spread.  You watch as your tall, brown-haired twin emerges from the smaller crowd of First Years.  Sometimes you find yourself jealous at his resemblance of your mother.  He inherited the way her face glowed and her hair hung in a perfect mess.  Even though he slouches, he still towers above most of youfirst year students. You notice Lupin sitting up straight, white-faced studying your twin.  Sirius deliberately sits on the stool.  You make a mental note.<em>  Lupin doesn’t know.</em>  As the Hat declares Sirius as a Ravenclaw, you see Lupin’s face regain color.</p><p>    “Tonks, Y/N Y/M/N.”  Neville says.  As you stoll up to the stool, you go to sit down and plop right of the side of the stool.  Clumsy just like your mother.  Luckily others laugh with you, and you hop right back on for the Hat to be placed on your head.</p><p>    “Uhg… another Order kid.”  The Hat groaned.  “Guess you assume you’re going to be in Gryffindor.”</p><p>    “Well, I… well yes.”  You reply, not sure if in your head or aloud.  </p><p>    “I see… well then, you do have loyalty deeply embedded, that would make a good Hufflepuff… ooh, a powerful combination of fearlessness and mischief, or deadly mixture.  If you ask me, trouble…” The Sorting Hat muses.  You furrow your eyebrows confused and slightly annoyed.  After a long pause it declares, “Gryffindor!”</p><p>    Thrilled, you spring off the stool, looking back at Neville.  He grins and gives you a nudge to your table.  You practically sprint up, being met with high fives and cheers.  The enthusiasm radiates off of you.  James and Emma greet you, and Teddy flashes you a big grin.</p>
<hr/><p>    The rest of the Sorting Ceremony goes by in a flash.  You glance up one last time at Lupin and find his face is still pale.  Before you can contemplate what’s going through his head, the stool and Sorting Hat are magically replaced by an embellished podium.  The headmistress stands and moves gently and confidently to the foreground.  “Welcome to our new students, and welcome back to our returning students.”  McGonagall’s voice booms in the silent hall.  “I hope all of you had an enjoyable summer, and now the time has come for us to continue our studies.  Please remember our rules.  A few to highlight:  one curfew is at 10pm for FIrst and Second year students.  And midnight for the rest of students.  After dinner, the outdoors is off limits for the First and Second years.  Each common room is open to all students until 10pm, at which point students who are not a part of the house must vacate.  Please remember to be back in your respective common rooms or dormitories by curfew.  The rest of <a href="https://musingpredilection.tumblr.com/post/182479264311/the-power-of-a-name-series-log" rel="nofollow"><b>Series Chapter Log</b></a>the rules and specifics, your prefects will let you know.  First years, don’t hesitate to ask if you have any doubt.  And with that… It’s going to be a great year.  Let the feasts begin!”  </p><p>    At that note, the tables begin to be filled with silver-covered platters containing all the meat one could imagine; potatoes and gravy; and peas and carrots.  Pumpkin juice pitchers appear.  This is by far way more food than you have ever seen; Teddy was not exaggerating.  Your eyes become way too big for your stomach as you pile on your plate.  James swiftly puts food into his mouth before loading the rest onto his plate.  Across the table from you, Emma takes her first sip of pumpkin juice.</p><p>    “What-do-ya-thin?” James mumbles through chewing.</p><p>    Emma nods her head.  “It’s good.  Very good.”  </p><p>    “Yeah!  It’s our favorite, wait until you have butterbeer.  That’s the richest stuff you’ll ever drink.”  You say.  The three of you continue to chat and meet other Gryffindors nearby.</p><p>    As the feast concludes, students around you begin to make their way to other tables greeting friends again.  You glance around and find Sirius with a few other first year Ravenclaws.  Waving at him, you decide to meander on over there.  “Hi Sirius!”</p><p>    “Hi, Y/N.”  He says.  “See you did Gryffindor.  Worried for nothing, eh?”</p><p>    “Yeah, I just really, REALLY wanted to be with James.” you replied.</p><p>    “And you are.” Teddy comments, as he ruffles your hair.  He tips his head towards your twin.  “and Ravenclaw, very respectable Sirius.”</p><p>    “Thank you, Teddy.” Sirius smiled shyly.  “I think Mum would be proud.”</p><p>    “Agreed, now we have people in each house from the family.  Gran Dromeda in Slytherin, Mum in Hufflepuff, You in Ravenclaw, and this weirdo and I in Gryffindor.”  Teddy says playfully nudging you.  “Anywho, Lil Bro.”  Teddy tilts his head towards a Ravenclaw prefect who is attempting to get the attention of the First years.  “It seems like your house is headed up to the tower.  Enjoy!  We’ll see you tomorrow at breakfast ok!  If you need anything, feel free to come and find me or ask Professor Longbottom, ok?” Sirius just simply nods.  “Alright, Kid.”  He says wrapping his arm around my head pulling me down into a headlock.  “Let’s head to Gryffindor tower.  What do you say?” </p><p>    You giggle trying to escape.  “Yeah, yeah!”  You squeal, as Teddy begins to tickle you with his other hand.  “Yes!”  you gasp for air as you laugh harder.</p><p>    “Ok, let’s go grab James, and are you both going to introduce me to your new friend?”</p><p>    After introductions are made, all of you Gryffindor first years follow the Gryffindor prefects to the tower.  You are told the password to give the Fat Lady, and are admitted into the common room.  On one side of the room, three loveseats are placed together creating a cozy space around the fireplace.  All along the other sides were tables; some intended for studying, while others showed off a few wizard chess sets.  The tower stairs continued upwards in the corner towards the sleeping quarters.  And in the center a large ornate scarlet and gold run lay.  The rest of the students disperse, as you first year students are ushered to the corner with the loveseats.  The prefects begin down the list of rules.  James and you don’t even both to listen, confident that Teddy will enforce them with you.  When Teddy isn’t issuing the regulations out, he is sure to glare at the two of you.  </p><p>    At the conclusion of the prefect lecture, you are reminded of breakfast times and dismissed to go and unpack.  Emma and you both rush to your room to unpack.  It seems much larger than described to you, but there are in fact eight four poster beds in the room.  You carefully remove your robes, and carelessly throw them into your dresser.   At the bottom of your trunk you find a letter from your Mum and a frame showing off your little family.  Andromeda wedged between you and Sirius.  Teddy is creating giggle out of you on the left, and your Mum lean against Sirius with David’s arm wrapped around her shoulders.  Placing it on your nightstand, you glance to see Emma placing a unmoving family photo on hers.  It seems lonely with only three people in it.  Her mum and dad you assume.</p><p>    The night concludes with all the first year Gryffindors piling around a table eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans together that one of the boys brought.  You all giggle as someone devours a bright one that is sour apple, and the next green one reveals itself as spinach.  Worse is the golden ones that can be sweet toffee or earwax.  At ten o'clock, you all head back up to the rooms.  </p><p>    James pulls you back, whispering, “No one’s even asked me about Dad.”</p><p>    “No one’s asked me about Mum either.  Guess we didn’t have to worry.” You shrug.  “Molly said I might be asked about Mum, being head auror and all.”</p><p>    “Yeah, Gran also told me that too.”  James replied.  “Well, probably won’t last.  Anyway, goodnight Y/N”</p><p>    “Goodnight James.”  You say as James begins to climb the stairs.</p><p>    “You know, Y/N, I think Hogwarts is going to be a grand ol’ time.”  James states, and he rounds the corner out of sight now.</p><p>    You silently agree, making towards the stairs.  As you head up upwards to your four postered bed, you overhear a conversation from the common room.</p><p>    Pausing you hear, Minerva whisper hurriedly.  “Remus, you had to have known.”  </p><p>    “No, Minerva I had no idea.  No one ever told me.  Not you, not Neville, not Harry.  I just thought he looked familiar.  He has <em>her</em> heart shaped face.  I supposed he was distantly related.  But then the girl.  She comes forward bearing <em>her</em> name too, and she was awfully chummy already with James.  She also has physical resemblance, though one look into those Y/E/C eyes and you can see <em>her</em> devotion and mischief glimmering.”  He breathes deep at the end, as he rambled it all out in one breath.</p><p>    “Yes, those features are Black’s.  They boy is perfect combo of Tonks and Black smashed together.”  Minerva says patiently.  “And as for Y/N, of course she is ‘chummy’, as you put it, with James.  They grew up together, practically inseparable the two of them.”  </p><p>    You can almost hear Remus’ jaw drop to the floor.  “These kids have been playing with Harry’s kids?  Who the… who are these kids?”</p><p>    “God, Remus you really are thick.  Sirius and the girl, Y/N are both…”</p><p>    “Yeah, I know… Dora’s kids.” Remus interrupted, sadness leaking off.</p>
