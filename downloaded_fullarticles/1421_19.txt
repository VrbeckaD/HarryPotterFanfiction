    <p>Harry was angry. He was heartbroken, he was sad, it felt as if his chest was caving in. But he couldn’t dwell on those feelings. He didn’t want to feel sad, so he chose to be angry. He screamed at Dumbledore, and Dumbledore sat there calmly. How could he be calm? Voldemort was back. Everyone knew that now. There was no denying it. Sirius was... </p><p>Harry pushed that thought away and stormed out of Dumbledores office. There was nothing left to say, or rather yell. And the old man wasn’t making him feel better. So Harry walked out of the office. He paused in the hallway and stared at the blank wall before him. Harry wasn’t very violent. He wasn’t prone to outburst before this year. But this year had changed him. All the anger, all the pent up sadness that threatened to take control of him came out. Harry punched the wall. He punched the wall again and again and again. He punched the wall until his knuckles were cracked and bleeding and something definitely felt out of place. And suddenly Harry wasn’t angry. He wasn’t really upset either. He was numb. His hand throbbed a bit, but other than that Harry felt nothing. </p><p>He walked in a daze down the long lonely corridors. There was no one there. All the students were ordered to stay in their dorms until they could be sure that the students would be safe. Harry never was great at following rules. He probably should’ve headed to Madam Pomfrey. Have her fix the broken mess that is his hand but he didn’t. Instead he followed the corridors down and down until he was standing outside of Snape’s room. Harry didn’t really know why he came down here. Maybe because he knew that Snape was trying to keep him safe when Umbridge was trying to question him. When he didn’t give Umbridge the veritaserum. When he pretended not to know what he was talking about and sent a letter to the headmaster. Dumbledore wouldn’t let Harry leave without explaining that to him. This didn’t make Snape a great guy or anything. It just made Harry feel like he had an ally who wasn’t also a 15 year old kid. </p><p>With his not bloody hand, Harry knocked on the door. Part him didn’t expect Snape to answer. Part of him didn’t want Snape to answer. But he had barely lowered his hand when the door flew open. </p><p>Harry was not prepared for the sight before him. Snape was wearing a dark gray Henley and black pajama pants. His hair was pulled back in a loose ponytail at the nape of his neck. And he looked so normal. He looked like a normal man going to bed and Harry couldn’t believe it. He didn’t know what he expected so late at night but it wasn’t this. </p><p>“Potter?” Snape asked. For the first time his voice wasn’t dripping with hatred. He sounded genuinely confused. Why would Harry be here? After everything that happened tonight Snape expected Harry to be an emotional wreck in his bed being comforted by his friends. Instead he was standing in front of Snape. </p><p>Harry just stared for a moment. Snape was about to ask what the hell he was doing there, before he could Harry threw himself at the potions master. He wrapped his arms around Snape’s middle and buried his face in his chest. Harry wasn’t sure why. He just really wanted a hug. Snape smelled like mint leaves and he was warm and he was there. And Harry wanted to feel something real. </p><p>Snape had two thoughts float through his head. One was to immediately push Harry off and slam the door and pretend this never happened. He decided to go with the latter. He wrapped his arms tightly around Harry and rested his cheek on the top of Harry’s head. </p><p>When Snape hugged him back it was like something snapped inside Harry. And for the first time that night, he cried. Not like a few tears slipped down his cheeks. He started sobbing uncontrollably. Harry half expected Snape to push him away now. But that didn’t even seem like an option to the man. He simply stroked Harry’s back and told him it would be okay. </p><p>When Harry quieted and Snape felt like the boy wasn’t going to fall apart if he let go, he released him and pulled Harry into the room. It opened to a small sitting room. It only held a couch, a coffee table and a desk tucked away in the corner. Snape pulled Harry to the couch and sat him down. He found a box of tissues and handed them to Harry and allowed the teenager to clean his face. Out of instinct Harry reached for another tissue with his right hand only to realize that this hand was quite broken. Snape’s eyes widen and reached out and gently took Harry’s hand in his. </p><p>“Did this happen at the Ministry?” Snape asked him. He examined his hand and it was definitely broken in a few places but was an easy fix. </p><p>“No,” Harry said softly. His voice a bit hoarse. “I punched a wall.” His cheeks tinged with pink from the embarrassment. </p><p>Snape decided not to comment and pulled out his wand and fixed his hand. “It will still be sore for a few days.” </p><p>Harry nodded. He looked so very tired and Snape felt very sad just looking at him. So he sat next to Harry and wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulders. Snape let the boy lean against him. Harry without a thought laid his head on the professor’s shoulder and closed his eyes. </p><p>They sat like that until Harry fell asleep. It was then that Snape gently laid Harry down on the couch. He conjured a blanket and laid it over Harry. Snape looked down at the boy. Something inside of the bitter man shifted and all the built up hatred he felt for Harry seemed silly. He was just a kid. </p><p>With a sigh, Snape bent down and took Harry’s glasses off and placed them on the table. Without thinking, Snape ran his fingers through Harry’s hair. Careful not to wake him. When he realized how odd this would be to anyone else he pulled his hand away and walked through the opposite door and into his bedroom. </p><p>Snape thought it best not to think about how weird it was to have a Harry Potter on his couch. He only took a moment to send the headmaster a letter, letting him know Harry was there and sleeping. He didn’t want everyone to think that the boy who lived was suddenly the boy who disappeared. With that, he turned out the lights and climbed into his bed. He tried to push Harry out of his head, but somehow the boy remained. Even after he slept, Harry continued to linger in his dreams.<br/>
