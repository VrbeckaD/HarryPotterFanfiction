    <p>The news comes over dinner. Hermione is sitting with Harry and Ron, promptly not listening to them go on about the Chudley Cannons.</p><p>"I'm telling you mate, this is their season!" Ron says as he settles himself further into his seat.</p><p>"What makes you so sure?" Harry asks, pouring himself some juice.</p><p>Ron leans over the table, almost spilling the mashed potatoes. "I just know it!"</p><p>"If I could have everyone's attention," The headmaster is up at the podium looking grim. </p><p>Hermione shares a look with Harry and Ron, who both shrug their shoulders in response.</p><p>"It has been brought to my attention that a student has passed away."</p><p>Like a hurricane, whispers breakout across the hall. Hermione can hear whispers of ‘Who do you think it can be?, ‘I totally knew something was off,’ and the like before she snaps her attention in front of her.</p><p>Hermione feels her stomach drop.</p><p>No.</p><p>She worryingly glances down the Slytherin table.</p><p>Where is he?</p><p>She searches across the table, looking for a sign of platinum blonde hair. She doesn't find it.</p><p>"Draco..." She whispers.</p><p>Everyone around her turns to look at her</p><p>"You okay?"</p><p>"Malfoy's not at his table."</p><p>They all turn to look at the table and sure enough, it hadn't just been her imagination he really isn't there.</p><p>"Before rumors spread," the headmaster continues as if he hadn't been interrupted. "I would like to say that yes it was young mister Malfoy who has now passed. There will be a memorial service this coming Sunday for those of you who would like to attend. That is all."</p><p>Hermione can't believe it. She had just spoken to him two days ago. He had seemed fine.</p><p>No. Actually, Hermione was lying. He hadn't seemed fine, he hadn't <i>seemed</i> fine since they got to Hogwarts.</p><p>He'd seemed depressed.</p><p>God, how could she have been so stupid. He hadn’t been very good at hiding it. He had seemed paler, thinner, and had even quit the Quidditch team. He had told her and the rest of them, in his own way, that he was suffering. He had practically cried out for help.</p><p>And she, she chokes on a sob, she had done nothing.</p><p>She had known he was hurting, maybe she hadn’t realized it but now that she looked back, she had known.</p><p>"Hermione are you-"</p><p>She's out of her seat, running to the girls room before Harry can finish his sentence. </p><p>She’s dry heaving over a toilet when Harry and Ron burst into the girls room.</p><p>“‘Mione…”</p><p>“I’m fine,” she says as the little that she did eat goes down the drain. “I’m okay, I just… felt sick.”</p><p>“I can see why,” Ron says, leaning against a sink. “I mean Malfoy, really? I never liked the bloke but I never wanted him to die, you know?”</p><p>Hermione felt anger rise to her throat. Ron had said several times that Malfoy could die in a pit for all he cared. She calmed herself down enough to get up and leave the stall.</p><p>Ron continues. “Although... he was a nasty ferret and he did bully the younger students. I wonder if anyone will even show up to his memorial.”</p><p>Hermione glares at him through the mirror. </p><p>“That’s a bit harsh mate,” Harry says, before Hermione can say anything. </p><p>Ron shrugs and takes a bite out of an apple that he took from the dining hall. “It’s the truth, though.”</p><p>“How could you…” Hermione is practically shaking with rage. Someone had died-- Malfoy had died and Ron didn’t seem to have a care in the world.</p><p>“Maybe you should lie down ‘Mione,” Harry says.</p><p>She suddenly feels weak. “Yeah, perhaps you’re right.”</p><p>He grabs a hold of her arm and leads her to the Gryffindor tower, where she does just that.</p><p>-</p><p>Sunday comes all too soon. </p><p>Hermione wakes up with a headache that she has come to expect over the last couple of days. The sun blinds her through the sliver in the curtains and she can’t help but think that it’s mocking her; of course it would be a bright sunny day during Draco Malfoy’s memorial service. </p><p>For all he was worth his weight in gold, the sun reminded everyone that the world didn’t care about one loss, it would continue to go on happily whether or not he was there.</p><p>Maybe Malfoy had finally gotten one right, maybe it was time to move on from this world.</p><p>The news had spread around the school the day after the announcement that it had been a suicide. The story went that Goyle had found Malfoy in the tub, wrists slit, covered in blood, and completely still. </p><p>Hermione cursed herself for wanting it to be a homicide. At least then she could get rid of the guilt that was eating away at her.</p><p>Her dorm mates are still asleep when she is done getting ready. She isn’t surprised that they chose to sleep in, but a part of her is disappointed and saddened by their sleeping figures.</p><p>Harry and Ginny are waiting for her by the door when she goes down into the common room.</p><p>“Ready?” Ginny asks, giving her a sad smile. She feels her eyes water when she notices they are the only three here.</p><p>“Yeah.”<br/>
-</p><p>When they get to the Great Hall, Hermione feels her eyes water again.</p><p>While there are plenty of Slytherins in attendance, there aren’t many other students from the other houses.</p><p>There is a group of Hufflepuffs huddled together on the left, a couple of Ravenclaws here and there, some young Gryffindor girls near the front, and as she looks closer, Luna and Neville near the back.</p><p>Hermione moves to sit in the middle.</p><p>The ceremony isn't very long. A priest goes up to the podium and says a few verses from the bible and tells a few stories of life and death, then a couple of Professors say a few words about his academic success before leaving. It is all very impersonal, very depressing. By the time it is over, Hermione feels sick to her stomach.</p><p>As she looks around she realizes that this is all the students of Hogwarts thought Malfoy deserved. Just a plain priest and a couple of sad students.</p><p>This wasn’t right. When someone died, people were supposed to <i>hurt</i>. </p><p>People were supposed to cry and scream and rave on about how it wasn’t <i>fair</i> to take away someone so young. How they couldn’t just take them and leave everyone in pain. But no one here cared enough for him did they?</p><p>She looks at Pansy, who had probably been the closest to him of them all, and all she sees are a couple of tears sliding down her cheeks. </p><p>Was that is? Was that all Draco had meant to her? </p><p>This wasn’t right!</p><p>Hermione shakes her head and gets up, feeling herself fill with anger. If no one was going to scream and cry and <i>care</i> about Draco Malfoy, then she was. </p><p>She was out the door before Harry or Ginny could stop her. She didn’t know what to do so as always, she marched toward her head of house’s classroom.</p><p>“Miss Granger what’s with all the fuss,” Professor Mcgonagall says calmly from behind her desk.</p><p>“Draco Malfoy isn’t dead. I refuse to accept it.”</p>
