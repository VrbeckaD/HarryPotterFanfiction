<p>Christmas Runes</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Are you sure you’re not going, Harry?” </p>
<p>Harry bit his tongue. “Positive. I hate Christmas and parties, so a Christmas party’s the last thing I want to do tonight.” </p>
<p>Tilting her head, Luna stared at him until, unnerved, Harry snapped, “What?” </p>
<p>She smiled. “Did you ever take Ancient Runes?” </p>
<p>Harry groaned. “Luna—” </p>
<p>“Evidently not. There’s a symbol that reminds me of you, actually. And if you squint at it—”</p>
<p>Harry held up a hand. “Okay, if I go, will you stop talking about runes?”</p>
<p>Luna hopped off Harry’s desk. “Of course. Come on, Harry. We don’t want to be late.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“Whose Christmas party’s this, anyway?” Harry asked as they approached the door. </p>
<p>Luna shrugged. “No idea. All that matters is the runes are correct, see?” She pointed at a stone, and Harry saw what looked like straight lines etched into it. </p>
<p>“Wait, are you saying we’re crashing—?” Harry, finding he was talking to empty air, groaned and followed her inside. </p>
<p>People were mostly snogging, and not recognising anyone, Harry edged his way towards the corner, hoping no one realised he was crashing. </p>
<p>“Excuse me,” he said to a man whose back was turned. </p>
<p>The man spun. “Potter?” </p>
<p>Harry stared. “Snape?” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” Snape frowned. </p>
<p>“Er…Luna.” Harry shrugged. “She nagged me until I agreed to come with her. Only I dunno where she is and I don’t know anyone at this Christmas party but you, and she kept going on about the runes—”</p>
<p>Snape held up his hand. “Potter, are you saying you crashed <i>this</i> Christmas party because of…runes?” </p>
<p>“I guess.” Harry smiled faintly. “When you say it like it sounds strange, but if you know Luna—”</p>
<p>“I’m familiar with Ms Lovegood.” Snape sighed. “So, you’ve found me. What now?” </p>
<p>“Now?” Harry smiled. “Can we talk?” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>They stepped outside where it was quieter, and Harry pointed to the stone Luna had indicated earlier. “See? Runes.” </p>
<p>“Quite.” Snape gestured towards a bench. “Shall we sit?” </p>
<p>“Sure.” Harry sat, Snape beside him. “Clearly you survived.” </p>
<p>Snape smirked. “Well spotted, Potter.” </p>
<p>Harry sighed. “Sorry, it’s just…I worried. And I mourned you.” </p>
<p>Snape raised an eyebrow. “Why?”</p>
<p>“Your memories. I saw all you’d sacrificed for me.” Harry looked up at the night sky. “I misjudged you.” </p>
<p>Snape snorted. “Not by much. What I did was for selfish reasons.” </p>
<p>Harry exhaled. “So’s this,” he said, and leaning in, kissed Snape.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Snape kissed him back for about half a second before withdrawing. “Potter, are you sure you know what you’re doing?” </p>
<p>Harry smiled ruefully. “Not a clue.” </p>
<p>Snape shook his head. “Trust you to blunder in.” He brushed his thumb over Harry’s mouth. “Still, as always, your instincts are correct.” Leaning in again, he kissed Harry. </p>
<p>It was a proper kiss, one that left them both gasping and panting. “We can return to the Christmas party,” said Snape, eyes glittering. </p>
<p>“Why?” asked Harry. </p>
<p>Snape’s eyes narrowed. “You really don’t know?” </p>
<p>“Know what?” </p>
<p>“When you said runes—” Snape hummed. “I’ll show you.” </p>
<p>~</p>
<p>“It’s an orgy?” Harry, standing at the door, gaped. “There are <i>Christmas orgies</i>?” </p>
<p>Snape stood behind him, steadying him. “There are orgies all year round. People know where and what they are because of runes. They’re a…signpost of sorts.” </p>
<p>“I’m going to kill Luna,” Harry muttered. </p>
<p>Snape slid an arm around Harry’s waist. “I take it you don’t want to stay, then?” </p>
<p>“No!” cried Harry.</p>
<p>“Shh,” hushed one of the snogging threesomes by the window. </p>
<p>“Then perhaps we can have our own Christmas celebration?” suggested Snape. </p>
<p>“Works for me.” Harry paused. “No runes, though, right?” </p>
<p>Snape laughed. “No runes.” </p>
