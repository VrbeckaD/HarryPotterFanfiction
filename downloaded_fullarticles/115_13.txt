    <p>A girl of straight white hair jumped around her messy bedroom clutching an envelope in her hand as she wore muggle clothing. Squeals left her mouth as she couldn’t help the smile on her face as Led Zeppelin played in the background on her record player. Suddenly her bedroom door was thrown open and a smiling redhead stood at the doorway with a bright smile on her face as she held the letter in her hands with the same brightness. </p><p>“Did you get yours too?” </p><p>“YES!” The redhead jumped onto the bed together with the white haired girl as they held hands together as they squealed and jumped as Robert Plant’s voice filled the room with the lyrics of “Since I’ve been loving you” </p><p>“I can’t wait to go to Hogwarts, can you Lily?” Both girls smiled as they were now laying on the bed side to side as both letters were ripped open and on their stomachs as they stared up at the white ceiling as Led Zeppelin played in the background softly </p><p>“Me either,” Lily grinned “We are going to take Hogwarts by storm!” </p><p>“You think?” </p><p>“Of course,” Lily jumped up from the bed as she graded the other girls arms and forced her to stand as well “We’ll both be amazing wizards Gwen!” Lily’s excitement seemed to rub off on Gwen as she soon joined in on Lily’s excitement </p><p>”Hogwarts better watch out for us!” Gwen smiled as she soon joined in with Lily’s excitement as they began dancing around before Gwen went crashing to the floor as she slipped on one of her own socks and fell on her back </p><p>“That is after you gain a sense of balance not to mention clean up your room” Lily pointed out as she stood over the girl with a teasing look in her eyes “Only then can we become amazing wizards” Taking the moffered hand Gwen smiled as she lightly pushed her sister </p><p>“You room isn’t much better” </p><p>“At least I know where everything is” Lily shrugged as she grabbed her letter “I’ll let Mom know that we need to get to Diagon Alley tomorrow to get our things” With that she closed the door as Gwen reclaimed her letter off her bed and set it on the only clean area in her room which was her desk </p><p>“Hogwarts here I come” </p><p> </p><p>“Look there is Ollivanders!” Lily grabbed Gwens sleeve as she pulled her towards the building with a huge smile on her face, “We have to get our wands!”</p><p>“Alright then, no need to drag me” Gwen laughed as she was stumbling over her feet </p><p>“Sorry, I’m just really excited” Lily laughed as she let go of the Gwens sleeve and they entered the small building </p><p>Gwen adjusted her backpack that carried her most of her new school supplies. Their parents had the cauldrons and other things they couldn't carry as they were waiting outside for them to retrieve their wands. </p><p>The building was rather narrow and shabby as it seemed that boxes of wands were everywhere as they piled all the way to the ceiling. With a smile, Gewen turned to Lily who had a huge smile on her face as she received her wand. </p><p>“10 ¾ willow swishy” The old man stated “Are you here to get your wand to young lady?” Gwen nodded as she shuffled over suddenly embarrassed as she didn’t know what to do </p><p>“Try this one” Grabbing the thick and long brown wand with two ridges on the bottle felt odd in her hand, waving her hand around a wall of wands suddenly fell to the ground with a crash </p><p>“I’m so sorry!” Gwen felt her face heat up as she handed him the wand back as she looked at the huge mess with wide eyes </p><p>“Don’t fret child” Taking his own wand out he muttered a spell that cleaned up the mess as all the wands back into their boxes and were stacked up once again “Try this one” </p><p>Taking the thin, black, and narrow wand into her hand that had small flowers engraved into the handle as it had a stout bottom with thorns encrusting the bottom of its </p><p>“10 ⅕ cherry swishy, a dragon core” The man spoke as I flicked my wrist and small fireworks exploded from the top causing a smile to stretch across Gwen’s face </p><p>“You’ve found yourself a wand, congratulations” The man named Ollivander spoke as both girls handed him the set of Galleons as they couldn’t keep their eyes off of them. Smiling they left the small shop with a wave of their hands to finish the rest of their shopping. </p><p> </p><p>_________</p><p>“Do you think you should write to your Father regarding you attending Hogwarts?” Lily asked as she laid on the full bed on her stomach as she watched Gwen clean up her room </p><p>“I’ve already sent him a letter and he said that he'll come pick me up so we go on our annual trip to America” Gwen retorted as she threw more clothes into the dirty pile while Lily hummed in response </p><p>“What kind of people do you think we’ll meet?” Lily asked with a huge smile on her face, Gwen kept the smile on her face as she didn’t want to dampen her best friends mood </p><p>Gwen was the only child of the prestigious pureblood Appleton family who was highly respected in the Wizarding world as they came from a long line of Slytherins and Ravenclaws. Her Mother was a Ravenclaw and her father was a Slytherin when they had attended Hogwarts. Gwen was pure blood while her best friend and childhood friend was a muggle born which meant that she was susceptible to bullying. </p><p>“All sorts” Gwen replied as she turned away to put all the books back into her bookshelf </p><p>“I can’t wait to learn more about the Wizarding world and everything I can about using magic!” Lily clapped her hands together as she rose from the bed </p><p>“Have you told Severus yet?” </p><p>“No, I plan to see him tomorrow and tell him about my letter to Hogwarts” Lily stated as she got up and headed to the bedroom door “Alright well I’m going to bed now, I’ll see you in the morning.” </p><p>“See you in the morning Lils” Gwen turned her head to her with a smile as she watched her leave as she closed the door behind her </p><p>“Night Gwen”</p><p> </p><p>_________</p><p>“Are you excited about going my daughter?” Gwen's father, Alexander Appleton, is a tall man with black raven hair, dark brown eyes that boarded black and a calm and collected demeanor. He had the characteristics of a slytherin but that’s where the similarities ended. </p><p>Both Father and Daughter sat at the dining table as they had been eating in silence. When he had picked her up from Lily’s house, she was sad having to make her goodbyes to Mr. and Mrs. Evans as well as Lily. She had ignored Petunia, as she was nothing but a selfish, spoiled prat in her opinion. </p><p>“Yes I am,” Gwen set her glass of water down as she looked up to see her Father staring at her with a small smile, “I wonder what house I’ll be sorted into” She added as she smiled at her Father </p><p>“You have a strong lineage of Slytherins and Ravens” Her Father stated with a smile as a House elf had walked in and handed him a slip of paper that turned his warm demeanor to that of something cold</p><p>She watched as her Father let out a tired sigh as she read the small paper, he stayed that way for several long minutes. As Gwen decided to ask what the matter was, he stood from his seat abruptly and clenched his fist. </p><p>“Continue eating, I have matters to attend to regarding work” He strolled over to her side of the table “I love you my darling, your Mother and I are very proud of you” He places a chaste kiss on her head before he left the dining room and made his way to his study that was upstairs </p><p>Gwen stood with a small smile as she cleaned up both her Fathers and her plates before making her trek up the carpeted steps to the second floor where her bedroom was located. She could hear her Father’s distinct voice from the study as he talked on the telephone to somebody. Slipping into her room she got ready for bed before making her way under the covers. </p><p>A small black creature moved at the foot of her bed as it slowly made its way towards her. Grabbing the small cat she sat up in bed as she cradled it to her chest. </p><p>“Hello Mr. Fitz” The cat began purring as she was petting it “How are you this evening?” </p><p>Gwen used to live in Cokeworth, London along with Lily and Severus but when her mother died when she was but nine years old. Her Father couldn’t stand to be in the house as the town reminded him so much of her and found himself grieving anytime he walked into a room or simply on his way home from work as he would pass her favorite bakery. </p><p>It has only been a little over two years since her Mother’s abrupt demise, Gwen still thought of her Mother a lot. She knew her Father saw her mother in her as she not only looked like her but she acted like her and developed some of her habits. Her Mother was loving and highly respected not to mention she loved Muggles. She found them to be interesting creatures who had their own sort of magic such as tellies and other such things. </p><p>She spent her summers with Lily as to that’s why she had a room there. Her Mother was close friends with the Evans when she saw Lily do accidental magic when they were playing once. She thought that Lily would become her best friend, to which she was right of course. Her mother told Lily’s parents much about the Wizarding world and what to expect from Lily as she developed her powers. </p><p>So when tragedy struck, Lily’s parents were the ones to help her Father help prepare the arrangements for her Mother’s funeral. Her Father threw himself into work and had her stay with the Evans that way she wasn’t stuck at home all the time by herself. Which she didn’t mind living with Lily as they had become more as sisters. </p><p>________</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to miss you” Her Father smiled down at his only daughter who’s eyes lit up as she tackled him in a hug with a bright smile on her face</p><p>“I’ll miss you too” Gwen knew that her Father was emotional today as not only had they visited her Mother’s grave this morning but because she was making a huge step into growing up</p><p>“Write to me every week alright?” Gwen pulled away with a huge smile as her Father bent down and placed a kiss on her head, “I want you to tell me as soon as possible whatever house you’re placed in alright?” </p><p>“Yes I pinky promise” Gwen held up her small pinky out to him as he wrapped his pinky around her own</p><p>“Now you best be off before you miss the train my darling” Her Father stood to his height as he placed a hand on her head as she nodded </p><p>“I love you”</p><p>“I love you too” With a small wave and another hug Gwen pushed her trolley towards the train as she saw a flash of bright red hair </p><p>“Lily!” </p><p>“Gwen!” Both girls hugged each other as they were dressed in their muggle clothing. “How was visiting America with your Father?” </p><p>“Amazing, I bought you a souvenir since you were unable to join me” </p><p>“Gwen you didn't have to get me anything”</p><p>“Don’t be silly, you’re my best friend and my sister Ms. Evans” Both girls giggled as they weren’t paying attention to their surroundings </p><p>“Come on Gwen, we should find a compartment before they’re all taken” Lily grabbed Gwen’s hand as she dragged her towards the train after grabbing their trunks </p><p>After several minutes of finding a cabin, they found an empty one near the back of the train. </p><p>“I’m going to find Severus since we found a cabin already” Lily and Gwen has put their trunks away as Lily had turned to the girl </p><p>“Alright we’ll I’ll be here” Nodding Lily left as Gwen grabbed a book from her things and began reading as she waited for the train to depart from the station </p><p>“Mind if we sit here?” Two boys stood at the door wearing smiles with their trunks in hand. Gwen smiled as she closed her book and set it in her lap. </p><p>“As long as you don’t mind sitting with two other people, my friends will be back soon” </p><p>“Not at all!” The first one stated as he put his trunk away while the other boy gaped him as well </p><p>“The names James Potter” </p><p>A pureblood. Like me.</p><p>The second boy with dark hair offered her his hand as well as a smile “I’m Sirius Black”</p><p>“I’m Gwendolyn Appleton” She took his offered hand as they shook hands “But I prefer to go by Gwen” She added as she smiled </p><p>“Little Gweny” He smirked as he watched her face become pink as she averted her eyes “That’s what I’ll call you” He took his seat beside her as James took the seat on Sirius’s left </p><p>“It’s a pleasure to meet both of you” </p><p>______</p><p>Published: December 1st l, 2019</p><p>Editors: March 4th, 2020</p>
