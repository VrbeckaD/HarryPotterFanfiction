    <p> </p>
<p>Ron knew whatever had attacked that diver was not a normal animal. He just didn’t get why no one was listening to him. It’s like no wanted to believe him. Everyone had looked at him like he was an idiot. Assholes.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry was dusting the bones of a pterodactyl when he saw his disgusting ex and boss for now, Draco Malfoy coming towards him. He hated him. Him and Hermione, his supposed friend.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>Harry went to Draco’s apartment to surprise him, but he was surprised himself by what he saw there. He knew Malfoy was arrogant, but he didn’t know he was a cheat and a liar too. Because there, on the couch was his friend, Hermione being fucked by his boyfriend while she was sucking their coworker, Blaise Zabini.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>He threw the files on the floor and left without a backward glance.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry snorted as he thought about the pathetic excuse his so called friend had given him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>“It started before you, Harry. We thought it was over but it wasn’t,” Hermione whined.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had wanted to slap her. He had. Hermione had kept her face down as he had walked out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>“Started before ? I am dating him and you are going behind my back and fucking him and you are giving this feeble excuse? Go to hell both of you,” he snarled at her and left the room.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco had just said a pathetic sorry. He didn’t look like he was sorry in the least.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>“Want us to off him, pup,” Sirius asked seriously. He will do it. Lucius’s son was as good as dead for hurting their Harry. Lucius was an ass of course his son was a dick too.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Harry shook his head. “No, it's fine. It's good the truth came out so soon."<br/></em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Sirius and Remus didn’t know if Harry was trying to play it cool or not. He had been dating the git for past six months and Draco had been seeing Hermione behind Harry's back from the very beginning. They hated them both and didn’t even want to know how Zabini fit in the situation. It was common knowledge Zabini had a girlfriend, who she was, no one had a clue. She must be deranged as well for dating him or maybe she was like him too.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Remus hated people like them.</em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Potter, look at me when I am talking you,” Draco shouted at his stupid ex. Harry was so dramatic and emotional. Always making a big deal out of nothing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry came out of his reverie and sneered at the idiot in front of him. He didn’t even know why he had even dated him in the first place. He'd always thought he would have a dark haired man as his boyfriend. Why did he go out with this garbage again?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Alphard Black is my godfather’s uncle, he owns this museum. Even if I sit around and do nothing, they will still not fire me. So fuck off, Malfoy.” Harry said sarcastically.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Stop being such a loser and man up, Potter,” Draco said with an ugly sneer. “I am your boss and I have a job for you. You will go to Maine and find out what killed that man in the lake. This report came yesterday and they want someone from the museum to check the tooth. I’ve decided that you’ll go. ”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry stopped brushing the bone and got up quietly. He could hear Neville, Ernie and Hannah snickering at Malfoy. The three knew he was going to get it now. Honestly, the blonde had guts to even stand in front of Harry. Or maybe he was just too shameless. Jury was out on that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Go fuck yourself, Malfoy. I am not your servant,” Harry shot Malfoy a poisonous glare before leaving the room.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry snorted to himself as he walked back to his office to gather his stuff. He was sure this must be that know it all’s idea; let him leave for a while, let him cool off, he’ll be fine in a few months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Not this time, Hermione. You were my friend and you stabbed me in the back. I will never forget this or forgive it. Never.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He talked to Sirius and Remus that day and told them that he will be going to New England. Alphard had already asked his nephew's godson if he wanted him to fire Miss Granger, Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Zabini.</p>
<p>“No. But I would like to go and check out this lake.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alphard nodded and ruffled his hair. “Of course, kiddo. No worries. You are free. I’ll fire them after you come back.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry kissed Sirius and Remus’s cheek and kissed his mom and dad’s photograph before going to the airport.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry was greeted by a tall redhead as he landed. Ron told him about the attack and Harry was intrigued. He had answered Ron in mono syllables and sneers because he was still pissed off at those bloody bastards.</p>
<p>Ron seemed to have taken his attitude personally.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So, that’s where it is,” Ron gestured at the morgue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now Harry was a very brave man, but he <em><u>really</u> <u>really</u></em> didn’t like morgues.</p>
<p>“That’s the morgue,” he said softly. Ron was not impressed by that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That’s where they keep them,” Ron commented sarcastically. Honestly, Potter was getting on his nerves like Riddle. They would get along so well. He sighed but offered to bring the tooth out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No, it’s okay,” Harry said with clenched hands. “After you, Mr. Weasley.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry screamed when he saw the dead body.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Okay, so not completely like Tom Riddle, Ron thought idly. That man wouldn’t have cared even if the body was in pieces.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry examined the tooth and was sure it wasn’t a bloody fossil.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, this is reptilian. And, its not a fossil,” he looked at Ron as he asked the next question. “How long did this attack go on for?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron sighed as he answered Harry, “six, maybe, ten seconds.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry nodded and got up. “Okay, I’d like to see this lake.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron nodded and called his fellow cops to make the arrangements. And he called Tom, <em>“I am too handsome for the world”</em> bloody Riddle. He was after all the head of Fish and Games.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry sprayed some mosquito repellent around him as Ron got some stuff from the grocery store. Unfortunately, some spray went into Ron’s face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sorry, I have a thing about insects,” he said nonchalantly. He noticed the way Ron was looking at him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Like he was a particularly nasty little bug.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He didn’t like that. He was not a bug. How dare Ron think that?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Soon, the Fish and Games head came and Harry ducked his head as he got a good look at him. Holy shit, was this guy real?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tall, dark and handsome didn’t do justice to this guy. He was tall, looked about twenty eight, two years older than his twenty six, had dark wavy hair, sharp aristocratic nose, delectable rosy lips, sharp cheekbones and a jaw that could cut glass. He could feel himself getting weak in the knees. This was his ideal guy. </p>
<p>Draco who ? He didn’t know anyone by that name.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And, Harry, here, then said he would like to see the lake,” Ron told Tom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tom gave Harry a once over and knew there will be a problem.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The gorgeous guy ticked off all of his boxes. He wasn’t very tall, but gods, he was beautiful. Emerald green eyes which were covered by square rimless glasses, delectable soft rosy lips which were just begging to be kissed, and messy black hair which gave him that just shagged look. Fuck.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This will be difficult. He’d never felt instant attraction like this. His previous boyfriends didn’t even come close to this guy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Tom Riddle,” he offered his hand to Harry. He was delighted to see a rosy blush  appear on those pale cheeks as he shook his hand.</p>
<p>“Harry. Harry Potter.”</p>
<p>“Right, so, would you like to go and see the lake now?” he asked Harry who to his immense delight blushed even more.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah. Sure,” Harry stuttered. He wanted to hit himself, he was twenty six, not a bloody teenager. Then again, he didn't have any experience in dating. Draco didn't count. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron was flabbergasted. They were made for each other. The two were subtly flirting and he didn’t know what disturbed him more. Tom Riddle, notorious for being rude and giving one word replies to everyone, smiling and offering his hand or Harry blushing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“They are both rude and sarcastic. They should get along well,” he muttered under his breath. That brought the two’s attention back on him. Tom’s indifferent cold mask came back on his face while Harry looked away, embarrassed at having been caught by Ron.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The three went to the lake and Ron showed them the spot where the attack had happened.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hey, stop for a minute,” Ron said to Tom. Tom looked at Ron who pointed at what looked like branches? in the middle of the lake. He nodded and stopped the boat. Unfortunately for Ron, it was a severed moose’s head which he pulled from the lake and dumped on Harry’s feet. Unintentionally.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry screamed as the severed head fell near his feet. It was a severed head, it was a severed moose's head. The poor animal...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He glared at Ron before punching him on the arm for his actions. Ron was not impressed by that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What was that for?” he shouted at Harry. Who did Harry think he was? Hitting him for no reason?</p>
<p>“You threw it at me,” Harry snarled. Oh, god. It was a severed head.  What could possibly kill such a gentle animal in such a cruel way ?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I just let go off it,” Ron said venomously and moved towards Harry, but was stopped by Riddle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This was pretty cool to watch, Harry looked like an angry kitten, ready to bite Ron’s head off. But they had a job to do and this wasn’t the way to do it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“He didn’t, Mr Potter. He just placed it on the boat,” Tom said casually. Ron hadn’t done anything wrong, he had <em>jus</em><em>t</em> placed it on the boat. He hadn’t deliberately thrown the severed head at Harry’s feet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Harry looked betrayed by that. “Of course, you’ll take his side. Why would you take mine ? Why would anyone ? Everyone betrays me, my ex boyfriend was fucking my friend behind my back and she had the audacity to say it started before…”</p>
<p>Harry closed his mouth as he realized what he’d said. Both Tom and Ron looked horrified by what they’d heard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well, now you know my sob story. Can we just leave ? Please ? If you don’t want to throw something else at me,” Harry said softly and went to sit at the opposite end of the boat so he wouldn’t have to look at either of them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ron spluttered and muttered a sorry and started the boat. Tom continued to look at Harry, thinking what kind of scum would do such a thing to someone like Harry.</p>
