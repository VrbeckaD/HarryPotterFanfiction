    <p>On the occasional less than satisfying day (of which there are often many), when either everything bad happens at once, or absolutely nothing happens at all, there are one of five things Sougo can do to cheer himself up.</p><p>The first; jinx Hijikata-san.</p><p>The second; jinx Hijikata-san.</p><p>And the third; jinx Hijikata-san. For no matter how reproachfully Kondou or his sister scold him afterwards, the look of pure outrage the older boy sends his way as he uncontrollably dances and trips over his own legs in the Main Hall is worth any lecture and/or the twenty following detentions.</p><p>Equally as exciting as the performance of a well cast tarantallegra spell is flying. Rain or shine, the brittle wind that beats his face and tangles in his hair is heaven. In the sky, there are no limits — his broom turns at the slightest touch, each rise and fall is measured and controlled, and on his Ichimonji Seven-Eighty, fifty feet above the ground, he's the master of his own fate.</p><p>But the fifth and final option from Sougo's list of surefire pick-me-ups — nothing compares. Hijikata could shit a bucket's worth of breakfast, lunch, and dinner midway through class and it would <em>still</em> come second to being the direct cause of Kagura's face contorting and twisting into an expression of the greatest possible disgust. All he has to do is catch her eye.</p><p>Fifth year, however, brings with it an entire new way of going all out.</p><p>They've been at it for several minutes, struggling in the space created for them by the lucky crowd happening to witness another of their glorious brawls. Having long since discarded their wands, the fight has mostly degraded into a childish battle of biting, punching, and kicking whatever bit of each other they can, rolling violently back and forth in a spectacle of limbs and flying robes amid the usual shouts of <em>fight! fight! fight!</em></p><p>"Die!" Kagura shrieks, viciously clawing at his eyeball.</p><p>Sougo grabs a handful of vermillion hair and yanks. "You first!"</p><p>It is, in his fine opinion, a brilliant ending to what has otherwise been a pretty shit day.</p><p>Until—</p><p>
  <em>"Protego!"</em>
</p><p>Sougo feels himself be blasted backwards by an invisible wall, skidding a few meters across the floor before coming to a stop at the edge of the crowd. From her indignant shout, it's safe to assume Kagura has received the same treatment.</p><p>"Gin-chan, let me at him!" he hears her roar from some distance away. "I'm not done yet!"</p><p>Sakata Sensei hauls Kagura up by the collar of her robe. "You're done, brat," he says, his face expressionless underneath the usual shock of white hair.</p><p>Sougo gets to his feet with a disguised wince, ruefully massaging his chest. He can feel his left eye beginning to swell, but Kagura is suffering from a nosebleed and he can't help but feel a little pleased. Her expression darkens even further at Sougo's satisfied grin.</p><p>"See?!" she hollers, wildly struggling in Sakata's grip. "Look at him smiling, the bastard! Gin-chan, he took thirty points off Seiran for me breathing, did you know?!"</p><p>"It was ten," Sougo corrects, and he hears several scandalised grunts from Kagura's fellow housemates in the watching crowd. "But I wish I made it thirty."</p><p>Sakata rolls his eyes. "With me, Sofa-kun," he says, and has to drag Kagura by the arm so she does not escape and try another attack. They are marched past the crowd and through the school to their empty Defensive Arts classroom, where they are led into the explosion of mess that is Sakata's office.</p><p>With a lazy flick of his wand, their teacher conjures two cushions before a low desk alongside the end of the room, the surface littered with parchment scrolls, Jump magazines, calligraphy brushes, and empty strawberry milk cartons. "Sit," he points, and strides over to the cabinet beside the desk without sparing them a glance. </p><p>Sougo and Kagura share a mutual, disgusted glare, but reluctantly oblige, settling as far away from each other as they can in their respective cushions. Meanwhile, Sakata rummages around the cabinet and reemerges with a battered box. </p><p>He moves to the sunken hearth set in the middle of the room and spoons out a handful of glittering dust from the wooden casket in his hand, unceremoniously tipping the powder into the pit. The hearth explodes to life. </p><p>"Tatsuma," he calls into the sudden upsurge of green fire, "Get your ass up here."</p><p>The unruly head of Sougo's Astrology teacher appears among the flames, sporting his usual cheerful expression and lopsided sunglasses. "Kintoki!" he beams. "If this is about Otose's firewhiskey, you know I didn't take it—"</p><p>"It's Gintoki, bastard, and everybody knows you did. But forget it; this is about something else."</p><p>Sakamoto looks curiously past him and spots Sougo sitting by the desk. "Oh, it's Okita-kun, ahaha! What're you doing there—"</p><p>"JUST GET UP HERE!"</p><p>Sakamoto's head begins to spin and a second later, his whole body emerges from the hearth. He steps out of the pit, dusting ash from his robes. "There was no need to yell, Kintoki, ahaha! You could've just said so."</p><p>Sakata's expression is an uncanny resemblance of Kagura's when he smacks Sakamoto upside the head. "Look at this! I was only halfway through this week's Jump when I had to leave to break up <em>their</em>—" he points accusingly in Sougo and Kagura's direction— "stupid fight! Control your students better, you shitty head of house!"</p><p>"Ahaha! Kintoki, you're so funny. Aren't you head of House Seiran? Shouldn't you also be controlling your students better?"</p><p>Sakata scowls. "My kid didn't try to take fifty points off of another house for somebody breathing."</p><p>"It was ten, Sensei," Sougo says again, and Kagura kicks him from her seat.</p><p>Sakata waves a hand. "Fine. But fifty points from Toppuu, Souichirou-kun. Sakamoto can set your detention."</p><p>"That's not fair, Kintoki! If that's the case, then I'll also take fifty from Seiran!"</p><p>"No way — your kid started this. Sixty points from Toppuu."</p><p>"Eighty points from Seiran, ahaha!"</p><p>"A hundred and thirty points from Toppuu!"</p><p>"Ahaha, a hundred and <em>sixty</em> points—"</p><p>"TWO HUNDRED POINTS!"</p><p>Sougo looks longingly to the door, thinking an afternoon of boredom might've actually been better than antagonizing Kagura and having to put up with the subsequent consequences. He's contemplating the risk of making a run for it when he hears Kagura cough pointedly in his direction. He glances her way and she smirks, jerking her chin towards the door as if to say, 'do it. I <em>dare</em> you.'</p><p>Sougo scowls. There's no way in hell he'll go now.</p><p>'Chicken,' she mouths, and Sougo is a second away from tackling her again when he hears Sakata shriek — "ALL POINTS FROM TOPPUU! EVERY SINGLE STINKING POINT YOU SLIMY EELS HAVE GOT, I'M TAKING IT—"</p><p>Sougo knows what will come next.</p><p>
  <em>BOOM!</em>
</p><p>Sougo ducks, shielding his eyes. From the explosion of smoke via Sakata's sunken hearth emerges the deputy headmistress of Mahoutokoro, her expression livid underneath a heavy layer of makeup.</p><p>"What," she says, "Are you two idiots doing?"</p><p>"Ahaha, Otose! We were—"</p><p><em>"SHUT UP!"</em> Otose roars, and Sougo is almost thrown back in his cushion from the force of it. He briefly meets Kagura's eye, and simultaneously, they clamber with frantic panic to their feet, fighting and stumbling over each other in their race to the sliding door.</p><p>"<em>CHILDREN,</em> THE BOTH OF YOU—"</p><p>"IT WASN'T ME—"</p><p>"—HOUSE COUNTERS ARE GOING <em>MAD—</em>"</p><p>Bangs and yells continue to chase them down the hallway as they run, snapping at their heels like gunfire. Pushing through the persistent crowds of students, they barrel past bright wooden classrooms and high, richly painted walls, sandled feet slipping on polished timber floors. It's only when they are a safe distance away that they stop at the end of a wide, paneled corridor, breathless from the exercise in escape. There's a stitch blooming in Sougo's left side, and it's with a relieved wince that he slides down the wall to the cool floor.</p><p>"Oi!" Kagura suddenly yelps, almost falling atop him. Sougo looks up, feeling a pressure in his hand and finding it attached tight around Kagura's wrist.</p><p>He blinks. "Oh," he says. In the palm of his grip, he feels fine bone and paper thin skin, and in a momentary lapse of coherent thought, he gives her wrist an involuntary, feather light squeeze. Above, he hears Kagura's breath stutter and he blinks again, immediately letting go. He tries not to think too hard about the sudden loss of warmth. "Sorry."</p><p>Kagura's hand lingers mid-air, frozen in a semi-state of shock before she comes to her senses and snatches it back, holding her fist to her chest and looking pointedly away. He thinks she might be blushing, but it could just as easily be flush from the exertion of running, so he says nothing.</p><p>"I could've run by myself," Kagura mutters. "You did not need to drag me along, yes?"</p><p>"You tripped," Sougo points out.</p><p>She sharply meets his eye with a glare, her cheeks now definitely aflame. "I did not!"</p><p>Sougo takes in the sweat that shines over her brow and the flyaway strands of vermillion hair framing her face, a sight he had only just caught a fleeting glimpse of when she'd accidentally slipped and stumbled into his back around a corner. His fingers twitch, remembering with uncomfortable clarity how natural the instinct had been to reach out and steady her. In the rush to get away, Sougo must have forgotten to let go.</p><p>He wrenches his gaze away from the sight of her hair glowing ruby red in the afternoon sunlight and shakes his head. How embarrassing.</p><p>"Whatever," he sighs, hauling himself up with a hand pressed against the ebbing stitch at his side. "I'm going."</p><p>Kagura's mouth falls open a little. "Where?"</p><p>Sougo walks away. "Anywhere."</p><p>"That's not fair!" Kagura hollers, chasing after him. "You have not been nearly punished enough, yes? You ruined my day, stupid eel! Pay up immediately!"</p><p>He scoffs. "Pay up?"</p><p>"Yes! <em>Immediately!"</em></p><p>Sougo stops, causing Kagura to once again slam into his back.</p><p>"OI—"</p><p>"Am I hearing this right, China?" he cuts her off, turning to face her. "You want <em>money,</em> in return for spending quality time with me?"</p><p>Her eyes widen, and Sougo is no longer quite able to hide the teasing smirk pulling at the corner of his mouth when he continues, "I'd be careful if I were you. I don't imagine Kamui would be too pleased to hear about his little sister running an escort service—"</p><p>Kagura grabs the back of his head with a violent shriek and throws him into a wall. It's only the fast reflexes borne from years of Quidditch practice that just saves him from a broken nose and the loss of his two front teeth, and after managing to catch himself in time, they begin another clumsy battle of pulling cheeks and kicking shins, stumbling along the hallway in a kind of four-legged hop amidst Kagura's incoherent yells of 'pervert!' and 'die!'</p><p>Much to Sougo's humiliation and overall discomfort, she wins with a well aimed punch to his stomach. He doubles over, gasping and cursing her existence while she looks down at him proudly. "<em>Anyway,</em>" she says, talking over his well meaning wishes for her death, "I meant take fifty points from your own house, yup. The old lady is sure to fix whatever mess those perm-heads did to the counters, which means Toppuu's house points will also go back to normal. It's totally not fair, yes? I still want compensation!"</p><p>Sougo is about to tell her <em>exactly<em> where she can stick her compensation when his sight focuses and he notices a commotion at the end of the hallway. "China—" he tries, but Kagura snaps, "Take points off from Seiran again and this time I will break your legs for sure!"</em></em></p><p>
  <em>
    <em></em>
  </em>
</p><p>"Not that," Sougo grits between his teeth, straightening as best he can with a bruised gut. He jerks his chin in the direction of the corridor opening. "<em>That.<em>"</em></em></p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>Without waiting for Kagura to follow, he peels off from her to see what the noise is all about.</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>Distracted though Sougo was, it was a wonder he didn't notice sooner how their running had brought them all the way to the Entrance Hall. From the top of the grand, white jade staircase, he watches chaos unfold in the foyer below.</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>"What was that you said about the old lady fixing the counters, China?" he calls behind him. Kagura grudgingly catches up to him, peering around Sougo with reluctant curiosity. Her jaw drops.</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>The Entrance Hall is filled to the brim with students clustered around the four stone bowls that make up Mahoutokoro's house counters, gasping and yelling in both horrified and excited intervals as they watch grey, blue, and pale green petals spin and twirl with frantic disarray above their respective bowls, looking as if caught in a miniature hurricane. Tsukuyo Sensei is stationed at the forefront of it all, seemingly trying to maintain the crowd but with little success.</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>"Everybody back to your activities!" she yells. "Whatever you were doing before you decided to block off the Entrance Hall, get back to it!"</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>Sougo thinks that Tsukuyo's words would probably have more effect if they weren't punctuated with the occasional avid glance behind her, no doubt updating herself on who so far was winning.</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>He sighs, amused. "You'd think our own Deputy Headmistress would be above such petty rivalry. What has Mahoutokoro come to?"</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>Kagura hums shortly, a frown tugging at her mouth as she watches the progression of Seiran's fluttering grey petals. "I forgot she was also head of Yosamu. Gin-chan must be fighting really hard." </p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>The girl proceeds to shoot Sougo a dirty look. "You know that this is all your fault, yes?"</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>Sougo leans against the wall and looks to the ceiling in what is surely an infuriatingly nonchalant gesture. "Is it? I don't remember."</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>The taunt works. Rising up in a swell of fury, Kagura jabs a finger to his chest and shouts, "You know it was! School started only a week ago and already you are drunk on the power of the Student Council, yes? Taking away points for breathing — Gin-chan is right! Idiots in authority are a danger to society!"</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>He smirks and tucks his hands into his sleeves. "In that case, we can rest assured. It'll be a cold day in hell when you're appointed as member of the Council, after all."</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>Kagura's fuming scowl curls into a sneer. "As if I would <em>ever</em> want to be a stupid dog of the school."</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>Sougo shrugs, his gaze drifting disinterestedly. "It's just as well. I'd hate to see what would become of our beloved Mahoutokoro if we gave its biggest idiot a position of control." </p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>Across him, Kagura reels back in outraged offence. "You—" she begins and stops, her mouth opening and closing in a furious, silent diatribe. Unable to form a coherent enough expression, she screams in frustration and even goes as far as to stamp her foot, almost cracking the wooden planks underneath her heel. Sougo waits, already grinning; his patience isn't tested for long. In the affronted pause that follows Kagura's tantrum, she finally comes to a decision. "Fine," she snaps, and steps back to point dramatically between his eyes. "<em>Fine!</em> Challenge accepted! Next year, I will be sent an invitation to join the Council and you'll eat your words, yes?! We'll see who's the idiot then!"</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>He relaxes his smile into a leisurely drawl. "Oh? Don't forget — Headmaster Baka only makes those at the top of their class part of the council, and... well." He glances down at the pink of her robes and smirks. "Kamui tells me the only thing worse than your grades is your smell."</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>Kagura scoffs. "As if I will let something like homework stop me. You do <em>your</em> best not to forget, Okita Sougo," she says, fixes upon him her most determined glare. "I will stop at nothing to ensure I beat you and your dumb house! And <em>that,"</em> she spits, "is a promise!"</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>And with a final scowl, she spins on her heel and storms away.</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>Sougo watches her go, eyes tracing the bounce of her hair and the heaviness of her step. The scent of crackling fire and summer flowers lingers in the air and he breathes it in, relishing in both it and the echoing remnant of his name rolling from her lips. His grin is electric.</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>"I look forward to it, China."</p><p>
  <em>
    <em>
      <em>
        <em></em>
      </em>
    </em>
  </em>
</p><p>In the palace of Mahoutokoro, it's a beautiful day.</p><p>
