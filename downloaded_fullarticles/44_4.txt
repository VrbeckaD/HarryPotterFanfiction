    <p>CHP 1: Moments</p>
<p>“No one expects the rug to be yanked out from underneath them; life-changing events usually don’t announce themselves.”-Slash</p>
<p>It’s often said that the moments that change your life aren’t the big ones, like graduation, they don’t come with big signs letting you know; but go by with a simple whisper mostly unnoticed, like the sheer luck of sitting in a train compartment with a group of boys who would turn out to be some of the best friends you’ll ever make.  If you’d asked Remus if he had thought that joining the Order of Phoenix with those same boys, then young men, would have changed his life in such a manner he would have to admit that this too was another of those moments where he failed to appreciate it for what it was. Sure he knew it was important but it’s one of those funny things where he couldn’t see just how important or how it would all seem when it ended. He was merely trying to change the world after all-to make a stand.  But even now 4 years to the day after that fateful night where he lost that entire group of friends in one go; two to deaths’ cold embrace and one a traitor and locked away in Azkaban. He couldn’t come to grips with the idea that the single moment when they swore their wands to the cause that such a thing would happen. It’s always been the way of man to easily risk his own life than that of those he loves and as such it always comes as shock when that is exactly what happens.</p>
<p>Today would have seemed no different, small moments going by unnoticed an owl at his window tapping with a letter in claw.  Though not common not so unusual either that he thought anything of it until after it had dropped off the odd shaped letter and flew away.  It was such a small decision really that when faced with it he wouldn’t have even said he had made a choice so much as just ran through the familiar motions of opening the window to let an owl in.  The shape of the letter though, that gave him some pause.  It was the same size as those ran through the muggle post and it left him to wonder at its origins.  The return address:</p>
<p>Law Offices of Baxter And Stanton<br/>
14910 10th ST Suite G<br/>
Berkeley, CA</p>
<p>Now here was that big sign, the, ‘Hey you!!!  Your life is about to change!’ message.  He could not open it, he could leave it sitting on the kitchen table, burn it in the fire, shred it with his wand and perhaps his life could stay the same, but was that what he wanted? Not that a letter was going to do much in the way of changing his life; it wasn’t after all his Hogwarts’ acceptance letter. None the less, staring at the return address he mulled this over.  Did he really want his life to stay the same?  It was a manageable life but a lonely one, aside from the few owls and occasional fire calls from his two friends still around, well one really would be considered a mentor and the other,… well the other tolerated him out of loyalty to the same mentor.  Remus liked to delude himself into thinking this other man might one day see that he was different than his past group of friends had been, that he could also be his friend as well.  He had a lot of life left to live he’d like to think he’d have someone to share those days with even if only in a friendly manner.  Remus had long ago let go of the idea of falling in love getting married and starting a family, he was tainted; that didn’t change his longing to matter to someone, to be counted on.  With a deep chested sigh he slid his finger into the envelope and opened the letter once again forever changing his life.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Remus Lupin,<br/>
It is with our deepest sympathies that we are informing you of your 7th cousin’s departure from this earth, leaving behind one son, a young Binxley.  As you are the closest next of kin, by muggle and magical law his upbringing falls to you.<br/>
We are requesting a meeting between you and us to set up the details and go over what raising Binxley would entail.  If you feel unable to raise him we understand however, due to the unique circumstances that surround young Mr. Binxley, we believe that if we cannot place him with you we will not be able to find placement anywhere.<br/>
Please fire call us and we will come to you.  If you plan on raising your 8th cousin you will need a witness when we sign the documents and transfer guardianship over to you, and a G/dparent who may be the same as your witness to ensure that adequate care is given to Mr. Binxley.<br/>
Once again with our deepest sympathies,<br/>
Baxter, Teeney</p>
<p>To say Remus was shocked would be like saying Voldemort was bad, but beyond the shock Remus wondered at how this letter seemed to answer all the longing he had just listed.  If he were to take his cousin Binxley in he’d matter and be counted on, and he’d no longer be alone.  His heart started to glow, though he had thought he’d never get a chance to be a father, had thought the closest he’d get was with his friends’ children as a surrogate Uncle, he’d always wanted to be one.  For a brief time after Lily and James passed he’d hoped they’d give Harry to him, but…  And that’s when his heart turned to ice again.  Once these lawyers found out his furry little problem he wouldn’t get Binxley either.</p>
<p>He slumped down into his chair the defeated feeling that had haunted him almost his entire life wrapping tightly around his chest, tears sliding from his eyes.  He would always be alone.  He was worthless.  To those who have never felt that kind of emptiness he would be hard pressed to explain it and to those who had; well no one really ever wants to talk about it so much as just wanting someone there just in case the words wanted to come out. This darkness took him over as it always did slowly and then suddenly, and really even before he realized the shift; he went from being content to miserable.</p>
<p>With a quick gesture of his hand a bottle of fire whiskey zoomed to him.  It wasn’t often he drank, but tonight he really didn’t care, his friends were dead or locked up, poor little Harry was being raised by his muggle Aunt.  It was Halloween and while the rest of the wizarding world celebrated the defeat of the darkest wizard of their time he sat in mourning at the life he lost that dreadful day 4 years ago.  He should have died helping to protect them that night too, but Dumbledore had sent him off on a hopeless mission to keep the werewolves from falling into support of the death eaters.  Taking a deep pull on the bottle he wondered for the first time if Dumbledore hadn’t seen that such a thing was going to happen.  The old coot may be a little crazy but he was crazy sharp too, he’d of had to have known they had a traitor in their midst close to BOTH Lily and James.  He took another drink, and another, and another.  And with each drink the angrier and drunker he got. Worst of all the farther into the darkness his mind fell.</p>
<p>Soon enough that bottle was empty and he was working his way through its brother.  He looked around his home, the same walls that had comforted him when he was a child now seemed to mock him.  Telling the story of the little boy who grew up to be nothing; his clothes mended so many times his mends had mends and his furniture slowly falling into disrepair.  On other days he’d have said his home showed it was loved and lived in but today it screamed to him the state of which his life had become.  This home had once held laughter, love, and the smells of home cooking but no longer.  The longer he sat there the more alone he felt.  All he was doing was surviving, and for what?  He had fought for the downfall of the dark lord but for what?  This brave new world he had helped see brought about, that he had risked his life for was the same as the old one for him; he was still a second class citizen and he felt it in his whole being that he always would be.</p>
<p>As he drained away the last of his second bottle his blurry eyes went to his kitchen where they landed on his knives and in an instant one sat in his hand.  He saw it all clearly now there was no reason for his being.  He offered nothing to this world and his true friends were waiting on the other side for him.  It was so simple he wondered why he had not realized it sooner.  And in yet another life changing moment Remus Lupin took the blade to his arms and with an exquisite white burning pain he waited for the world fade to away.</p>
