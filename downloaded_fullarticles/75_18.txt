    <p>For someone who thinks decisions through as infrequently as Sirius, he operates with very few regrets. Sirius lives in a black and white world, makes choices based on emotion and principle. Unfortunately for him, most of the people around him understand nuance. He thought that greasy git got what was coming to him since he was so dead set on poking his nose around the whomping willow. He felt like– if nothing else – Snivelous was a bad person and should face the consequences for his actions in totality. Remus, on the other hand, disagreed completely. Remus had been so betrayed, and Sirius was starting to feel like maybe he too was a bad person. This prank, as he had called it, <em><strong>( </strong></em>although, wasn't it really an attempt on Severus's life <em><strong>) </strong></em>was currently atop his list of regrets, which only had three items on it. One, doing something that hurt Remus. Two, leaving Regulus behind in Grimmauld Place. Three, burdening his friends, and the Potters, instead of finding a way to handle his shit on his own, as a now free man. He was pretty sure all of his friends, aside from Remus, would disagree with item number three. Remus– sweet, kind, gentle Remus- would never admit to it, but Sirius was <em><strong>sure </strong></em>that he wasn't thrilled about Sirius's status as the Potter's second son, and James' best mate because it would keep Sirius away from him. However, much to what Sirius assumed was Remus' chagrin, Sirius had a special status among the marauders, and therefore Remus couldn't avoid him forever. Not when they were taking a six-hour trip to the beach to celebrate their two weeks of Easter holidays. All Sirius wanted to do was figure out where he stood, let his friends go on their stupid trip, and phase-out of Remus's life so he wouldn't have to deal with all of the weird interactions, the awkward exchanges of "oh– excuse me" and "I'm just leaving" and get back to his self-loathing in fucking <em><strong>peace </strong></em><em>thank you very much. </em>Sirius <em><strong>KNEW </strong></em>he was wrong, he knew that Remus had every right to hate him, and he just wants to get all of the uncomfortable shit over with so he doesn't have to think about how the boy that he's <strong>in love with </strong>can't stand to look at him anymore.</p><p>He practically jumps six feet in the air when he hears someone entering the dormitory. It could be anyone, so he tries to tell himself that there's only a 33% chance that it's the one person that doesn't want to see him. He keeps his eyes trained on the floor, waiting with bated breath to see if whoever entered greets him. He knows Remus won't since they're not speaking, and he can't bring himself to watch the way his best mate's face twists into a grimace when they lock eyes. What catches him off guard is the way Remus's soft voice meets his ears– it's so tight it mimics the tightness in his chest, and he can't understand what the fuck is happening for a moment. <em><strong>" </strong></em>James said you're coming to Seilebost." It's not a question really, Sirius knows that. Remus trying to suss out whether or not this is going to be a disaster, that's why he's bringing it up. It kind of hurts his heart to think Remus can't trust him to not ruin a holiday, even if Sirius knows that he came close to ruining a lot more than that when he told Severus how to pass the willow. </p><p>"Oh, so we're talking now?" The moment the words tumble from between his lips, Sirius knows he's made a mistake. He didn't <em><strong>mean </strong></em>to sound like a bitchy nonce, but it's been kind of lonely in the dorm lately. He hasn't had anyone he can turn to, because everyone knows he was wrong. And usually, when he's blatantly wrong and being dramatic, that's when he turns to Remus, who listens and then grounds him in reality. </p><p>"Don't be a bloody tosser. I'm just fucking asking." Remus knows he's using insults, so why does his voice come out sounding so <em><strong>sad </strong></em><strong><em>?? </em></strong>However sad he sounds, it doesn't stop Sirius from wincing, the same way he does when people yell at him. And then Remus's stomach is twisting with guilt. He didn't mean to <strong>scare </strong>Sirius, but he has every right to feel hurt. </p><p>"Sorry– sorry Moony, you're right. I uh– yeah, he said that being cooped up here by myself would be bad for the old psyche." His voice comes out somewhere between a whisper and a mumble, and it's hard to imagine the way the two of them laughed and yelled boisterously only a few weeks ago. But now, everything is different for them, and it's tearing Sirius up inside. </p><p>"Don't call me Moony– Sorry I– we're not there yet." </p><p>Sirius can practically hear his heart crack inside of his chest at that. All the hurt and pain and frustration bubble up in his chest, threatening to choke him, because how could he have done something so <em><strong>stupid </strong></em>and reckless and let Snivellous get in the middle of their friendship?</p><p>"Oh, we're not? Do enlighten me Remus, where the fuck are we then?" He snaps, and he <em>knows </em>this isn't the way to solve the problem, but maybe if he's short enough, Remus will finally yell and scream and give Sirius what he <em><strong>deserves. </strong></em></p><p>"You absolute prat! It's not my fault you're a selfish bastard who almost killed someone and got me arrested! God, if you could think of someone outside of yourself for five <em><strong>fucking seconds </strong></em>we wouldn't even be in this god damn position!" </p><p>"No great losses if you killed Snivelous. Would've been worth it."</p><p>"And it would have been worth it if they locked me in fucking Azkaban? Glad you have your priorities sorted. Maybe people are right about you. Maybe you don't know how to be anything other than a <em><strong>b l a c k. </strong></em>I can't believe I trusted you." Remus can feel himself breathing heavily because this is all so foreign to him. He doesn't yell. He's the calm, collected friend. So how did he end up losing his cool this badly? He doesn't even believe some of the things he's saying, and he knows that these wounds will cut the other boy deeply. Maybe he wants Sirius to feel how badly he hurt him. But this is surely unfair, and when Remus stops fuming, he'll probably regret this. </p><p>Sirius, on the other hand, is shocked. He practically runs out of the room to the toilets because everything hurts and he just needs to be <em><strong>alone. </strong></em>His skin feels like it's on fire, and his breathing is ragged. All he can think of is his father's voice between his ears calling him <em>weak, worthless, pathetic, disappointment. </em>He can see the look on Reg's face as he ran out the door, and when Reg found him kissing Remus in the hallway yelling "<em>no brother of mine!" </em>And at that moment, Sirius wonders if he's doomed to ruin every one of his relationships. He finally makes it to the toilets and locks himself in a stall. He crumples as soon as he's alone, pulling his knees to his chest and trying to steady his breathing. It doesn't help that the tears that threatened him through his whole morning have now started to spill over, and Sirius has never felt so disappointed and guilty. he's trying to convince himself that he'll be fine on his own but everything hurts because for <em>once </em>Sirius thought he could have something, and how could he have been so dumb. Of course, he can't have this. He can never keep a good thing. Not with the way his mind crumbles into an endless ricochet of the Most Ancient and Nobel House Black. </p><p>Remus wasn't expecting Sirius to react like this. He <em><strong>knows </strong></em>that Sirius is all bravado all the time and that there's usually a lot more going on beneath the surface for him, but he didn't think that asking him not to use such an affectionate nickname would result in Sirius running away in tears. He didn’t mean to yell, it just kind of happened. It’s not his fault Sirius betrayed him! The anxiety and guilt of making Sirius feel that way washes over him like the tide and leaves him exposed, like in the first rays of the sun after the full moon. It <em>hurts </em>to be so open, so exposed, but what is Remus supposed to do. He can't forgive Sirius yet, no matter how desperately he wants to. He can't get over the betrayal of trust just <em>like that. </em>And he shouldn't have to. Not when this is Sirius's fault in the first place. It's not like Remus betrayed his trust and exposed <em>his </em>secret. Remus climbs into his bed, ready to simply let the emotions fall by the wayside and sit down to do his homework. He opens his Defense Against the Dark Arts text and tries diligently to focus on his homework. But his thoughts keep roaming to the tear tracks down Sirius's face and the way Sirius looked so guilty. It's not like Remus hasn't ever seen Sirius cry (even though he'd probably never admit it). Just two weeks ago, after they had fallen into bed together Sirius had begged him to promise that they would never let something get between them the way his parents had. He assumes that the Prank, as Sirius had called it, wasn't some premeditated event, and that night–those tears before the full– had much more to do with a fight with Regulus after he had seen them together. But Remus was not Sirius's keeper! It wasn't his job to hold Sirius's hand and ignore his own safety for Sirius's catastrophic emotions. At least, that was what he told himself as he slammed his book closed, and before he knew it, he was knocking on the door of the stall Sirius was sitting in, seeing his muggle sneakers and ripped trousers through a gap between the door and the floor. He can hear Sirius's breath hitch, and it sounds like he's trying to stop crying. </p><p>"Siri? Cariad, please open the door." He tries, his voice gentle. </p><p>"If I open the door, will you actually listen to an apology or are you ju-just gonna walk away again." Technically it's a question, but Sirius doesn't allow for that. He knows the answer, and he's so tired of the disappointed look Remus has taken to wearing. </p><p>"Open the door, Pads. Please." No sooner has Remus said it, than Sirius is unlocking the door and pulling him into a hug. </p><p>"You can hate me forever if you wanna, Moon– I mean, Remus. I just– I need you to know that I didn't a-a-actually think he'd come. I th-thought he'd get cold feet, and I dunno I don't know what I was thinking and I'm so, so sorry." And then he's sobbing again into Remus' shoulder and he's muttering about how he doesn't deserve anything and that he messes everything up and Remus' heart is breaking because <em>fuck </em>he never wants Sirius to feel like <strong>this. </strong></p><p>He takes a deep breath, trying to convince his own heart rate to slow because as much as Sirius means to him, as much as Remus cares, things can't go back to the way they were. Sirius can't be trusted yet. Not when he sold them out the way he had and selfishly told Snape how to find Remus at his most vulnerable. "Siri, I'm gonna forgive you." He states, carding a hand through the other boy's hair. He means it too, he will forgive Sirius, he knows it. It's just a matter of when he feels ready. "I'm just not ready for things to go back to how they were yet. You– you hurt me, y'know? Doesn't mean I don't still care about you, just that we need to figure out how to get through this part of things." </p><p>Sirius nods into his shoulder, his whole body trembling. "Don't suppose this means I can uh-" he starts, but then he pulls away and looks down at his feet. "I'm sorry... I was gonna ask if you wanted to join me back in the dormitory, but that's probably pushing it... I'm sorry."</p><p>"We'll get there, cariad. For now, I can help you pack?" </p><p>They make their way over to Sirius' bed, and he pulls out a bag to pack full of clothes for the Easter holidays. He grabs a few pairs of ripped jeans, taking into account which ones Remus is drawn to and grabs a few t-shirts out of his trunk. He reaches for a beige, cable knit jumper, and Remus lets out a chuckle. "That's mine."</p><p>"I know." Sirius replies, a grin breaking out on his face. His teeth graze his bottom lip as he looks over at Remus, before raising the jumper and smelling it. "You smell really fucking good." </p><p>"Glad you think so." </p><p>Sirius looks over at Remus again, like a lovesick puppy, and he notices that Remus takes another step towards him. He wonders where they stand because he doesn't really feel like the question has been answered. But that doesn't stop him from blatantly giving Remus a once over and biting his lip. Sirius has his heart on his sleeve at this moment, and he just wants to crawl back into bed with his lover, to be held and loved. Sirius can feel his chest constrict as he leans up, and his lips brush Remus's. "Anything you'd particularly like to see me in?" He asks with a smirk. </p><p>Remus grins wolfishly and nods. “Anything that’s mine, Pads.”  He pulls Sirius into a tight embrace, which catches the other boy off guard, but he’s relaxing into it within seconds. </p><p>“Missed you, cariad.” </p><p>“Missed you too, Moony.” </p><p>Sirius feels Remus’ arms tighten around his slight frame, and he knows that something is wrong. </p><p>“Rem, love, you alright? Should we sit?” </p><p>Sirius doesn't even wait for an answer before pulling Remus to the bed and running his fingers through his curly blonde hair. He can feel the tears that wet the fabric across his shoulder, and he just wants to know how to help. “Moony?”</p><p>”’M fine Pads. I just—“</p><p>”You don’t have to be fine. If this is too much I-we don’t have to.”</p><p>”No–“ it sounds so desperate when he disagrees, and Sirius wonders what kind of toll this fight has taken on him. </p><p>“just– really missed you– an’ I-I-I dunno.” <br/>
“You don’t have to know. ‘S okay.” Sirius presses a kiss to his forehead and continues to run his fingers through Remus’ hair. They lay like that, Sirius whispering his affection in Remus’s ear until Remus falls asleep. </p><p>When he hears Remus's breathing even out, Sirius's thoughts drift back to all he's done wrong– all the ways in which his friends will never forgive him. He thinks about the Potters, and how much they've done for him, and he's only repaid them by endangering and burdening their son. He thinks about Peter, all anxiety and fear wrapped up in the bravery of constantly forcing himself out of his comfort zone– how Peter would probably feel much more comfortable if Sirius wasn't constantly forcing him into uncomfortable situations. And then there's Remus, who he could never make up for what he's done to. Remus is sweet and kind, soft kisses in the dead of night and fleeting touches, and <em><strong>fucking hell </strong></em>why did he have to go and fuck this up? Then there's Regulus, who he <strong>left behind. </strong>How could he have done that? By the time that he takes pause over Regulus, he notices he's been crying. Like a lot. And Remus must have been exhausted if he didn't wake up and notice, which Sirius is grateful for. He reaches for his wand and casts "<em>Muffliato</em>" because he really doesn't want anyone to ask him about it tomorrow. Sirius lets his emotion roll through him until he's too tired to think anymore, and closes his eyes. His breathing is still ragged, and he tried burying himself in Remus's embrace as deeply as he can. The overwhelming feeling of <em>home </em>in Remus' arms is enough to bring him peace, and allow him to drift off to sleep. </p>
