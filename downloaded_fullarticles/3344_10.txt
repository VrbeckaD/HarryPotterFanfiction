    <p>Regulus congratulated Narcissa as soon as the news was confirmed. He smiled as warmly as he possibly could as a wave of nausea hit him hard.</p>
<p>All he had to do was look towards Malfoy to know that any child Lucius had would be condemned to a depressing fate. A fate with no choice, a fate filled with despair and one so lonely that it would crush the poor child.</p>
<p>A fate that Regulus knew all too well.</p>
<p>He couldn’t do it, couldn’t bear the thought of his soon-to-be cousin left with only Malfoy’s prejudiced thoughts. It wouldn’t end well for the baby. It couldn’t.</p>
<p>So, Regulus did the only thing he could. He wrote it all out and made sure that the next Malfoy heir would get a complete story, one that wasn’t biased, one that wasn’t shrouded in darkness aimed at being an infallible truth.</p>
<p>Regulus wrote to his cousin and hoped it would be enough.</p>
