          <div class="userstuff"><p>He was giving up. That was all there was too it. As another hex hit his back, making his knees buckle, Draco made up his mind. He was done.<br/>
"DEATH EATER!" Draco flailed, the hex knocking his legs from beneath him.<br/>
He. Was. SO. Done.<br/>
Nonetheless, Draco couldn’t let people call him a coward. Not anymore. Staggering to his feet, he extended his wand, hex forming on his lips.<br/>
“Flipindo!”<br/>
Before Draco could even draw breath, a jinx flew over his shoulder. Turning, he found himself eye level with the wand that vanquished the Da- Voldemort.<br/>
"Don't you have something better to do? The war is over. Fuck off!" Potter yelled, anger sizzling in his voice. Unsurprisingly, the students scrambled away.<br/>
Before Draco could fully comprehend what just happened, Potter gave Draco a once over, smiled a tired, weary smile, before making to saunter away. Draco’s arm moved of its own accord, holding onto Potter’s robes unbidden.<br/>
As Potter stared questioningly, Draco’s mouth worked like a codfish.<br/>
“Thanks.” He eventually croaked. Potter smirked, mischief in his eyes.<br/>
“That’s the first time I’ve heard you say that, Malfoy.” Instantly, the moment ended. Draco rolled his eyes as Potter sniggered.<br/>
“Don’t get used to it.” He shot back, smiling as Potter’s laugh continued. Maybe he wasn’t so done after all.</p></div>
