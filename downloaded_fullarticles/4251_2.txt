    <p>"There's the train!" Meliodas Leviathan spun towards his father, eyes wide and cheeks flushed with excitement. The Hogwarts Express was <em>huge</em>, a beautiful, gleaming scarlet snake with smoke (that was purely for show, of course; the train had "gone green" <em>ages</em> ago) pouring off of it. It was the transport to his destiny, to a place where he was going to learn <em>magic</em> and <em>fly</em> and do all sorts of absolutely <em>amazing</em> things. "That's it, right, Father?"</p><p>Rexicus Leviathan let out a small huff of amusement, setting down his trunk with one hand (the owl that was gently coerced into the carrier on top of it hissed in annoyance). "Yes, that's definitely it." He was a tall man, with broad shoulders and dark, dark eyes that both of his little brothers inherited. Out of the three Leviathan children, only Meliodas had green eyes; people always commented on how little he looked like his father with his short stature and blond hair, and he was never quite sure whether he was glad about that or not. <em>But that's not going to bother me today</em>, he vowed, sneaking a hopeful glance at the train. Whether he was Sorted into Slytherin like his father or Ravenclaw like his mother didn't matter to him; either way, he'd find a way to make his father proud. <em>At least, that was what he said</em>.</p><p>"Can I go on?" Zeldris's black eyes were bright with wonder, and he glanced at his little brother. He looked the most like their father, with wild ebony hair and eyes that seemed to glitter with a dark sort of brilliance. The only thing the two of them had in common was their short stature, inherited from their mother; both of them looked tiny next to the giant-of-a-man that was their dad. "Just for a minute, Father, <em>please</em>--"</p><p>"Don't be stupid, 'dris," Estarossa snorted, strolling back over to them with hands shoved into his pockets. His brother had wandered off as soon as they were through the magical barrier, and he returned now with all the self-satisfaction of a ten-year-old. "You know you'd try to sneak into a compartment at the first chance you got." Black eyes flashed with an amusement that seemed beyond his years; he looked nothing like either of their parents, Estarossa Leviathan, with silver hair and a flicker of a constant catlike smile.</p><p>"I would not!"</p><p>Meliodas exchanged a glance with Estarossa and rolled his eyes. Considering that Zeldris had vocalized his desire to go to Hogwarts from the time he was about <em>three</em> and had first heard of the place, the argument was rather...<em>ineffective</em>. "I'll send you loads of owls, of course," he told his brother, reaching out to ruffle the eight-year-old's hair. "And you're going to be the one going soon enough."</p><p><em>"Three whole years,"</em> Zeldris grumbled. "That's too looooooooooong." He drew out the last word, before descending into incoherent muttering, presumably cursing whoever had decided that Hogwarts students started at eleven years of age.</p><p>His father laughed, a deep, rumbling sound. "I'll leave you three to say goodbye, then." He bent down, arms open for a hug, and Meliodas gave him a dubious look. He was <em>eleven</em>, for God's sake, he didn't <em>do</em> goodbye hugs anymore.<em> You're not going to see him for a long time</em>, <em>though</em>, a small voice reminded him (very much against his will). <em>This is the last hug you'll get from him for awhile</em>.</p><p><em>I really hate that logical little voice sometimes</em>, he thought, but he went in for the hug anyway. Rexicus's embrace was deep, drowning, and for a second he felt like he was five again, clinging to his father after a scraped knee or bruised knuckles, and he was suddenly glad that the stupid voice in his head had convinced him. "Gonna miss you," he whispered.</p><p>"I'll miss you too, little demon." Meliodas felt his father's hand ruffle already-messy blond hair and he drew back, staring at the man indignantly--he'd just brushed it, seriously; it wasn't as if he needed to look any <em>more</em> like a little kid on his first day at Hogwarts. His father only chuckled, getting to his feet. "I'll be at the barrier," he informed Estarossa and Zeldris. "You two don't hold your brother up, okay?"</p><p>"Fine," huffed the former. Zeldris only bounced on his toes and beamed, all mischief and childish glee, and their father left with one last booming laugh, waving. He bit back a grin, wrapping his hand around the handle on the side of his trunk and glancing around, letting the mess of laughter and bickering and voices surround him as his eyes skimmed over the platform. A boy who looked to be his age floated--floated!--past, arguing with a short girl in white as a brunette blew past them and charged onto the train with her trunk dragging behind her, a disgruntled-looking Great Horned owl on her shoulder. A serene-looking black cat was slung around the shoulders of a tall girl with sleek black hair, flattening its ears with a hiss that he could practically hear as a lanky boy with blond hair edged past her, the tiny owl on his trunk letting out a hoot of annoyance. Pink hair caught at the corner of his gaze, and he turned to watch a slender person (he couldn't quite tell whether they were male or female) glide past, continuing right past a...</p><p>Oh.</p><p><em>Wow</em>.</p><p>Silver hair, blue eyes, and a grin that seemed even wider than his own flashed like sunshine through the smoke; she trotted right past him (he hoped that he didn't look too starstruck) chatting eagerly to two girls who looked sort of like her, but older, a man as tall and broad-shouldered as his own father following them with loving concern written all over his face. "Close your mouth," Estarossa advised, and Meliodas realized belated that he'd been gaping at the girl, shutting his mouth with a small snap as his face heated up. An knowing grin crossed his brother's face. "She <em>was</em> pretty, though."</p><p>Pretty, Meliodas decided, barely covered what that first sight of her had induced in him, but he nodded anyway. "Yeah."</p><p>"She's a girl," Zeldris pointed out, wrinkling his nose. "Girls are...alright, I guess, but they're <em>mean</em>."</p><p>"You can't say they're all mean just because you don't like Melascula," he admonished, grimacing slightly at the thought of their slightly <em>too</em> snakelike cousin. Mela was the perfect stereotypical Slytherin, back when House discrimination had been rampant (as it was, there was still a lot of competition, but Gryffindors--which, to be honest, his father generally despised--and Slytherins no longer hexed each other constantly)--cunning, secretive, and with a clear sadistic streak to accompany her Ministry ambitions.</p><p>"She bit me!" And there was the fact that she also had tiny fangs, for some bizarre reason. Odd defects like Estarossa's (and the unknown girl's) silver hair and Mela's mildly frightening ability to unhinge her jaw were becoming more and more common in the Wizarding World; he'd counted about a thousand unusual hair colors on Platform Nine-and-Three-Quarters, including a very eye-scorching shade of neon green.</p><p>"What about Derieri?" he suggested, standing on his toes (he'd never felt his short stature as keenly as he did now, trying to stare over everyone's heads to get a glimpse of the silver-haired girl). The only daughter of their mother's family friend, the wild little girl was certainly more interesting and less frightening than Melascula, though she was worryingly aggressive.</p><p>"Punched me in the face," Zeldris muttered, crossing his arms defiantly. "Who just punches someone in the face? She didn't even get in trouble!"</p><p>"Because that's her way of showing affection," Estarossa replied. "Psychotic as women are, that girl has clearly stolen our brother's heart with nary a word, and we must prepare to fight on the battlefields of love--"</p><p>"Shove off, 'rossa," Meliodas snorted. "I don't even know her."</p><p>"<em>Yet."Â  </em>Estarossa rubbed his hands together gleefully, dark eyes bright behind silvery bangs. "Here's what's going to happen, brother. You're going to find her compartment, drop in with a little 'sorry, everywhere else is full', and use that magical combination of common sense, sarcasm, and terrible jokes to sweep her off her feet."</p><p>"You're <em>ten</em>," he felt compelled to point out. "And I'm eleven. How do you know so much about romance?"</p><p>"Unimportant," his brother dismissed, which meant that he'd either gotten into the hidden section of sleazy romance novels that their mother had loved and Father had deemed 100% off-limits or that he'd been watching Muggle films again without permission (Zeldris snorted with amusement at what the eldest knew he saw as the stupidity of his brothers; he was in all honesty the only one of them with any sense). "Now go, shoo!"</p><p>"Yeah, yeah," he muttered, reaching out to loop an arm companionably around his brother's shoulders, a one-armed sort of hug that felt grown-up enough for a Hogwarts student (he still gave a proper hug to Zeldris; he was only eight, after all). "I'll see you at Christmas."</p><p>"You'd better send owls," Zeldris reminded him, voice wavering just a little bit. "Every day."</p><p>"Well, obviously. You think you can handle that, Wandle?" The Barn Owl chirruped indignantly, flapping his tawny wings as if to say "Who do you think you're talking to?" He grinned at his owl, lifting his trunk up onto the small wheels on the back as he turned towards the train, hauling the boxlike structure filled with all the possessions he'd have at Hogwarts up onto it behind him. Already it felt more real, standing here in the strangely comforting confines of the crowded Hogwarts Express, the suddenly solemn black eyes of his brothers seeming very far away. "Stay safe!" he shouted across to them, but the rumbling of the train drowned out his words. Meliodas stared across at them for a moment longer, trying to force his eyes to stop stinging, before taking a deep breath and tearing his gaze away as he started the (surprisingly short) journey to an empty compartment.</p><p>Well. Mostly empty.</p><p>Red eyes (<em>actual</em> <em>red</em>, the kind of scarlet that made people think of blood) opened, a grin stretching across the angular face of the lanky kid sprawled across the opposite seat. His lack of House robes meant that he must've been an incoming first-year like him, but he was easily tall enough to pass for a third-year, with a furry white thing that definitely wasn't a cat or an owl (or a toad, but who the hell brought toads anyway?) draped over his shoulder. Meliodas stared back, paralyzed by the strange intensity of the other boy's gaze. <em>Why do I feel like he's going to eat me?</em></p><p>Then the boy barked a laugh and sat up, lips curled in an easy smile. "No need to look so scared. Unless you decide to piss me off, that is~" He drew out the last word in a languid drawl, strange scarlet eyes glittering with amusement. "Name's Ban. You?"</p><p>"Meliodas." He almost said his surname before realizing that the other boy hadn't given his, instead glancing back at the mostly-full train. "Um, mind if I sit here? It seems to be filling up fast."</p><p>Ban shrugged. "By all means." Meliodas could feel his gaze on his back as he forced his trunk under the seat, yelping as the train suddenly lurched forward (oh God, this was it, <em>this was freaking it)</em> and nearly knocking Wandle's carrier onto the floor. He caught it, slid into the seat across from him, and glanced out the window. The sky was a pale blue, almost like ice, but the black-white-and-gray of the city was already fading, hues of brilliant emerald starting to roll over the world. <em>Slytherin green</em>, he thought, and wondered absently whether his robes and tie would soon match.</p><p>"What House d'you think you're going to be in?" The words slipped out without him even realizing until a few seconds later; Ban, however, looked somewhat pleased--almost as if he'd wanted to strike up some kind of conversation.</p><p>"Dunno, really. Dad was a Hufflepuff and so's my little brotherâwell, he's probably going to be," he amended, and Meliodas chuckled.Â  "I think I might be Slytherin--Slytherin or Gryffindor, maybe."</p><p><em>Gryffindor</em>. Where dwell the brave at heart, they said. His father had never liked Gryffindor, calling them a group of self-righteous, overly pompous bastards, and he himself had never met one, but the stories he heard...well, he couldn't deny that some small part of him wanted to see what it was like to be part of a House of heroes. "We might be in the same House, then," he remarked, grinning at the thought (<em>see, 'rossa, I'm not a hopeless case when to comes to friends). </em>"My whole family's been in Slytherin and Ravenclaw, and I'm definitely not clever enough for Ravenclaw, so..."</p><p>"Maybe you'll be the exception," Ban suggested, eyes glinting with amusement.</p><p>Meliodas shrugged, still grinning. "Maybe." He doubted it, thoughâhe wasn't brave, just reckless. "You have a brother?"</p><p>His smile stretched even wider, baring tiny fangs. <em>They're almost like Melascula's, </em>he thought, intrigued. "Yeah, Therion. He's a good kidâsweet, friendly, loves Chocolate Frog cards. Basically the polar opposite of me."</p><p><em>You seem pretty friendly to me,</em> he thought to himself. Aloud he said, "You hate Chocolate Frog cards?"Â </p><p>A laugh was startled from Ban. "Okay, maybe not the complete opposite. What's your favorite?"</p><p>"Nymphadora Tonks," Meliodas answered immediately, and Wandle chirruped in agreement. His father had told him stories about the Battle of Hogwarts from all those years ago, about the heroes who died in it and were immortalized in history, and while Harry Potter himself tended to be the favorite of the masses (not to say he didn't <em>like</em> him; Harry Potter was probably thirty times braver than he'd ever be and he had a name that sounded a lot less stupid than his), he'd always gravitated towards Tonks. A Metamorphmagus, a troublemaker hero that charged into battle despite the fact that she could've stayed home and protected her baby and no one would've blamed her, an Auror who fought Dark wizards for a living, she was everything he secretly dreamed of being. <em>Brave, good, loyal</em>.Â </p><p>A low hiss came from behind Ban, but he didn't look, instead watching to gauge the possible friend's reaction. The other boy tilted his head. "Woulda pegged you for Lily Potter or Fred Weasley, to be honest, but Tonks is cool." Those fangs flashed in another grin. "My favorite's Sirius Black."</p><p><em>Sirius Black. </em>He'd been a criminal, a maverick, wild, quick to anger and quick to defuse, but with a heart the size of the sun and a ferocious loyalty to the people he loved. <em>Yeah, that suits him, </em>Meliodas thought before furrowing his brow. <em>How would I know that?</em></p><p>Of course, before he could dwell on it, a blur of pink--<em>pink?</em> What kinds of animals were pink (it was obviously too small to be human)?--burst into the compartment with a yowl, making Wandle screech and the tiny white creature jumped to its paws with a shriek, bouncing off of Ban's shoulder and onto the seat next to him. It was a fox, he realized, a small white fox that was baring its sharp fangs at...at a rather plump-looking cat that was now perched on the luggage rack above them, hissing. A cat that was <em>also</em> bright pink with darker patches. <em>How the hell...</em></p><p>"Sorry!" a voice, bright and cheerful and sounding slightly panicked, called. Meliodas managed to tear his gaze away from the (bright freaking pink, for someÂ  bizarre reason) cat and towards the door of the compartment, where a girl was standing.</p><p>A girl with silver hair and bright blue eyes.</p><p>
  <em>Oh dear.</em>
</p><p>"Sorry," she repeated sheepishly, pulling her trunk into view. "Hawk got away while we were looking for a compartment, and it looks like everywhere else is full. Can I sit here?"</p>
