<p align="left">Today would be the day a certain Miss Hermione Granger headed to Hogwarts: School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for the first day of school for her last time. Surely this academic year would be exciting but numerous things would be different.</p>
<p align="left">First of all, her two most beloved friends who resembled brothers to her, Mr. Ron Weasley and Mr. Harry Potter, wouldn't be there to rejoin her. They both decided that instead of finishing at Hogwarts, they'd begin Auror training.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Second, she wouldn't have to deal with the stress. The Dark Lord had brought upon enough for her and her friends, mainly Harry, during their more adolescent years at Hogwarts. That is admittedly one critical difference Hermione is definitely happy about.</p>
<p align="left">And the final main change, and perhaps the saddest, is that she would have to experience her official last year without her calm and wise Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, who had been tragically killed about 2 years before then.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">And just before Hermione could dwell unduly deeper in her thoughts and the unusual eeriness in the cabin that was usually filled with Harry and Ron's loud chatter, the door opened very smoothly.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">From out the corner of her calculating eye, the brunette saw a familiar redhead. As the girl turned to examine the full view, she recognized it was Ginny and was breathless for a second.</p>
<p align="left">Hermione has been hopelessly in love with Ginny since her second year and Ginny's first. Every moment she saw her, the brunette's heart would skip a beat about 500 times in a row.</p>
<p align="left">Ginny had nothing special on and was currently in her regular clothes - a pair of jeans and a band t-shirt Hermione gave her 2 years ago - but she still looked breathtaking to the brunette.</p>
<p align="left">The embarrassed girl's personal thoughts were interrupted again when Ginny said hi to Hermione.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">"Hey, 'Mione. Mind if I sit here? I noticed it was unoccupied," Ginny said, jokingly and with a hint of sympathy, while cocking a grin that made Hermione's heart skip a beat again.</p>
<p align="left">"Uh... Um," Hermione carefully said to try not to stutter,"sure. Take a seat."</p>
<p align="left">Ginny offered a crooked smile before continuing eagerly. "So, best friend, how was your summer break," asked Ginny, who was always interested in hearing about Muggle life, even though it sometimes confused her.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">"Oh," said Hermione trying not to boast in front of the charming girl she dearly loved, " it was impressive. We visited Portugal but nothing overly exciting. We had been there a while ago."</p>
<p align="left">"Wow. I wish I went somewhere, but I guess it is good having time to be on your broom all day playing Quidditch," Ginny said with a shrug but with a smirk.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">"Yeah, I guess..." Hermione said, trying not to blush by the smirk Ginny unwittingly gave her. But the last part the brunette said was because she didn't really fly on brooms and definitely didn't play Quidditch. She was likely the only Gryffindor who didn't live and breathe Quidditch, but that's an outdated stereotype.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">"So," Ginny said, cutting into the older girl's thoughts again, " do you think this year will be fun?"</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">"I dunno, without Ron and Harry, I dunno how it'll be precisely but I know positively I'll survive with you and Luna around." Said gently Hermione, with a casual shrug and a smile.</p>
<p align="left">Luna Lovegood is also Hermione's close friend. Even though she used to despise how the Ravenclaw girl was so happy in the midst of things, Luna was, nonetheless, a funny person and a very good friend.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">"Well, thanks. I genuinely appreciate that. And I feel the same way about you and Luna," said Ginny enthusiastically.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Hermione blushed before starting again, "So are you captain of the Quidditch team?"</p>
<p align="left">"Yea. The kid who took Harry's spot last year had to leave Hogwarts because of extreme family business, and of course, we didn't play a lot of official games, if you even call them that, so they carefully picked whoever played on the team the longest and lived it practically and unanimously chose me."</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">"That's excellent. Congrats, Ginny!"</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">"Thanks. I would have been undoubtedly elected captain anyway this year," Ginny said triumphantly with a smirk.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Just before Hermione could respond with a teasing remark, the recently sealed door had completely opened again, noticeably smoother than when the redhead forced the door open. A familiar enthusiastic blonde appeared through the door opening and sat down across Hermione.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">"Hey Hermione and Ginny," Luna said gleefully. "How have you girls been?"</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">"I'm alright." Said Ginny quickly as she was looking for something out the door before turning back to the two girls.</p>
<p align="left">"I'm doing absolutely well, and you?" Hermione said trying not to focus on Ginny.</p>
<p align="left">"I'm doing fine. Merely appreciating the scenery for the billionth time. It's extremely alluring, don't you think," Luna asked nonchalantly but curiously as she eyed Hermione for her opinion.</p>
<p align="left">"Definitely, yes it is," Hermione said, "kinda sad this is our last time heading to Hogwarts."</p>
<p align="left">"Indeed, it is," Luna said a bit glumly — a look Hermione never saw on the blonde — before continuing, "and Ginny. What exactly are you looking at or waiting for?"</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">"Hmm?" Ginny said a bit bewildered. "Oh, I was merely waiting for the snack cart to come down this way. You know, I have to build up muscle for this season," Ginny said with a smirk that made the brunette fluster for the umpteenth time in 15 minutes, which Luna clearly saw with a smirk.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">"Agreed, you may have a chance at actually going on a date since you are so muscular," Luna said with air quotations but also with a playful and devious smirk.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">"I have always been rugged," Ginny said proudly, "don't doubt my guns." The redhead said with a smirk.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">"Yea, well... Don't focus on just working out," Hermione said pointedly at the redhead. "You do know we have a bunch of exams and a lot more homework, right?"</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">"Yea, yea. Like there is a year where we don't have much homework and exams. I'll be fine."</p>
<p align="left">Right when Ginny completed her statement with another smirk, the snack cart had just pulled up right outside the cabin door.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">"Oh hello, Miss Weasley," the lady said brightly,"Miss Granger, Miss Lovegood. I take as you want everything you can have, right?"</p>
<p align="left">"Right," Ginny said brightly as she stood up to get her snacks.</p>
<p align="left">"The Weasley appetite, I tell you..." Hermione whispered loudly, on purpose, with a smirk towards a giggling Luna and then a bewildered Ginny.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Hermione could have sworn she saw a faint blush on Ginny's face, but she decided to pay no attention to it and pester her about it later.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">"Why were you guys laughing and smirking?" Asked Ginny suspiciously while placing all her snacks on the side of her.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">The scene of the cabin reminded her of Ron's eating on the seat and Harry looking out the window with things on his mind. It made Hermione feel quite bittersweet.</p>
<p align="left">"Nothing," Luna said trying to suppress a giggle</p>
<p align="left">"Yea, OK." The redhead said unconvinced.</p>
<p align="left">"Well, let's change into our robes," Hermione said trying not to giggle, "we should be at Hogwarts soon."</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
