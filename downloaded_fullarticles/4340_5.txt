<p align="JUSTIFY">Hey there :)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It has been some time already that I wanted to post this, because how much I love my tattoos and their meanings &lt;3</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">(Again, I'm not a native English speaker, and I don't beta the “What's inside my head” series :D Apologies for potential mistakes.)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Let us begin at the beginning. My. First. Tattoo. Ever.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">December 5th, 2015. As an early Christmas present, my parents agreed to my first tattoo. I'm not over the age of majority yet, so my mother had to stay with me while the tattooer did his work.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">“Always”. With the A in the shape of the Deathly Hallows.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Obviously, I did it as a tribute to “Harry Potter”. At the time, it was 10 years after I fell in love with the series. I really wanted to mark this “birthday” with something very special, in addition to my “10 Years Marathon” of the seven books.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">On the Internet, I saw a few HP tattoos, but I wasn't really looking for ideas at first. I was just amazed with some of them.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After a few years of consideration, and as I was almost of age, I decided I would ink my 10 years tribute on my skin.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Tribute to the saga.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Tribute to the fandom.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Tribute to Severus Snape as well.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">“Harry Potter” deeply changed my life. I was seven when I watched the first movie. It was at school, the Friday afternoon just before All Saints holiday.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I remember my mom buying me my first book. And I remember even more vividly my mom buying me the seventh book - I nearly cried when she came home with it.</p>

  <em>(January 15th, 2016)</em>
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">At first, and until the “Tale of the Prince”, I loathed Severus Snape. He was the one who hated Harry Potter and his friends, the one who we didn't know which side he was on, the one who murdered Dumbledore.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">His memories redeemed him to my eyes. But at first, I never really focused on him, even after these revelations. I had to wait until Alan Rickman's portrayal in this scene, to feel really sorry for him.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Even though, I have to admit it, Severus Snape is still subject to endless debates among the fans. His memories don't fully make amends for all his actions (Neville's bullying, for example - even if I understand completely that someone who had been bullied in the past, can become a bully a few years later; you're so exposed to others' violence, you can act the same as them because that's all you know, or your memories make you bitter).</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">So, “Always” is my tribute to the saga I've grown with, teaching me values for life.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is also my tribute to the extraordinary fandom, thank you very much to keep the community alive with your talks, your debates, your tweets, your tumblrs, your fanarts, your fanfictions, your fanvids.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">(Some fanfictions are clearly better sequels than “Cursed Child”, by the way ;D)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">And, finally, it is my tribute to a controversial character, whom I have grown to love as the years passed, because we have things in common, more than I can imagine, probably :D</p>
