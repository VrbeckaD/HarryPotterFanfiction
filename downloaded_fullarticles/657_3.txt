    <p>Harry watched as Ron made his way through a second plate, leaving a mess of crumbs in his wake, devouring everything in sight. It wasn’t until Ron reached for his goblet of pumpkin juice and took a sip that Harry decided it was time to speak up.</p>
<p>”I wanna bang the DADA Professor.”</p>
<p>The sharp inhalation along with the immediate sound of choked gasping and spluttering coughs was music to Harry’s chaotic neutral ears.</p>
<p>”Mate…<em>what</em>?”</p>
<p>”He’s hot. I want him to bend me over his desk and raw me. I don’t even care if his pet runespoor watches with all three of its heads.”</p>
<p>”Harry. <em>What the fuck?</em> I’m trying to eat.”</p>
<p>”I listened to you talk about that wet dream where you bang the Ravenclaw Granger girl while she recited <em>Hogwarts A History</em> to you, and if I can listen to you talk about <em>that</em>. Then you have to do your friend duty and listen to me talk about <em>this</em>.”</p>
<p>”I hate you Slytherins. Everything is a trade-off with you jerks.”</p>
<p>”Ron, three of your siblings are and were Slytherins.”</p>
<p>”Majority rules. The rest of us, Mum and Dad, were Gryffindors-well not to mention Percy, bless his Ravenclaw heart. Crap, and Charlie, who was a Hufflepuff. But, by default, they are all honourary Gryffindors. And even if that weren’t the case that doesn’t mean they aren’t Slytherin jerks too Harry.”</p>
<p>”Fine. Whatever. <em>I</em> still wanna bang the DADA Professor.”</p>
<p>Ron’s groan and the sound of his head hitting his plate was the only response Harry received. Which was alright, Harry could work with that.</p>
<p>”I know, right? He’s hot as hell and <em>knows what he’s talking about</em> and if that isn’t a turn on? I don’t know what is. And I know you understand what I mean Mr. Talk Nerdy To Me.”</p>
<p>”Harry, please stop bringing that up, it was one time.” Ron muffled into some bread.</p>
<p>”Thank Merlin Quirrell ate shit or whatever the summer after Fifth-year. Professor Riddle ticks all my boxes, and since beating out Malfoy as Head Boy, we’ve only gotten closer. My goal is to get him to succumb to my seduction before we cross the lake. He’s strong, though, I have a feeling he’ll give in after our N.E.W.T.s.”</p>
<p>”Isn’t Professor Riddle your Mum and Dad’s age? Weren’t they in the same year?”</p>
<p>”So?”</p>
<p>”That wasn’t an answer.”</p>
<p>”I don’t see how that matters.”</p>
<p>”Doesn’t your Dad hate his guts and complained all break when he heard Riddle was staying on as DADA Professor for our seventh year?”</p>
<p>”…Mum and Remus think he’s charming and Padfoot and Dad are just bitter.”</p>
<p>”Oh Merlin Harry, this has to be your worst one yet. What happened to Diggory? Weren’t you pinning after him for a while? He was such a nice bloke.”</p>
<p>”Well since Cedric graduated I haven’t had a lot of time to think about him, and whenever I did find myself thinking about him, he was just too…on the straight and narrow for me. I want someone <em>exciting</em> with <em>life</em> to them! Someone who can maybe whisper dirty to me in Parseltongue while making me forget how to walk.”</p>
<p>”Are you sure you aren’t a Gryffindor, Harry? This amount of reckless endangerment can’t possibly be a Slytherin trait. There’s still the year left, we can get you re-sorted.”</p>
<p>”Har. Har. Very funny.”</p>
