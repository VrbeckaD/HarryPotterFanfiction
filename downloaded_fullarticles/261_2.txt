    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p class="western">Their first meeting was less than graceful. But it was certainly memorable.</p>
<p class="western">Harry had been in this strange Eos place for all of three months, and he hadn't appreciated any of it to be honest. Well. That was a bit of a lie, but he didn't particularly want to acknowledge that fact, because it would open even further uncomfortable thoughts that he couldn't be dealing with right now. He hadn't given up hope of Hermione or Dumbledore or the Ministry tracking him down, but he decided that he couldn't live off Kimya Auburnbrie's kindness forever, though he knew she would be more than willing to let him, so the fact remained that he needed to pay his own way, and earn his own money. Which lead him to joining the Hunter's Organisation, which by all rights he was technically too young to do, but no one particularly cared about that in the current war – they needed all hands on deck to deal with fiends and daemons with the army concentrating on Niflheim.</p>
<p class="western">Harry was.... not great with swords, and he was genuinely at a loss when one was unceremoniously shoved into his hands by Kimya's younger sister Ezma. He knew which end to stick in the other guy, but he was far better with guns – point and shoot. Using his wand was kind of like training for this, only there was just the one spell, and it was finite. Which was <em>really</em> annoying and why he was in the middle of whaling on the trio of mushussu with the Durandal blade, his empty twin Quicksilvers shoved into the muddy leather holsters at his thighs.</p>
<p class="western">And if he swore copiously while he fought, well, it was his goddamn right! The hunt required him to deal with an over-populated nest of these fuckers before it reached Meldacio, so he had been fighting twenty of these spiny little ugly fucks since sunrise. It was almost sun<em>set</em> and he'd finally managed to bring their numbers down to three when some arrogant little shitweasel tried to steal his meal ticket!</p>
<p class="western">The stranger vaulted down from the main road with a yell, stupidly drawing attention to himself as he brought a sword down from overhead at one of the mushussu. Harry didn't even think, he just acted, dropping his sword and lunging at the fucking shitstain with his barehands and fingers. As angry as he was, he didn't intend on <em>killing</em> him, just making him regret ever doing anything so fucking stupid again in his life.</p>
<p class="western">The stranger squawked in alarm as Harry ducked under his arm, elbowing his wrist into throwing his blow wide even as the wizard stomped on his foot, and rammed his forehead into the bastard's face. A Glasgow Kiss as Malcolm bragged when they were kiddies and he broke Harry's glasses for the last time before he went to Hogwarts. He snapped a knee into the stranger's stomach, and then twisted and shot a foot right into the fork of his legs.</p>
<p class="western">He dropped like the sack of shit he was, wheezing with bulging blue eyes, and Harry left him to kiss the dirt as he realised the remainder of his hunt was fleeing back towards the ruins at the lake edge, and bolted after his fleeing prey, snatching his fallen sword as he went.</p>
<p class="western">“GET BACK HERE YOU BASTARDS, I HAVE RENT TO PAY!!” he howled furiously as he took a running leap off the small cliff leading down towards the ruins at the Vesperpool's edge – the spiny bastards scuttling as fast as their fucking legs could carry them for the safety of the thick undergrowth and the other fiends that lurked closer to the water that he wasn't strong enough to deal with, yet.</p>
<p class="western">He raced after them all the way to the first of the ruined buildings down the hill, skidding on wet mud and swiping wet foliage from his face before he caught up, and, with a furious yell, split one in half. The other two were harder to find, but he wasn't leaving the basin until he found them, killed them, and collected proof of their destruction. Only once he had could he collect his bounty with confidence and peace of mind.</p>
<p class="western">The two remaining fuckers tried to lead him into a nesting cockatrice's territory but he pinned one by the tail with his blade and immediately made for the other one, bludgeoning it to death with the stocks of his Quicksilvers before turning his attention to the pinned one. It didn't put up much of a fight. He made sure to collect the poisoned barbs and scaled skin from each kill, he needed proof afterall, and he could sell them for a pretty gil afterwards too.</p>
<p class="western">Wiping the gross mixture of sweat, rain water, mushussu blood, and mud from his face, he took a breath and just relaxed for a moment turning his face to the sky and letting the faint wind dry the sweat on his face. Then he turned and braced a foot against the final corpse in order to yank his durandal free, he wiped it clean and resheathed it at his hip before turning to begin the long walk up the hill to the main road.</p>
<p class="western">Hunt successful, time to head back to Meldacio to collect his bounty.</p>
<p class="western">It would be a long walk but he needed it after the extended combat, it would keep him warm and stop his muscles from aching too badly when he woke up tomorrow. Making sure his spoils were tucked up securely as he went, he found the dirt path that lead up to the road and skirted around a local gaia toad's attention, shivering a little as the air chilled with the herald of rain in the near future. Hopefully he would get into the tunnel before the heavens really opened, he might have been British and thus able to handle most forms of rain-based bad weather, but that didn't mean he liked it any. Wet feet were the absolute worst, and he hated getting his hands and face wet too. If he was swimming or showering it wasn't such a big deal, but rain water? No thanks. Dirty stuff.</p>
<p class="western">He finally reached the main road, casting a curious glance over a group of men stood beside a fancy car, chuckling at something behind it, another member of their group? No one seemed to be injured or worried so he brushed them off. They certainly didn't <em>look</em> like Hunters, or Niffs, or soldiers. Not really his business, and for once, he could easily push it aside, turn his head and keep jogging. It would be a long run and as he wasn't old enough for a motorbike yet, and while Kimya and Ezma lamented the lack of chocobos, Harry didn't even know what they were so he couldn't comment on the lack or abundance of them either way, if he wanted to get back home before nightfall he needed to keep moving.</p>
<p class="western">The tunnel back to Meldacio from the Vesperpool lake was a long and cold one, thankfully he reached it before the rain kicked off, but he could tell that it started about a third of his way through the tunnel by the taste of the wind coming up his back.</p>
<p class="western">He was about halfway there when that fancy car passed him, he ignored the commotion of voices inside as they passed, only glancing over idly to note that they were all men before they were out of sight. Given how close it was until sunset it was likely they'd settle the night in Meldacio. He wrinkled his nose and, not for the first time, gave thanks to the Auburnbrie sisters for taking him in. The caravan was filthy at the best of times, he didn't think he'd be okay with <em>sharing</em> it at the same time either.</p>
<p class="western">Night fell before he reached Meldacio. Because of course it did.</p>
<p class="western">Kimya was waiting for him as he came sprinting out of the tunnel, swearing violently as he shook himself clean of daemon miasma, and nervously checked his jeans for holes – he <em>hated</em> tonberries.</p>
<p class="western">She laughed at him, and laughed harder at the bitchy expression he shot her.</p>
<p class="western">“Nice to see you too,” he complained as he sheathed his sword and stomped past her.</p>
<p class="western">Portuttle was at the restaurant like usual and Harry made his bee-line directly to him, waving idly to David, Ezma's son who was helping Norman with an armload of horns.</p>
<p class="western">“Potter, glad to see you made it back in one piece,” the tipster greeted with a smile of relief.</p>
<p class="western">Harry slapped down his papers and tugged off the pouch of his proof-carves, “Hunt successful!” he declared as he slammed it down, a hair shy of demanding his money then and there. He had better manners than that, and Portuttle was a pretty cool guy, he and his family had been running the restaurant here in Meldacio for generations, they'd seen almost every hunter that ever was come and go, had been there to see their names added to the list of the lost, and trained themselves to be the best support they could possibly be. But with it they also had to develop a certain level of distance, or apathy, to the fates of those whom they supported – otherwise they'd just end up falling to pieces whenever someone died on a hunt they sent them off on.</p>
<p class="western">The tipster gave a glance to his papers before checking over his proof. Twenty different individual pieces that he checked with an expert eye – the number of hunters who half-assed a job and brought multiple carves from the same animal and tried to claim they had hunted multiple was astronomical. Every tipster had the eye of a jeweller, just to make sure they weren't being swindled, and they had gotten <em>very</em> good at telling age, sex, and health of a fiend with just a glance at the carve presented to them.</p>
<p class="western">“Well done. That was a tough hunt, I'm surprised you made it back, Potter. Twenty three thousand gil, and a Mega Phoenix, as promised. With this, I think we can bump your rank up again,” he decided with a grin as he set the promised rewards onto the table next to his pouch, and held a hand out for Harry's licence.</p>
<p class="western">The Gryffindor passed it over with one hand and snatched everything up with the other, checking the debit card had the requisite amount listed on the back – hunter payment cards were issued much like gift cards were back on Earth, listing the amount within the card on the back of the card. The funds could be transferred into a legitimate bank account, but it made the card useless as they couldn't be filled again by normal means. When someone wanted a hunt done, they went to a tipster with as much information as possible and the tipster would declare the rank of the hunt and the minimum cost. The cost could be off-set by including items in trade, which was quite common as it could drop the price of a hunt by a good ten thousand gil in some cases. The tipster would then use a blank card and have the money transferred onto it by the bill poster, and hold both money and items in trust until the hunt was taken, completed, and the payment transferred. At which point they would inform the poster of the success.</p>
<p class="western">It was a good system, but it relied on trusting the tipsters <em>heavily</em>. Something that Harry had some doubts about, but thus far, Lucis seemed to have a very different, much more.... <em>honourable?</em> culture than he was used to. People were very environmentally conscientious here, and polite. Aside from the kill-stealing bullshit, but times were desperate and so were people. Hence why Harry <em>didn't</em> kill the guy he took down earlier, he'd just warn the other hunters about the kill-stealer in the area.</p>
<p class="western">Portuttle handed him his licence back, showing the increase in rank, dug into his pocket and shoved a bracelet at him, “Congratulations.” Grinning at him as Harry quickly stowed it away after a curious look. He didn't know what kind of bracelet it was, but he could tell it had a fairly solid enchantment on it, he'd take it to the Cutlass van tomorrow to see what it did if he couldn't figure it out himself.</p>
<p class="western">“Thanks Tim. I'll swing by tonight to help with the washing up, kay?” he asked, relaxing now that he had cash in hand. The tipster didn't take it personally, he just laughed and ruffled his hair.</p>
<p class="western">“Sure thing, kid. Now off you go,” he bid nodding to where the two sisters were fixing to get into another argument again. Harry groaned when he saw it and quickly snatched up his papers for the hunt (because he liked keeping track of them, and it seemed like a good idea to keep a record), and rushed over to pay the two his rent – and break up their argument.</p>
<p class="western">The fancy city folk didn't register on his radar as he let Kimya hug and fuss over him, grimacing as Ezma snorted and pinched his cheek hard, calling him adorable.</p>
<p class="western">But they certainly recognised him, or rather one of them did.</p>
<p class="western">“You!” the shortest of the group snarled as Harry slinked away from the Auburnbrie sisters, rubbing his sore cheek, as he went in the direction he last saw David going in.</p>
<p class="western">The Gryffindor paused, blinking at the stranger. He was about his age, wearing a military uniform of all things, and bristling like a Coeurl fixing to pick a fight, his boots were shiny and black, his uniform was clean and pressed, his hands and fingernails were also clean, and there wasn't a single button or seam out of place. Even his sword-sheath gleamed, shiny, clean, and flawless. Stood in blood and sweat stiffened leathers, with mud up to his thighs, dirt under his nails, across his cheeks, twigs in his hair, and his pistols dented and caked with blood after he used them to club the last of his prey to death, he felt incredibly dirty and small in front of the other teenager who was already close to hitting six foot while Harry had only just reached 5'3”.</p>
<p class="western">He hated him immediately.</p>
<p class="western">“Can I help you?” he asked with forced politeness despite the fact the guy was glaring at him with a face like a slapped arse.</p>
<p class="western">Outrage immediately twisted the other boy's face, his mouth dropping open soundlessly, as if he couldn't believe Harry had the balls to ask such a question. That.... okay, no. Malfoy would <em>always</em> fucking come up to him with that goddamn look on his face, and right now, Harry was entirely too tired and fed up to deal with <em>another</em> up-himself fancy pisspot.</p>
<p class="western">He scoffed and brushed past him, “Whatever. If you're too stupid to figure out what you're fucking saying that isn't my problem,” he dismissed. He had more important things to do, like have a hot bath before he was on shift at the kitchen later.</p>
<p class="western">Suddenly he was being flung to the ground with an angry bellow.</p>
<p class="western">Oh, OH! WELL THEN!</p>
<p class="western">He snarled furiously, and rammed an elbow back into the asshole's stomach, feeling him wheeze and elbowed him <em>again</em> even as he kicked his feet out and rolled out from under him. He didn't even try to regain his feet and lunged for him on all fours – he'd lost his weapons more times than he cared to count when he first started hunting here over a month ago, he knew how to take down things tougher and more armoured than some punk with an <em>attitude problem. And he'd done it with his bare hands then as well!</em></p>
<p class="western">It was not a fight for the ages. It wasn't a battle. It was barely a brawl.</p>
<p class="western">When he looked back on it later he would be embarrassed, but for now, all he cared about was grinding that too clean face into the goddamn mud and hitting everything he could get his hands on as they rolled across the floor and out into the rain. The two of them were little more than a whirling sprawl of kicking, punching, and swearing – Harry was aware of biting and clawing at the asshole more than once but the fucker kept punching him in the kidney again and <em>again</em> and <em>again</em>, so Harry felt it fair play to get a good damn grip on his hair and smash his head into the ground for it. The least he could have was a broken nose if Harry was going to end up pissing blood for the next week!</p>
<p class="western">“HARRY!”</p>
<p class="western">Hands were suddenly yanking him backwards and away. David. He immediately went limp and didn't try to fight him. The guy was like twice his height and three times his weight in muscle alone, Ezma had been training him to be a hunter since he could walk.</p>
<p class="western">“THAT'S ENOUGH!!” the seventeen year old roared, stomping his foot down beside the stranger's head hard enough to stop his furious scramble to his feet in its tracks. “The hell do y'all think yer doin'?” the larger boy demanded glaring down at the boy on the floor, “We don't take kindly to unprovoked attacks 'round these parts, stranger.”</p>
<p class="western">“Unprovoked! He attacked me first!” the teenager roared, scrambling to his feet.</p>
<p class="western">“Fuck you! You attacked <em>me</em> first!” Harry shouted back, lunging against David's grip, and nearly getting choked when the older teen yanked him back and shook him like an errant pup.</p>
<p class="western">“Harry, git yer ass home!”</p>
<p class="western">“Hell no! This psycho attacked me from behind! I'm not leaving you alone with him!” the Gryffindor snapped and then lifted his arms, sliding neatly out of his leather vest where Dave had him scruffed.</p>
<p class="western">The stranger spluttered furiously, “I tried to <em>help you earlier!</em> And you attacked me before running off!” he snarled furiously.</p>
<p class="western">Dave looked at him while Harry froze in abject bewilderment. He had never seen this pillock before in his –</p>
<p class="western">“YOU'RE THAT KILL STEALING PISSPOT!!” he shouted, pointing at his face. Those blue eyes were quite recognisable.</p>
<p class="western">“KILL STEA- YOU WERE FLAILING LIKE YOU WERE HAVING A SEIZURE! IF I HADN'T COME ALONG YOU'D HAVE DIED!” the stranger howled furiously.</p>
<p class="western">Harry was about to laugh directly in his face before Dave's hand slid neatly between them, covering his mouth and pulling him backwards, pinning him firmly against his chest, “Am I t'understand this,” the seventeen year old demanded slowly, “That y'all interfered with an active Hunt in progress?” he asked, glaring at the no longer so fancy stranger who paused, and then stepped back and straightened up. He still looked like he would have loved nothing more than to wrap his hands around Harry's neck and squeeze, but the feeling was hidden as best he could (and it was entirely mutual as well, Harry decided as he glared at him over Dave's hand) as he seemed to realise the gravity of what had occurred earlier and why it was a more sensitive issue than he had previously anticipated.</p>
<p class="western">“Ahem, might I interject?” a second voice interrupted, a smooth deep baritone belonging to someone much older than everyone present. The three teenagers turned to spot one of the fancy city men in front of them, dressed neatly in a shirt, waistcoat, and slacks, wearing a monocle and neat black cornrows. He smiled kindly at the three of them, “Allow me to introduce myself, I am Weskham Armaugh. This young man is one of my companions, Cor Leonis. Might I know your names?”</p>
<p class="western">“No,” Harry snapped through Dave's hand, and was ignored.</p>
<p class="western">“David Auburnbrie, Mister Armaugh, an' this here is Harry Potter, m'Aunt's charge,” Dave introduced flatly, eyeing the two of them distrustfully, keeping one hand pressed over Harry's mouth, and the other on his upper arm.</p>
<p class="western">“A pleasure, you seem like fine young men,” Mister Armaugh said, and he even seemed <em>honest</em> about it, and while Dave seemed to take him at face value, Harry gave him the look he felt that comment deserved. Honestly, how stupid did he think they were? These poor uneducated <em>dirty </em>country bumpkins? What an asshole. The man's mouth twitched in amusement when he got a look at Harry's face, “I must apologise for my companion's actions earlier,” he explained, lifting a hand as Leonis opened his mouth to protest, looking outraged, almost immediately the teenager bit back whatever he was going to say and scowled down at his boots. “He mistakenly believed Mister Potter to be a civilian in need of assistance. Unfortunately we are largely unfamiliar with the fine work of the Hunters being from Insomnia as we are. No insult was meant, I assure you,” he promised.</p>
<p class="western">Harry bit the inside of Dave's hand, pinching the tender skin between his fingers and making him yelp and yank his hand away, “That doesn't explain why he attacked me just now!” he snapped, “Do people from Insomnia regularly tackle people from behind when they're walking away?”</p>
<p class="western">“Cor just doesn't know how to talk to pretty boys, don't hold it against him!” a third voice declared, snickering.</p>
<p class="western">“Your Highness! I do not!” Leonis protested hotly, scowling even as his face turned dark red.</p>
<p class="western">Harry bristled, “'<em>Pretty</em>'?!” he echoed sharply.</p>
<p class="western">“Er, handsome?” the new stranger in an even fancier black pinstripe suit suggested awkwardly, scratching at three days of beard growth on his cheek, looking a little at a loss. Gods, his magic felt weird. Harry grimaced and looked him up and down, aside from himself and Kimya, this was the only other person in Lucis he had encountered with magic so far. He wasn't impressed. Not only was the guy's magic weird and kinda warped, his facial hair was ugly too.</p>
<p class="western">“What are you supposed to be, a shitty mafia cosplayer?” he demanded flatly instead of any comments on his weird-ass magic.</p>
<p class="western">The man's mouth dropped open in shock, the two men behind him burst out laughing, Mister Armaugh coughed into a gloved hand to hide his own amusement, and Leonis immediately dropped into a stance and reached for his sword hilt – Harry bristled and would have done the same only Dave chose that moment to suddenly hoist him up over his shoulder.</p>
<p class="western">“OI!”</p>
<p class="western">“Apologies, Yer Royal Highness,” Dave said with a bow, looking worried, “Harry i'n't from Lucis – <em>or Niflheim!</em>” he added quickly spotting the alarm that crossed their faces, “He's – I'll take 'im home now. I'm sorry.”</p>
<p class="western">Harry huffed as Dave took him to Kimya's cottage.</p>
<p class="western">He froze, stiffening as he spotted Leonis smirking smugly in amusement as he was carted off like a sack of potatoes. This Kingdom for his fucking <em>wand</em>! One – solid – hex! A tickling charm! Anything! Even an Aguamenti on top of his ugly head. For lack of any suitable weapons he gripped the back of Dave's leathers, slid backwards, and swung his foot forward under the seventeen year old's arm as hard as he could.</p>
<p class="western">It was beautiful. His filthy muddy soaking wet boot nailed the asshole full in the face.</p>
<p class="western">He shot the shit-whistle the middle finger, grinning maliciously as the door closed in front of him, and his boot hit the floor.</p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<hr/>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">Kimya laughed herself sick when she heard everything, Ezma wanted to tan his backside for being so disrespectful to a member of the Prince's Retinue – at least until Dave stuck up for him and told her what happened, specifically that Leonis attacked Harry from behind as he was walking away. Harry had been particularly unapologetic about it all, viciously informing her that the guy wasn't <em>his</em> Prince, so why should he treat someone who had the good fortune to be born into that particular family any differently than he would anyone else?</p>
<p class="western">“The Lucis Caelums' have magic blessed onto them by Bahamut himself, their right to rule is divine,” Ezma explained, rubbing her eyes in aggravation.</p>
<p class="western">“His magic is fucking weird, is what it is,” Harry scoffed unhappily, “I like Kimya's magic more.” Hers felt like summer sunshine, yellow flowers, and healing rain. She wasn't strong, but she had the power to <em>boost</em> other magic users, she was a support to them. The Prince's magic felt..... weird. Wrong. Like half of it wasn't his, or.... half of it was <em>missing</em>.</p>
<p class="western">“Aww, that's kind of you to say,” the elder of the sisters chuckled, stroking his hair, grinning as he wavered between leaning into it and batting her hands away.</p>
<p class="western">Ezma groaned, rubbing her face, “It isn't a matter of whose magic you prefer, boy!! They are blessed by the Gods themselves, you should show them respect!”</p>
<p class="western">Harry folded his arms and arched an eyebrow at her, “And how do you know my magic wasn't?” he asked lightly, “Or your sister's? Does the fact that we have magic make us royalty too?”</p>
<p class="western">Ezma slammed a fist onto the table, “Ya know tha' isn't wha' I meant!” she roared red faced and furious. She snatched her hand up, clenching her fist and screwing her face up as she visibly forced herself back under control, and relaxed, her breath wooshing out in one gust and pointed him in the face, “Tomorrow, they're going up t'the Myrlwood. T'the Royal Tomb. You'll be their guide, boy, and y'all can apologise while yer at it!” she added, raising her voice when Harry opened his mouth to argue.</p>
<p class="western">“I'm not even local!” the Gryffindor protested.</p>
<p class="western">“But y'all are the only one that's been prowlin' that there basin recently,” Ezma snapped, “Meanin' yer the only tour guide we got. And y'all <em>will</em> escort them boys t'the best o'yer ability, <em>right?</em>” she demanded dangerously, her dusty brown eyes narrowing on him.</p>
<p class="western">He growled, “Fine. But I'm not apologising.”</p>
