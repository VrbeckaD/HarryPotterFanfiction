          <div class="userstuff"><p>"Good morning, Draco!" Harry grinned, shaking his boyfriend into wakefulness.</p><p>"It is not morning yet." Draco responded, ducking under the cover.</p><p>"Actually, it's eleven o'clock and if you don't get up you're going to miss quidditch practice. You have twenty minutes." Harry said, laughing when Draco shot up.</p><p>"You're joking." He said, noticing the closed bed curtains on everyone else's beds.</p><p>"I can't believe you fell for it again!" Harry practically cackled. Draco glared and climbed back under the covers.</p><p>"I hate you." Draco said, muffled only slightly by the cover.</p><p>"I love you too." Harry grinned.</p><p>"Since I'm up now, I think we could put this time to good use." Draco said suggestively, coming out from under the cover.</p><p>"Great idea." Harry grinned.</p></div>
