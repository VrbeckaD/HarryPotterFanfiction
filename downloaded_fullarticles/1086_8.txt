    <p>Light, all over, trying to seep through my closed eyes. That I can deal with fairly easily when I wake, my room is always like that in the morning. I’ve gotten used to it as I’ve grown up. But when I also come back into consciousness without any feeling at all for I have no idea whatsoever reason. Telling my head it’s morning, I try to open my eyes, but I can’t. I can’t move either, and I have no idea why. That’s when I get a little (maybe a lot) worried My eyes continue to stay closed to several minutes. But all that’s in my mind is waking up. I want to tell myself I’m dreaming, but this feels way more realistic than that.</p><p>     “Stop pulling me, I can walk, you know! I’m happy too, in my own way that isn’t skipping this way and that like a five year old.” A young woman says from nearby. Not sounding very happy at all, like she had the time of her life running ten miles. “You’ve been visiting him almost everyday since we’ve been back here, almost a week and a half. You were just here thirty minutes ago. Why do we need to be back here now?” Her voice gives me impression that you don’t want to know what she’ll do next if you make her bad side. The tackle life by being intimidating impression.</p><p>       “We swear we’re telling the truth, May! He really did jerk his leg, his good leg, the leg that wasn’t hit by that curse, I mean. But he really did move!” A boy says. I hear the sound of feet running toward me. “Ask Pomfrey, she’ll tell you. We have to hurry, we can’t miss him waking up!”</p><p>      “I didn’t say that I don’t believe you. I’m just bringing the fact that he’s been comatose for two weeks, all three of us know that, mostly our still sore muscles that had to carry him, screaming our lungs out for help.” The woman says again. “The curse that hit him was very strong.”</p><p>        “Well, we will admit you did sound doubtful before.” Another girl, a slightly younger one, says.</p><p>        “Great...” The older girl, who I now think might be May says. “As much as we wanted him awake and strong. We were hoping he’d stay out until after his appointment at St. Mungo’s.”</p><p>       “Come on! There’s already so much we have to catch him up on!” The young girl yells enthusiastically.</p><p>       “Wow, you’re active for a seventeen year old.” May says under her breath, me barely catching it.</p><p>        “We still don’t know that, if he’s out of unconsciousness.” The boy says matter-of-factly. Footsteps run in my direction.</p><p>         “Hello, Mrs. Goldenwood, I haven’t seen you since you graduated, nearly four years ago.” Says an older woman, further away, obviously overhearing the conversation like I am. “Well, if you’d like to know, you can be sure our Mr. Baggins over here has learned a lot from the example you put out for him while you were a student.”</p><p>      “She’s right, May. You should’ve seen him put in that Prefect badge for the first time! He was so dashingly handsome, so responsible.” The young girl says in an exaggerating way.</p><p>      “Remember he was also very shocked Riley. Remember what he said at my house? He said he didn’t deserve the privilege of wearing a second badge on his uniform.”</p><p>      “Not everyone wants to hear what you have to say, Jake. I could honestly care less if you think Bilbo was shocked to become a Slytherin Prefect. I remember him being quite proud of himself when he attached the badge on his robes for the first time. He also said he was excited to get to know the new first years, he said he wanted to tell them of his experience, and help them with subjects. Melanie Brake, even said he was the most helpful.”</p><p>      “Maybe it’s because you have a crush on him. You’ve been denying it since our fourth year. Admit it now Riley. Or forever hold your peace.” The girl mumbles something, which I can’t hear this time</p><p>       “That’s how you our best friend apart from someone under the effects of Polyjuice Potion.” May says, laughing. “But on to serious manners. Did he really jerk his good leg? And is he going to be okay? What’s in store for him? He’s only seventeen. He deserves to live a healthy, long and happy life.”</p><p>        “His leg did move, May. But we don’t what’s next for him, I’m afraid, I have just sent a message through the Floo Network to your aunt, trying to see if we can move his appointment up to maybe tomorrow, but the earliest is next week. The hospital has had their hands full for weeks. But neither of us aren’t very hopeful on his leg. He’ll need further cheeking though, but amputation is a possibility.”</p><p>      “Do you have numbers? Make this all a bit more realistic.” The young girl, Riley asks.</p><p>      “There’s a forty percent chance he’ll have his right leg for more than a month, assuming there aren’t any more complications, the infection has already gone pretty much untreated until you came here. If he has those odds though, Kate believes there’s only half chance he’ll have that leg for the remainder of his life. He probably won’t want it.”</p><p>      “Why so sad?” Riley asks, sounding like she’s almost crying. “Why can’t the first statistic be a more hopeful?”</p><p>      “How long we and him were stuck with only leaves as his bandages, and bread as food, sticks as splints for him, our arms as a very uncomfortable hospital bed. His Quidditch uniform guards the only protection from pain anywhere else when and if we drop him. In the situation he’s in, I believe we can hope in forty percent.”</p><p>      What’s Quidditch? Are they referring to me? Is it just me, or does the body that likely is controlling me really have the same name as me. I’m hoping it’s just a coincidence, because I don’t know what to think if it isn’t. If this is real, which I don’t think it is. I don’t this happening to me. What does “amputation” even mean? Probably not very good.</p><p>      My eyes open, the lights almost blinding me, I look right to see the three of them. A boy with pale skin, the same medium brown eyes I have, and short blonde hair. The girls. The one who I take as May stands in the middle, she has a darker tone of skin, green eyes, and wavy dark hair that goes to her shoulders. Riley, the younger girl, looks like she could be May’s sister, the same skin, but Riley’s hair is much lighter, a light brown-orange. All three are Big Folk. I have never seen any of them in my life.</p><p>      “Hello, Riley, Jake, May. Where am I?” I ask, giving them eye contact, Riley sighs, looking like she’s trying to not to jump at me. “The last thing I remember is us in the forest, and me being hit by one of those officers from that Ministry.”</p><p>       “Yes, they were following us for nearly two days after you broke me out of Azkaban, as far as I remember.” Says May, I think.</p><p>        “What did they want from us anyway?” I ask.</p><p>         “Most likely me back in that room. And maybe you three for trial” May confers. “But, Bilbo, what you were doing back there was brave. But not without mentioning very stupid, dumb, scary. We thought we lost you. Never, ever sacrifice yourself like that again!”</p><p>      “All I wanted to do was protect you!” I yell. “I have no clue to what I’d do if you’re in my spot. We ran away to do one thing, and I believe I did my part quite well. I believe we are back at Hogwarts I assume.”</p><p>       “You ran away to do one thing. We followed to help you not die..” Riley says.</p><p>       What’s Hogwarts? A hole that I’ve never heard of? Doesn’t sound like it.</p><p>       “Yes we are. But doing your part almost got you killed! Think before you act! It’s not that hard.” May yells. “You should’ve thought twice about even thinking about flying out of grounds during a Quidditch game even though you know you’re a Chaser!”</p><p>     “Oh come on, May. It’s not like anyone noticed. And who told you how I snuck out? How do you know it was all my idea to save you from Azkaban?” I ask moodily, my eyes rolling.</p><p>     “I think they noticed you turning left as the Quaffle was going toward your teams hoops. I think the entire arena noticed. They also said it in the prison, if you forgot.” May says bluntly. I pause for a moment, trying to put sense into what “my friend” said.</p><p>      “Well, at least you’re out of there, and we’re all here together.”</p><p>      Obviously having enough of May’s stubborn snapping, I look left, at the older woman, who’s just like the other three. She has the same curly hair I do, but a little shorter, and whiter, she wears a green hat. She’s storing a bunch a of bottles into a cabinet.</p><p>      “Hello, Madame. How long was I out for. How long have I been under your supervision?” I ask, she pauses in her task and looks at me.</p><p>       “You’ve been unconscious for two weeks, you’ve been back here for ten days. Your friends were only in the wing for two days. But since you wanted the most painful end of things. You won’t be out of here until you go to St. Mongo’s. Your face is fairly disfigured, you don’t have too much of a chin, but when you look in the mirror, you’ll see I’ve been doing some work to improve it here and there, and the leg that was hit by that curse is pretty much ruined, muscle is gone.” The woman, who is most likely that Madame P-something says.</p><p>      “I get why you said ‘painful end of things’ but St. Mongo’s? Is what happened to me really that bad? Why do I need to go there?” I ask, my voice scared, I start whimpering, a tear drops from my left eye.</p><p>      “I’m answering the second question first, and the answe is: yes, it is that bad and I believe you most likely overheard why you need better medical attention, Bilbo. You may need ampution, and you need your face fully fixed.” May says stubbornly, I flinch when she says my name. I look at her, and the first thing she does is slap my right leg, and she hits it hard. Even though I feel nothing at all, in less than a second I’m wailing my head off. I’m glad I’m I have no feeling in my body “Well it’s on you, you jumped in front of us so we wouldn’t get more hurt than we already were.” Not helping. Making me feel worse. Tears flood my vision, as May takes a tiny circle out of her pocket and tried opening it, but her endever is stopped by Jake.</p><p>      “He’s already in a bad mood because you slapped him, if I were you, I wouldn’t direct that mirror to him.” Jake says, trying to keep his grip on May’s arm. I wipe the tears away with my blanket</p><p>       “He brought this entire thing upon himself, Jake. He needs it.” May yells, yanking her arm away, and opens the mirror and directs it at me. What I’m met with is a boy with curly hair just shades lighter than the colour of chocolate, light brown skin, but he has dark green eyes. He has cuts, his fairly disfigured face, left cheek almost non-existent, barely any chin, no eyebrows. The torn up skin is held together by black knots all over, is swollen, and he looks like he has just been crying. Cause he has. This is just a coincidence, he looks exactly like a young version of me, mostly. I tell myself I’m just dreaming again, but I’m not so convinced this time. This boy has the same name as me, and looks a lot like me. Will this get any weirder? This is turning into a nightmare quicker than I want to. I just want to wake up at this point, but I can’t.</p><p>        I’m speechless for minutes. My eyes fixated on my face, so is my mind. He’s controlling me.</p><p>       “Come on, you three. Let Bilbo here get his rest. He needs as much of it as he can get. He has a lot of pain ahead of him.” The healer says after about five minutes.</p><p>       “I’m so excited.” I say with a strong tone of sarcasm.</p><p>       “Be quite!” May snaps quietly.</p><p>        “Oh, Slughorn told us to tell you to expect him to come bring him flowers and a card later, after he’s finished organizing his potion ingredients.” Riley says, I hear footsteps as they fade away, and my eyes close to try falling back asleep. Which I don’t do for several minutes.</p><p>         I hope I’m finished with this weird dream, but I’m not. Something weird starts happening. Everything starts going backwards. Beginning with that conversation. Then it’s blackout again, for what seems like forever. Then, I’m surrounded by trees, tons of them, and I’m laying down, surrounded by several guys wearing blue from head to toe. But I’m only like that for a second. I bounce back up, the guys bounce back, then we’re all attacking each other, holding long wooden sticks, we do different motions with them, and lights with several different colours come out of them. This only lasts for twenty seconds, then me (not really), May, Jake and Riley are sitting down, catching our breath. Then May and I stand up and walk into more trees, and everything continues. We are just about to walk back when everything goes back to normal.</p><p>       “May. What is it?” My voice asks moodily. “How come you’re not grateful for everything I’ve done?”</p><p>       “It’s you, Bilbo!” May says angrily, stomping her feet in frustration. “What you did. What you have become.”</p><p>       “What did I do? You were the one put on trial for no reason!” I yell, I try turning around but May grabs my arm, and pulls me back. I yelp, landing on sticks.</p><p>        “You know what I’m talking about. What made you so stern? Where did that nervous get-it-done-and-over-with kid in braces go?”</p><p>        “He grew up, May, just like dorky Riley, and wannabe hero Jake. He wanted to prove himself as powerful, strong.”</p><p>       I look at May, she doesn’t look convinced, she shakes her head and continues. She grabs me by my arm and drags me. “Tell me the truth! You know you’re lying.”</p><p>      “Ow! Let go of me!” My legs kick, and my arm that isn’t held by May is trying to loosen her grip on me. I start crying, obviously in pain.</p><p>      “You were scared of everything, Bilbo, when you first came to Hogwarts. You were just petrified. Every minute that wasn’t in class, you would cry until you’d fall asleep, even in the bathroom. You used to flinch at the sight of your books. You sometimes couldn’t stand to see yourself in the mirror, like you were ashamed of yourself. You wouldn’t raise you hand for weeks, you wouldn’t talk to anyone who wanted nothing but to help you adjust. Why can’t I see him one more time, just tell him I’d be there for him?” May says, I don’t stop crying miserably. “Stop crying! Just tell me the truth!”</p><p>       I don’t speak. May gives up and drops my arm. May takes out a tiny leather book out of her coat pocket and gives it to me. Pause in my sobbing. And I look inside it, it’s a bunch of pictures of a young boy and his friends. The first one is of a boy who I recognize as an even younger version of the one who controls me, sitting on a three-legged stool, wearing a huge pointed brown hat, the hat looks like it has a confused expression, I have a nervous look on my face. I’m wearing black and grey all over, a bunch of older people are behind me, sitting behind a table. I look below the first, another one of him standing with May, who looks considereably younger, we are both wearing the same black clothes, but now they have different colour stripes, he has silver and green, and May has yellow and black, they are both wearing badges on our lefts, he has a green snake, May’s is a black badger. He looks like he’s been crying, which he seems to do a lot apparently. May has her arm on his shoulder, like she’s trying to comfort him. I keep reading. As the book goes on he slowly gets older. After twenty pages, he’s shown in the middle, being linked by Riley and Jake, he’s smiling, revealing his teeth, which are covered in tiny grey circles and a straight line the same colour.</p><p>       “Why do want me to see these? I remember everything, the Sorting, you, coming back for my second year wearing those braces. Why is this important?” I ask, trying to give the book back to her, she doesn’t let me. I put it in my pocket. I try walking away again, and she lets me for a while longer.</p><p>       “Just tell me, Bilbo, why did you sneak out of Hogwarts to try and find me? You broke about twenty rules doing that. You’re risking your own cage in that terrible place.” May says. “You’d never think about doing that before I graduated. That’s why Slughorn turned you into a prefect. Look at you now, when you broke school rules, we have enough on our trail.”</p><p>       “We lost them a long time ago, they’re likely lost. It’s hard to not get lost in a place like this.” I say, looking at her, my moody tone not going away.</p><p>        “You know what, let’s just go back to the others, you’re not being cooperative with me at all.” May says, sighing defeatedly.</p><p>       Everything goes backwards again, for longer this time. We are walking backwards in the forest, a huge building comes into sight. We are slowly getting closer, and closer to it. I don’t want it to go forward again this time. And it doesn’t. But only after the clearing and running inside through a maze of ugly doors, with tiny windows, running up several stair cases, trying to be stopped by people in black the entire time. We reach another floor, and instead of continuing up the stairs, we run unstopping. The first open cell comes into view and May runs into it, the door closes as it’s lit on fire, then it extinguishers itself and I think we have another entire conversation. Great. This is likely going to go forward again.</p><p>       And it does.</p><p>       Now it’s “me”, Riley and Jake running along a corridor of small cells. I look behind, Riley and Jake look like they’ve been running a long time, the tired look on the faces, I’m ahead of them, so I must be the same way, both have cuts I’ve never noticed until now.</p><p>       “Keep running. We never know when those guards can find our trail again.” I whisper as loudly as I dare. A loud gasp comes from several feet in front of us, giving us extra motivation to keep going.</p><p>       “Oh no. Them.” May’s voice is the quietest I’ve ever heard it. We keep running, and stop to see May’s face between the bared window. She looks at us as if she’s seen us before, but trying to put names on our faces. Her face in particular doesn’t look like it’s been cleaned in a while, all the dirt and grime.</p><p>       “Hello, May.” I say as if to give May a clue to us. “You look, relatively worn down.”</p><p>        “Not the least of my problems, what’s your name... Bilbo. What I’m trying to wonder is, what the heck are you doing here? You brought Riley and Jake with you too? Are you serious? Do yes have any idea how dangerous it is around here?” </p><p>        “Yes.” Riley and Jake say in unison.</p><p>       “Who’s insanely reckless idea was this?” May asks as if she’s trying to interrogate us.</p><p>       “His.” They say again, pointing at me. I elbow both of them in the ribs. </p><p>        “Let’s just find a way to open this thing up and get out of here. Not like Alohamora works here, so we have to use our imagination, like, Incendio, Bombarda or some other spell that makes fire, or breaks stuff, that’s fine too.” I whisper to Jake and Riley, equally looking at them. They nod understandingly, we grab our sticks and aim at the door. “On my count to three. One. Two... May, I’d take cover if I were you. Three!” We start yelling and red lights hit the door, creating small explosions. It takes a few minutes, but there is finally a dent big and deep enough to kick into a hole, for May to crawl through.</p><p>       “There they are!” Someone yells just after May crawls out. We look behind, four people are running towards us, yards behind, but getting closer. I think those guards I was just talking about found us.</p><p>       “Run and don’t you dare stop for anything!” I yell, already six feet ahead of the others. They quickly follow.</p><p>       Everything goes backwards again. It doesn’t stop for long time this time. I don’t  really care. I’ve had enough of this weird dream. I’ve had enough of it for a long time.</p><p>       But after what seems like forever, it goes forward again. It stops with me sitting in small room by myself. I’m looking out the window. Inside of a huge brown building, which makesBag End, my home, look like the size of a teacup. People are walking this way and that. I look the other way, at a silver trunk with the initials B.B. on it, beside it, is a cage with a tiny black cat. The tiny thing looks traumatized, scared.</p><p>      “Oh, Midnight, you don’t like being in that confined thing, don’t you?” I ask, tacking the latch off the door, I take the cat out, handling it on my lap. “Believe me, I’m still not used to the entire ‘you’re a wizard’ thing either. But it’s all perplexing in way I can’t describe, if you get what I mean.” The cat looks at me as if I’m crazy. “You don’t really understand. You weren’t the one who woke up in a forest. I was.”</p><p>        “Hello.” Says a considerably younger Jake from outside. “You look like one of those kids who’d rather be alone, no offence, I’m the same way, but it does get lonely after a while. I’ll admit that.” He chuckles. I stand and close the door, holding Midnight, I’m only two inches taller than him.</p><p>       “Come on in. Please don’t mind her, she’s only a kitten, I did as much as I could, but she isn’t exactly house trained. But she just went before we left for the station, so nothing much to worry about.” I open the door, and he walks inside, setting his things on the other seat on the opposite side of where my stuff is.</p><p>         “First year? Jake asks. I nod. “I guess that puts us in the same boat then.” He looks out the window and sighs.</p><p>         “I was just thinking to myself how weird all this magic is.” I say. “Even though I’ve studied enough to not be clueless about everything for at least a couple weeks in each subject. I’m still pretty nervous.”</p><p>          “About what?” Jake asks.</p><p>          I pause, as if trying to think. “Everything. What if the teachers don’t like my efforts? What if I don’t make friends?” </p><p>          “I’ve been worrying about that as well. But hey! You look like someone who has a lot in common with me. Mind if I stay? We can be friends. Take a little bit of the worry off us. We can share bad jokes with each other.” Jake says, the last part makes me laugh. “See, you get me.” He joins.</p><p>          “How can you? I still don’t know your name, and you still don’t know mine.” I tell Jake, who is still laughing.</p><p>         “My name is Jake.” Jake says, no longer laughing.</p><p>         “Don’t laugh, but mine is Bilbo.” I say. Jake looks unamused. Why would I think my own name is funny, my friends don’t laugh when they talk about me, unless it’s something funny, “Everyone will know when we’re at school. Name tags were required on the uniform list, I probably shouldn’t be this embarrassed to introduce myself. But I think I know you from somewhere, you look familiar.”</p><p>        “You look familiar as well.” Jake says, than gasps as if he is realizing something that he should have remember. “You’re that-”</p><p>        He is cut off. “Yes, I am the kid who freaked out.” </p><p>        “Anyway, what’s your cat’s name?” Jake asks.</p><p>       “Midnight.” I tell him, I give her to Jake, he rubs her head.</p><p>        “She’s very pretty.” Says Jake. “I also love that collar, it looks adorable on her.”</p><p>       “Thanks. I picked it out myself.” I giggle.</p><p>       The conversation continues between Jake and I for a long bit of time. No May, no Riley. Nobody joins us. But we seem to be okay with that.</p><p>       But when I expect it to go backwards again. It doesn’t. It goes forward, I watch as countryside speeds past us as it slowly gets darker. A huge building comes into view. But then it rewinds again, as if something wanted me to see the place then changed it’s mind. It goes backwards faster and faster. If I had control over myself, I would’ve thrown up or passed out of motion sickness a long time ago. But then, it stops, and I’m in darkness.</p><p>      Then I wake up. Not in the bed I remember falling asleep in, but in a forest.</p><p>     “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“What did you see? Is he the kid in the prophecy?” A voice asks, powerful and maybe even intimidating to some.</p><p>      “I saw a lot of things that would make him relatively very uncomfortable, Zeus.” Another voice with the same aura tells the first. “But yes. He is the one centred in the prophecy.” He looks at the small body on a table twice a long. The body looks like an average man in the mid twenties in features. But in hight, he can easily be mistaken for a kindergartener in modern times. According to what the grey wizard told him, he has a very high sense of self sense. Calling him a five-year-old and asking him if he’s lost his mommy, might not be the best move. The council will have to highten him, painful as it is, as well as de-age, which is also very uncomfortable.</p><p>        “How long ago was the fall of You-Know-Who?” Says a third voice. “How long has he been on the loose?”</p><p>        “It’s been two months, Gandalf.” A fourth voice. “He has been on the run for a couple weeks now.”</p><p>        “I see.” The third voice says again, he fingers his chin in thought. “But how can a prophecy like this center around somebody like Bilbo? He’s never really had much experience outside of his country’s borders, and worldwalking? Getting that letter? He’d never accept it!”</p><p>    “We have no choice. We’re just as skeptical about him as you are, but we have to do it.” The second voice says. “He’ll get used to it eventually.”</p><p>        “Let’s just turn him, dump him somewhere and get back to our own business. Better give him time to adjust to the new stuff than have him only have an hour than bam, Hogwarts, here he comes.” The first voice says. Everyone else laughs. As stubborn as Zeus can be, he can act on his pros and cons. He is the king of the sky for some reason. He also has a sense of humour.</p><p>        Several people go to a counter to grab small bottles, and put them by the body. No one can help but look at him nervously. A lot depends on him, everyone knows that, but they all look at him in doubt.</p><p>       “Ready?” The third voice asks again. A few people walk closer and grab bottles, one opens his mouth.</p><p>       The third voice counts down from three, the people at the table pour the bottles contents into his mouth, as quickly as possible.</p><p>        They step away from him as the body starts screaming in pain, kicking his legs as if he doesn’t know what else to do. His body starts growing, his curly hair straightens slightly. He’s also given new clothes, to help him fit in. Blue runners, black pants, and a dark red sweater. Everyone sighs in satisfaction. He looks exactly like a ten year old, looks and all. They turn to look at a map, finding the perfect place to put him.</p><p>       This is going to be good.</p>
