    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p class="p1">The world was sweltering and the sky was sweating, as if rain was hanging in the air from the way humidity flooded the sky. It was the type of day that made Sirius wonder how the clouds stayed afloat, heavy as they were with condensation.</p>
<p class="p1">The pool was sticky with it, and Sirius wanted nothing more than to curl up in an air-conditioned room with a glass of ice water. It made his throat itch just think about it, and he turned to look longingly at the row of houses across from the pool.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius leaned against the counter with a yawn, doing his best to stay out of the sun, lingering right under the overhang and relishing the cool. He had a knack for not thinking things through fully, and evidently he hadn’t realized exactly how miserable it would be to stand in the sun for hours on end. <em>Job opportunity at the pool </em>had sounded far more appealing in the papers.</p>
<p class="p1">“Sirius! Get out here!” James yelled, rolling his eyes and brandishing a towel in Sirius’s general direction. He snapped it twice before turning back to shield his eyes against the constant glare.</p>
<p class="p1">“But the sun!” Sirius protested, retreating further under the overhang and trying to shrink into the wall and pretend he wasn’t there. The brick was blissfully cool against his back. When James turned exasperatedly to look at him, he pouted. He wasn’t entirely sure why he’d taken the job in the first place. Mostly to get out of the house — every second out of that place was a blessing itself, even if the Manor was flooded with cold.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course it was, chilled to the bone with his mother’s harsh yells and meticulous upkeep. But he’d rather burn to death than live the rest of his life shut away there.</p>
<p class="p1">He could see James barely biting back curses, not wanting to get in trouble for swearing around young, impressionable kids. He settled for waving a towel at Sirius instead.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s summer, of course it’s hot! What did you expect?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, fine,” Sirius grumbled. He pulled at his t-shirt, sticky with sweat and chlorine, clinging to his skin in a wholly unpleasant way. He walked out as slowly as possible, not wanting to sacrifice his respite from the weather. A drop of sweat rolled even further down his back. Cringing heavily and arching his back, he pasted a smile on his face and joined James where he was handing out towels.</p>
<p class="p1">“Do you really need my help?” Sirius groaned, because it felt like the sun was already burning him, a slow slide from white to red. “Really?”</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">As much as he loved to complain, Sirius also loved the pool. He loved pretty much anywhere away from home, but the pool especially, with James and the strange assortment of regular pool-goers. He’d been working here a few months now, and the prime of summer was starting to hit. Now he understood why they’d been so desperate for employees at the beginning.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Can someone check memberships for me?” Peter called out from behind the counter, and Sirius dropped all the towels in his haste to take over. Shade. Relief. He ran around the pool, skidding dangerously past the huge signs that screamed no running, and he vaulted over the counter in one fluid leap.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I’ve got it,” he grinned, ignoring James’s exasperated cries from behind him and the pile of sodden towels.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Peter just rose one eyebrow, as if to ask <em>really?</em> He’d learned not to question things by now, and this was tame by Sirius’s standards.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Sirius swore he could feel the shade against his back as strongly as the sun, beating down over his reddening arms and drying the sweat that soaked his forehead and shirt. He let out a breath and sucked in the air, which was cooler in the shade. It soothed his parched throat. He busied himself with the member list, shuffling papers around to look busy and smiling towards the entrance.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Sirius had seen his fair share of strange people in his time, and there were enough people who wore long sleeves or trousers to go swimming that it wasn’t abnormal. Usually, though, they stayed away on the worst of days. On a day like this where the humidity in the air soaked through the towels and made the air itself feel like a swimming pool, they’d seek refuge by the indoor pool, or stay at home, happily air conditioned.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Usually they didn’t come limping up to the counter, crutches swinging, clad in a woolen-knit jumper.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Except, that’s exactly what happened.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I’d like to renew a membership here from last summer,” the redhead girl beside the jumper-boy said, slapping a card down on the counter. “And he needs to renew his too, but he lost the card,” she added, jerking her thumb in the boy’s direction.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Sirius was still gawping at him. It had to be over one hundred degrees out, and he was wearing a jumper. A knitted jumper with ugly stripes that somehow still looked good on him, with the way it hung loose over his frame.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The boy quirked an eyebrow at him. It would’ve been more suave if there wasn’t already a bead of sweat rolling down the side of his face from underneath a nest of tawny curls. His hair matched his jumper perfectly, somehow, and the sunlight that managed to worm its way under the overhang lit him up with a glow that didn’t betray how miserable he must feel.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Is there something wrong?” the girl asked, looking between Sirius and the jumper-boy, and Sirius quickly shook himself out of his reverie. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“No, no,” he said quickly, grabbing the membership and nearly dropping it in his haste. Swearing in the back of his mind, he quickly punched in the number of her membership, charging another year to her account. The entire time he could feel the boy watching him — his unnaturally amber eyes, piercing in a way that was almost disconcerting. He did his best not to look up. It was more difficult than he’d anticipated, especially with the impulsive nature that seemed to follow him around wherever he went, waiting for the most random of things to jump out and catch him by surprise.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">But he kept his head down as he charged the card and then slid it back across the counter.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“And you, what’s your name?” Sirius asked, looking up and meeting the boy’s eyes again, trying not to look away. It was like he’d forgotten all ettiquette on this front. He couldn’t remember what he was supposed to do — was he supposed to maintain eye contact? Was this too long? Should he look away now?</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He felt completely thrown off balance.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Remus Lupin,” the boy said quietly. He shifted on his crutches and wiped another bead of sweat from where it had been slowly making its way down his face. Sirius wondered again why he was wearing a jumper, of all things.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Right,” Sirius said. “And how d’you spell that?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">When he finally handed a new ID card to Remus and waved them through to the pool area, he couldn’t help but stare after them, at his awkward navigation of the crutches and the jumper still weighing heavily over his shoulders. </span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">There was something about the way Remus walked with his shoulders hunched forwards — pausing between blundering steps and nearly slipping as he went — that drew Sirius’s attention towards him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">A group of kids walked up to the register then, laughing, towels slung over their shoulders, and Sirius ripped his gaze away from Remus Lupin. He tried to concentrate on his job, not that punching numbers into a register was especially exciting.</span>
</p>
<p class="p1">It wasn’t until later when Peter relieved him of duty that he remembered Remus Lupin.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius was standing off to the side of the pool, surveying the clamor and splashing pool water. He preferred to stand on the side with lane lines — it felt calmer there, less noise and energy swamping him with every second he watched. He couldn’t take excitement 24/7, especially not when the day was already so hot that he felt sluggish and slow.</p>
<p class="p1">Even far away from the chaos, he hung off to the side. There was a lot of standing around for his job, watching after people and making sure they were okay, and Sirius had found that he could get away with standing in the shade of a tree.</p>
<p class="p1">Despite it all, he found his gaze being irrevocably drawn towards the bloke who had come in earlier, draped in a knitted jumper and now covered with a sheen of sweat. His leg was propped up on the chair, and Sirius distantly wondered what was wrong with it. There wasn’t a cast, nor any visible injury that Sirius could see. Not a sign.</p>
<p class="p1">His friend Lily was already in the water, swimming laps. He watched as she swam. She was obviously good — Sirius had come to be able to pick out talented swimmers from the rest, despite knowing nothing about swimming in the slightest. It was obvious from the easy power in her body, the quick turns and practiced strokes, that she was a swimmer. Sirius looked back over at Remus, and wondered if he was a swimmer too.</p>
<p class="p1">He wanted to know. He wondered if he could ask.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius’s train of thought was interrupted a moment later by James, who walked over to him, carrying a pile of towels and looking rather disgruntled.</p>
<p class="p1">“You’re the worst,” he said, wiping sweat off his own forehead and only serving to mess up his hair further. “Dick. I’m taking counter duty for the next hour. That’s what you get for abandoning me.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah, yeah, whatever,” Sirius said, still distracted by Remus and Lily.</p>
<p class="p1">James followed his gaze to where Lily was swimming and let out a low whistle, following her path through the water.</p>
<p class="p1">“She’s <em>good</em>,” he said under his breath, towels forgotten as he watched her cut through the water.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah,” Sirius said absentmindedly. Remus had pulled out a book now and was immersed in it, seeming not to hear to water splashing around him and the screams of kids. It was like he was lost in his own world, the kind of concentration Sirius could only ever achieve when he had an idea in his mind.</p>
<p class="p1">An idea like the one that was currently niggling at the back of his head. The idea of understanding Remus.</p>
<p class="p1">“Right, I’m going to the shade,” James said, tossing the towels to Sirius and walking easily back over to the counter, spinning around to type in a number and then lean back against the wall with a yawn.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius turned back to Remus. He couldn’t keep his gaze away.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, he snapped.</p>
<p class="p1">“Okay, how do you do it?” he asked, walking over to take a seat next to Remus, feeling the straps of the beach chair hot against the back of his legs. He shifted uncomfortably against the heat, but quickly refocused his gaze on Remus.</p>
<p class="p1">“Do what?” Remus responded after a beat. He didn’t even look up from his book, his eyes still moving steadily over the words, devouring them like they were far more important than Sirius. Sirius felt an uncomfortable twist in his stomach that came along with being ignored.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s the middle of summer,” Sirius elaborated, feeling suddenly awkward and imposing. “It’s somewhere around 100 degrees.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Mmm,” Remus said absentmindedly. He was chewing on the inside of his mouth in concentration, still hunched over the pages. A drop of sweat fell from his forehead onto the words, and his hair hung limp around him from the humidity that clouded the air. Sirius wanted to grab his book, to force him to look up and take in Sirius’s face with the same rapt attention that he was giving to his book.</p>
<p class="p1">“How are you wearing a jumper in the middle of summer?”</p>
<p class="p1">The boy looked annoyed now, and he flipped a page pointedly, eyes scanning the page with a deliberation that made Sirius wonder if he was actually reading or if he was just trying to send a message.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius knew he should leave now. It was written across the boy’s face and shown in every movement, but something about the atmosphere compelled Sirius to stay. He was sweating and annoyed, and something about that gave him an odd courage.</p>
<p class="p1">“How can you stand the heat? I’m dying, and I’m wearing a short-sleeved shirt.”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus closed his eyes momentarily as though shielding them against the sun. He took a deep breath, and Sirius could see the air travel through him, in the expanding of his chest underneath the jumper. In, pause, out. In, pause, out. In, pause, out.</p>
<p class="p1">Then he opened them again and turned to Sirius, pinning him with that striking amber-orange gaze that made Sirius forget entirely who he was. He tried to read if their were any emotions reflected in Remus’s eyes, wondering if the gaze meant anything or if it was another appearance — another thing that Remus couldn’t help, like the way his hair curled around his ears. Another feature that told Sirius nothing, a hook and lure that reeled him in only to reveal nothing on the other side.</p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t notice the heat,” Remus ground out. His fingers were tight against the page, and his eyes were a permanent fixture on the roaming sentences, black ink that looked out of place against the heat of the day. Sirius felt something building inside him, and he knew he should leave. He should remove himself from the situation before things went too far.</p>
<p class="p3">"Of course you feel the heat!" Sirius said instead, staring at Remus's flushed face. He still couldn't tell if Remus was actually reading or staring at the pages for show, because the way his eyes stuttered across the page gave away nothing. The sun was beating down on the both of them, casting strange patterns across Sirius's legs between the lines of the umbrella, and he tried to focus on the patterns instead of the roiling emotions building inside of him. "Why are you wearing a jumper?"</p>
<p class="p3">Remus took another deep breath, snapped the book closed, and glared up at Sirius.</p>
<p class="p3">"Can you not take a hint?" he asked, words as brittle and sharp as the manner in which he'd closed the book. "Leave me alone."</p>
<p class="p3">“Fine, but there's no need to be so rude about it," Sirius shot right back. He stared at the light dancing across his legs, trying to steady his breathing and knowing he should leave before he slipped into a state that would be near-impossible to get out of. He knew how this would end up, because it had happened before. Before, when his parents ignored him and stared right through him like he was invisible, not worth their gaze. And now — now he was practically invisible to <em>Remus Lupin </em>too, an irksome fly that wouldn’t stop buzzing.</p>
<p class="p3">"Look, I'm trying to read," Remus said with a sigh, gesturing to his book and wiping a hand across his brow. He was still flushed and panting slightly, looking like he'd run a mile instead of sitting in the sun and reading a book.</p>
<p class="p3">"Well, I'm sorry," Sirius said, trying to keep his voice even. There was a pressure behind his eyes that he hated with every fiber of his being.</p>
<p class="p3">At that moment, Lily pushed herself out of the pool.</p>
<p class="p3">"Is everything okay?" she asked, directing the words at Remus, a worried frown reflected in the crease of her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="p3">"Fine," he said. "I was just reading." He turned back to the book again, flipped open to what appeared to be a random page, and continued to read with no further comment. Sirius took one last look, at the piercing eyes that were back to scanning page after page, at Lily's protective posture, and then he turned on his heel and walked sharply away.</p>
<p class="p3">He couldn't stand to be in the sun any longer, no matter what James had said. The heat was drilling through him, only further fuelling his bout of emptiness. Sunburn was no longer his greatest worry — not even the pounding in his temple that was surely a product of the heat and his sleep deprivation. No, instead it was inside his head, the lurking truth of his existence. Of his worth.</p>
<p class="p3">"Back again, I see," James said somewhat sarcastically when Sirius marched over to him. When Sirius didn’t respond, he took a closer look at the evident distress on Sirius's face. "What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="p3">"I'm going," Sirius said bluntly. He picked up his bag and slung it over his shoulder, avoiding James’s eyes. "I can't take this."</p>
<p class="p3">“What —?" James stared after him hopelessly, but Sirius was already walking out the door. "Sirius, hold on, I'm coming!"</p>
<p class="p3">Sirius didn't stop or look back. There was too much restless energy brewing inside him, and if he stopped moving, it would surely come out in other ways. Ways that he'd been trying to avoid, recently.</p>
<p class="p3">James caught up with him anyways a few minutes later, hurrying along and slowing to a walk when he reached Sirius.</p>
<p class="p3">"I left Peter in charge," James said quietly. He handed a canteen of water over to Sirius, who took it without a second thought, taking a gulp and relishing the almost-too-cold sting of the water in the back of his throat. It was soothing, and it stilled him slightly. Calmed down the heat that simmered so close to the surface. "What happened?"</p>
<p class="p3">"Did you see that guy that came in, the one on crutches?" Sirius burst out. He tugged at the end of his hair, delighting in the sting. "The one wearing a jumper?"</p>
<p class="p3">"Yeah. And?"</p>
<p class="p3">"I talked to him," Sirius said, feeling more ridiculous with every word he spoke. "I asked him why he was wearing a jumper in summer, and he kept — he kept ignoring me. He kept reading his book, like I wasn't even there, and… maybe I was being rude, I had no right to ask, but…” Sirius trailed off, taking a deep breath. "What is it James? What is it about me that makes everybody want to fucking ignore me?"</p>
<p class="p3">James looked at him, and there was a shift of recognition in his gaze.</p>
<p class="p3">“Ah. Sirius, you —”</p>
<p class="p3">"Don't," Sirius said tiredly, cutting him off before he could even begin. "Please don't bother. I know I'm being stupid."</p>
<p class="p3">"No, it isn’t you.”</p>
<p class="p3">Sirius let out another sigh and took another drink from the canteen. He focused on the cold, like he’d learned was easiest. Focusing on something besides his feelings. Cold, cold, ice.</p>
<p class="p3">"Why did he ignore me?" Sirius asked, and James frowned at that. It was a frown Sirius recognized, one that let him know he was about to be told off.</p>
<p class="p3">"Don't go blaming that boy," James warned, stopping. They were in the middle of a parking lot now. "Just because he reminds you of your parents doesn't mean —"</p>
<p class="p3">"Yeah, I know!" Sirius interrupted, and he felt limp, wrung out, like the air after a storm.</p>
<p class="p3">“Maybe you know,” James said, his calm voice making up for the both of them, “But you’re still blaming him for how you feel.”</p>
<p class="p3">It was then that the sky opened up above him, rain pouring down, grey and beautiful and soaking through his clothes. Sirius stared up at the sky, at the sudden pent up release of water from the heavens, and he shook his head.</p>
<p class="p3">“He got under my skin somehow,” Sirius whispered to James. “There was something about him that made me angry. I don’t know if it was because he was like Reg, or… I don’t know.”</p>
<p class="p3">“I know,” James said quietly. He sat down on the ground, ignoring the fact that it was the middle of a rain-soaked parking lot, and Sirius sat down beside him. “I know.”</p>
<p class="p3">The thing was, James <em>did</em> know. He was one of the only ones who knew, who could see through the careful façade of confidence he put up at every turn. Underneath that, James was the only one who knew how unstable it was, a mess of emotions underneath a shell that could be cracked if someone even found the slightest weak point in just the right place, and it appeared that Remus had found that.</p>
<p class="p3">Now he felt split open and raw in a way that made him put up that second barrier, the one of unfeeling that protected him a second time from the turmoil inside. He knew it was lurking, and he knew that nothingness was better than what he held beneath.</p>
<p class="p3">Sirius returned home that night, to another place he'd be ignored. Shunted aside.</p>
<p class="p3">He sat in his room and wished he hadn’t put up so many walls, because now he barely knew what was behind them all.</p>
<p class="p4" align="center">* * *</p>
<p class="p1">When Sirius went back to the pool the next day, the weather was notably less horrible than the day before. The sky was covered in a thick layer of graying clouds, and a soft drizzle fell all around. Sirius loved these days, when he could take his time walking down the sidewalk to the tune of rain sputtering against the concrete, all endless grey.</p>
<p class="p1">The colors of the world felt in sync on these days — it was all grey. The skies, the rain, the concrete. There weren’t clashing colors that made him cringe and feel out of control, no yellow sun and blue sky and <em>brightness.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Just grey.</p>
<p class="p1">He was in a good mood by the time he reached the pool, bag slung over his shoulder, shirt speckled with the telltale sign of fallen rain.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hey,” James said casually when he got to the pool, tossing a towel at him. “No time to lag around, tosser. Go put the towels away.”</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius rolled his eyes but grabbed the towels with a grin, starting to move them inside so they wouldn’t be rendered completely useless by the rain. James could read him better than most anybody — he didn’t tiptoe around Sirius because he’d had a bad day yesterday.</p>
<p class="p1">And most of all, he knew how to make Sirius feel useful. Even though he had trouble concentrating on boring tasks, having something to do gave him a destination of sorts. He started stacking the towels and restocking the snack bar, exchanging idle conversations as people filtered slowly into the pool.</p>
<p class="p1">The stream of visitors was markedly slower than usual. It was almost nice, to have a break from the hassle and screaming. Instead, it was all little kids being hurried off before the rain got too bad. Sirius was organizing the back room when he heard a voice from behind him, the quiet one that was almost swept up in the song that rain pattered against the surface of the water.</p>
<p class="p1">It was Remus. He knew it immediately, and there was something in the sound of his voice against the backdrop of rain that dug a tiny pit in Sirius’s stomach.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius had far too much experiences with these pools of dread that seemed to cling to him — like he was collecting them, day after day. They started small, barely noticeable, merely a twinge inside of him. And then they grew. They grew, until they filled him up and he had to escape, to never again look at the thing that caused them.</p>
<p class="p1">He had to stop this one before it grew and swallowed him whole. He couldn’t let Remus do that to him unknowingly — couldn’t let <em>Remus </em>become something he dreaded.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus was still limping, although his crutches were gone, and he was still wearing a sweater This one was even bigger than the last one, and yet more threadbare, looking completely worn down like he’d been wearing it for years on end with no intention of stopping.</p>
<p class="p1">He limped slowly over to a beach chair and sat down, kicking his leg up while Lily jumped in the pool and immediately started to swim laps. Sirius watched as Remus glanced up at the sky, annoyance reflected in his gaze — his eyes looked grey today, something about the way they reflected the sky. But even grey, they were startling as ever, like a <em>bright </em>grey. If there was such a thing.</p>
<p class="p1">He didn’t even look at Sirius, just stared in frustration as the rain coated his face and clung to the knit of his sweater. He pulled a book out of his bag and hunched over.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Oh. </em>He was trying to shield it from the rain, Sirius realized, keeping the pages from smearing and soaking through with rainwater.</p>
<p class="p1">He walked over to grab an umbrella, one of the large ones with stands that spanned the space of multiple chairs, and he dragged it over to where Remus was hunched. Customer service was the most important part of his job, after all.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hey,” he said when Remus looked up at him. He dragged the umbrella over and propped it up, clicking it into place. “I thought you might want this.”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus looked from him to the umbrella, looking confused.</p>
<p class="p1">“Look, I’m sorry we got off on the wrong foot yesterday. I’m… trying to make up for it. You were reading, and I thought you might want to keep your book dry.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Thanks,” Remus said. He carefully slipped a bookmark into the page and set it down on his lap, looking up at Sirius in a way that didn’t <em>exactly </em>seem like an invitation to sit, but Sirius took it as such anyway because it was the most welcoming he’d seen Remus.</p>
<p class="p1">“Don’t worry about it, it’s my job.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh,” Remus said. He almost sounded disappointed — Sirius had a slight sinking feeling that he’d said something wrong —but he brushed over it quickly.</p>
<p class="p1">“What book is that anyway that’s got you so absorbed?”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus’s eyes lit up at that, looking over at the book eagerly, fingers clenching in his lap. He opened his mouth, seemed to think better of it, and drooped slightly.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s nothing,” he muttered. He clenched his hands in his lap again. “Nothing at all, just boring stuff.” He shrugged. “It’s not interesting,” he reiterated, looking away.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s got to be more interesting than my job,” Sirius said with a dry laugh, looking around at the pool.</p>
<p class="p1">“No, it’s okay,” Remus said.</p>
<p class="p1">“Please?” Sirius wasn’t sure if he actually cared or if he just wanted to get Remus to talk, but it didn’t really matter which in the end.</p>
<p class="p1">“Fine,” Remus said with a sigh, but Sirius didn’t miss the way his eyes brightened and his whole face seemed to glow. “It’s stupid, really. But…well, it’s about dragons. They’re sentient, but they don’t really realize they are — they’re not as cognizant as humans. Anyways, their homeland...”</p>
<p class="p1">His voice trailed into the pounding rain as he talked, splattering against the umbrella. It blurred away the rest of the world until Remus’s bright grey eyes and animated hand movements were all he could really see. The tiny pit of dread had faded entirely into nothingness, and instead their was a tiny coal of happiness in its place, and a similar coal-like glow hummed around Remus.</p>
<p class="p1">“…and right now they’re falling from the sky.”</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius smiled over at him, and Remus looked away self-consciously.</p>
<p class="p1">“That’s cool,” Sirius said. “It sounds like a good book. Sorry for being obnoxious yesterday, I wouldn’t have wanted to be interrupted either.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus laughed, and at that moment, James’s voice rang from across the pool.</p>
<p class="p1">“Sirius, get over here and stop avoiding work!” Sirius yawned and stuck his tongue out at James, feeling a miniscule drop of rain land on it. He stood up and stretched his arms above his head, each drop making him smile.</p>
<p class="p1">“Have fun with your book,” he said, and he smiled tentatively at Remus.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah, yeah,” Remus said, waving him off. “Whatever. Go do your work.”</p>
<p class="p1">So that’s what Sirius did, jogging over — point-blank ignoring all the painted signs that told him not to run — and replacing Peter at the counter. He glanced back over his shoulder once to find Remus immersed in his book again, thumbing at the corner of a page, lips moving slightly like he was mouthing the words as he read them.</p>
<p class="p1">He looked back to find James watching him, one eyebrow quirked, and Sirius ignored him. He didn’t need James to remind him of his meltdown yesterday, or anything else that might follow that train of thought.</p>
<p class="p1">“You made up with him then?” James asked nonetheless, and Sirius barely refrained from rolling his eyes, which was his constant state when he was in James’s company.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yes,” he sniffed in a way that made him feel superior, looking away and pretending to shuffle some files into place. “Of course.”</p>
<p class="p1">He heard James laughing from behind him, and couldn’t resist cracking a grin himself.</p>
<p class="p1">“He’s not actually that bad,” he said, shrugging. “He likes reading a lot, wouldn’t stop talking about his book, whatever it was about.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Not that you actually listened to him, did you?” James asked, and Sirius looked back to see him leaning against the wall, one eye closed, shielded from the rain.</p>
<p class="p1">“I did!” Sirius insisted, and proceeded to launch into the story of dragons who fell from the sky. James looked suitably impressed.</p>
<p class="p1">“Well, I must say I wasn’t expecting that. Usually you tune me out halfway through the conversation, but I guess I’ve been usurped by the new guy, huh?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh, shut up,” Sirius said, rolling his eyes again — he was unable to suppress it this time. He didn’t mind James’s teasing — he never had, but he was especially carefree now, when there was still an ember burning in his stomach and radiating warmth throughout him. When the rain was still pounding around him.</p>
<p class="p1">Other people hated it — they said the rain dampened things, that the grey was a wet blanket over everything. For Sirius, it fueled the coal instead of putting it out, a reverse kind of fire. It made sense because it didn’t make sense, because nothing about Sirius or his mind had ever made sense in any way, shape, or form.</p>
<p class="p1">He was glowing from the inside out, from the time he talked to Remus to the time he left with James by his side. James seemed to notice it too.</p>
<p class="p1">“What’s got you in such a good mood?” he asked, looking over at him and kicking at a puddle as he walked, watching the rain splash down in an extra shower. James wrinkled his nose at the water as it soaked his jeans from the ankle upwards but Sirius didn’t pay him any mind.</p>
<p class="p1">He didn’t know how to answer exactly, because that’s how his mood worked. Strange things — textures, feelings, auras he could never quite explain. It was like he had a whole other pocket of emotions that weren’t available to other people but were spread out in an array in front of him.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus, the rain, the pool — it was a whole different emotion, designed entirely for him. Something that James would never be able to understand.</p>
<p class="p1">So instead he shrugged.</p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t know,” he said, smiling down at his pair of shoes, even though he had never particularly liked them. “I’m happy, that’s all.”</p>
<p class="p1">James laughed, and Sirius could feel the eyes staring at the side of his head, but he didn’t look over. It was a soft atmosphere, everything blending together into one, with the water gracing him and dripping down the back of his neck. He skipped a step, the energy building up in him all at once, and he started laughing, feeling all too giddy.</p>
<p class="p1">“I can tell,” James said in amusement. “Wanna stay at mine tonight?”</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius wrinkled his nose again, not wanting to think about what would come later if he returned home. He almost wished it was back to how it had been when he was younger, when his parents would yell and frown at him. At least then he’d been a person instead of a ghost. Now, he was the ghost. Less than a ghost, actually, because it wasn’t that they saw through him<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>— they didn’t see him at all.</p>
<p class="p1">He wasn’t there. He didn’t get a place at the dinner table, he wasn’t enough to be granted their words. On rare occasions he got disapproving glances. Sometimes he would get a sharp word. But for the most part, he wasn’t a part of their family. He wasn’t even a disgrace.</p>
<p class="p1">He was <em>invisible.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Part of him liked the rain even more for that, because it couldn’t pass through him. It was always pounding against him, keeping him solid so he wouldn’t float away into a different world where he was unmoored and unconscious and nonexistent.</p>
<p class="p1">“I shouldn’t,” Sirius said regretfully. “I’ve been away too much recently, and Regulus…” he trailed off. “I don’t know. I don’t want to leave him there alone.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Okay,” James shrugged. “But Regulus can fend for himself.”</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius tensed instinctively. It was nothing James had said, because James was always careful about his words in a way that Sirius never had the patience to be. It was the thought — the feeling — of his family. The duty he had to Regulus even though he was invisible.</p>
<p class="p1">Regulus teetered on the cusp, stuck between the family and Sirius, neither good nor bad, and Sirius had taken it upon himself to be there and help steer Regulus in the right direction.</p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t know if he can,” Sirius frowned. “He’s strange.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You can’t protect him forever,” James pointed out, in a way that was entirely too reasonable for Sirius’s tastes. “You’re going to have to let him out into the real world at some point, you know. He can’t be under your wing for his whole life. He’s not one to be influenced, anyways.”</p>
<p class="p1">“I know,” Sirius snapped, looking away. He tried to hold onto the coal in his stomach. He tried not to let it be extinguished, because he knew there were things he had to work through, but at the moment that wasn’t what he wanted to do. He wanted to sit in the rain and let it fall on him, wanted to think about Remus’s smile and the way his eyes glowed, wanted to hold onto the feeling that he was <em>worth </em>something, that his life wasn’t a complete waste.</p>
<p class="p1">He wanted to splash in puddles like a normal kid. He wanted to laugh, to yell at the thunder and count seconds until lightning, to figure out how far away the storm was, to stay outside and find the rainbow, to drink hot chocolate and dance in the rain.</p>
<p class="p1">He wanted to live, wanted to live in a way that he’d never been able to do.</p>
<p class="p1">But daydreams could only last so long. That was only acceptable at night, when things were<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>dark. Night was a realm where he could pretend and nothing had to have bearing on the highlights of the day.</p>
<p class="p1">So when James fell silent and kicked at another puddle, Sirius sighed and turned to face him.</p>
<p class="p1">“I know you’re trying to help,” he said quietly. “I know — I…” he trailed off, not even sure what he was going to say. “Can we go to the park? I don’t want to go home yet.”</p>
<p class="p1">James smiled at him, looking relieved in a way, and he nodded. “Only if you race me there.”</p>
<p class="p1">And he took off without another word, sprinting like his life depending on it, slipping dangerously over the grass and misplacing every other step. There was a spray of water in his path and Sirius wasted no time in taking off after him, creating his own trail of water droplets that rained down from the sky after him — a second rain, splashing against him, against the ground.</p>
<p class="p1">He closed his eyes and let the wind flood over him as he chased James to the park. He was okay still. He was okay. He was okay. He was okay.</p>
<p class="p5" align="center">* * *</p>
<p class="p1">The next day when he got to the pool it was a strange medium weather, not raining, not hot, only slightly foggy and moist. The air still felt heavy and dense, slightly humid, but the temperature was so even that Sirius couldn’t say if it was warm or cool.</p>
<p class="p1">It was just there, like his skin belonged in it, like he was soaking in nothingness.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus was there again too, with his book and with Lily, who was swimming laps seamlessly.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius couldn’t help himself — the coal in his stomach was still flaming and radiating a warmth through him, so he went to sit next to Remus, who looked up at his approach with an mild surprise.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hi,” he said. He didn’t close his book, but he didn’t ignore Sirius — Sirius counted that as a score.</p>
<p class="p1">“Hi,” Sirius said back, yawning and slinging his legs up to the chair. He and James had stayed at the park far longer than was probably practical last night, and Sirius hadn’t crept home until his eyes could no longer adjust to the dark, let alone stay open.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus stared at him for a second.</p>
<p class="p1">“You never told me your name,” he said after a minute, regarding Sirius carefully.</p>
<p class="p1">“So I didn’t,” Sirius mused, shrugging. “It’s Sirius.”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s not that serious,” Remus frowned, thumb rifling through the pages of his book while he looked at Sirius. “It’s only a name.”</p>
<p class="p1">“No, I meant — my name. It’s Sirius.” He proceeded to spell out his name, accompanied by the doubtful slope of Remus’s mouth as he did so.</p>
<p class="p1">“Oh,” Remus said. He shrugged, and turned to look out over the pool. It was more crowded than yesterday, but still lower than usual, with the pool not close to the usual filled capacity. “Okay.” His thumb worried at the corner of the book.</p>
<p class="p1">He followed Remus’s gaze to the flash of bright red poking out from underneath Lily’s swim cap. She was still swimming as steadily as ever, breathing like she was on land instead of half-submerged in water. She flipped turns with an agility that Sirius could only marvel at, twisting through the water like she was meant to be there.</p>
<p class="p1">“How do you know her?” Sirius asked curiously, and he felt Remus’s eyes on him as he watched Lily.</p>
<p class="p1">“Lily?” His voice was still quiet, even without the rain to mask the sound.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah.”</p>
<p class="p1">“We used to swim together,” Remus said with a shrug. The way he watched her had a hint of another emotion in it. Sirius couldn’t quite tell what it was — he didn’t know Remus well enough to understand his facial expression — but it almost looked like envy. Sirius wondered vaguely if they had some sort of history together. He didn’t bring it up.</p>
<p class="p1">“Cool,” Sirius said instead. Quietly, like Remus. “Used to?”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus shrugged, looking away with something akin to disappointment. “Until my foot got injured.” He gestured at the leg that was still propped up on the chair. Sirius couldn’t see anything wrong with it at first glance. Or at second glance.</p>
<p class="p1">“What happened to your foot?”</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s complicated,” Remus frowned. “But I can’t swim.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Okay,” Sirius said. He was good at telling when there was something more to a story. There usually was, with the complicated politics the Black Family got involved in, or with James’s tendency to keep things to himself no matter how often he was there for Sirius. But he could also sense when people didn’t want to talk something, when it was best left alone, and he could tell this was one of those times. “How’s your book going?”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus paused for a second, and then raised his eyebrows, glancing at the cover. “Do you really want to know?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Go for it,” Sirius laughed, and he leaned back while Remus launched into his story. There was something about watching him, the passion that jumped into his features at the mention of his book.</p>
<p class="p1">“Only half the dragons escaped,” he began, and all of a sudden he was off again, back into his secret worlds. When Remus finally trailed off sheepishly, Sirius realized after a second that he was still staring at Remus with a smile on his face.</p>
<p class="p1">“Why are you looking at me like that?” Remus asked, looking extremely self-conscious.</p>
<p class="p1">“Nothing,” Sirius said, still smiling. “You just get very excited about it.”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus blushed at that, a pink stain running over his skin, and he looked away, picking at the hem of his sweater sleeve.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah, well. I don’t know much about you, what do you like?”</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius shrugged, suddenly uncomfortable, because he didn’t <em>have </em>hobbies like Remus. He tagged along, he went with the world because he’d been born into it, and he didn’t have a passion for anything special.</p>
<p class="p1">“Nothing much,” Sirius shrugged, and he looked in the other direction. “I don’t know.”</p>
<p class="p1">Remus looked at him for a minute, pondering.</p>
<p class="p1">“Okay, then what do you like? One thing. It can be small.”</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius thought back to yesterday, to the coal in his stomach. “Rain,” he said, thinking of the cool speckles against his skin and the sounds and smell and… “I like rain.”</p>
<p class="p1">“There you go,” Remus said, giving him a small smile. “That’s not nothing.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah, but it’s not…it’s not anything real.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Rain is real.”</p>
<p class="p1">“You know what I mean,” Sirius snapped. He felt oddly vulnerable, stripped down to his core, and Remus’s eyes were boring through him regardless. He hated it. He hated that he hated it. He wanted to leave.</p>
<p class="p1">“Well,” Remus said slowly. “You have plenty of time to figure it out, you know. You don’t have to know anything yet.”</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius shrugged. He wanted to get away from the conversation, because when he thought too hard about his role in the world, he felt hopeless and worthless all over again, like he was going to do absolutely nothing and it wouldn’t matter in the slightest. <em>He </em>wouldn’t matter in the slightest.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’ll leave you to your reading, then,” he said, standing up and turning around, momentarily forgetting where he was, what he was supposed to be doing.</p>
<p class="p1">He wasn’t sure if Remus was watching him walk away — he’d never been able to feel someone’s eyes on him, the way other people seemingly could. Perhaps he was less attuned to people than everyone else. He sighed, watching Lily turn another flip. James walked up behind him, bumping him in the hip and following his gaze.</p>
<p class="p1">“She’s <em>good,” </em>he murmured, eyes following her across the pool. She barely stopped for a breath. Still, still swimming as fluidly as before.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah,” Sirius said distractedly. “You mentioned.”</p>
<p class="p1">He left James to himself watching Lily, and he walked over to the check-in counter. He stewed in his thoughts, absentmindedly scanning badges, all the while lost somewhere within himself. Every so often he glanced up at Remus and the way he mouthed the words of the book while he scanned the pages.</p>
<p class="p1">But most of all he was caught up in the future, so much so that when Regulus walked through the entrance way, looking around him, Sirius absentmindedly asked for his membership without realizing who it was.</p>
<p class="p1">“Sirius?” Regulus asked, sounding concerned. He leaned against the counter, casting a look around him once more. “Sirius, it’s me.”</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius looked over at him in surprise, his eyes finally swimming back into focus from the blurry point he’d previously been fixated on.</p>
<p class="p1">“Reg? What are you doing here?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I wanted to see where you work,” Regulus shrugged. Even though Sirius was brothers with Regulus, Sirius had a difficult time understanding him. It wasn’t like Regulus had no moral compass, because he did. He understood right from wrong well enough — he had his own ideals, and he understood morality. But it was almost as though he wasn’t sure when the compass was applicable.</p>
<p class="p1">Or maybe Sirius was entirely off. Nothing about Regulus had ever made sense, even when they were small children. He would run around the house telling stories to the portraits, who spoke in whispered words that he was going mad.</p>
<p class="p1">Only, Sirius didn’t think that was true. Regulus wasn’t mad. He was different, but he wasn’t <em>mad.</em></p>
<p class="p1">“Okay,” Sirius said slowly. “This is where I work.” He gestured slowly around him, across the pool and Remus’s tawny curls, across the scores of people who were there to swim. Across James, who was still casting side glances at the redheaded figure, cutting through the water like nothing else. Across Peter, nervously handing out snacks to young kids.</p>
<p class="p3">"I can see that," Regulus commented, looking around the area with his nose scrunched in distaste. "It's very..."</p>
<p class="p3">Sirius sighed as he trailed off, his words lost in the air. He could guess what Regulus had been about to say, in any case. Plebeian, perhaps. Commonplace. Undignified.</p>
<p class="p3">"Well, I'm making money," Sirius said bluntly, squaring his shoulders and doing his best not to be annoyed at the fact that his brother had barged in asking about his job only to insult it. This was a job, he reminded himself. This was his job, and he was making money.</p>
<p class="p3">He was being useful.</p>
<p class="p3">"You could have taken the job as Black Family —“</p>
<p class="p3">"I'm not working for Father," Sirius spat, and the words turned his mouth sour. "Why do you think I'm as far away from him as possible?"</p>
<p class="p3">Regulus stared at him cooly. "You're smart," he said simply. "You could do something good with your life, but instead you're working at a pool for minimum wage."</p>
<p class="p3">"Why did you come here?" Sirius asked. Regulus was one of the only people who could talk to him, whose words would stick. Mother's, Father's... their words used to hurt, but they didn't stick.</p>
<p class="p3">Regulus's always did. Regulus was too much strange to ignore.</p>
<p class="p3">"Is everything okay?" Peter stepped in between them, looking from Regulus to all the tense lines and planes of Sirius's face.</p>
<p class="p3">"Everything's fine," Sirius said, directing the cold in his voice towards Regulus, staring at him and refusing to look away.</p>
<p class="p3">"Right," Peter said, obviously sensing the lie and not willing to let it go. "Sirius, James needs your help with some food problem. He told me I wasn't smart enough to help him, so if you'll deal with that I can take over checking people in to the pool."</p>
<p class="p3">"Okay," Sirius said quietly, knowing it was a lie. He walked over to James and leaned against the food counter, letting out a sigh that felt like it had been trapped in his chest for far too long.</p>
<p class="p3">“Ignore him,” James said when Sirius looked over at him. He was busy making food of some kind or another, and he wasn’t looking at Sirius, but it was obvious that was who it was directed at. “Don’t let him get to you, Sirius. What he says doesn’t mean anything.”</p>
<p class="p3">Sirius sighed again..</p>
<p class="p3">“I know,” he said, frowning. He did know, but he couldn’t help it, he couldn’t help any of it. Regulus had a voice that could cut through anything. “In theory.”</p>
<p class="p3">James looked at him thoughtfully and then just nodded. Sirius leaned back against the counter and closed his eyes, letting the equal mugginess of the day flood over him. It felt good for his eyes to be closed, because he could only see the sunlight in bursts of red splotches. The world was still there, but really it wasn’t. Not for him. It was only spots of color instead of actual shapes that made up figures.</p>
<p class="p3">When he opened his eyes again, all his weight still against the countertop, he found Remus staring at him. Remus tipped his head to the side as if to ask a question, but Sirius wasn’t entirely sure what the question was supposed to be. And even if he had, the answer was a whole different story.</p>
<p class="p3">So he just gave Remus a small smile of acknowledgement before turning back to James. He tried not to think about if Remus had heard them talking about Regulus, because that left him feeling raw.</p>
<p class="p3">“You want help?” he asked, suddenly in need of distraction. His hands were itching and he needed to do something — it didn’t particularly matter what, but he had to do <em>something. </em></p>
<p class="p3">“Yeah, sure,” James said with a yawn. “You can bring this food to them.” He handed a plate of food to Sirius and pointed vaguely towards a family sitting by the edge of the pool.</p>
<p class="p3">Sirius did exactly that, trying not to pay much attention as Regulus walked out towards the pool exit.</p>
<p class="p3">That night, neither Sirius nor Regulus mentioned what had happened.</p>
<p class="p6">* * *</p>
<p class="p1">The next day was miserably hot again, the sun seemingly closer to earth than it had been on any of the previous days, with not even a trace of cloud to block it out. Sirius had his hair tied up in a bun, but even so there was already sweat trickling down the back of his neck, sticky and hot.</p>
<p class="p1">And sure enough, Remus was still wearing his bloody jumper. It reawakened all Sirius’s curiosities and questions from before, and he really couldn’t help himself. He sat down beside Remus in the chair. Predictably enough, he had a book open — he didn’t look up when Sirius sat down, but his face twitched into a tiny smile nonetheless.</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I have a new theory,” Sirius told him matter-of-factly, entranced by the way the jumper swallowed him whole. “You’re cold blooded.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Remus kept his eyes trained on the page for a second longer, seeming to collect himself, before he carefully slid a bookmark into the book and set it down on the table beside him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“What?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You’re cold blooded,” Sirius repeated, nodding towards the pale blue knitting. It looked soft, especially against the soft brown of Remus’s curls. There was something about Remus that matched his surroundings — his eyes were glowing again, soft against the sun. “This is the second time I’ve seen you here when it’s over a hundred, and you’re still wearing that jumper.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Remus flicked at the corner of the book pages. “Yeah, well, this is the second time I’ve seen you here when it’s over a hundred, and you’re still talking to me instead of doing your job.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Sirius opened his mouth, then closed it again.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Touché,” he said finally, leaning over to look at the cover of Remus’s book. He let the jumper question slip away, because it was obviously something Remus wasn’t inclined to discuss. “Is that a new book?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Remus sighed and turned the cover to face Sirius.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Yeah,” he said, “And it’s actually rather boring.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Why don’t you go swimming?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Remus’s face went blank and his whole body shuttered up again, the blinds shutting out the sun on a bright day, completely shielding him.</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I told you I hurt my foot.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Right,” Sirius said quietly. “That’s — right. I’ll see you tomorrow, then?”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“I guess so.”</span>
</p>
<p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The day passed in a haze of heat.</span>
</p>
<p class="p4">* * *</p>
<p class="p1">Another night gone was another day Sirius woke up with sun streaming through the window, even though his curtains were resolutely closed against the light. It woke him at an ungodly hour, already streaming through with a determination that heated up the entire room with a glow.</p>
<p class="p1">Their house was well air-conditioned, a product of being rich and prestigious, and Sirius had mixed feelings about the chill. It was nice, of course, but it wasn't right. He didn’t want this.</p>
<p class="p1">So he left, like he did every other day. He walked to the pool.</p>
<p class="p1">Today was a big day at the pool, because it was the beginning of the summer swim season, when teams started meeting at hours that shouldn't even exist, when lanes got closed off and reserved, when the whole atmosphere got a lot more serious.</p>
<p class="p1">When Sirius got to the pool, Lily and Remus were already there. Lily was pulling on a swim cap, tight around her hair, the rubber creased in odd places.</p>
<p class="p1">"I wish you could swim," Lily said sadly, looking down at Remus's foot, even though it still wasn't easily visible what was wrong. "It's going to be weird without you, you know. You've always been there."</p>
<p class="p1">"I'll be back soon enough," Remus said quietly, but his smile looked strained. "Just wait.“</p>
<p class="p1">Lily was on a swim team — it made sense, of course, considering her level of skill that Sirius had observed over the last week. Remus, on the other hand. Sirius had never seen Remus swim, and he wondered what he looked like swimming as he limped over to a chair.</p>
<p class="p1">He quickly stopped wondering, because it filled his mind with images of Remus, his curls plastered around his head —</p>
<p class="p1">No.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius went over to greet Remus, because they did that with people that visited the pool regularly. It was polite. Customer service, that was the official term, although really Sirius just used it when he got tired of standing around and had to do something before he ruptured.</p>
<p class="p1">Besides, he liked being useful to people. He went to sit beside Remus, who was still, <em>still,</em> wearing a jumper. It was knit and thick, too big, and Remus looked frankly miserable under all the layers of wool.</p>
<p class="p1">"You're either a masochist or a sadist," Sirius mused, watching a drop of sweat that clung to the back of Remus's neck.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus looked over him. It was good luck, Sirius thought, that he hadn't gotten his book out yet. If he had, he probably would have ignored Sirius in favor of reading. Not that Sirius would've blamed him, really.</p>
<p class="p1">"What?"</p>
<p class="p1">"That bloody jumper," Sirius sighed. "It's so hot out I'm almost melting out of my skin, and you're still wearing that thing. Either you like to suffer, or you like to watch me suffer by proxy." Remus rolled his eyes and tugged self-conciously at the jumper.</p>
<p class="p1">"I just like jumpers," he mumbled, a small frown line creasing the expanse of skin over his eyebrows. "Can you please drop it?"</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius sighed. "Look, I'm not trying to interrogate you or anything, I just hate to see you like this when it's so hot outside."</p>
<p class="p1">"I'm fine," Remus insisted. "Okay? Nothing to worry about. Leave it.”</p>
<p class="p1">"Okay," Sirius said, hearing the dubious quality in his voice from afar. "Whatever you say." He turned back to watch the pool, where Lily was standing beside a pair of girls who were laughing at something she'd said. They were obviously on the same team — their swim caps, which read <em>Gryffindor</em> in red and gold, clearly showed that.</p>
<p class="p1">He watched as they jumped into the water without hesitation. Sirius had never been able to do that. Not that he could swim, but every time he got in the water it took him far too long to get acclimated.</p>
<p class="p1">"Were you on that team before you got hurt?" Sirius asked, hoping all the questions weren't too much prying. He felt slightly guilty, but his curiosity won out.</p>
<p class="p1">"Yes," Remus said hesitantly. "I was, why?"</p>
<p class="p1">"Curious. I'm just curious."</p>
<p class="p1">"I used to be a swimmer," Remus told him. "After my foot heals, I might go back to it, but for now..." he trailed off.</p>
<p class="p1">"I see," Sirius nodded. "I'll leave you in peace now, you probably have plenty of reading to do."</p>
<p class="p1">Remus gave him a faint smile as he stood up, and when Sirius walked away, a tall strict-looking woman with a tight bun bumped into him. Remus lowered his head quickly, pulling out a book and hiding behind it like he didn't want to be seen by the woman.</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius watched curiously as she walked over to Lily and the group of swimmers, who were standing in a tight circle.</p>
<p class="p1">"Listen up!" she said, voice crisp. She didn't have to speak loudly to command attention - that much Sirius could already tell. "In the pool, eight warm up laps. You know the drill."</p>
<p class="p1">They all jumped in the pool without hesitation, further reinforcing Sirius's suspicion that she wasn't a woman to be trifled with.</p>
<p class="p1">He walked over to where James was watching them behind the snack bar.</p>
<p class="p1">"Swim team season," Sirius commented, because James's eyes were following the same line as his own. "Best time of the year."</p>
<p class="p1">"You see the redhead?" James asked idly, his eyes watching as Lily warmed up. She looked like she was easily one of the fastest, and somehow it looked like she was barely having to fight against the water at all, because she overpowered it easily with every stroke, using it to her advantage. She seemed a natural — as though she was born in the water. A mermaid from one of Remus’s books.</p>
<p class="p1">"Lily? You keep mentioning her.“</p>
<p class="p1">"Is that her name?" James asked, eyes not leaving her for a second. "I'm going to ask her out."</p>
<p class="p1">"Way to be blunt," Sirius muttered, and turned to lean against the counter and look back at James. "Wait, you weren’t joking?"</p>
<p class="p1">"No!" James insisted. "She's perfect! Do you see her swimming?"</p>
<p class="p1">"James!“ Sirius looked over at him in exasperation, glad for a distraction, “You didn’t even know her name until a second ago! Have you actually had a <em>conversation </em>with her like normal people do before they ask someone out?”</p>
<p class="p1">"Sirius. Look at her."</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius rolled his eyes and followed James's gaze.</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah?”</p>
<p class="p1">"You can't tell me you wouldn't want to date her."</p>
<p class="p1">"I wouldn't want to date her," Sirius mumbled under his breath. He pushed of the counter and made his way around James, trying not to look back over at Remus.</p>
<p class="p1">"Yeah, well, you don't want to date anybody so that doesn't count."</p>
<p class="p1">"Okay," Sirius rolled his eyes. "It doesn't count. Now stop mooning over somebody who's busy trying to swim, and go do your job.”</p>
<p class="p1">"Yeah, yeah," James groaned. "Fine. But you're on desk duty then."</p>
<p class="p1">"Fine," Sirius shot back. As he was walking past where Remus was sat, he glanced over. The woman from before — hair wound into a tight bun — was approaching him.</p>
<p class="p1">"Mr. Lupin?" she asked crisply, and Remus reluctantly brought the book down from where it had been covering his face.</p>
<p class="p1">"Yes, Coach McGonagall."</p>
<p class="p1">"Why aren't you over there in the pool?"</p>
<p class="p1">"I hurt my foot," Remus mumbled, glancing down at the foot propped up on his chair. "I can't swim with it like that."</p>
<p class="p1">McGonagall frowned down at him. "What did you do to your foot?" Remus looked uncomfortable, and Sirius realized suddenly that he really shouldn't be eavesdropping. But he couldn't bring himself to move away.</p>
<p class="p1">"I tripped," he said. "Sprained it. It's nothing big, but the doctor said I can't swim."</p>
<p class="p1">"Do you have a brace?" she frowned, looking down at his foot, and Remus shook his head sheepishly. "How long will it be before you're well enough?"</p>
<p class="p1">"At the very least, a couple weeks," Remus said quietly, scratching his face and flicking through the page corners with his thumb. "I might have to sit this season out." Sirius moved over to the counter, suddenly uncomfortable with listening to their conversation when he reflected on how he'd felt when he saw Remus staring at him while they discussed Regulus. This was private.</p>
<p class="p1">He scanned into the register, trying to ignore while Remus and McGonagall continued to discuss something with each other. His mind was spinning.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus had tripped? Why had he been so uncomfortable when Sirius asked him that? Why wasn't he wearing a brace, why was he always wearing a sweater? What was the something more that Sirius had sensed when he talked to Remus? What was Remus Lupin hiding?</p>
<p class="p1">When Lily was on her thirtieth lap of the pool, and when Sirius thought he couldn't stand to check in any more people, a surprising relief provided itself. It was Remus, leaning against the counter and looking sheepishly over at him.</p>
<p class="p1">"Can I help you?" Sirius asked amusedly, surprised that Remus would be the one to seek him out.</p>
<p class="p1">"I just wanted some shade," Remus said in a murmur so low that Sirius almost couldn't hear it.</p>
<p class="p1">"What?"</p>
<p class="p1">"It's too hot outside," he said again, and Sirius tried to keep to much of his smugness from showing through, even though it was rather difficult.</p>
<p class="p1">"Too hot, you say? Could it have something to do with the jumper you're wearing?" Remus glared at him, and Sirius held up his hands in surrender.</p>
<p class="p1">"Okay, okay! I'm sorry, I'll stop talking about it. But -" he broke off, but apparently was unable to help himself "- Just answer me one question, okay? Just one."</p>
<p class="p1">Remus sighed, book hanging limply at his side. "Depends on the question," he said eventually.</p>
<p class="p1">"Why do you come here with Lily if you're not even going to swim?"</p>
<p class="p1">"I -" Remus shrugged. "I don't know. To support her, I guess."</p>
<p class="p1">"Oh." To support her. Perhaps they were dating. Sirius almost wanted to ask, but figured he'd already used up his question, so he just nodded. "Okay. What's that book about?" He couldn't help himself. He loved listening to Remus ramble on about his book, even though he never understood what was happening. He could listen to it for ages, really.</p>
<p class="p1">Remus narrowed his eyes suspiciously, as though he thought Sirius was up to something, but he started talking anyways, filling Sirius’s world with others far beyond.</p>
<p class="p1">When James packed up for the day, Sirius yawned and sidled up to him, rubbing at his eyes and cringing when they stung from exhaustion.</p>
<p class="p1">"I think Lily might be with that guy that sits on the side of the pool all the time," he said with another yawn, eyes closing involuntarily.</p>
<p class="p1">"What?"</p>
<p class="p1">"You know that guy that —“</p>
<p class="p1">"Yeah, yeah, I know who you're talking about, but why do you think that? Did she tell you? Did he tell you?"</p>
<p class="p1">"Calm down," Sirius said quickly, "I don't know, I'm just guessing. He says he only comes to the pool because he wants to support her, and it seems like a couple-y thing to do, doesn't it? I dunno, I might be making things up.”</p>
<p class="p1">“They’re friends, no need to assume,” James muttered.</p>
<p class="p1">"Yeah," Sirius said. He paused for a moment. "I think Remus is hiding something."</p>
<p class="p1">"Remus?"</p>
<p class="p1">"The boy."</p>
<p class="p1">"Oh. What do you think he's hiding?"</p>
<p class="p1">"I dunno," Sirius said again, and the frustration he felt deep down punctuated every syllable. "I can't tell. It's something, I can feel it, I'm just not sure what." James sighed and slung his bag over one shoulder.</p>
<p class="p1">"Whatever you say, Sirius. Although you're probably imagining it, you know."</p>
<p class="p1">"Yeah, yeah, it's just that he's always wearing that jumper."</p>
<p class="p1">"Plenty of people wear long sleeves to the pool," James said reasonably. "He's not alone."</p>
<p class="p1">"But it's the middle of summer!" Sirius protested. "He's not even swimming! I don't know, but I think there's something going on."</p>
<p class="p1">"And let me guess," James said sarcastically. "You're determined to figure out what it is."</p>
<p class="p1">Sirius held out his arms, imagining that it was raining, feeling the condensation around him and the humidity that clung to the air.</p>
<p class="p1">"Yeah," he said. "I am."</p>
