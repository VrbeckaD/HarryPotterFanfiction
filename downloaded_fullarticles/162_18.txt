<strong>September 1, 2001 – 10:45 am</strong></p><p align="center">~*~Molly’s POV~*~</p><p>Molly was incensed as she led her brood to the Muggle entrance to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. She may have looked the picture of happy wife and mother, escorting her children to their train, but inwardly, she was cursing the day Harry <em>bloody</em> Potter was born.</p><p>“Come along now, children,” she called out behind her as they hurried to the gate. “It’s a bit crowded with all these Muggles, but we’d best hurry. Ginny, dear, which platform was it again?” she asked, hoping beyond hope that the Potter brat would overhear, looking for the platform and not knowing where it was.</p><p>“Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, Mum!” the only girl piped up. Molly knew that her daughter was excited to meet the famous Boy-Who-Lived, a boy Molly still hoped would someday be her daughter’s husband despite her current irritation.</p><p>“Yes, yes, of course. How silly of me. This way, now. We’re nearly there.” She came to a stop in front of the brick wall between platforms Nine and Ten. “Fred, George, best get a move on. You two go through first.”</p><p>Molly was too busy glancing around the station in search of Potter to notice the look her twin sons gave each other at her odd and bewildering behavior. They wondered once again why they hadn’t merely Flooed onto the platform as they had in years past, before rushing towards the wall. If a muggle had been watching they would have been astounded when the two boys appeared to vanish just as they would have collided with the brick barrier.</p><p>“Your turn, now, Percy. Best hurry before the train leaves!” Molly called once she noticed her troublesome twins were through the gate. Percy merely nodded in acknowledgment of his mother’s direction, and went through the barrier, wondering why they were arriving so late when in past years they’d always come with plenty of time to spare. <em>How frustrating,</em> he thought to himself.</p><p>“Alright, Ronald, your turn,” she said, gesturing towards the gate.</p><p>“But what of Potter, mum? Isn’t he supposed to be coming with us?” the boy asked.</p><p>“I want to meet Harry Potter, Mummy! Why isn’t he here?” little Ginny asked with a whine and a stomp of her foot.</p><p>“I don’t know where the boy is, but it matters very little. You’ll miss the train if we keep dawdling. Come now, through the gate, Ronnie, Ginny. Hurry now.” Molly said with a sigh of exasperation, as she herded her two youngest children through the gate.</p><p>
  <strong>Hogwarts Express – 10:05</strong>
</p><p align="center">~*~Tony’s POV~*~</p><p>“Alright kiddies, let’s get this show on the road!” Tony said with excitement. “Now, Catlin, you know to call me on your StarkPhone if there is any trouble with the old coot once you arrive at Hogwarts. That goes for the two of you as well, Harry and Draco. Don’t be shy, you can use it to talk to us old folks as well.”</p><p>“Really, Dad? We know already! Can we please just get on the train and find our compartment?” Cat asked, exasperated with her father’s exuberance.</p><p>Lucius and Narcissa both chuckled as they ushered Tony towards the Express with Draco, Harry, and Catlin falling in behind. “They will be fine, Tony. There isn’t anything Dumbledore can do that we wouldn’t know about immediately. Hela has agreed to keep an eye out for the children. If you can’t trust the Goddess of the Underworld, who can you trust, hmm?” Lucius inquired with a humorous smile.</p><p>“Laugh it up, Blondie,” Tony snarked. “This is my baby girl we’re talking about. I’m allowed to worry.”</p><p>The group boarded the train and went about locating an empty compartment.</p><p>“What of the Weasley’s, Father?” Draco asked, curiously.</p><p>“You’re not to worry about them, Dragon. Don’t cause any trouble and mind your manners. The youngest boy will most likely try to insult you. Do not permit yourself to fall for his petty tricks. Is that understood?” Lucius asked with a raised brow.</p><p>Draco nodded, “Yes, Father, I understand. I won’t stoop to their level.”</p><p>“That doesn’t go for pranking, though. Harry, Catlin, as my children, you’re required to prank people. I’m sure your Uncle Sirius would agree. When, not if, you do, make sure it’s in fun, be careful not to cross the line into bullying, or Severus will have all of your heads,” Tony said with a disarming grin that somehow didn’t undermine the seriousness of his words.</p><p>“Of course, Dad,” Harry said with a grin of his own. “I’m sure Cat will be able to convince Severus to assist with any pranks we do wish to do.”</p><p>“I can try,” Cat replied with a giggle.</p><p>“Wonderful! Alright, pull out your trunks so that we can store them in the racks, then it’ll be time for us old folks to be heading out. I’ll inform Loki the next time I see him that you’ve made it to the train without any incidents.” Tony said, holding his hand out for their trunks.</p><p>Draco pulled his trunk out of his pocket and handed it to Tony, who then set it on the seat for Lucius to unshrink with a tap of his wand before levitating it up onto the storage racks. Like a well-oiled machine, they repeated this action with both Harry and Catlin’s trunks.</p><p>“Alright, Dragon. Come give your mother a hug, it’s time for us to go.” Narcissa said with a smile and her arms open.</p><p>“Bye, Mother. I’ll miss you,” Draco said as he gave her a tight hug.</p><p>“We’ll miss you too, my Dragon. Take care of yourselves and stay out of trouble. Harry, dear, be sure that Sarabi stays out of trouble, the same goes for you and Jupiter, Catlin.” Draco’s mother said as she hugged her son, then turned and opened her arms to the other two children.</p><p>“We’ll miss you as well, Aunt Cissa,” Harry said as both he and Catlin gave her a hug before moving on to join Draco in bidding Lucius and Tony goodbye.</p><p>“Be safe and stay in touch,” Tony said as he hugged his daughter. “If trouble does come up, let me know, and I’ll be sure to inform Loki so he can deal with it. Be yourselves, don’t let anyone tell you what you should or shouldn’t do, and remember, I couldn’t care less what house you’re in, understood?” The three children nodded and said their last goodbyes before settling down in their compartment.</p><p>Once they were back on the platform, the three adults stood where they could see their children happily talking amongst themselves in their compartment. “I don’t know about the two of you, but I’m feeling extremely nervous about letting our kids go to that school.”</p><p>“You’re not the only one, Tony,” Lucius assured his friend, “ but we must remember, those three are the Founder’s Heirs. Hogwarts won’t allow any harm to come to them and will, in fact, protect and help them in our stead.” Just then, there was a commotion over by the platform entrance.</p><p>“Is it just me, Gred, or is our dear…” one red-headed boy started.</p><p>“…mother acting strange?” the other, his twin, finished his sentence.</p><p>“Yes,” replied the first.</p><p>“No, Forge, you’re not the only one,” the second boy responded.</p><p>“And who might they be?” Tony asked, curiously.</p><p>“Fred and George Weasley. Magical twins. From what I’ve heard from my work with the Board of Governors, they are geniuses in their own right despite their penchant for causing chaos. Severus agrees although they frustrate him to no end.” Lucius replied.</p><p>“How so?”</p><p>“Despite clearly understanding the material, they do poorly in all of their classes. They have taken up the mantle of Hogwarts’s resident pranksters. Their pranks make use of nearly all the core subjects: Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, and, to a lesser extent, Defense. They target all Houses indiscriminately, and never once have they crossed the line into bullying. Severus fears that they aren’t living up their potential in the classroom as a form of rebellion against their harpy of a mother, Molly. From what I understand, she wants them to get ‘respectable’ jobs at the Ministry and give up their dreams of opening their own joke shop.” Lucius said with a disapproving frown.</p><p>“They sound like my kind of kids,” Tony said, approvingly. “If they ever manage to open their shop, that’s one place I would certainly invest in. Now, who’s that?”</p><p>“Percy Weasley. He is currently the oldest Weasley child still at Hogwarts. Behind him is Ronald Weasley, the youngest Weasley son. He will be a first-year student alongside our children. And there’s Molly, along with her youngest child and only daughter, Ginevra.”</p><p>“She’s the witch with a capital B that wants her daughter to marry Harry,” Tony said with a hint of anger in his voice.</p><p>Narcissa let out a surprised laugh at his description of the Weasley Matriarch. “Yes, that’s one way of putting it.”</p><p>“Hurry up, Ronald! Your brothers are already aboard the train, and you only have five minutes to get on and get settled before it leaves the station!” Molly screeched at the boy.</p><p>“Coming, Mum!” the boy shouted back, struggling a bit as he dragged his trunk behind him.</p><p>“She’s a witch. Has she forgotten that she could shrink his trunk or even levitate it onto the train for him?” Tony asked, shocked by the lack of common sense being displayed by someone who’d been surrounded by magic her whole life.</p><p>“So it would seem.” Lucius drawled, his amusement evident in his voice.</p><p>The three adults turned back to the train and saw their children waving out the window of their compartment as the train began to move. Tony smiled to himself when he heard Harry shout out ‘Dad! I’ll miss you!’ over the noise of the train. “We’ll miss you too! Be safe!” Tony called back. The three parents stood watching as the train cleared the platform, carrying the three heirs to Hogwarts for a whole new adventure, unable to squash the worry they felt for their children.</p>
