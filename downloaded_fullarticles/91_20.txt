    <p>April, 1945.</p><p>"...Don't you think so, Tom?"</p><p>Tom blinked, looking up from his book at the source of the half-heard question. Abraxas was grinning at him; when he had Tom's attention, he gave a subtle nod toward their Defense professor, who was currently demonstrating... something or other. Tom had gotten distracted by marginalia in the book he'd 'borrowed' from the Restricted Section.</p><p>"I believe I missed the first part of your question, my friend," Tom murmured. "Kindly repeat it?"</p><p>Abraxas stifled a laugh in his hand. "I said, the new professor really looks a lot like you when he has his glasses off. Don't you think?"</p><p>"Hm." Tom considered the matter. Professor Potter -- 'not <em> a </em> Potter, though, to be clear' -- had removed his thick-framed, round glasses at some point in the past few minutes and neglected to put them back on. There were a few superficial similarities between them, perhaps, if one discounted the laugh lines in Potter's face and the startling green of his eyes. But then, most magicals in Britain looked alike. Was it really so significant? "I suppose so," Tom acquiesced, returning to his reading on Inferi.</p><p>He had assumed that to be the last he heard on the matter, but not so.</p><p> </p><p>"Professor, Professor," called Walburga Black sweetly as she waylaid Harry in the hallway. "Might I trouble you a moment? There is a small matter-"</p><p>Harry allowed the seventh-year witch to join him in his office, feeling somewhat like he had in his first year with the troll and the bathroom -- except now he was in Hermione's position. Why exactly Dippet had decided to 'let' Harry substitute in as Slytherin Head-of-House for the rest of term, he had no idea, but he hadn't dared refuse when the Headmaster was already letting him stay on as a teacher for the latter term that year.</p><p>Even if he'd had a choice, Harry suspected he'd have accepted, though he couldn't identify his own motivations either.</p><p>Time travel, it seemed, was a hell of a drug.</p><p>Miss Black had already seated herself in one of the visitors' chairs at Harry's desk, which obliged him to sit in his own chair, something Harry was loath to do (it reminded him how much work he had at hand). The barest effort on his part to find out what was the matter yielded answers: it was unusually straightforward of her, actually, which only meant ulterior motives were in play.</p><p>"My friends and I are wondering," the witch batted her eyelashes, and Harry supposed that might have worked in her favor had he not already 'met' her in the future, "if you would object to donning a minor glamor at dinner this evening? We are trying to prove a comparison, but so far only a few have acknowledged its validity."</p><p>Well. That almost sounded interesting enough to try, if a bit weird. (Purebloods, sometimes. Ugh.) Harry leaned back in his chair, the model of patience, and asked, "What is the nature of this glamor, Miss Black, and may I ask what comparison you wish to prove?"</p><p>Walburga uncrossed and re-crossed her legs, a gesture Harry had come to identify as her 'tell', and leaned in, confiding. "Medina-" that is, Medina Mulciber- "thinks you and Tom look a lot alike. We've been trying to point it out to him, but he hasn't taken any notice."</p><p><em> Of course he hasn't, </em> Harry thought. <em> He's busy reading Dark Arts books. </em> Perhaps he was supposed to do something about that, but frankly, what was the point of intervening when he'd already defeated Voldemort in his time? There was no academic reason to call him out; 'Mister Riddle' was at the top of his class. Interference accomplished little save to annoy the young wizard and draw more attention to himself, attention he didn't need if he was going to successfully orchestrate his return to his own time not long from now.</p><p>"If you could glamor your eyes red to match his, we think we can convince him," Walburga was saying.</p><p>(Harry wondered why no one else thought Tom's red eyes were weird.)</p><p>"I suppose I may as well, if it means so much to you," Harry sighed with a small smile, reaching for his wand.</p><p>In the grand scheme of things, what harm could it do?</p><p> </p><p>Abraxas nudged Tom in the ribs with an elbow, gesturing toward the Head Table. Distracted from his perusal of the book in his lap -- later on in the same chapter as earlier -- Tom obliged his friend.</p><p>And froze.</p><p>His future self was sitting at the table, picking at the mashed potatoes on his plate. "That's impossible," Tom said, controlling his expression. It would not do for anyone to see the depth of his shock.</p><p>(How had he not noticed - but then, he <em> was </em> a master of disguise. Or he would be, by then-)</p><p>Abraxas snorted. "So do you believe Walburga now?"</p><p>"You mean, that is-"</p><p>"The professor. He glamored his eyes red."</p><p>Pieces were clicking rapidly into place, though he did not blame Abraxas for not having the same epiphany. Professor Potter, who had abruptly joined the staff on New Year's Day to replace Merrythought for the rest of the year; who had not spared Tom a passing glance, unsurprised even by the exotic color of his eyes; who had apparently brought no personal items with him upon his arrival, given how bare Tom's friends had reported his office to be.</p><p>Tom took in this information, and plotted.</p><p>In the background, his friends shared smiles at having 'convinced' him, with no idea what they had truly brought to light.</p><p> </p><p>"Professor Potter, may I speak with you privately?"</p><p>Tom Riddle stood in the doorway of Harry's office, expression more wide-eyed than Harry could ever recall seeing. Baffled, he nodded, stepping aside to let him into the room.</p><p>Hospitality urged Harry to offer him tea, but he was privately glad Riddle declined. The urgency in the boy's body language was a bit concerning, actually; by force of habit, Harry gathered his magical energy a bit closer to him, ready for a confrontation. He disguised it by making a cup for himself with the tea set he'd borrowed from the kitchens.</p><p>He could feel Riddle's eyes on him the entire time he went through the motions, lingering until Harry turned back to his guest and sat down across from him with his cup. "I don't think I've ever had you in my office," Harry observed with genuine, mild surprise. "What brings you to my office, Mr. Riddle?"</p><p>"You're a time traveller," Riddle stated without preamble, wonder in his voice.</p><p>Harry blinked at him. How had he figured <em> that </em> out? "I am, yes."</p><p>The resulting expression was one Harry would best describe as 'starry-eyed'. "How did I- you- do it? Did we become immortal as planned? And if so, why bother returning?"</p><p>"..Wait," Harry began slowly, "I think you've misunderstood-"</p><p>"-the Unspeakables' fault? Have we produced any heirs, or is that counterproductive to keeping control of the empire?"</p><p>"Wait, Riddle - Tom." Harry held up a hand for silence, halting the rest of the barrage of questions. "It sounds like you think I'm the future version of you, is that right?"</p><p>"Yes, it must be," Tom insisted, "though you're using a different wand than mine-"</p><p>"A brother wand, actually," Harry had to point out, "but I'm not. Us looking alike is coincidental. I <em> am </em> a time traveller from your future, but I'm not you yourself."</p><p>Tom nodded, a calculating shine in his eyes as though he were in on a secret. "Ah, I see. So Tom Riddle is gone, and Lord Voldemort rises-"</p><p>Harry dragged his hand down his face, exasperated. "No, Tom! I'm not you - you're <em> dead!" </em></p><p>That might have been the wrong thing to say.</p>
