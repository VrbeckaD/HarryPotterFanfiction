    <p>Severus methodically put one step in front of the other, his whole body aching. His head was throbbing and his vision flickering dangerously. His magical reserves were nearly completely depleted and his mind was muddled, thoughts sluggish- his reflexes almost non-existent, he found, as he stumbled over a root, falling to the ground without even attempting to catch himself. He gave a low groan of pain and a louder sound of protest when he realised his body was absolutely refusing to stand up.<br/>
'Bugger', he thought, as his vision went dark.</p><p>Poppy Pompfrey snapped her eyes open with a gasp, her hand grasping the burning cold medaillon that she had been wearing ever since a night way back near the start of Severus career at Hogwarts, when the young man had stumbled to her in tears, showing her the Dark Mark and talking about being a spy for the light, apologizing all the way for throwing in his lot with Voldemort. They had talked long into the night and she had demanded a promise of him that he would come to her if he needed help. A few weeks later, they had nearly lost him. He had near splinched himself apparating back from wherever the Death Eaters were meeting, his magic struggling to follow his commands due to prolonged exposure to the cruciatus curse. Hagrid had found him by chance, collapsed in the Forbidden Forest. When she finally released him from the hospital wing, she presented him with a Medaillon, begging him to take it. Their Medaillon's were linked and charmed to alert each other when the other needed help, triggered through a specific thought. Both Medaillons would help the wearer find the other, if it was needed.  It even worked through apparition. She had had to swear an oath to never, ever, follow him to a Death Eater meeting. But Severus wasn't at a meeting. He was on Hogwart's Grounds, within the Forbidden Forest and he needed help. Poppy didn't waste any more time.</p><p>When he woke up, it was to Albus Dumbledore speaking to Poppy and a warm, comfy bed. He supressed an annoyed groan. Of COURSE Albus would be there. The old coot wanted his report, as usual. No thought about giving him time to rest up. It's not like Severus didn't have a method to inform the old man if there was something new. But of course, Albus needed to "check up on him".<br/>
But Severus had no plans to speak to the Headmaster now. An annoyed huff from Poppy, followed by an admonishment to "keep it short" alerted him to the fact that he was about to be disturbed. A wizened hand squeezed his shoulder and Severus fought to keep from tensing as he opened his eyes to meet the twinkling pair of his employer.<br/>
"Severus, my boy."<br/>
"Albus."<br/>
Best get it over with quick. Albus wasn't about to leave empty handed.<br/>
"There's nothing new other that the Dark Lord has decided to take a two week vacation. He wants me to brew a few things for him by the end of the month, the usual," Severus rattled off after a moment's silence.<br/>
"A vacation?" Albus frowned, then brightened.<br/>
"Excellent..." the old man trailed off, looking apologetically at Poppy, who rolled her eyes, vanishing into her office. It was more for show than anything, as Severus was going to tell her anyway. Severus crossed his arms, staring at the Headmaster impassively.<br/>
"Then you'll have time to brew some things for the Order."<br/>
"Again?" Severus asked incredulously.<br/>
"The war effort, my boy." Albus retrieved a crumbled paper, pressing it into his hand.<br/>
"You can start on them tomorrow."<br/>
With that, he left, leaving a fuming Potions Master behind.<br/>
"What did he want?" Poppy returned from her office, settling down on the side of Severus bed and pulling him into a hug.<br/>
"Potions for the Order," Severus replied grumpily, waving the piece of paper at her when she released him.<br/>
"What, again? Already? Those are not even essential potions." She was as incredulous as he was and angry. Though no longer a novelty, coming from her, it nevertheless felt very comforting to feel her angry on his behalf.<br/>
"You need a break."<br/>
"Well, technically speaking, I could just take one," he said slowly, a smirk forming. He didn't quite know where this was coming from, but...<br/>
"Albus can wait a bit for his potions, they're chugging them too fast anyway."<br/>
Poppy saw his smirk and her eyes flashed. A very Slytherin grin formed on her face.<br/>
"Let me guess- you already have those potions in stock, don't you?"<br/>
He nodded.<br/>
"Then I say go for it. He wasn't even going to let you wake up on your own," she said angrily, crossing her arms across her chest, "he needs a reminder that he shouldn't just keep on demanding things. I'll have things covered on the medical end, after all you were badly hurt during that last meeting and you need a break"<br/>
"It's not that bad, is it?" Severus raised a brow, well aware that it wasn't.<br/>
"No, but Salazar knows they're working you raw."<br/>
Severus snickered.<br/>
"I can't believe Albus keeps forgetting you're a Slytherin."<br/>
"Not my problem. Now, sleep."<br/>
"What, I've barely been awake!"<br/>
"Severus..."<br/>
"Yes mom."<br/>
"You're impossible."</p><p>Â </p><p>- the next day -</p><p>Severus was humming to himself, practically dancing through the room as he worked on an experimental potion. The Dark Lord was on vacation, he was on holiday. It had been far too long since he could do something just for himself. It was a personal project he wanted to introduce first to the Potions World and then, providing it got the recognition he was hoping for and funding for a large trial run, he would introduce it to the world. Or rather, his alter ego would. If the Dark Lord ever realized what he was working on here, he would be marked a traitor. His steps slowed momentarily, as he recalled the last traitor in the Inner Circle. He shook his head. The Dark Lord hadn't found out about his duplicity, despite using Legilimency on him while weakening him with various curses. He wouldn't find out about this, either. Also, if it ever came to that, he had long since made plans how to commit suicide even while in the Dark Lords grasp. He had an exit strategy. Firmly, Severus shoved the dark thoughts back into the dark recesses of his mind. It was then that he realized he was about to have a visitor. Albus. He gave a sardonic chuckle, then resumed his work, now completely calm and collected, as he waited for his employer.</p><p>Albus Dumbledore made his way to the dungeons with a spring in his step. Fourteen days. So much could be done in fourteen days. There were a few teachers who hadn't had a vacation in a while and of course, he could try and work on Severus, convince him to take Harry back as his student. Ah, life was good. He knocked on the door to Severus quarters, a smile growing when he got no answer. 
'Already at work- I've always liked his work ethic.' The boy had been an excellent investion. He let himself in.<br/>
"Severus?"<br/>
No answer. Albus swiftly made his way toward the private lab and indeed, as he had thought, the young man was hard at work. Although surprisingly, only one cauldron graced the workplace. That was a little unusual.<br/>
"Severus?" He repeated, with a knock. Severus looked up, a strange expression in his eyes. Ah. Head in the clouds again? Albus smiled genially.<br/>
"Hard at work, my boy?"<br/>
"Yes- no, don't step in. I'll come to you- it needs to simmer for a while now."<br/>
Severus waved his wand, then stepped out of the room.<br/>
"What are you brewing?"<br/>
"Oh, just a fertility potion. Tea?" Severus called back over his shoulder as he made his way to the kitchen. Behind him, Albus was sputtering. Had he heard that right?<br/>
"Excuse me?"<br/>
"Tea?" Severus repeated.<br/>
"Yes, please. I mean, what potion did you say you were making?"<br/>
"A fertility potion. Well, sort of. It's a new potion."<br/>
"But... the Order."<br/>
"Won't need those other potions tonight."<br/>
"Yes but-" Albus trailed off when Severus raised his hand.<br/>
"No buts, Albus. Let people take a break. There won't be any activity in the next two weeks. Now drink your tea." He was sure Severus was struck by some temporary insanity. Or maybe he was dreaming. Well, the tea was good, either way. He would check up on Severus again tomorrow- if he hadn't started on those potions by then, maybe a reminder about their agreement would be in order.</p><p>"The infirmary needs it's potions stock refilled," Albus tried again.<br/>
'Sneaky, Poppy, sneaky.' Severus thought. He knew for an absolute fact that the potions stocks in the infirmary were full.<br/>
"I'm busy. I'll be busy for the foreseable future. At least a week."<br/>
"What could be so important that you can't help out? You're not even doing anything!"<br/>
"Precisely. I am taking a break."</p><p>Severus fought hard to keep from laughing. Who knew baiting Albus could be this funny? A part of him was screaming in panic, shocked at his daring. He watched as Albus drank the spiked drink, entirely unaware that it wasn't just tea. It took only five minutes, then Albus started squirming uncomfortably.<br/>
"Are you okay, Albus? You're looking... off. Did you sleep well?"<br/>
"Quite fine my boy, quite fine. Excuse me."<br/>
With that, Albus left his quarters.</p><p>ALBUS' POV</p><p>- Monday -</p><p>"Morning Albus," Severus greeted, overly cheerful.<br/>
"Good Morning, my boy, have you-" Albus began, but Severus interupted, loudly.<br/>
"Albus. I need your help."<br/>
"Anything. What is it?"<br/>
"Should I get a dog, or a cat? A pet snake is a bit clichee, so I've narrowed it down to those- no, wait! Maybe an owl or..." He trailed off.<br/>
"Severus, whatever are you talking about?"<br/>
"I'm thinking of getting a pet. These rooms get very... lonely. Oh, an eagle would be interesting too."<br/>
"Severus."<br/>
Severus mumbled loudly to himself, throwing a few animal species around, completely ignoring Albus.<br/>
"SEVERUS!"<br/>
"Albus, there's no need to scream like that. Yes?" Severus said innocently.<br/>
"I need you to-"<br/>
"No."<br/>
"Excuse me?"<br/>
"Whatever you were gonna say, the answer is no. I'm taking a break."<br/>
"But, I need you to chaperone-"<br/>
"Minerva and Flitwick will do just fine."<br/>
"But Severus, you can't take a break!"<br/>
"I am."<br/>
"Severus. Need I remind you that you promised me anything?"<br/>
"No need. I remember."<br/>
"So?"<br/>
"So?"<br/>
"During the holidays? How many students are staying again?"<br/>
"Enough."<br/>
"Exactly- I need a break. And I'm taking it. Either way, I can't just start another potion. The experimental one is at a critical stage."<br/>
"But we need you."<br/>
"I haven't taken a long leisurely stroll lately. I think I'll visit the Squid today. Or Hagrid."<br/>
"You can go to Hogsmeade. The children will be-"<br/>
"Fine with another chaperone, I'm sure. Why don't you take them?"<br/>
"The Order..."<br/>
"You're not making any sense now, Albus. What's the Order got to do with this?"<br/>
"Severus, I am ORDERING you."<br/>
"No. I'm busy."<br/>
"I could fire you."<br/>
"Yes you could. But you're not going to. Poppy would file a complaint. Because, you see, I am only following her orders. She says I'm going to die if I don't take a break."<br/>
"I'll be having words with Poppy."<br/>
"Oh, okay. Could you ask her whether she is free this afternoon?"<br/>
"Severus..." Albus looked helplessly at him, sighing.</p><p>- a week later-</p><p>"Please, Severus, I'm begging you! We need your help," a completely dissheveled Albus tried.<br/>
Silence.<br/>
"Severus?"<br/>
A note lay on the table.<br/>
'I'm out. Don't expect me back until noon on Thursday.'</p><p>- Thursday -</p><p>Albus was almost afraid to go to the dungeons. Severus had been utterly unpredictable the last week. He had also been very uncooperative, lazing about instead of working. Hogwarts was utter chaos. The Weasley Twins had pranked the whole of Slytherin. They were all wearing pink tutus now- and had begun hexing anything and everyone in a rage.<br/>
"Albus!" Severus bounced up toward him. Albus dropped the applepie he'd gotten from Molly to appease Severus, running as fast as he could.</p><p>SEVERUS POV</p><p>- Monday -</p><p>Severus bit the inside of his cheek, hard, to keep from laughing at the overly cautious way Albus edged into his rooms. The hallucigenic potion he had slipped the old man yesterday had apparently worked. Albus didn't look as if he had slept particularly well.<br/>
"Good Morning Albus. You're not looking too good. Can I help you?"<br/>
"Are you ready to brew those potions now?"<br/>
"What potions?"<br/>
"For the infirmary."<br/>
"The infirmary is fully stocked, Albus. Why would I brew more now?"<br/>
"You brewed them?"<br/>
"Yes, of course, last month. Are you ok?"<br/>
"Fine, fine." Albus replied faintly, sinking into a chair, head in his hands.<br/>
"Here, drink this."<br/>
He handed Albus a slip of paper.<br/>
"Poppy gave me this. She threatened bodily harm if I didn't give it to you." Albus went a sickly pale color.<br/>
"Albus?"<br/>
"This this says you're to be on sick leave for the next week." Albus' voice was actually shaking. Maybe the potion had been a bit much.<br/>
"Yeah, I know. Apparently, I came very close to dying this time. At least the Dark Lord is on vacation until Saturday evening in two weeks."<br/>
"What are you talking about? It's Monday."<br/>
"Yes, I know. Poppy released me yesterday."<br/>
Albus stared at him. Then he cast a tempus. He shook his head, cast it once more.<br/>
"Albus?"<br/>
"Excuse me. I need to lie down."</p>
