  <strong>Chapter 1</strong>
</p><p>Suddenly they were in. The flat was still and felt heavy with dust. Of course, it had been months now since it was last occupied. Hesitantly they walked in and placed their bags on the floor. Hermione searched in her bag and produced two mugs, which she placed decisively on the countertop, by the kettle. Draco went down the hall with his hands in his pockets, one clutching his wand, to investigate which bedroom was the better. He peered into one, a room painted dirty magnolia, and then the other, a duck-egg blue. He noted the double bed in the blue room and the better view from the window of the magnolia.</p><p>Now in the living area, Hermione placed a hand over a part of the wall which looked damp. Paint flecks came away on her fingertips. She stood, looked around her. It was a roof, she thought, trying to smile. When Draco walked into the room and caught her eye, she noticed the resigned disappointment on his face. Mustering civility in voice and expression, she asked if he would like some tea. He refused.</p><p>The first evening in the new flat was dreary. The hallway light didn’t work, the kettle was filled with limescale, and Hermione’s wardrobe contained the sad remains of an old woollen scarf harbouring a moth infestation. She and Malfoy scarcely exchanged two words. Instead, each felt drained, grey, tired. After some attempts to make the flat feel lived in they gave up and retreated to their rooms, unapologetic, needing to be alone. Despite all that happened, they hadn’t felt quite so vulnerable in a long while. After the tent, the walls around them were disconcerting. Draco couldn’t hear Hermione as she turned pages noisily, or her heavy footsteps. Hermione almost missed Draco’s rustling, snarling presence. Her room was dim and a light drizzle was frosting the window.</p><p>They woke up within half an hour of each other, but Draco was the first to try the shower. Hermione unpacked some essentials from the beaded bag but left most of its contents inside, still edgy, still needing to know she could run if she needed to. She threw a jumper over her old pyjamas and headed to the kitchen for a cup of tea, reminding herself to breathe. As she went past the bathroom she heard the shower curtain crackle and the water hitting the basin, and Draco exclaiming ‘Fuck’ under his breath. Hermione smiled: the water was either too hot or too cold. At least she knew for later.</p><p>The living area and kitchen looked marginally more inviting in the morning light. There was sun coming through the window and onto the table, and Hermione noted the shelving unit near the front door. She put down her tea and fetched some books and a poster from her room. She put the books on the shelf and the poster, an old Penguin cover of Jane Eyre, on the wall opposite with a sticking charm. Then she changed the colour of the curtains from their grey and red to a clean off-white. Feeling better, she sat back on the sofa and tried to convince herself that this was home now.</p><p>Draco, feeling clean, albeit a little raw from the scalding water, dressed in the comfiest outfit he brought with him: jeans and a crisp t-shirt. He had never owned a pair of slouchy tracksuit bottoms, and didn’t mean to start now. He had changed the wall from magnolia to white last night, but in the light of day he felt keen to experiment. He changed the wall in which the wide window was set to a pale yellow, then to a rosy pink, and settled on a cool grey. The carpet cast off its murky blue behind in favour of a fresher, deeper midnight hue. He looked out of the window for a little while. He saw fields beyond the small garden, shared between the six flats of the building. Beyond the fields were clumps of trees, not quite congealed together enough to be called woods. He was glad he chose this room: Hermione’s faced onto the road by which the flats were reached, and he still couldn’t get used to seeing cars all the time. The fields before him reminded him of home. Real home.</p><p>Making for the kitchen and some breakfast, Draco took with him a platter he pinched from home, silver on the outside and red on the inside, and his coat. If he had to live in this dump, he would damn well hang it up next to the door. It was a dump, but it was his dump, after all. He didn’t think of Granger except to hope that she wasn’t in the kitchen.</p><p>When they saw each other they looked away, the shadow of a greeting smile on their lips. It was formality, nothing more. They may have missed the noises made by another person last night, but this was day. Draco didn’t speak as he hung up his coat and placed his platter on the table. Hermione sipped tea pointedly. Draco glanced at the newly shelved books but made no comment. So they had both staked their claim.</p><p>Instinctively Draco opened the cupboard next to the fridge.</p><p>“We don't have any food,” Hermione said from the sofa.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>For a few moments nobody spoke.</p><p>“I’ll go and get some later. Write down what you want, let’s make a list. Got any galleons— pounds?”</p><p>Hermione finished her tea, got up.</p><p>“I have a notebook somewhere, hang on,” she said, feeling stupid.</p><p>Her voice tailed away into nothing, absorbed by Draco’s silence.</p><p>“How much d’you need?” asked Draco when she returned with pen and paper.</p><p>“£20 should do it. Just to be safe.”</p><p>Nothing from Draco.</p><p>“I’ll keep the receipt, obviously. Anyway, there’s no point in stealing from you, now that we, you know. Live together.”</p><p>“Ever the honourable Gryffindor, Granger.”</p><p>Hermione glanced at him, but his face was impassive. She decided to change the subject. A week in the tent taught her that if there was anything sure to ignite him, it was backchat. It was difficult to get anything done when he was angry. Another deep breath.</p><p>“Also, we should think about work. Yeah Malfoy, work. I know you’re rolling in wizard gold, but we can’t afford to change much of that at a time. Like we talked about.”</p><p>“I remember, thanks. And why are you assuming I won’t work?”</p><p>“Have you ever?”</p><p>For the first time since yesterday, they looked each other in the face, challenging. She could see the irritation in his eyes.</p><p>“It’s not my fault I’ve never needed to. Merlin knows if there’s a muggle job worth my while. I’ll start looking soon.”</p><p>“You know, I think you’d make a good plumber.”</p><p>“Your talent for humour always takes my breath away. I will not be picking plums, Granger.”</p><p>Hermione smiled discreetly.</p><p>In preparation for the shopping trip Hermione dropped two blonde hairs into a couple of inches of poly, watched it turn a dull raspberry colour and downed it like a shot. Tangy. She went to the bathroom in her dressing gown and watched the mirror sink slowly down the wall as she grew five inches taller. She nearly bumped into Draco as she crossed back into her bedroom, and smiled involuntarily at the second of surprise he always displayed when he saw Ava. Enjoying her alter ego’s sinewy body, feeling cat-like, Hermione dressed in a pair of slim jeans and a light jacket.</p><p>Draco marched into the kitchen with rarely seen speed when she returned from the supermarket.</p><p>“Where’s my stuff?” he asked, looking into the bags on the floor while Hermione filled the kettle for another cup of tea. Draco took things out of the bags and put them on the countertop, a jumbled mess of groceries and toothpaste, shampoo and onions and pasta. Hermione watched him through narrowed eyes.</p><p>“We have cupboards you know,” she said finally, arms crossed. Draco stopped, one hand in a bag, the other clutching a bar of Galaxy Caramel.</p><p>“I don't see you putting anything away. Where’s the brie?”</p><p>“Well, I’m not turning the kitchen into a war zone, either. They ran out of brie.”</p><p>Hermione pulled some change out of her pocket and handed it to Draco, along with the receipt. He took it and studied it.</p><p>“What the fuck is ‘JS SEL &amp; VIT ACE 60’?”</p><p>“Vitamins.”</p><p>“Vitamins?”</p><p>“You know, like Madam Pomfrey’s general health draft, except a bit less... Potent.”</p><p>“Shit muggle knock-off?”</p><p>“Not at all, they still work. No need for snobbery, Malfoy.”</p><p>“Me, snobby? Tip of the dungheap, muddy.”</p><p>“You agreed not to call me that!”</p><p>“I’m hungry, okay? You took a bloody age getting this crap and half of it’s not even here. I’m going to have breakfast now. With your permission, of course.”</p><p>Hermione didn’t fail to catch the sarcasm in his tone, and looked at him with equal iciness. Although she was hungry, she would rather get out of the kitchen until Draco had gone back to his room.</p><p>“Your word evidently counts for fuck all, Malfoy. Permission granted,” she replied.</p><p>Back in her room, Hermione fumed silently. One day into leasing the flat, after almost no time, they were bickering again. Malfoy was insufferable and unreasonable, she thought to herself. He was unpredictable and techy, mulish and irritating. Did his parents never teach him to help around the house? Had he ever done his own washing? Cooked his own meals? Wiped the table? Hermione was adamant that she wouldn’t be cleaning up after him. Poor, spoiled Malfoy would have to learn that himself, and darned if she was going to coach him every step of the way. They were the same age, for god's sake, twenty; more than old enough to be self-sufficient. But Hermione checked herself, picturing Malfoy’s parents: that perfect, manicured, blonde pair. Of course they had taught him that he was above all that drudgery. They didn’t keep house elves to show them a good time. He was a baby, Hermione thought. He was a stupid, arrogant baby. She could almost feel sorry for him. Almost.</p><p>She removed the concealing charm she had cast over a picture of Crookshanks, and her parents gazed back at her, smiling patiently as Hermione, aged seven, tried to make the camera work. A sweet pang of sadness pierced her stomach. She remembered drying while her dad washed, dropping handfuls of diced carrot into the pot and hearing them plop into the water. Self-reliance was something she had taken for granted. Her parents had shown her what it was to be capable. It certainly wasn’t a smooth road however, Hermione thought with a grin, recalling the look on her mother’s face when she had refused point blank, aged ten, to clean her bedroom.</p><p>A nasty rhythmic screeching noise from the kitchen jerked Hermione back from memory lane. Draco had set the fire alarm off.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Hermione asked him, raising her voice above the noise. Draco was holding a pan, its charred contents smoking copiously.</p><p>“Come on, Granger, I thought you were supposed to be clever. I’m cooking,” hissed Draco, a slightly wild look in his eyes as he registered the damage he had done to his breakfast. His face was pale except for the pink blotches on his cheeks showing up livid and angry. Hermione rolled her eyes and opened the nearest window, then pulled out her wand. Soon the smoke began to dissipate, billowing through the window, ushered out by Hermione’s charm. Draco filled the sink with water and dropped the pan in it, bacon and all. Spitting and sizzling, the bacon was extinguished and immediately banished to a watery grave. The fire alarm was silent at last.</p><p>“Have you ever... Cooked before?” asked Hermione tentatively. Draco ran his hands through his hair, exasperated.</p><p>“I didn’t expect it to be so... Hot,” he said, drawing a shaking hand across his brow.</p><p>Hermione failed to repress a grin. Draco caught sight of her expression and immediately flared up again.</p><p>“You can get off your high fucking hippogriff, alright?” “I didn’t say anything.” “I can just hear your stupid thoughts, Miss Perfect. So I’ve never had to cook before, ha ha ha.”</p><p>“Oh, get over yourself, Malfoy. Who cares if mummy served up three meals a day? All I care about is that the flat’s still standing tomorrow.”</p><p>Draco stepped towards Hermione, threatening. The sweat on his face made him look ill. The smell of burning began to get to Hermione, and she opened the window wider. Draco suddenly brought his face close to hers.</p><p>“I don't need you lording it over me in my own flat, muddy. And don't you dare bring my mother into it. Ever. Do you understand me?”</p><p>Hermione didn’t like the look in Malfoy’s eyes. Hungry and hot, he was the worst version of himself he had been in a long while, perhaps since they began to live alongside each other. Although she longed to retaliate, to prove him wrong, to remind him that it was her flat too, she stopped herself. This was not the way to begin, she reminded herself. He was a trying bastard, but she had managed a week with him in a tent already, with minimal duelling. Someone needed to be the bigger person, and although Hermione felt a hot wave of indignation swell up into her throat, she choked it back down. Now was not the time. It would be like stamping on a wasps’ nest.</p><p>Draco himself was finding controlling his anger difficult, as he always had. The humiliation of burning the breakfast he was so looking forward to eating was causing himself to forget the promise he made: arguing with Granger, getting under her skin, challenging her: it was useless. They had always been bitter enemies, on the basis of her friendship with Potter; but also, as he later understood, because of her blood status. He could almost hear his father’s voice, urging him to look past her, not to waste time hating her. True, he had said, all those born of muggle blood are to be despised, but with cold indifference rather than with real fire. Your hatred and your passion should be reserved for those who do you terrible wrong. Why had Draco always felt that the gaze with which his father regarded him was tinged with regret? Or even disgust?</p><p>Draco turned to the matter at hand, dismissing Hermione from his mind, albeit with difficulty. The pan was burned and the bacon had stuck fast to it. Rather than take soap and sponge to it, Draco plucked it out of the water by its handle and hurled it through the open window, not waiting to see it land on the ground below.</p>
