    <p>Calidara Nefzen went by 'Malfoy' to her friends. The twelve year old girl had taken to wearing her fine white-blond hair in a fish-bone braid and was considering asking her adoptive parents if she could put purple streaks in it.</p>

<p></p><div>
  <p>Her cousin, Draco, thought this was a terrible idea and told her why in a four page letter which mostly said the words 'rubbish', 'low-born', and 'ugly' over and over in varying sentence structure. Her friends, Fred and George Weasley, who were older twin boys that enjoyed themselves thoroughly, thought it was an amazing idea, one going so far as to say she'd look 'hot with purple hair'.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Her friend Harry Potter gave no response to either of the letters she sent him over the first month of vacation, prompting her to worry about his horrible Muggle family and how they were treating him. So, while her parents were at work, she hopped on a train at Waterloo Station and rode the half hour to Surrey.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Number four Privet Drive was a small, boxy house on a street filled with other identical boxy houses. She walked up to the door, eyes falling on the bars holding tight outside of a second-floor window. She knocked, politely, on the door and waited. A tall, skinny woman opened the door. She looked absolutely baffled to see the small blond girl on her front step. "Good morning!" Callie said, smiling.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"If you're selling something-" The woman started, a large boy with honey colored hair coming up behind her. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Oh, I'm not selling anything. I'm here to see Harry."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Who?" The woman squeaked. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Harry Potter. He lives here, right? Used to live under those stairs."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You're one of his freaks, aren't you?" The round boy accused.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I think you mean 'friends'." Callie said, smiling.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"We'll not have your kind here." The angular woman said, sticking her nose up.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You're his Aunt Petunia, right? Which makes you Dudley." Callie said, smiling as she pushed past the woman to smile at the round boy.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You get out of my house!" Petunia exclaimed.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"No, see, I'm here to see the boy who's up on the second floor with the bars on his window, and you should know better than to make a witch angry."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You can't do magic outside of school. You can't do a thing to-"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Petunia stopped speaking as Callie pulled a small vial out of her jacket. "There's a loophole for every law, isn't there? This is mine. See, the Ministry doesn't count potions as a traceable form of magic because even Muggles can use them once they're brewed. This one is called 'The Draught of Living Death', basically gives you leprosy. Of course, I took the antidote as a precaution when I was making it, so if I were to toss this on the ground the only ones affected would be you and dear Duddykins." She concealed the bottle in her palm and smiled, politely, at Petunia Dursley. "Or, we could act like civilized Britons and you could send dear Dudley to go let Harry out of his room so I could spend a day with my friend."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Duddy, go let Harry out."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"But Dad said-"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Dudley, go let Harry out!" The woman's voice went shrill and the boy ran up the stairs.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry walked down the stairs, confused for a moment before his eyes fell on Calidara. He ran down the rest of the way. "Callie! What are you doing here?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Threatening your family with consequences of their terrible acts. Walk with me?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Definitely." Harry said, rushing past Petunia. As they walked out of the house, Petunia slammed the door behind them. "They know we can't use magic. How'd you threaten them?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>She produced the vial and showed it to him. "Told them it was 'Draught of Living Death', which is actually an extreme sleeping potion, but they don't need to know that."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"And <em>is </em>that-"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Perfume I got from my mum for my birthday." She said, with a smirk. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Brilliant." Harry said, with a smile. "So, what are you doing all the way out here in Surrey?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I got worried. I sent you two letters and the owl came back like they'd been delivered but I never got a response."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry shook his head. "I never got them. There was a house elf named Dobby who was stealing my mail." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Weird. I thought maybe Athena misdelivered them... which was weird because she's had no problems getting letters to Draco and Fred and George." She shrugged. "Can't believe they've locked you away again. Terrible people."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"They were being <em>okay </em>until Dobby showed up and clued them in to the fact that I can't do magic outside of school. So, they locked me in my room, said I wasn't going to school."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well, at least I was able to get you a day pass. And when I get home I <em>will </em>call in the cavalry. The Weasley boys won't stand for you starving in a home cell."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well, it's good that you're here. I thought you were still mad at me."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well, if you'd gotten my letters, you'd know I've forgiven you. I understand that I'm going to have to prove and re-prove myself as a good person. It's just a fact of my life."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Not to me. Not ever again. I know that you're a good person. You came all this way just to check on me." </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Come on. I've been babysitting my neighbors son the whole summer, so I have a bit of money saved up. Let's get you some curry or something."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>As the sun started to go down, Calidara walked Harry back to Privet Drive, a little nervous about him having to go back. "I promise that I will write to Fred as soon as I get home. They're already worried about you, too, and once I tell them your family is locking you away and starving you... they're sure to help."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Thank you for an amazing day, Callie. Even if the Weasleys don't show-"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"They will." She smiled, pulling her perfume out of her pocket. "Do you want the perfume?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Harry laughed. "No. I think I'll be okay. Thanks. I'll see you on the train?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Of course." She smiled, then hugged him. "Be safe. Don't let those... ridiculous Muggles hurt you."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>~~</p>
</div><div>
  <p>It was a week later when she received a letter, carried by the snowy owl Hedwig. It said Harry had, indeed, been rescued by the Weasleys... in a flying car, no less. He was happy, excited for school and they were planning to go to Diagon Alley for supplies on Wednesday should she want to meet up with them. She immediately wrote to Draco to extend the invitation onward.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Her parents insisted on going with her this time, they hadn't liked her buying her own supplies for the first year. Wednesday morning found them in Gringotts, converting pounds to Galleons. She figured they'd go find Harry and the Weasleys after, but she didn't have to wait. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything?" A redheaded man near the entrance said.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"No, he was selling-" Harry said.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"So he's worried. Oh, I'd love to get Lucius Malfoy for something..."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You be careful, Arthur, that family's trouble. Don't go biting off more than you can chew-" A redheaded woman responded.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"So you don't think I'm a match for Lucius Malfoy?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"What's that about Lucius Malfoy?" She asked, stepping up to them.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Callie!" George exclaimed.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"My pally!" Fred rhymed.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"This is Calidara?" The redheaded woman asked with a small smile, an undertone of nervousness in her words.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Yes, ma'am. You must be Fred and George's mum. It's brilliant to meet you." Callie responded, offering her hand to the woman. Mrs. Weasley took it and clasped it between her hands. "These are my parents, Jemma and Edward Nefzen."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Her parents wasted no time moving from Mrs. Weasley to Hermione's parents, who Callie introduced as Drs. Granger, ("they're dentists!") while Mrs. Weasley examined her. "Well, I don't know what you were talking about, Ronald. She doesn't look evil, to me." The woman said, smiling brightly. "I rather think your brothers are right."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Have you gone mad, mum?" George asked in a conspiratorial tone.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You can't say things like that aloud! You're going to ruin our reputations!" Fred finished.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Callie giggled. "Ron and Hermione don't like me, much, Mrs. Weasley. I'd like to think it's because of my family ties, but I'm sure my attitude was a contribution. I had a bad time after finding out about my birth parents and I took it out on Hermione, and Ron seems to hate anything to do with the Malfoys but that seems to come honestly." She smiled, brightly at the woman. "Of course, my uncle and cousin haven't done anything to tide those feelings!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Well, I suppose being raised with Muggles gave you a bit more down-to-earth humanity. Didn't mean that to sound so rude."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Oh, I'm sure it's true. There is a reason my mum gave me the Nefzens before she went crazy on my uncle and there is a reason she went crazy on my uncle." She looked over at her parents and the Grangers being pulled into an enthusiastic conversation with Arthur Weasley. "Oh, guess my parents have made friends with your husband."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Arthur does like Muggles. It's why he works in The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office." Mrs. Weasley said as Arthur insisted the two Muggle couples join him for a drink at the Leaky Cauldron. After confirming with Callie that she'd be all right hanging with her friends while they had a drink with Arthur, her parents went off with the redheaded man. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"We saw Lee around earlier, I'll bet we could find him." George said, as they stepped out onto the marble steps outside Gringotts. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"We'll all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks." Mrs. Weasley said, as Fred, George and Callie rushed toward the joke shop. "And not one step down Knockturn Alley!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"What's Knockturn Alley?" Callie asked as they passed Quality Quidditch Supplies. "Ooh, can we go in there? Just real quick?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Are you going for the team this year?" Fred asked.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I am, actually." She said, pushing open the door.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"So, what are you looking to get? Some gloves, a helmet?" George asked.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Fred picked up a pair of goggles by the door and held them up to his eyes. "A stylish pair of eye coverings?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"A broom!" She answered, walking over to the broom racks.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Your parents gave you enough money for a broom?" The twins asked, a bit crestfallen.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"No." She turned to them, indignantly. "I babysat my neighbor's bratty two year old all Summer, and sold my famous fudge at the farmers market every Tuesday morning, just so that I could come in here and buy a broomstick. If I buy used, I might even be able to buy a care kit for it."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Fred and George's eyes widened as she pulled out a bag of Galleons. "How good is your fudge?" They asked.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I did say it was famous." She said, proudly. "I could make it in my sleep, I made so much of it this Summer. All so that I could buy this!" She said, walking up to a used Comet 260 sitting on a rack in the corner of the store. The tag on it read '19 Galleons'. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Bloody Hell, Callie. You can afford that?" Fred seemed a bit distressed.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Barely. There's 21 Galleons in this purse." She said, admiring the broom.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Care kit's only 10 knuts." George said, picking a kit up. </p>
</div><div>
  <p>"So you'll have plenty left for candy and fireworks." Fred snapped out of his upset to smile at her. "Well? What are your waiting for? Pick up your broom!"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Comets are pretty good. Better than our CleanSweeps, anyway." George encouraged as the trio walked up to the register. "'Course, ours are ancient."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Marcus Flint would be crazy not to have you on his team, you know?" </p>
</div><div>
  <p>As they walked toward the joke shop, her broom slung across her back by a thin strap, she enjoyed the jingle of her leftover money. "So, who's this git Lockhart who wrote all our Defense Against the Dark Arts books?"</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Oh, to live in the Muggle world." George responded, wistfully.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Where that man's face isn't on everything from cookbooks to pest-control guides." Fred rolled his eyes. "He's pretty, so witches think he's brilliant."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"You'll probably fall for his wavy hair and perfect smile, too." Lee Jordan was suddenly beside them. "All the witches do."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>Fred rolled his eyes again. "Callie's too smart for that."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"I dunno. Think my mum's pretty smart and she's gone mad for his books."</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"So, our new teacher is a fan, which means we get to hear Lockhart's praises all year." Callie concluded.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Unfortunately." The twins answered.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>"Great."</p>
</div>
