    <p>
  <span>Harry is laying down on the couch from last night’s concert in a hotel room, he have a steampunk top hat and matching goggles on his forehead, black unzipped tights, and a pair of steampunk gloves. His eyeliner is ruined and black lipstick is ruined as well.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He’s topless with tattoos, a stag and a doe kissing on his left upper arm. A werewolf hugging a normal wolf on the right upper arm, a pair of socks on the forearm. On his right shoulder is Jack Russell Terrier and the left is an Otter. The letter F and G are on the back on his neck. On his left upper back is an Hare in a crescent. The other side is a remembrall in behind the gryffindor sword. There is a smiling black dog between the two above the white doe on the lake. Next to that doe is a phoenix holding pair of half-moon glasses in its beak. On the other side of the doe, is a tabby cat sitting down on a stack of books. On the front of his hand is a roadkilled toad in a ruined pink dress, on his other hand is a crushed beetle with jeweled glasses. On the chest where is heart is, is a lovely horse.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> A pair of leather boots with several buckles are laying down on the floor along with the dirty steampunk-style trench coat and a dress shirt covered in beer stains.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He feel a poking on his head and hears laughing. He gets up with a pounding in his head as he put on his goggles to see... He smiles weakly at the little boy smiling at him while a middle-aged woman give Harry a stern look and a young man glared at him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Good morning Ted, Jackie and Roberto” he said weakly as he slowly gets up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh bloody hell...” Harry said softly winching from his hangover as he vomits in the trash can.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hi Daddy” said the kid happily, innocent of what’s happening to his godfather.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did you had fun last night, sir?” said Roberto, Harry’s servant and an American wizard, sarcastically.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Harry rolled his eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You should be more careful next time young man” said Jackie, Ted’s nanny &amp; witch from USA as well angrily. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jackie gives Harry a potion to cure his hangover, he drinks it and a minute later he feels much better.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sorry about that ma’am...the concert was really crazy last night and in the backstage, I didn’t remember what happened after drinking that </span>
  <b>
    <em>my special juice</em>
  </b>
  <span> with the dancers and those girls I’ve bring backstage...” said Harry as he laughs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Roberto facepalm while Jackie rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can I have some your special juice?” asked Ted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“When you’re older Ted” said Harry laughing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Jackie and Roberto sighs.</span>
