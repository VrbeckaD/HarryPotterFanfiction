  <span>“Ron I’m home,”  Hermione called as she looked through the day’s owls.  She noted the light was on in the bedroom so even though her boyfriend didn’t answer the call she headed in that direction as she shifted through the papers.  “Harry sent us a pos…” She stopped when she glanced up seeing the man standing in her bedroom was </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> the redhead she had been expecting, but a tall man with jet black hair and a smooth smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Welcome home Hermione,”  Tom said as if her walking in on him hastily packing her clothes into a bag was a perfectly reasonable thing for her to walk in on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She moved to draw her wand, but Tom already had his out, and a strange purple light hit her directly in the chest.  Hermione gasped as the shock hit her, but nothing seemed to happen for a moment. She frowned in confusion as slowly the world started to grow around her.  Her wand slipped from her fingers, but before she could see what was going on something came up over her head and blocked her vision.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry, pet.” She heard Tom say, but his voice sounded odd.  “I’ll turn you back to normal as soon as you learn to be a good girl.”  He added with amusement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt hands grasp her and she tried to yell and pull away, only she was stuck inside something she couldn’t quite understand.  Everything felt off and weird, and she was having problems thinking straight. Tom shoved her into a small space of some kind, and she heard the click of metal against metal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now to make that idiot boyfriend of yours think you left him.”  He said thoughtfully.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione wiggled out of whatever had been holding her and looked out at her surroundings.  She frowned as the cramped space seemed both familiar and utterly alien. She could see Tom working on collecting her things from the room, but everything looked so much bigger than it should.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Meow?”  She asked and was shocked by her voice.  She looked down at herself and saw fur and paws.  He turned her into a </span>
  <em>
    <span>cat</span>
  </em>
  <span>!  Everything clicked into place, from her view of the world to the fact things were looking void of color, but somehow brighter at the same time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She started to pace the cat carrier that he had put her inside, and she realized the thing that had around her before as her shirt.  She hissed at it, and she hissed again when he heard him chuckle at her reaction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry my pet.”  He said in a soothing voice.  “I have things all set up for you at my place.”  With that, he picked up the carrier, and she had to lay down not to be too jostled.  She started to meow as much as she could, maybe one of their neighbors could help her get out of the ridiculous situation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He made it with her all the way to the Apparition Point down the street from the apartment she shared with Ron.  She had been on side-along apparitions before of course, but she felt doing it as a cat in a carrier was not going to be fun at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was right to be worried, as the moment they made threw she felt sick in a very odd way.  Throwing up as a cat was nothing like doing it as a human and she was not pleased as he jostled her around while she felt so sick.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time the thing stopped moving she had gotten her sick on her fur, and when his face came into view she just wanted to use her claws on his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Welcome to your new life, Hermione.  We're going to have so much fun together, my pet.”</span>
