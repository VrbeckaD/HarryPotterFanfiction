    <p align="left">Dying so spontaneously sucked, its not all that surprising I <em>always</em> felt as if I would die young, but that's not what got me it was my books, the <em>fanfiction</em>, I had so many more books to read not to mention those (evil) cliffhangers and now I'll <em>never</em> know! The horror! </p><p align="left">Though I'll never be positive or sure about how I ended up in the Potterverse (considering I'm more of an otaku) its probably because it was one of my last thoughts. (I feel completely justified in this opinion, I mean, <em>it</em> happened in <em>fanfiction</em> and I already believed in the multiverse theory so its not out of the realm of possibility that my thoughts or intent were sent out into the universe - or something like that - and the released energy directed itself there and latched onto the closest desired intent (ex: human being but a magical one considering my intent) for survival.</p><p align="left">Or its something else, I mean magic <em>exists</em> so who knows what kind of fuckery it could be?) </p><p align="left">Anyway I was pretty bumbed out when after <em>dying</em> and leaving all those wonders<strong> </strong><u></u><strong><strike>(and my family I loved them <em>soo</em> much)</strike></strong> too suddenly regain cognitive awareness in a <em>foreign</em> house with flying fucking dishes and a unsettling feeling of <em>not right.</em><strike></strike></p><p align="left">And since I'm a<em> </em>paranoid bitch I immediately took stock of my surrounding's, determining I was alone I looked at myself before internally freaking the fuck out because I'm a black - latina and proud of it dammit with pretty caramel tanned skin <strong>not</strong> white wrinkled skin!</p><p align="left">Seeing a hallway I rush down looking for a mirror, easily finding one, I check my appearance seeing <strong><em>Molly- fucking -Weasley</em></strong> staring back at me.</p><p align="left">Immediately cursing under my breath I take off back into the kitchen to check the features of what seems to be 'The Burrow'. It's, I hesitate to say, <em>nice</em> but messy and there's a lot of clashing colors and as an artist I feel <em>offended</em> but that's not important right now, I hear a set of feet upstairs and as I check the living room I see an apron with a stic-- wand in the pocket. As I grab it I feel a tiny tingle and then suddenly I'm bombarded by all this information.</p><p align="left">(<em>"Mummy! Brother pulled my hair!" "Molly's lying!"

"Mum! Is lunch ready?" Ginny called out, not knowing I check in the kitchen and see that Molly had lunch already set up.</p><p align="left">"Yes, sweetheart! It's ready!", I say already getting her seat ready and clearing the rest of the table. I really didn't know how to feel and not wanting to seem suscpicious I do my best to act as Molly and wrap my head around my new reality.</p>
