    <p>“Bill, the Potters are coming over tonight. I need you to take care of Cassie for Lily.” Molly looked at her eldest son. Bill Weasley was going to be 10 years old soon. </p>
<p>“Mum, what about Charlie? I have...4 others to take care of too.” Bill left out Charlie from the equation. He was probably going to read about dragons in his room anyways.</p>
<p>“Please Bill? She’s just a baby. She’s a few few older than Ron is.” Arthur looked at Bill. </p>
<p>“Alright…” The sound of fire roaring up in the fireplace brought everyone’s attention to the couple walking into the Burrow.</p>
<p>While Bill might say it was annoying, he absolutely loved taking care of children, eve if she or he wasn’t his siblings.  His favourite was by far Cassiopeia Lily Potter. He absolutely loved the girl. She never cried when he showed up, she would cry to see him. Not as much as she did for her <em>Uncoo Moony</em> or <em>Uncoo Padfoo</em>, but she it still mad his 10 year old heart melt. </p>
<p>“Good evening Molly.” Lily Potter smiled brightly to the large Weasley family. “We thought we might come a bit earlier. Cassiopeia has been dying to come see William and Charles.” The Potter’s only child, a daughter with her father’s hair and her mother’s eyes cooed at her name.</p>
<p>Bill couldn’t help but smile at the infant as he took the girl from Lily and James. He didn’t have a sister, but this one was cute. Whether his mother would have another son in a few weeks, he could only guess. 6 sons was a lot. Heaven forbid Molly Weasley have a seventh. </p>
<p>“Come here.” Bill mumbled as Cassie grabbed his finger and giggled. This time, his hair would be saved from the pulling and yanking. “Mum, I’ll be in the sitting room.” Bill told his parents as they waved him off. He held the child in his arms as he made his way to his mother’s rocking chair and sat down, placing the small girl in his arms and onto his lap, flush against him. “You’re cute, you. You know that?” </p>
<p>Cassie giggled and attempted to yank his long red hair that was usually kept behind his shoulder. Bill quickly moved his hair out of reach. Long hair was a pain when there was a baby around. This child was turning a year old in a few days. </p>
<p>The Potter family often came to visit his family, and more often than not, Bill got to take care of the young girl. He loved his little task. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The night of Halloween</p>
<p>“Mum! the Potters left this here from last night.” Bill showed his parents the box. </p>
<p>“You can give it to them next time we see Lily or James.” Arthur told him. </p>
<p>It was getting pretty late that night. an uncomfortable cold of the month of October seemed to pass through every bone in the 10 year-old’s body, despite being inside the house. </p>
<p>Bill felt uneasy at his dad’s words, knowing they were completely innocent, but feeling like it was off in some way. </p>
<p>He felt as if there wouldn’t be a next time.</p>
<p>Once everyone in his family was asleep, Bill crept out of his and Charlie’s room and passed the other rooms. Baby ginny was such a light sleeper that he was glad she was with his mum tonight. It was really the only way that this would work. </p>
<p>He stepped out of the kitchen and out into the yard, the cold catching him off guard.Bil ran to the main road as fast as he could, making sure that if his parents decided to look out the kitchen, they wouldn’t see him in the yard. Soon enough, the large triple-decker bus appeared and the door opened.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you a bit young to be riding the bus this late?”</p>
<p>“I’m 10. Bring me to Godric’s Hollow.” Bill told the conductor. Bill sat on one of the beds and hung on for dear life. It wasn’t the first time he rode the knight bus… His mum had forgotten the floo powder once and thought maybe the Knight Bus would be alright. </p>
<p>It wasn’t. It was also Molly’s first time riding the death trap. Never again, she swore.</p>
<p>For multiple minutes, he clung to the bed posts as he was thrown around and soon enough, the bus came to a stop. Bill stepped off the bus and gave a few coins to the conductor and stepped towards the Potter Home. He froze when he saw a cloaked figure walking slowly towards the home. </p>
<p>Bill felt his blood run cold as he ran between a few bushes and stared at the figure. The door opened and shouting was heard before a bright green flash was appeared. The shouting stopped… He didn’t move. Out of fear? Out of instinct? Whatever it was, it was keeping him rooted to the ground as another scream was heard and two green flashes He still held the box firmly in his hands. After at least 20 minutes of being crouched in the bush and no more sounds being heard. Bill slowly crept out onto the pathway and made his way towards the home. The door was still wide opened when he reached the entrance. </p>
<p>His eyes froze on the body laying there.... <em>Mr. Potter</em>… He carefully moved around the rubble and went upstairs to the nursery. </p>
<p>Sometimes, he came with Charlie to babysit so he knew the house like the back of his hand.</p>
<p>He froze when he entered the pale girlish-pink coloured room. Mrs. Potter was on the ground, motionless and pale, as Cassiopeia cried in the crib. He approached the girl and took her into his arms, cooing gently. Her soft black hair parted slightly and he saw the scar. Red, almost like blood, and in the shape of lightning on her forehead. He moved her hair back to cover it and calmed Cassie down. </p>
<p>As he was about to leave the room with her, in walk a man with greasy black hair, a crooked nose and dark eyes. “Red hair, freckles, you must be a Weasley.” The man droned on. </p>
<p>“What of it?” Bill shot back, shielding the remaining Potter. </p>
<p>“Where are your parents? Surely you weren’t inside the house when he came?” The man questioned him. This stranger couldn’t see inside the nursery. “Or… surely it wasn’t you who caused all of this?”</p>
<p>“Of course not!” He defended himself. The man looked at the boy with intrigue and motioned hi to continue. “There… was bright green flashes coming from the house… and there was a cloaked person that came in moments before.” From the mention of green flashes, the man rushed into the nursery and broke down to his knees at the sight of Lily. </p>
<p>“Leave the child.” The man croaked out quietly. </p>
<p>“N-no. She’ll be safer with my parents.” Bill told him. the man abruptly looked at him and shot angrily. </p>
<p>“Leave the child, you insolent brat.” The man approached the child and Bill closed his eyes and yelled. </p>
<p>“No!” A pulse of magic erupt and pushed the dark haired stranger all the way to the wall, leaving him shocked. <em>Accidental magic…</em></p>
<p>He took the opportunity and ran outside, the child still in his arms until he was met with a big man, several times taller than he and someone he noticed. Lord Black, or more commonly known as her <em>Uncoo Padfoot</em> . He was friends with Mr. Potter.  </p>
<p>“William?! What are you doing here?” Sirius crouched down to eye level. “Do you have any idea how dangerous this part of town is at night? Particularly right now?”  Sirius looked at the bundle he was holding and saw Cassiopeia. “James...Lily… They didn’t survive, did they…” Sirius mumbled, Bill shook his head and felt his blood run cold again.</p>
<p>“I’ve got orders to take young miss Cassie to Dumbledore.” The giant said. “You can’t be that old… Are you attending Hogwarts yet?” He shook his head.</p>
<p>“Next year.” was his answer.</p>
<p>“Ah, well, I’m Hagrid. Gamekeeper at Hogwarts.” The giant introduced himself kindly. “And you are?”</p>
<p>“William Weasley…” He mumbled. “But everyone calls me Bill.” </p>
<p>“Well, Bill want to come with me to bring Cassie to Dumbledore? Help me out a bit?”</p>
<p>“Why” Bill paused for a moment and looked at the sleeping Potter girl in his arms. “Mum and dad can take care of her! I can help! So can Charlie, and Percy too!” </p>
<p>“We’re taking her to her relatives.” The giant told the boy. “You can ride in the side car if you want.” It took a few more minutes of convincing for Bill to slowly hop into the sidecar as Sirius layed one last kiss on Cassie’s forehead and attended to other <em>business</em> as he had put it, leaving with an angry fire in his eyes.</p>
