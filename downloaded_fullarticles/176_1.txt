    <p>Chapter It was cold, so dark and cold, the pure silence of space made it all more eerie. It had felt like hours since Bellatrix had stirred in this black emptiness. She had screamed shouted and pleaded for anyone until her voice was hoarse. The only sound her raspy breathing as she curled in a foetal position to conjure any warmth from her body. She could barely remember anything from before or how she got here, even the dark days of Azkaban could match the numbing of her current surroundings. After what seemed hours and momentarily glimpsing around her, she noticed a slight glow simmering in the distance. She sat up slowly trying hard to focus, as seconds passed the glow got ever so closer, she wanted to call but her throat was so dry a mere grunt gargled deep from within her throat. She had tried searching for her wand on her body on the ground around her, even wandless summoning brought nothing to her. Bellatrix stood slowly, gaining her balance as she stepped forward towards the glow she took several hesitant steps in the blind darkness. Stopping as she put her left foot forward finding nothing solid underneath and almost falling forward into the empty abyss. She caught her balance in time and took a step back. Looking forward towards the light in front. By now it was only a few hundred yards and as it approached she could make out the lantern hanging against something. "It's a boat" she thought to herself. The silent vessel floated its way towards her, the lantern swaying slightly in motion. "Come Bellatrix" a voice whispered from beside her, she almost screamed at the dark cloaked figure she found standing to her left, never feeling its presence beforehand. She stumbled backwards her immediate thoughts being a Dementor when she saw tattered black robes and nothing under the hood. But logic kicked in, for one Dementor’s didn't talk and she would have sensed them a mile away. It was only as she looked closer she noticed the cloaked figure holding a scythe and pointing it towards the boat as it glided sideways in front of her.<br/> Memories flashed through her mind of stories told to her and her sisters the tales of the three brothers and their gifts from Death. Her mother's descriptive accounts of the Grim Reaper seemed completely accurate, down to the skeletal hands, as Bellatrix looked at the cloaked figure once again. He seemed to float onto the vessel after she stepped in taking a seat next to the lantern trying to feel the little if any warmth the flame may throw off. Death stood silent facing the direction the boat seemed to float in. Bellatrix looked down over the side, it seemed they were floating through mist rather than water, nothing appeared to be lapping against the boat except wispy clouds.<br/> "Where are we?" she asked Death, her voice finally returning to her. The hood turned and looked at her. "We are in limbo, I think that's what your kind call it. It is the place between your world and the next one." He answered turning his head back as it was before. They floated on for a time in silence, Bellatrix felt the boat begin to turn sideways as it slowly nudged a solid surface. She turned around to look at a rocky surface lit by a few lanterns similar to that on the boat. Death pointed his hand gesturing for her to step out. She took a few steps forward and looked back. Death was still in the same position on the boat.<br/> "What now" she asked.<br/> "You go on alone, follow the path for it is your turn." He answered as the boat turned and began floating away.<br/> "Time for what?" she shouted rather irritated after him.<br/> "Judgement to be passed. Goodbye Bellatrix Black" Death answered disappearing into the darkness.<br/> Bellatrix stood several seconds as the lantern on the boat diminished and she was sure she saw nothing but the hollow blackness ahead of her. She turned round and hesitantly walked down the worn pathway marked out ahead by the faint lighting. No sound could be heard except her breathing, and soft thud of her boots on the earth. All her senses were on high alert for anything unusual.<br/> ________________________________________<br/> The path seemed to go on forever, she was aching, numb, all energy drained as she dragged on this endless path. 'Limbo it certainly was, a big pile of nothing, and where is everyone? She thought to herself. 'Surely more than herself had died, all those bodies she saw in battle' as faint memories flickered in her head. She was brought out of her thoughts abruptly as she almost walking into a large wooden doorway. The large studded lacquered doors stood in a carved hole of earth, bolts appeared to be opening mechanically on the inside. They creaked open slowly. Bella now beyond annoyed pushed and forced her way through.<br/> She entered a large white marbled room, she scrunched her eyes closed adjusting to the sudden brightness of the room after being in the dark for so long.<br/> "At last we thought you were lost Bellatrix Black" a sharp voice caught her attention. Three identical old hags (it was the first description Bella could think of from the strange women in front of her) who seemed to be enthusiastically playing with an endless supply of silver threaded silk in front of them. "Who are you?" Bellatrix snapped, she was tired of games.<br/> "Keep your temper in check Bellatrix Black your patience has become short over the years. As for introductions we, my sisters and I are the three Moirai" the left one answered inspecting a slither of silk thread manipulating it through her fingers as she spoke.<br/> "You're the what?"<br/> "What is it with these Purebloods always with the arrogance didn't they get taught anything?" the right side sister spoke as she continued cutting through the thread on her side.<br/> "How dare you! I. . . “But Bella was cut off before she could continue.<br/> "Ah now Bellatrix Black, you were weaved as an intelligent girl and your arrival is unexpected. Your death is long premature, you were never destined to come here yet, and looking at your damage soul many things have happened that were never meant to."<br/> Bellatrix contemplated these words as she took in every word said. "Why do you refer to me from my maiden name? Is my husband dead? And what of my lord?"<br/> "Because despite names you will forever be a Black, Lestrange is something you would never be, it is but a name, as for your husband, his time is not up yet. As for the one you call your lord. Yes he is finally claimed for by death after much delay"<br/> "He’s dead? You mean him. .he lost to that boy? But. ." she broke off, she remembered all the fighting, the boy jumping back to life and duelling with her lord, feeling pain to her chest, and them waking up to the cold darkness that brought her here. ". . I'm dead?"<br/> "In a way yes but as my sister stated that was not intended so soon, a lot of your life was not, you were never meant to be a killer, Bellatrix you were not born that way, manipulations and choices of others restricted you from what was destined. You killed tortured and maimed so many yet you should never have been tainted with that life, your soul rotted for others gain. For your crimes you should be commended to hell for infinity of punishment. But not all of this was your fault"<br/> "You think I didn't choose those things? I didn't enjoy that life? Your opinion means nothing to me" Bellatrix cackled at such absurdity.<br/> "Now you feel that way Bella but your rotted soul shut out any motion long before. But now the matter at hand is to be solved. Judgement is to be passed and your fate has been decided. You are not ready to pass yet, your destiny remains unfulfilled and another chance given to return to earth and do so, but there will be consequences."<br/> "And what would those be?" Bellatrix asked casually looking at her nails almost looking bored.<br/> "You shall be returned to a time when your soul was still pure. But you will forever live your memories of the life before, the souls you destroyed will not be forgotten. The fates have decided" the three sisters began simultaneously weaving the piece of thread. Bellatrix felt a strange sensation over her body as a faint glow seemed to hover above her skin, her eyes widened in shock as she began to feel physical changes to her body happen before her. Her breasts pushed up in her corset as her bust became more pert. The scars on her arm faded instead leaving unblemished ivory skin, her teeth grew back where decay had caused them to fall out years before. Her hair seemed to become shinier and the volume slightly longer. The most obvious feeling was a slight burning to her arm and neck. She pulled her sleeve up to see the area the dark mark occupied slowly fade until the skin was unmarred. She touched her face no crow's feet lingered in the corner of her eyes.<br/> And then everything went black.<br/> ________________________________________<br/> Her eyes shot open as a large breath escaped from her lungs. She sat bolt up looking at her surroundings. She appeared to be lying in the middle of some stone circle. She instinctively searched for her wand not finding it on her body. She tried summoning it but to no avail. The pale moonlight lingered on a clear sky. Her mind flooded with her last memory of events, the fates, Death, Judgement, and Change. She wrenched the shoulder of her dress down on her left arm, the arm was unblemished, there were no physical scars, and she looked at the body of her 19 year old self as it had been so many years ago.<br/> Bellatrix Black was alive and for the first time in her life she was terrified.</p>
