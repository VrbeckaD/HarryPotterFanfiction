    <p>    “Severus, it has been over a week now,” Minerva sighed and shoved back a wisp of hair that had somehow fallen loose from her impeccable bun (maybe Harry’s messy hair was contagious).  “You <em> cannot </em> skip two more weeks of classes just because Harry has a <em> curable </em>illness.”</p><p>    The potions master looked up from where he was sitting by Harry’s bedside as the preteen was receiving his second anti-venom treatment and thrashing a bit in his sleep.  “Watch me,” he said impassively, before turning his fathomless back eyes back to the child, wiping a curl of sweaty hair off his clammy forehead.</p><p>    “Your OWL and NEWT students have exams in a week,” Minerva reminded him, trying not to lose her patience with the man- they were all worried about Harry, after all, but they couldn’t just take all that time off of work every time he was sick, or the sad truth is they’d <em> never </em>get anything done.</p><p>    “And if they haven’t learned it by now, they’re useless and they’ll fail; I don’t see the problem,” Severus shrugged, turning back to dabbing Harry’s cheeks with a cool cloth.</p><p>    <em> “Severus, </em>they need to review,” the tabby animagus said, more insistently this time.</p><p>    “The potions lab doesn’t just <em> disappear </em>when I’m not in there, and I’ve got bigger problems at the moment than than making sure they don’t destroy it- nothing’s stopping them.”  With a learned efficiency, when Harry shot up, he quickly brought the bucket up, and not a drop of vomit spilled on the sheets as Severus held the bucket with one hand and ran the other through Harry’s hair.  </p><p>    “Shhh, there there- get it all out,” he said, even though Harry couldn’t see his lips- it was mostly to reassure himself at this point, but he had to say <em> something.   </em> Luckily, the episodes of projectile vomiting had been slowly decreasing, but the weight loss was of course concerning, since Harry couldn’t keep anything down at the moment.   <em> Just </em>when they’d been starting to make some progress…</p><p>    Severus sighed and made sure the IV still had plenty of fluid, since it was Harry’s only source of nutrients at the moment.  Poppy had finally managed to drag Sirius and Remus away from the bedside to take a shower (unlike normally, when it was for pleasure, <em> now </em> they were taking a shower together for the sheer efficiency of it, just so they could get back to their godson sooner), so he was the only one there to fend of Minerva’s badgering.  He knew, of course, that once the mutts came back, the nurse was going to force him to eat and shower as well. He at least consoled himself with the knowledge that that was as far as he would let it get- she <em> couldn’t </em>make them sleep anywhere else but Harry’s bedside, no matter how stern she might be: it was three against one (and no, the irony was not lost on him that he was teaming up with the two remaining Marauders, but frankly, he didn’t give a shit).</p><p>    “Come on- if you get fired, you won’t be able to be around to watch Harry during the school year,” Minerva threatened, and Severus scoffed at her.</p><p>    “It took our combined onslaught to get Albus to fire Filch for <em> hitting </em> a child- he’s not going to fire <em> me </em>for missing work,” he sneered.</p><p>    “Are you sure, dear?  I mean, your dark mark is gone- you’re no longer useful as a spy anymore.”</p><p>    <em> “He </em>doesn’t know my dark mark is gone.”</p><p>    “That’s what we <em> assume- </em>but he knew when Harry saved the unicorn- his reach clearly extends farther than he lets on,” Minerva reminded him.</p><p>    “I’m <em> not </em> going back to work until he’s better, Minerva, and <em> that’s final,” </em>the potions master asserted.  “What if he wakes up and I’m not here?”</p><p>    “Why don’t we take turns?” Remus came out of the bathroom, holding hands with Sirius, whose shoulder-length hair was in a towel.  “I’m not too bad with potions, and that way the students could still get their review in and you can spend more time at Harry’s bedside.”</p><p>    “But why would I spend <em> more </em> time when I can spend <em> all </em>the time?” Severus pointed out, and Poppy came out of the storeroom with a syringe full of medication for Harry, rolling her eyes at him.</p><p>    “It’s not healthy for you to spend all your time locked up in here- you’re not sleeping, you’re not eating- hell, you’ve lost almost as much weight as Harry,” she scolded, and everyone <em> knew </em> it was serious when Poppy swore (or everyone knew it was <em> Sirius- </em> both manifestations of the word were <em> perfectly capable </em>of driving her crazy).</p><p>    <em> “I </em>can afford to lose the weight,” Severus argued, and Poppy put her hands on her hips and looked down her nose at him.</p><p>    <em> “Can you, </em>though?” She clucked, poking one bony hip as he started to the side, irritated.</p><p>    “Fuck off,” he told her, eloquent as ever.</p><p>    “Don’t use that kind of language in my hospital wing, young man- only <em> I’m </em> allowed to do that,” she chastised him.  “Now, you are going to teach <em> at least </em>three classes these week, and Remus can take some others, but you are going to get up and move around- if Harry wakes up to see you looking like you’ve half-wasted away, it’ll only worry him, and we can’t have that.”</p><p><em>     </em> <em> “Fine,” </em> he groaned, seeing he was beaten.  “I’ll go teach a bunch of useless degenerates doomed to failure anyway instead of sitting next to my child like a <em> proper </em>parent just so you’ll stop filling the room with tension- which is unhealthy for Harry, mind you- but this is on you.”</p><p>    “I’ll accept that,” the healer agreed, smug.  “Now, you’re going to eat a good lunch, young man, and then <em> you’re </em>going to get in the shower as well.”  She gave him a scrutinizing look. “You might want a potion to cover the greys, as well- I can see at least five.”</p><p>    “Ha- almost as many as Moony,” Sirius broke in, trying to lighten the mood, but it only got him a tickling hex from both his boyfriend and their co-parent.</p><p>_____</p><p>    “Hey buddy,” Ron said, signing along, which was kind of pointless since Harry’s eyes were closed anyway, but it was a comfort thing.  “How was your day- are you feeling any better? Madame Pomfrey said you’ve been throwing up less, which is good. Colin’s doing a lot better too, by the way, although he’s telling anyone who will hold still long enough that you heroically saved his life.  Anyway, they took down Tom Riddle’s award for special services to the school- and hey, get this- it turns out the reason Hagrid was expelled was because they thought <em> he </em> was responsible for the chamber.  How dumb is the ministry, right? Well anyway, now he’s getting a new wand and doing independent study for his OWLs, so he can keep being the caretaker as well.  And he’s got something else going on, but he won’t tell us what it is- says it’s a surprise, or something. So yeah, that’s the happenings. Anyway, I know we couldn’t transfigure your inhaler because the magic might mess with the technology that lets it dispense the medicine and stuff, but Hermione and I saved up and got you a new one as a get-well gift- it’s got Spiderman on it, and now Winnie the Pooh can just be a backup.  Hermione’s coming, by the way- she’s just waiting for McGonagall because she has a meeting about all her electives next year- she’s trying to take them <em> all, </em>can you believe that?  Well, you probably can- that’s our Mia, after all.  Draco will be here in a little bit too- he just had to take a break because he’s a little overstimulated, with all the stress of worrying about you and the castle all excited and loud over everything that’s happened this year.”</p><p>    Ron continued to talk excitedly to Harry- he hadn’t seen him for <em> a whole day, </em>since yesterday Pansy, Theo, and Daphne had commandeered the visiting hours.  He told him all about classes and homework (“don’t worry though,” he added, “you’re excused, so you don’t have to get all stressed out about makeup work or anything, since there’s no exams anyway.”)  Eventually, he took out a chess set and put it on the bedside table, and the three adult men moved aside to make room for him.</p><p>    “I know you’re not awake, but I can just play your side- don’t worry, I’ll be as rubbish at it as you normally are, so it’s realistic.”  He forced a laugh as he set up the pieces, and for a while it was him just playing both sides, ignoring the protests of the white side (of course he always let Harry be white, so he had a <em> little more </em>of a chance by going first) as he made them go to their own doom.</p><p>    Harry made a soft, not-quite-groaning noise in his sleep, and ended up moving the hand attached to the IV, which brushed against his rook, shoving it forward a couple spaces.</p><p>    “Mother of Merlin,” Ron gasped.  “You’ve got me in checkmate- you’re a better player sleeping than you are awake!”</p><p>    Sirius and Remus traded soft smiles, and Sirius lifted Remus’ rough knuckles up to his lip, brushing a soft kiss against them.  “He’s got good friends,” he whispered to his boyfriend, who nodded.</p><p>    “He’s got <em> the best </em>friends,” the werewolf agreed as Hermione suddenly burst in, setting her heavy bag by the bedside and startling awake her head of house, who had just started to drift into an uneasy sleep in one of the bedside chairs.</p><p>    “Sorry,” she told him quickly, before turning to Ron.</p><p>    “I got all my electives!” She told him excitedly, and he looked at her strangely.</p><p>    <em> “How?” </em>He asked, gobsmacked.</p><p>    “Let’s just say we worked something out,” she waved aside his astonishment, pulling out a book for herself and a cauldron cake for Ron.</p><p>    “What?” He said around a mouthful of the pastry.  “You gonna study ahead this summer, kidnap a fourth year, shapeshift into them, and take half the electives above your grade level during our free periods?”</p><p>    “Good idea, but no,” she told him, not taking it as a joke at all.  “Just don’t worry about it.”</p><p>    “You scare me sometimes,” Ron just shook his head in disbelief.</p><p>    “Good,” Mia responded, a satisfied expression on her face.  “Sometimes I worry you’ve grown complacent.”</p><p>    “You’ve never gotta worry about that,” he assured her, blanching a little.</p><p>    “In return for your respect, I will be a kind overlord,” she promised.</p><p>    “You know,” Ron sighed, “sometimes I worry the hat doomed us all by putting you in Slytherin.”</p><p>    “What?” Hermione shrugged, unconcerned.  “I’ll be a better dictator than the minster.”</p><p>    “Fair enough- but I <em> still </em>think having you and Pansy Parkinson in the same dorm room is a bad idea.”</p><p>    “Your concerns are valid,” Hermione responded, blase, as she readjusted Harry’s blankets.  Ron’s favourite job taken, he carefully fluffed the pillows behind his best friend’s head.</p><p>    “They’re <em> adorable,” </em>Poppy gushed, as the adults watched from a few feet away.</p><p>    “They’re scary, is what they are,” Sirius corrected.  “Once they’re all trained up, they’ll have more talent in their little toes than the rest of us <em> combined.” </em></p><p>    “Hermione is going to be the first muggleborn Minister of Magic, and we’re very proud,” Remus reminded him.  “A little mortal terror is well worth the groundbreaking strides she’ll be making in wizarding history.”</p><p>____</p><p>    The anti-venom was a rough process, and Harry came out of it looking far worse for wear but more than ready to be out of bed.</p><p>    “May I please go see the basilisk?” He asked his guardians, as Remus and Severus each ran a thumb nervously along one hollow cheek.</p><p>    <em> “Absolutely not!” </em> Severus yelped, scandalized.  “It <em> bit </em>you!”</p><p>    “Yeah, but that was only because of Tom,” Harry reasoned.  “And she felt <em> really </em> bad about it, and she <em> really </em> liked me.  And besides,” his face lit up as a very <em> Slytherin </em>idea came to him.  “Rumor has it that Salazar Slytherin had personal quarters down there- don’t you wanna explore?”</p><p>    “You can’t tempt me into taking you into a dangerous situation with historical relics,” Severus said stubbornly, and Remus reached out to put a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>    “He does have a point,” he took up for Harry.  “I mean, his animagus form is a basilisk, for one thing, so I’m sure she could teach him how to manage it quite well.  And we’d <em> all </em>be there with him.  The basilisk was under control of a dark artefact when she did all those things- if Harry says she’s perfectly harmless otherwise, I think he’s proven himself trustworthy enough that we can believe him.”</p><p>    “Well…” Severus still seemed unsure, and Harry looked up at him pleadingly.</p><p>    <em> “Pleeease!” </em> He begged, flashing his big, irresistible green eyes.  “I <em> promise </em>I’ll be careful!”</p><p>    “Oh, fine,” Severus sighed, giving up.  <em> “But </em>you have to have all three of us with you-” he motioned to himself, Sirius and Remus, “and if anything looks to be dangerous, we’re taking you right out.”</p><p>    “Alright,” Harry agreed easily, taking Severus and Sirius, the two closest, by the hands and leading them towards the chamber.</p><p>    <em> “And </em>you have to eat lunch first,” Severus ordered.</p><p>    “Oh, <em> fine,” </em>Harry sighed, impatient, but reluctantly changed directions.</p><p>____</p><p>    At lunch, everyone wanted to talk to him now that he was back with the greater school population, and Harry was fielding questions and congratulations and out-and-out hero-worship the whole time.  It was funny, how fast opinions of him had changed.</p><p>    “Hey,” a hand landed on his shoulder, and Harry jumped, but, on turning around, was pleasantly surprised to see the smiling face of Cedric Diggory.</p><p>    “I’m glad to see you’re feeling better,” the Hufflepuff said, and Harry gave him a brilliant smile that made Draco’s insides squirm, for some reason.</p><p>    “Thanks,” Harry replied pleasantly, making room for him to sit down at their table.  “It’s good to see you again.”</p><p>    “I wanted to come visit you in the hospital wing, but I wasn’t sure I’d be welcome,” Cedric admitted, his cheeks heating a little.</p><p>    <em> You wouldn’t have been, </em>Draco thought savagely, crossing his arms.</p><p>    “Oh, you’re our friend- you’re <em> always </em>welcome,” Harry said cheerfully, and Draco’s pout deepened as Pansy gave him a scrutinizing look.</p><p>    “Thanks,” the fifth-year responded, reaching for a pastry.  “Boy, you look like you’ve been through the ringer.”</p><p>    “Eh,” Harry shrugged.  “I’ve seen worse.” And Ron and Hermione hated- <em> hated more than anything- </em>that it was true.  “So, how you been?”</p><p>    “Studying for OWLs,” Cedric sighed.  “But they’re almost over now- just my History of Magic written exam, after lunch.”</p><p>    “Do you think you did okay on potions?” Harry asked as he bit into one of Dr. Norton’s special protein bars.  “I feel like I should apologise for keeping Sev so busy…”</p><p>    “Oh, don’t worry about it- I think I managed alright.  Plus, Professor Lupin was an <em> awesome </em>teacher as well, and it was nice to experience different teaching styles from Snape’s.”</p><p>    “Professor Lupin…” Harry looked confused for a moment.  <em> “Oh, </em>you mean Moony,” he laughed.  “It’s weird to see people calling him that.”</p><p>    “Right, because he’s one of your guardians,” Cedric remembered, and Harry smiled again.</p><p>    “Yeah- it’s great, you know, the three of them- they take really good care of me.”</p><p>    “I’m glad,” Cedric reached out and ruffled his hair, and Harry, laughing, pulled away.</p><p>    “Well, I should probably get back to my table…” he sighed, a bit reluctantly.  “Gotta do some last-minute cramming for that last OWL.”</p><p>    “Well, bye then,” Draco butt in before Harry could say anything, and the Hufflepuff winked at them all before turning away.</p><p>    “He’s nice,” Harry remarked.</p><p>    “Yeah, whatever,” Draco huffed, and Harry looked at him strangely for a moment.</p><p>    “You overstimulated?” He signed, and Draco shook his head.</p><p>    “Just don’t see why he’s gotta come over here all the time, is all,” the blonde signed back jerkily.</p><p>    “I think it’s kind of nice- inter-house unity and all,” and Draco shrugged before turning back to his plate.</p><p>    “Hey,” Harry tapped him on the shoulder.  “Love you,” he signed.</p><p>    The other boy brightened a bit.  “Love you too.” Harry gave him a one armed hug before turning back to his plate, wondering how he was <em> ever </em>going to finish it all.</p><p>_____</p><p>    <em> “Hello hatchling,” </em> Seren hissed brightly, before she got a good look at him.   <em> “Oh my- what happened to you?!” </em></p><p><em>     </em> <em> “ I was a little sick, or I would have visited sooner,” </em>Harry responded, purposely leaving out the reason he’d been ill, but she picked up on it anyway.</p><p>    <em> “Oh dear- it was me, wasn’t it?” </em> She groaned.   <em> “I’m so sorry hatchling!” </em></p><p>    <em> “Hey,” </em> Harry stepped forward, putting one small brown hand on her snout, and Remus kept Sirius and Severus from both stepping forward anxiously.   <em> “It wasn’t your fault- it was Tom’s, and I’m all better now.” </em></p><p><em>     </em> <em> “You don’t </em> <b> <em>look </em> </b> <em> all better,” </em> his basilisk mama nudged him.   <em> “Here, change into your form and I’ll bring you a big juicy crow.” </em></p><p><em>     </em> <em> “Er, I’m alright…” </em>Harry pulled at his collar, trying not to offend her.</p><p>    <em> “No, I promise- you’ll love it in your animagus form.  Just transform, and I’ll be right back.” </em>While the rest of the students eagerly explored the chamber (and Severus, despite all the priceless relics around him, kept his eyes only on Harry), the preteen transformed, and soon a little baby basilisk, about 2 feet long, was draped across the ground.</p><p>    “Aww, how cute- I wanna try!” Hermione exclaimed, and before Remus or Severus could open their mouths to explain that magical animagus forms were rare and becoming a magical animal by shapeshifting completely impossible, there was another, slightly longer young basilisk on the ground.</p><p>    “Holy…” Sirius began.</p><p>    “Motherfucking Merlin’s…” Severus continued.</p><p>    “Psychedelic magic mushrooms,” Remus finished, as they all gaped at Hermione, who turned her gaze upon them (without the lethal feature, obviously), as if to say <em> well, what are you on about? </em></p><p><em>     </em> “That should be impossible…” Severus gaped, and Hermione just flicked her forked tongue out at them, clearly meaning something amongst the lines of <em> well, I’m here, aren’t I?  So start readjusting your beliefs. </em></p><p><em>     </em> <em> “I think you broke them,” </em>Harry hissed to Hermione, who was obviously able to understand and speak parseltongue in this form.</p><p>    <em> “For grown men, they’re </em> <b> <em>awfully </em> </b> <em> breakable,” </em>Hermione shook her serpentine head, thinking of all the times she’d already rendered them speechless.</p><p><em>     </em> <em> “Oh look, Seren’s back.” </em> They both turned to see Mama Basilisk, who looked <em> overjoyed </em>to have another hatchling to feed.</p><p>    <em> “This is Hermione; she’s a shapeshifter,” </em>Harry explained, and Seren nudged her fondly.</p><p>    <em> “Oh!” </em> She exclaimed.   <em> “Another child- here, I’ll go fetch another crow.  You two just stay right there.” </em></p><p><em>     </em> <em> “It’s okay,” </em> Harry stopped her, looking at the bird.   <em> “It’s awful big- I think we’ll just split it.”   </em>Seren clearly didn’t look happy with that answer but let the matter drop.</p><p>    <em> “If I’ve already shifted into a crow, does this make me a cannibal?” </em>  Hermione asked as they started on the bird.   <em> “Not that I care- just curious.” </em></p><p><em>     </em> <em> “Dunno,” </em> Harry replied, spitting out a feather.   <em> “Did you </em> <b> <em>know </em> </b> <em> you’d taste this good when you tried that form?  I think it was rather dangerous of you to transform into such a tasty bird.” </em></p><p><em>     </em> <em> “I can shift back really quickly now,” </em> Hermione bobbed her scaly head in a rough impression at a shrug, <em> “so whatever tried to eat me would have been unpleasantly surprised.” </em></p><p><em>     </em> <em> “Merlin, I love you,” </em>Harry hissed a snort, picking the meat off a wing bone in a way that would have disgusted his human form.</p><p><em>     </em> <em> “My name is Hermione, but I love you too.” </em></p><p><em>     </em> Everyone else was very confused as they watched two little basilisks literally <em> writhing </em>in what turned out to be laughter.</p>
