    <p>Everbloom Chapter 1</p><p>The girl’s pale hands skimmed the blades of grass beneath her as she let out a laugh of pure joy as her iridescent pink wings fluttered and took her high above the flower garden. </p><p>Her candy colored hair flew up around the sides of her face as she relished the feeling flying. </p><p>It had been over a year since she had been able to fly freely around her home’s large garden.</p><p>Just as she was about to pass the large oak tree on the edge of her family’s property she heard her mother’s voice yell up at her from below. </p><p>“Ottaline! It’s time for you to get dressed! They’ll be here shortly. You can’t very well meet your husband to be for the first time with your wings all sweaty.” </p><p>The girl sighed and shook her head with a grin resting firmly on her lips. </p><p>Today was a very special day in the Mezereti household and she knew that she needed to look extra special. </p><p>Landing gracefully down next to her mother she threw her arms around the woman’s lithe figure with a girlish squeal. </p><p>“Oh mother! I can’t believe I’ll finally get to meet him. I’ve been dreaming of this moment for my whole life.” </p><p>Her mother’s features softened as she hugged her 18 year old daughter to her. </p><p>“Yes I know. Now come on, hurry up. I expect to see you downstairs in exactly half an hour. I want you to wear something so stunning that the Malfoy boy won’t know what bloody hit him.” </p><p>Placing a small kiss on her mother’s cheek, Ottaline nodded and brushed a piece of her long, windswept pink hair out of her eyes before she took off running into the house and up the stairs to her room. </p><p>Her wings fluttered behind her making a whoosh of wind that knocked over several things around the house making her mother roll her eyes. </p><p>After a quick bath, she made her way into her closet trying to decide which dress would be best to meet her fiancé in.</p><p>Her nimble fingers thumbed through the hangers before she let out a gasp and a small giggle when she found the perfect one. </p><p>Taking the dress off the hanger she slipped into it and stood before her heart shaped mirror admiring how the dress fit perfectly to her slim figure. </p><p>The dress had a pink and silver ombre sparkly bodice and a full light pink sparkly skirt with small pieces of glitter woven into the tulle. </p><p>She thought that the ball gown silhouette was very fitting for meeting her future husband seeing as how she needed to reveal that not only was she was a fairy, but a fairy princess at that. </p><p>Sitting down at her vanity, she charmed her naturally pink ombre hair into cascading curls that fell down her back. </p><p>After applying some lipstick and minimal makeup, she pulled up the hem of her dress and giggled when she thought of how surprised her pureblood wizard would be when she told him that fairies hated to wear shoes and go barefoot everywhere. </p><p>A knock sounded on her door as she called a soft “come in”. </p><p>Her mother appeared and let out a little shriek of astonishment at how gorgeous her princess looked. </p><p>Ottaline noted that her mother also looked radiant in a bright blue mermaid gown and with her long satin white gloves and the magnificent crown that sat on top of her long candy blue hair. </p><p>Running into her mother’s arms, the young princess felt tears prick her eyes.</p><p>Her mother pulled back and waved her hand which made a large sparkling crown appear on top of her daughter’s head. </p><p>Stepping back, her eyes glistened with unshed tears as she watched her daughter pull on her long white satin gloves and spun in a circle with a smile that went from ear to ear. </p><p>“Oh Otty! You look absolutely stunning! I really wish your father could’ve been here to see you. He would’ve been so proud.” </p><p>She said as her voice shook with emotion. </p><p>Ottaline felt the tears fall in rivers down her cheeks but quickly cast a spell to make her face dry once again. </p><p>“I miss him, mother. He was my best friend.” </p><p>She whispered as her mother took her hand and led her to the door of her bedroom.</p><p>“I know, dear. All of us do.” </p><p>Her mother said simply before she led her to the top of the staircase where she stopped and tilted her head to the side before her eyes lit up with excitement. </p><p>“I think they just got here! Oh my Goddess! Can we please go downstairs and meet them now?” </p><p>Ottaline rambled out making her mother laugh with amusement. </p><p>Nodding, the Queen turned and shot her a knowing look before she descended the stairs. </p><p>“Behave yourself, child. I’ll go announce your grand entrance.” </p><p>The young princess fiddled with the tulle of her dress and was practically jumping with nervous energy. </p><p>A few moments later she heard murmurs of voices before her mother called up the stairs.</p><p>“Lord Draco Malfoy, I am happy to introduce my daughter. Princess Ottaline Nicola Mezereti!” </p><p>Floating gracefully down the stairs, Ottaline felt colorful sparks fly off of her wings as they fluttered with a new, strong energy. </p><p>When she reached the last step she froze as her breath caught in her throat. </p><p>There, in front of her was the most handsome wizard she had ever seen. </p><p>His eyes widened when he met her gaze and his mouth dropped open as he shakily reached out and took her hand to raise it to his lips before dipping low in a deep bow. </p><p>“You’re Majesty. It is a pleasure to finally meet you. I have been dreaming of this day since I was a small child. May I have the great honor of joining you for a light afternoon lunch?” </p><p>His aristocratic drawl sent shivers down her spine as she nodded and raised her hand and threaded her fingers through his platinum locks. </p><p>“You will never leave my side again? Is that understood?” </p><p>She whispered as his eyes searched her own before he pulled her close and nuzzled his nose against her own. </p><p>“Darling, not even death’s cold hands can pull me away from your side. I’m yours, forever and always.” </p><p>He said before his lips smashed onto hers and sparks of rainbow magic glittered down around them entwining their souls together forever.</p>
