</center>“Are you ready?”<p>Draco turned to face Harry. He was chewing his lip - a nervous habit he’d picked up - and couldn’t stop wringing his hands together. “I don’t know if I can do this,” he said. </p>
<p>“You can,” Harry said, coming to stand right in front of Draco. “You’re not going to be alone. We’ll all be there.” </p>
<p>“I know,” Draco said. “But none of you cursed Madam Rosmerta.” </p>
<p>“No,” Harry agreed. “We didn’t, but we all understand now why you did. We don’t even have to go into The Three Broomsticks if you don’t want to.” </p>
<p>“Really?” Draco asked, a hopeful look crossing his face.</p>
<p>“Really,” Harry nodded. “But I want to go to Hogsmeade with you. It always looks amazing near Christmas, in the snow.” </p>
<p>Draco gave Harry a small smile. “It does,” he admitted. “I used to love visiting around Christmas time, before… everything.” </p>
<p>“Then let’s go,” Harry said. “We can go and look around the other shops and meet up with everyone else. We can get someone to pop into The Three Broomsticks and see what Madam Rosmerta thinks about you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, nice,” Draco snorted. “Just what I want. Everyone to hear how much she hates me and thinks I should be locked up!” </p>
<p>“No, no,” Harry said quickly. “It won’t be that bad. I’m sure she doesn’t think you should be locked up.” </p>
<p>“But you don’t <i>know</i> that,” Draco replied. “I haven’t been back to Hogsmeade since well before the battle.” </p>
<p>“I know,” Harry said, wrapping his arms around Draco. “So wouldn’t now be the perfect time? It’s nearly Christmas, people are naturally more forgiving so shouldn’t give you too much trouble.” </p>
<p>Draco sighed and relaxed into Harry’s embrace. “Alright,” he said softly. “Let’s go.” </p>
<p>Harry smiled and kissed Draco’s cheek whilst giving him a squeeze. Then he unwrapped his arms from around Draco and took his hand instead. Together, they headed out of the dormitory and made their way through the castle and into the grounds. </p>
<p>They continued on their way until they finally reached the sign that read ‘Welcome to Hogsmeade’ on it and Draco slowed down. </p>
<p>Harry squeezed his hand gently. “It’s fine,” he said softly. “Come on.” </p>
<p>Draco nodded and they passed under the sign and into the village.</p></div>
