    <p>The mid-June afternoon heat proves unforgivable this year, and Remus once again is thankful for the central air conditioning in their flat. He’d tried to go out before, when he’d woken up, feeling groggy and in need of iced coffee and maybe a nice walk in the summer air, but once outside he realized how ruthless the sun’s rays were and came back in straight away. Sirius had been stepping out of the shower when Remus came in the front door. He’d taken one look at Remus’ forehead, dripping with sweat, and laughed, planting his lips across Remus’ wet hair as he told him he’d grab him a coffee on his way home.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius had been getting ready for a meeting with some investors of one type or another. In March, Sirius had proposed that the coffee shop feature a layered rainbow smoothie in honor of the anniversary of when gay marriage had been legalized in England. It had quickly gone viral on Instagram, and since then, the shop had been packed and the calls from people looking to buy the shop or open up new locations have flooded in. Sirius was there now, in the office of whoever was offering him a deal today, with James probably Lily as well. The whole thing made Remus’ head spin, especially considering the only person who’d tried to explain any of it to him was Sirius, and Sirius himself didn’t have a clue what was going on. It was exciting to Sirius regardless, considering he’d come up with the idea, and when Harry showed it to him on Instagram, he’d said, “See, I’m not old, Moony! I still know what the kids like!” having long since revived the old, failed nickname, back when Emmy was a toddler and unable to say his name properly. “Moony” had been easy for her, and so it had finally stuck.</p><p> </p><p>Between the image of Sirius crowing “Moony” into his ear, the heat of the sun amplified by the glass window, and the cool rush of the air conditioner from the vent above the couch, Remus is unable to focus on his current task, which is planning lessons for the coming year. Having just received his PhD in English in the spring from UCL after finally, <em> finally </em> finishing his dissertation, Remus was promptly offered a teaching job by the head of the English department, who had been very interested in his work and adored him, both as a professor and a friend. So now he’s trying to organize syllabi for his first ever classes as a full time professor, borrowing from classes he has taken and classes he has taught while earning his degree. Still, he’ll have to reread all of the books and poems he’s planning to teach before he can put them on the syllabus for sure, and he’s honestly rather looking forward to a summer stretched on the couch with a book, highlighter, and pen in hand. If only he could get his mind off of Sirius…</p><p> </p><p>“Hello,” Sirius greets with glee, banging the front door open suddenly enough to make Remus nearly fall off the couch. “I have a present for you,” he adds, presenting Remus with an enormous iced coffee, light and sweet, just as he likes it.</p><p> </p><p>“Just in time for me to forgive you for almost making me piss myself,” he acknowledges, taking the cold drink from Sirius’ outstretched hand. It’s mocha flavored; he closes his eyes and any minor annoyance drifts away.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m just in a good mood,” Sirius protests, moving a pile of books and papers to sit down beside Remus on the couch. “Not all of us had to spend our morning staring at Shakespeare.”</p><p> </p><p>“It is my privilege to do so, actually,” Remus protests, closing his laptop before it can be pried from his hands. Lately, Sirius has been <em> full </em> of energy, and he’s been a handful to put up with, to say the least. However, as Remus is always the focus of his attention, he can hardly say he minds. “How did it go?”</p><p> </p><p>“Splendidly, I think,” Sirius answers, beaming like a puppy, “James was happy, so I imagine that’s a good sign. Lily’s been bugging him to just take an offer already. She’s getting sick of all these meetings.”</p><p> </p><p>“I would be, too,” Remus murmurs, leaning in to kiss Sirius softly, “If you weren’t getting dressed up every time you had one. I’d take any excuse to see you in a suit.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius laughs, softly now, as his lips brush Remus’ ear. “You know, all you have to do is ask, love,” he purrs in response. His right arm curls around Remus’ back, and his left hand reaches for Remus’ own, matching golden rings glinting in the sunlight. Remus leans easily into his arms, honestly thankful for the distraction.</p><p> </p><p>“But if you’re here, then you could just be naked,” Remus corrects, sinking into the soft cotton of Sirius’ shirt. When Sirius looks nice, he looks <em> nice </em>. His long black hair is straight and sleek despite the dizzying humidity outside, and he’s wearing carefully ironed black pants, expensive dress shoes, a long navy blue tie, and a pale blue button up that make his eyes pop, which they do, beautifully so, when Remus looks into them. Sirius is smiling at him, too, as if he’s just revealed an incredible secret to him. Remus loves when Sirius pretends to be surprised by how much he adores the man.</p><p> </p><p>“I could be naked?” he asks, raising his eyebrows. “I could. And it’s hot, here, in the sun,” he adds, carefully taking his hand back from Remus’ to undo his tie. Remus takes the moment to simply lie back in Sirius’ lap, resting his head against the arm of the couch. Remus himself is wearing whatever Sirius wore to bed last night, which he found discarded on their bedroom floor this morning. He’d pulled shorts on, too, when he’d tried to leave this morning, but those have since gone the way of his journey to the coffee shop. Sirius is looking at him like he’s never looked better.</p><p> </p><p>“It is,” Remus comments idly, reaching up to unbutton his dress shirt for him. “I don’t know how you’re not sweating to death, honestly, just from the walk up from the car.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius barks out a laugh, his hands slipping around Remus’ hips now that he doesn’t need to undress himself. “It’s hot, but it’s not <em> that bad </em>,” Sirius says, and it’s probably true for Sirius, because Sirius likes to present himself as Just Too Beautiful to sweat, Remus thinks. Of course, he knows different, having seen Sirius’ hair plastered to his forehead with sweat on the pillow next to his own, but in front of other people, and in a suit like this? Sirius wouldn’t be caught dead sweating. He is a miracle of nature, honestly. Sometimes Remus thinks it’s a real shame that he doesn’t model, because his talents are being wasted.</p><p> </p><p>When he gets the shirt open, Sirius is wearing a plain white tank top underneath. It clings to his chest in all the right way. Remus breathes in deep and smells outside and coffee and cologne and a hint of sweat and it just smells like Sirius, deep and beautiful. “I couldn’t work all morning,” Remus admits, “I’ve gotten spoiled in the last two months, being home with you all the time. I think I’m probably going to explode of loneliness when I have to go back to school.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius snorts, but runs his fingers through Remus’ hair comfortingly anyway. “<em> Back to school </em>. Sounds ridiculous, coming out of the mouth of a twenty-five year old man.” He traces Remus’ lips with his thumb to illustrate. It’s still cold from the coffee he’d been holding.</p><p> </p><p>“To <em> work </em>, is that better? Though, truthfully, I’ve learned more teaching than I ever have taking classes.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know, I know, you wank yourself raw analyzing Ode to a Grecian Urn with a bunch of 18 year olds,” Sirius jokes. His lips turn up just so at the end. Remus knows that smile, and he knows that it means that Sirius is just looking for a reaction from him.</p><p> </p><p>“I end up raw without any wanking all the time,” Remus says, wiggling his eyebrows lasciviously at Sirius. This is another thing he has gotten from Sirius in all the years they’ve spent together: his overtly sexual sense of humor. “And anyway, don’t be so disparaging about it, I seem to remember you liking me just fine when I was 18.”</p><p> </p><p>“But you’re you,” Sirius says, as if that explains things on its own. He puts his hand along the side of Remus’ jaw, running a thumb over his cheek. Remus quite likes when Sirius touches him tenderly like that, like he’s something to be treasured. He’d never admit it, but Sirius seems to have figured it out well enough on its own. “Also, don’t pretend I satisfy you for my sake. I know, I’m old, I’m sure I’m asleep long before you’re sated.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Sated </em>,” Remus mocks, laughing. “You’re losing your touch, I think. If you ever describe my sex drive like that again I think it may actually just shrivel up and die.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius grins, watching Remus’ eyes like a beautiful work of art. He knows this routine well enough to know exactly what’s happening; Sirius is making him laugh by saying stupid things on purpose and then marveling at his pale brown eyes sparkling and crinkling in the sunlight. “The day that happens is the day that I, too, shrivel up and die.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re nothing if not libidinous, I’m perfectly aware,” Remus agrees idly, grinning despite himself at Sirius’ dramatics.</p><p> </p><p>“And I get mocked for the word ‘sated’,” Sirius complains, eyebrows crinkling. <em> He looks cute </em>, Remus thinks, but then, Remus is always thinking that. “I swear, sometimes I regret the day I offered to pay for Uni for you.”</p><p> </p><p>“One of us needs to be literate,” Remus says. He feels so peaceful, here in Sirius’ arms. He loves their routine. Even though it changes with his own changing schedule, they always find time for moments like this, soft cuddling with light banter, and Remus spends all of the rest of his time waiting to be right here again.</p><p> </p><p>“Speaking of degrees,” Sirius segways tactfully, “Now that you’re finally, <em> finally </em> done with yours, all twelve billion of them—”</p><p> </p><p>“Two,” Remus corrects, raising an eyebrow, “And undergrad and then continuing the same subject in a PhD program hardly counts as two separate degrees, even—anyway, what are you about to make me do now?”</p><p> </p><p>Remus regrets his word selection when he sees hurt in Sirius’ eyes, and quickly reaches to take his hands in his own. “I never make you do anything,” Sirius says, still focused determinedly on Remus’ eyes. “But I was going to bring up the idea of a baby again.”</p><p> </p><p><em> Oh </em> , Remus thinks, and of course, that is where Sirius was going. He’s been surprised, actually, that Sirius hasn’t mentioned it already this summer. Sirius has hounded him at least once a year about wanting a child, and Remus has told him every time, <em> when I’m done with school </em>. Now, here they are. Remus looks into Sirius’ eyes and sees hope, and he remembers Emmy, before princess lip gloss kits invaded, when she used to toddle around in cute tiny sandals and little pink dresses and coo and call him ‘Moony’ and pull his hair and giggle her sweet little laughs, and he sees in Sirius’ eyes how much he wants that, the emptiness he sees in their flat without a child toddling around their living room like that, and he finds himself really seeing this vision Sirius has of them as Parents for the first time.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” he says after a moment. It’s easier than he thought it would be; he’s known Sirius has wanted this for over five years now, but here it is, finally. Now, he wants it too.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius looks surprised. Remus can see 7,000 defenses and reasons lined up carefully on the tip of his tongue, and of all the answers he’d expected, Remus can tell “okay” was not one of them. His eyebrows push together, and he stares into Remus’ brown eyes for nearly an entire minute before he grins. “Really?” he asks.</p><p> </p><p>“Really,” Remus says. He hasn’t considered this, not really, not in the present sense, but since Sirius has come into his life, he’s made all important decisions spur of the moment like this, from dating Sirius to choosing a university to picking what to study, and it’s all worked out fairly well. “I have no idea how exactly we’re supposed to go about this, but really.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well,” Sirius says, lighting up at the fact that Remus is <em> finally </em> ready to listen to the options. “There’s adoption, of course, but we could—”</p><p> </p><p>“How about we talk about this over lunch?” Remus says softly, finally beginning to stand. “This is important; let’s do it properly. Give me thirty minutes to shower and get dressed.”</p><p> </p><p>Sirius nods immediately. Even as he pushes into the bathroom, Remus can feel Sirius’ wide eyes and massive grin on his back.</p><p> </p><p>******</p><p><br/>Eventually, after Sirius attempts research and Remus grows sick of answering his questions about basic biology, he and Sirius decide to go see a fertility specialist to see what their options are.</p><p> </p><p>The doctor explains to them that, of course, they will need a surrogate for any of the options, but that they could provide sperm and use an egg either from their surrogate if they would like to or from a donor, which would then be fertilized and implanted into the surrogate. He then introduces a third option, which answers the questions Sirius had tried (and failed) to google.</p><p> </p><p>“There is another way, but it’s something brand new. Obviously, the idea of using both of your DNA rather than a donor’s at all would be the best option, and there’s been research on how to make this work for a long time. Essentially, the way it’s done is that we take germ line stem cells from one of you. Normally, these would develop into a sperm, but we’re able to kind of ‘trick’ the cell into developing into an egg instead, and the egg can then be fertilized by the other partner’s sperm. We’ve seen a lot of success with the method we’re currently using to do this, but obviously, it’s something that’s really very new. It’s also quite expensive,” he warns.</p><p> </p><p>Sirius gives Remus a determined look, and Remus smiles thankfully at the doctor. He’s excited, of course, just like he knows Sirius is, but all he can think as Sirius’ big gray eyes bore into him is, <em> poor Lily </em>.</p><p> </p><p>******</p><p> </p><p>A few nights later, they invite the Potters over for dinner at their flat. Him and Sirius spend the late afternoon shopping and cooking; they pick up ingredients for dinner (homemade fish and chips) and dessert (sticky toffee pudding) along with a couple bottles of white wine, and Sirius jokes about how domestic they are, and Remus knocks him down a peg by insisting that their food choices aren’t exactly suited for anyone with a refined palette.</p><p> </p><p>When they get back home, they bake together, Sirius getting flour handprints on Remus’ butt while Remus pretends to be angry. While it’s in the oven, Remus cuts up potatoes and batters fish, and Sirius fries. Sirius is poking at a piece of fish in the pan of bubbling oil when there’s a knock on their door, so Remus goes to greet them.</p><p> </p><p>“Remus!” Emmy screams immediately as the door opens, throwing herself at him. He catches her only because he expects it, grinning at her enthusiasm and kissing her on the forehead.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi love, how was your day?” he asks her, shooting James, Lily, and Harry a smile as they come inside and hang their coats up.</p><p> </p><p>“It was okay. Mommy took me to the park,” she says, her tight hug finally losing its strength. He sets her down and helps her take her coat off.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s a big girl, Remus, she knows how to work a zipper,” Lily tells him, grinning. James has already run off, probably in the kitchen pestering Sirius as they speak, but Harry waits for a hug, too. Every time he sees Harry, he has a hard time believing how big he is. When Emmy’s coat is up on the rack, Remus turns around to pull Harry into a hug.</p><p> </p><p>“Enjoying your last summer before real responsibilities start setting in?” Remus teases.</p><p> </p><p>Harry sighs as he steps back and reaches a hand up to mess up his hair. It’s astonishing the way he does it, exactly the same way James does. “I’ll be enjoying it a lot more a few weeks from now,” he says, referring to his 18th birthday. “Though I am excited to take classes with all of the talented professors at UCL. Especially one Professor Lupin,” he jokes.</p><p> </p><p>They walk into the kitchen together, mostly because Remus is afraid of James, Sirius, and an 8 year old being in the same room as a pan of hot oil, even if Lily is there to watch them. “I wouldn’t be if I were you. I’ve been working on what I’m going to teach all summer and I still have no idea.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sure you’ll pick some good stuff,” Harry reassures him, taking out five wine glasses. Lily shoots him a look like, <em> I really wish you wouldn’t until your birthday </em>, but Harry ignores it entirely. Remus sets them around the table at each place setting and Harry begins pouring white wine into the glasses. “You’ve read like every book ever written so you’d be able to judge, if anyone.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, but he’s only read them all <em> once </em>,” Sirius justifies. Remus shoots him a glare, and Sirius grins at him innocently before looking away to take the last piece of fish out of the pan. “He’s gotta go through another two times before he can decide. You should see him every day, laying on the couch covered in books from 9 am until bedtime. I’m afraid one day they’ll crush him to death, and his last words will be in iambic pentameter. It’ll be tragic, truly.”</p><p> </p><p>James ushers Emmy into a seat, and Remus helps Sirius bring everything to the table. Harry is already halfway through his wine and Lily’s mouth is doing That Thing it does when she’s mildly disappointed. Remus often wonders if Harry would irritate his mother less if Remus had been there to mediate Sirius’ behavior around him from the beginning, but wondering is useless, because they are here, and Harry takes great pleasure in mildly annoying his mother.</p><p> </p><p>“You two are so domestic, it’s precious,” James comments as he loads Emmy’s plate up. “Sirius couldn’t be trusted with frying anything before you, Remus.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, well, if things go horribly wrong one day and Sirius and I end up bitter and divorced, it’ll all be worth it as he’ll always know how to make fish and chips,” Remus remarks dryly, passing the dish of fish to Lily on his right.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry darling, you’re stuck with me for life,” Sirius purrs at him. “And regardless, I most definitely taught you how to cook. So James can shove it.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus watches Emmy mutilate her piece of fried fish with her fork. He thinks of all her energy, how much the four of them have put into her and all they have left to do before she’s an independent person, and he feels drained just thinking about it. He thinks about starting over again from day one, him and Sirius with a child of their own, and feels exhausted already, but he also feels <em> excited </em>. And then he wonders if they’re completely insane for wanting this.</p><p> </p><p>It isn’t until after dessert that they get a chance to talk to Lily seriously. Emmy has fallen asleep and Sirius has tucked her into bed in the guest room, and everyone has switched from wine to tea. Harry in particular looks a bit tipsy, getting up to use the bathroom much more frequently than normal. Remus finds it hilarious, honestly, and can’t wait to take Harry out drinking for his birthday. They’ve gotten really close as Harry has matured, unmanageable as his rebellious teenage energy may be.</p><p> </p><p>“You have something important to say,” Lily says suddenly, after a too-long moment of silence. Sirius looks startled, and then blushes. Remus merely smiles serenely at his husband.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, yes,” Sirius says at last. “It’s kind of a lot.” He pauses nervously, swirling his cup of tea for something else to focus on besides Lily’s piercing green eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, for God’s sake, Sirius,” Remus tells him, gripping his thigh under the table for strength. “Sirius and I went to see a reproductive endocrinologist the other day to ask about our options. You know, for having a baby.”</p><p> </p><p>“Uhh,” Harry says, raising an eyebrow questioningly at them. “I know medical science has come a long way, but I don’t suppose that’s quite possible yet.”</p><p> </p><p>Remus shoots him a look, much more playful than his mother’s look, and Harry takes a big gulp of tea and looks away. “He told us that there’s a new method they have that would actually allow us to have a biological child, and Sirius is absolutely convinced that this is what he wants to do.”</p><p> </p><p>Lily is looking at them oddly. She’s silent for a long moment. Sirius is red in the face and refuses to look up from his lap. James just looks confused. “Remus,” she says after a moment. “Surely I’m not the only person with a uterus that you two know.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh <em> god </em> ,” Harry yelps, nearly falling out of his chair. “Am I supposed to leave the room? No one told me we were going to be talking about—about <em> that </em>! I don’t want to hear about that. I don’t want to know that exists,” he cries frantically.</p><p> </p><p>Lily looks quite amused now despite the lingering worry lines. “You were in there for nine months dear, don’t be so horrified. In any case, Sirius… I know we’ve talked about this before, I know I’ve told you in the past that I’d do it in a heartbeat, but you haven’t mentioned it in a while.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry looks as if he may be sick. Remus grins at him, but he doesn’t look so amused. Sirius clears his throat, finally, and says, “You know Remus and I don’t spend too much time around women. Neither of us is all that interested, really.”</p><p> </p><p>Lily sighs, looking pensively into her mug. Remus is positive he can see the corners of her smile crawling higher on her cheeks, and he knows that the answer is as good as yes. He suddenly wishes they’d gotten flowers, or a nice bottle of wine for Lily to enjoy before… well, but he quickly realizes that it’d be out of place, in their little family, to make a polite gesture like that. Just as Lily and James have never offered anything special in return for Sirius and Remus’ coparenting of their children, Remus cannot offer Lily a gift in exchange for her doing this for them. It seems a bit weird, at times, to Remus, until he remembers that Lily and James and Sirius have all known each other since they were very young, and while they have all developed manners (somewhat, he thinks, though Sirius’ interpersonal skills are neither here nor there), those manners have not translated to their relationships with one another. Remus tilts his head curiously, refocusing on Lily. Truth be told, she’s mentioned to him that she’d like to be pregnant again before it’s too late. Her red hair curtains in front of her in curly tendrils, blocking her smile from Sirius’ view. “I adore the two of you with all my heart. You know that I do, I’d do anything for either of you. But Sirius, I’m 35 years old. I’m not exactly in my prime baby carrying years. I don’t know if it’ll take, and IVF is expensive. I don’t want to sign us all up for heartache.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, of course you’d have to see the doctor and see if you’re a suitable surrogate,” Sirius says quickly. His cheeks are flushed with hope, leaning forward across the table to try to catch Lily’s eye. “If you’re not, you’re not, but I had to ask, Lil. You know I’ve wanted this, well. For longer than I’m willing to admit, really. The thought of being able to do this, to have a child that’s really <em> ours </em>… it’s more than I ever could’ve hoped for.”</p><p> </p><p>Lily’s smiling up at him now, tucking her unruly hair behind her ear, soaking in the desire in his big blue eyes. “Okay,” she agrees. “We’ll go see this doctor and see what he says. You practically raised my children, the least I could do is see if it’s even possible for me to do this.”</p><p> </p><p>“And if it is?” Sirius asks. Remus sees the longing in his eyes; he can’t imagine how Lily would ever be able to say no and break his heart, if she weren’t on board. If Remus was in her seat, he’d say yes just to get Sirius to stop making that face. Then again, Lily is much better at saying no to Sirius than he is.</p><p> </p><p>“If I am, then we’ll talk to the doctor about the logistics,” she promises. “I don’t want to get your hopes up, Sirius, we’re not in our 20s anymore. IVF <em> is </em> expensive,” she repeats, her concerns having gone unaddressed, “and I don’t know how many tries it’ll take if it even does ever work. I’m practically ready for menopause.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re a good 15 years away,” Remus admonishes. Lily looks up at him now, and the coy facade she had up to keep Sirius’ celebrations at bay vanishes when their eyes connect, giving way to a joy and happiness that nearly outshines Sirius’. He sees the loving tease hovering in the curve of her smile and the green of her eyes: <em> You want to be a daddy. </em> Remus grins back helplessly, and clears his throat. “And I’ve told him how expensive it’ll be; he won’t even listen.”</p><p> </p><p>“How do you feel?” James asks finally, breaking his blank speculative gaze to look at Remus.</p><p> </p><p>“Sirius has been pestering me about a baby since before we got married,” Remus says, taking Sirius’ hand on the tabletop now. Lily smirks, eyeing their contact, as if they haven’t been married for years. “And I’ve always put it off because I’ve felt I wasn’t ready, but this time it feels right. I’m done with school, and with the success you guys are having with the shop, Sirius will really be able to pull away as much as he’d like to spend time with the baby. It just seems right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll do it,” Lily says suddenly, looking at Remus with an odd, loving smile. “If I’m healthy enough to, if the doctor says it’s worth trying, I’ll do it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Lily, I could fucking kiss you,” Sirius says, grinning widely now. Despite knowing Lily would say yes, despite having told Sirius <em> no kids yet </em> time and time again, Remus thinks he might cry, and really, really hopes that he doesn’t, because then they’ll all be a mess, and it’s too early for that, to be sitting around the kitchen table crying into their tea.</p><p> </p><p>“I may vomit, if you do,” Harry warns. Sirius waggles his eyebrows at him and he mimes gagging into his cup of tea, and they both laugh a little bit too hard.</p><p> </p><p>This is going to happen, Remus realizes. One way or another, whether Lily is able to be their surrogate or not, he and Sirius are going to have a baby. He feels nauseous, lightheaded, and clammy, but most of all, he’s thrilled at the prospect. His mind is suddenly filled with an image of him and Sirius taping paint samples on the wall in an empty room in their new home, arguing over eggshell or pineapple cream or mint, and that used to make his stomach churn but now he wants it, quite badly. Sirius squeezes his hand so hard his fingers turn white. He squeezes right back.</p>
