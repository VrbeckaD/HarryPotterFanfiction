  <span>“Hello Veronica, how are you feeling today?”  Hermione asked as she checked the girl’s vitals.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sleepy.”  The patent answered with a slight slur.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, that is the medicine.”  She explained as she held the twelve-year-old girl’s hand up for inspection.  Hermione’s heart sank as she noted the very tips had started to darken in color.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t like it, Healer Granger.”  Veronica shook her head and frowned up at the woman.  “It feels weird all the time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, only a little longer.”  Hermione lied and smiled at the girl.  There was no reason to frighten her, no reason to make her last few days of sanity any more uncomfortable than they already were. When the girl started to shake, she administered another dose of sleeping aid and headed back to her lab.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time she made it back to her desk, she was already writing the new symptoms down in the girl’s file.  With Veronica, it made six cases in the last three months, and they were still no closer to figuring out where the new illness had come from or any way of even slowing its progression.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione had been put on the Black Soul Delirium’s team right out of her internship, and though she had had high hopes in the beginning, with each new case, hope died a little more.  Veronica was the youngest victim so far, but without being able to tell how the disease spread, there was no hope she would be the last.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she set aside her notes, she saw a message from the lead Healer on her team and opened it with a frown.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>See me in my office as soon as you are able.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The message was direct, and to the point, it was one of the few things she liked about the old Healer.  She set down her work and headed to his office. He wouldn’t call her away from her tests if it weren’t something important.  Maybe there had been some breakthrough. Perhaps she wouldn’t be forced to does a twelve-year-old with the Draught of Living Death in the morning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wanted to see me, Sir?”  She asked as she stood in the Healer’s doorway.  To her surprise, the Minister of Magic himself sat across from her superior.  She smiled at Kingsley tiredly and looked between the two men with confusion. “What are you doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Minster has brought something to our attention that needs serious consideration.  Please close the door; this is of a sensitive nature.” Healer Thumblewick ordered as he motioned to the door and then the chair next to Kingsley.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her smile disappeared at the hardened look in her friend’s eyes.  With a simple nod, she closed the door and took her seat next to the Minister.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This offer was sent to my office three days ago.  I want you to know that I seriously considered burning it and never letting you see it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it?”  She asked, getting worried from the haunted look in Kingsly’s eyes.  “What could be so bad?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The only reason I am passing it on is I know how serious we need to take this Black Shivers threat while the victim count is still relatively low.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Someone is offering help?  How could that be bad? What does that have to do with me?”  Hermione asked as she started to get frustrated that he hadn’t answered any of her questions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think you should just show her the letter, Mr. Minster.”  Thumblewick offered, and Hermione found herself on the edge of her seat at the man pulled a scroll from the desk and handed it to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had a green seal that had been broken, and the image in the wax made her stomach drop.  She suddenly knew precisely why Kingsly hadn’t wanted to show her the message. It had been three years since Harry had subdued the Dark Lord.  Three years with him locked away in the very bowels of Azkaban. Three years was now long enough to forget or forgive the horrors he had set upon the world.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have got to be kidding me!”  She snapped as she shot to her feet.  She didn’t even want to touch the scroll, let alone read it.  “What could </span>
  <em>
    <span>he</span>
  </em>
  <span> possibly have to offer?  Who’s letting him write letters at all?!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hermione.  Just read it.  You know I wouldn’t bring something like this to you if it wasn’t possibly worth it.”  Kingsley held the scroll out towards her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She snatched the letter from the minister’s hand, and her boss made a displeased sound in the back of his throat.  They didn’t exactly get along regularly, but she knew he was at least a competent Healer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She took a breath before opening the letter and looking over the perfectly neat handwriting she knew all too well.  After the war was over, Hermione had made it her mission to score the Hogwarts archives for every piece of anything Tom Riddle had ever written.  With him still alive, she knew they couldn’t rest. They needed to be prepared for his next wave of horror when it came. Her report had been laughed at by most, but Kingsley had taken it with the gratitude of someone who knew the danger they still faced.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Mr. Minsiter,</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I wish to offer a gesture of goodwill.  It has come to my attention that the wizarding world has a new threat to the safety of wizards, such as myself.  After much consideration on how I could best serve the wizarding world, I have come up with what I feel is a fair proposal. I wish to speak to Miss. Hermione Granger on what it would cost the Ministry for my help in this matter.  I will only make my offer to Miss. Granger herself and I will know if you choose to send some imposter in her stead. I am sure your advisors have told you how much time means when fighting a new illness, and you are an intelligent enough man to know how much time my brilliance could save in lives.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>~Lord Voldemort</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“How did he know?” Hermione asked as she looked between the two men.  They both looked unimpressed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am sure his guards told him about the disease.  It has been all over the papers this month.”  Thumblewick said dismissively.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wizards like myself’”  She read the message to the two men who still looked clueless.  She sighed. “The only connection any of the victims have is that they are all of mixed blood.  They all have one magical parent and one muggle. Just like him. That little gem hasn’t been in the papers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kingsley frowned as he considered what she had to say while Thumblewick looked unimpressed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think you are reading too much into the line.  What is important here is that he is willing to help, and we are at a dead end.”  The Healer pointed out, making Hermione frown all the more. He wasn’t wrong.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There is no doubt in my mind this is some kind of trap, but I don’t think we can dismiss the offer either.  Not with what could be at stake.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You want me to go to Azkaban to see him myself.  Go see exactly what he wants to help us here?” Hermione asked, but she already knew the answer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why is this even a question?” Thumblewick hissed.  “We are talking about the most brilliant mind alive in the world today if he wishes to help. If he could be useful than we could save lives. We could stop this before it truly becomes an epidemic.  You are going.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The choice is hers”  Kingsley pressed as he eyed the older man.  “She would be the one taking the main risk here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What risk?  He’s locked up in the most secured cell ever created in wizard history.  She is playing messenger, that is all. You will do this.” Thumblewick turned on her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can do it.”  She agreed before Kingsley could yell at her superior any more.  “He’s right. It’s only taking a message.” She said even as Hermione thought of what she would say to the mass murderer when she saw him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wasn’t playing this game.  It was far too risky to even think of accepting Voldemort's offer, but if she told them what she planned to say they would probably stop her from going.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure?”  Kingsley asked one last time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She said she would do it; you can go as soon as you have your things together.  We want any information as soon as we can get it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure.” Hermione agreed, feeling resolute as her plan formed in her mind.</span>
