  <strong>1959-62<strong></strong></strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Cassiopeia blinks curiously down at the little, wrinkly, pink thing in the cradle that Kreacher is rocking.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“His name is Sirius Orion Black the third, and he’s Heir to the Black family after your father.” Her mother’s voice doesn’t change from it’s usual sneer, so Cassiopeia stays quiet. Her mother leaves without another word, but she stays, curious about Sirius. She’s never seen a baby boy before, but he’s not too different from what she remembers Andi looked like as a baby. Cassiopeia reaches into the cradle and runs a gentle finger along his cheek.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Sirius.” She tilts her head as she murmurs the name. Andi and Bella call her Cass or Cassie. Just like Andromeda is Andi and Bellatrix is Bella. “Siri.” Much better. Siri reaches up towards her when she changes her hair color to a light blue instead of the gold blonde she usually has.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Cass giggles slightly as Bella and Andi stare at their new baby sister, Narcissa. The now five kids are in a sitting room with Kreacher watching over them. Siri starts to babble happily as Cass starts to flicker her hair through different colors.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“It’s pretty cool that you got the family ability,” Andi says softly, coming to sit next to her. Cass wiggles her eyebrows as her eyes change colors.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“I think so too. Now, Narcissa is a mouthful, just like Bellatrix, Andromeda, and Cassiopeia. What’s her nickname going to be?” The six year old and four year old sisters look at each other as the seventh month old boy crawls into Cass’ lap.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Cissa,” Bella declares, and Andi nods with a smile.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“I like Cissa.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Walburga’s entire face puckers as she realizes what Sirius’ first word is. Orion looks no better, like he just bit into a lemon.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Cass,” Siri repeats, grey eyes bright. Druella rolls her eyes as Cass pulls her brother closer. Bella and Andi are looking back and forth between the seven year old and her mother.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“She’s three for three, now. I wonder if Narcissa’s first word will also be some version of Cassiopeia’s name.” Grandfather Arcturus, Lord Black, gives Cass a look she can’t understand, but she doesn’t think it’s negative, unlike her parents’.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>It is. Cissa ends up saying her first word as she takes her first steps. Cass’ eyes are locked onto the little eleven month old girl waddling towards her.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Cass, Cass, Cass,” she babbles, and the eight year old picks her up when she starts to fall. Bella and Andi are cheering as Cass dances around the room with her little cousin, and Siri starts clapping and giggling in the excitement.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Siri’s almost two when Regulus is born. The two siblings are in the baby’s room, Walburga and Orion already in bed.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“What do you want his nickname to be?” Cass asks softly, holding Siri on her hip so he can see their little brother better.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“He’s wrinkly.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“So were you. And Cissa and Andi, too.” Siri seems to debate for a moment.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Reggie.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Alright, Reggie it is.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>The first time it happens, Cass is at Grandfather Arcturus’. Orion floos him to inform him that there was an assassination attempt on Sirius, and Cass feels like her heart stops. Once the call ends, her grandfather turns to her and sets a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Breathe, child. Sirius is okay.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“I don’t believe them.” It slips out before she can stop it, immediately wincing at her lack of control.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“That he’s okay?” When she doesn’t respond, he tilts her chin up at him. “Answer me, Cassiopeia. I will not get angry with you.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“That it was an assassination attempt,” she murmurs.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“And what makes you say that, child?” She straightens up, meeting his gaze head on. She needs him to believe her. Adults tend to take her more seriously when she sounds like them, when they can forget that she’s a child.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Ever since Regulus was born, they have been becoming cruel towards Sirius. Regulus is a better behaved child for them, and I fear they would prefer to have him as the Heir Black instead of Sirius.” He frowns at her.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Who told you Sirius was the Heir?”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Mother.” Grey eyes so like Siri’s study her, and she waits for a reaction. He just hands her another book.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>She’s five for five when Reggie’s first word is ‘Cass’. Siri’s thrilled when his second is ‘Siri’.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong></strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>

<p>
  <strong>1964-68<strong></strong></strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Cass leans out the window to wave at Siri and Reggie as the Hogwarts’ Express pulls out of the station. Once out of sight, she sits back down, feeling weird without her little brothers and cousins by her side. Bella will join her next year, so she’s not too worried that Cygnus and Druella can alter her beliefs too drastically, as long as Cass writes her letters often. The door slides open, and Rodolphus Lestrange enters the compartment, Avery, Malfoy, and the Carrows with him. Wonderful.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Black.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Lestrange.” She arches an eyebrow as they fill the compartment.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“What house do you think you’ll get?” Malfoy drawls, trying to lean back in a confident manner. Cass just finds it forced.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she answers, “Slytherin. Obviously.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“It is the best house.” She turns her gaze on the snickering Carrows, debating on whether or not it’s time to step away from her parents’ shadow. Sirius and Regulus flash through her mind, Siri’s bravery despite the consequences, Reggie’s inhalation of knowledge, and she decides that yes, it is time.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“No, it’s just the one that suits the qualities I possess.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“I value ambition and cunning, therefor, Slytherin fits me best. It’s that simple.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“And what would your parents think of that?” She glares at Malfoy, eyes flashing red.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“You tell them, and I’ll sew your mouth shut.” The compartment falls silent, so she flashes him an innocent grin.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>It’s Yule break, and Cass is curled in her bed at Grimmauld Place with Siri and Reggie. She’s telling Siri about Hogwarts as Reggie naps. She’s describing the Prewett twins, two of the Gryffindor boys three years older than her, when he starts to fidget.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Problem, Siri?”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Mother and Father told me that anyone not pure is beneath us. They listed off several family names that are considered bloodtraitors. Prewett was one of them.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Our parents have outdated and backwards views that show just how stuck in their own sense of superiority they are. Your best bet is to run whatever they teach you by me, and I’ll help you figure out what you actually want to remember. Okay?” He nods slowly, so she presses a kiss to his forehead. “Perfect.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Bella hides her beam as the Sorting Hat calls out Slytherin, and the 11 year old sits down beside Cass. She squeezes her wrist as Lucius and Rodolphus congratulate her. She turns to Cass with wide black eyes.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Are you still going to try out for Slytherin Seeker?” She nods without hesitation, and Alecto Carrow snorts in derision. Bella sneers at him, but Cass just squeezes her wrist again.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Want to make a bet, Carrow?”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“On?”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Ten galleons says that my quidditch tryout has you speechless.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“You trying out, Black?” She glances down at Pucey, the quidditch captain, and nods.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“You’re on,” Carrow snarls.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Cass swings to stop in front of the stands after her tryout, grinning at the group there.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Well? Am I ten galleons richer?”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Yes,” Greengrass answers with a smirk, the third year leaning against the railing.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Excellent,” she purrs, and Pucey flies by with shouted words of acceptance. Her grin grows.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Third year starts on an interesting note. This year, Cass gets to choose electives. It's easy to cross out divination, since she’s not a seer and that would be pointless. Same with Muggle Studies. She has no interest in that. Runes is an obvious yes, given how often she gravitates towards that section of Grandfather’s library. The only difficulty she comes across is deciding between Care of Magical Creatures and Arithmancy. Care because she loves animals, Arithmancy for the knowledge it holds. </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Merlin, Cassie, again? How many times are you going to stare at that paper?” Cass turns a glare on Bella even as Siri giggles from where he’s laying on her bed. “Just choose already.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Shut up. It’s hard.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“No, it’s not. You’re just overthinking it. Here.” Bella tosses a galleon at Sirius. “Flip that for her. Heads for arithmancy, tails for Care.” Cass watches the gold spin, only to snatch it from the air as it starts to fall.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Cass.” Siri pouts, so she leans closer to ruffle his hair.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Care it is.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Told you, you were overthinking it.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Shut up, Bellatrix.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Miss Black, stay after class, please.” Cass blinks a few times.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Yes, Professor.” The class files out, leaving her alone with Professor Babbling. It’s silent for a few moments as Babbling studies her.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Miss Black, what are your thoughts on the workload?” She frowns lightly at the question.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“It seems easy enough. Was there an issue with my work?”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“No, quite the opposite. Your work tells me that the course load is too easy.” Oh, that.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Yes, Professor, I do find it rather easy. I have gravitated towards the runes section since I was able to read.” She had chosen Runes due to her interest in the subject, only to be incredibly bored with the information being taught.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“I had thought as much. How about this. I give you a test, and then we discuss how far up we need to move you.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“I would appreciate that very much.” If she had known how easy this class was, she would have chosen Arithmancy. Babbling passes over a scroll, which Cass takes and moves back to her desk. Even this ‘harder’ work is easy, and Babbling’s eyes widen as she hands the completed test back. Cass remains in the classroom as the test is graded, knowing Slughorn will just smile at her and invite her to another Slug Club meeting when she explains why she missed his class.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Well Miss Black, my thoughts were correct. I will need to speak with Professor Slughorn to see if your schedule can be altered. Given the level of your work, you can advance to the fifth year class. I would put you in a higher year, except for the fact that you would need your OWL first.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Luckily, fifth year runes coincides with her break. Unluckily, it’s a Gryffindor and Hufflepuff class.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Class hasn’t even started yet, and Cass already finds herself hiding a sneer at the wary and suspicious looks she’s receiving from the fifth years around her. </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. Class, Miss Black will now be joining us for class.” Cass returns Babbling’s smile, ignoring the hostility of the rest of the class. Some of the students pull back as she proves time and time again that she knows what she’s talking about. Other students seem to get even worse as they realize she’s still ahead of them, despite only being 13.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Back in her common room, Cass sits on her favorite couch, relaxing back into the cushions. Not much time passes before she finds herself squished between two people. Cracking her eyes, she hums. Tatius Warrington and Felix Flint. She actually likes these two.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“How was class, Cass?” Tatius asks, reclining back against the couch arm.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“As well as class could be for a lone snake in a room full of badgers and lions. The badgers seemed fine, except for a few. The lions were livid, except for a few. The work is still easy, but I’m not as mindlessly bored.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“You would do better in the Slytherin class.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Yes, but that class is the same time as Transfiguration, and McGonagall will not budge.” Felix sneers lightly.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>

</p>
<p>“So, you’re stuck with the Gryffindors.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Unfortunately.” This is going to be a fun year.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Finally. Cass tosses her trunk on her bed at home, glad another year is over. Flippy pops in, a snap of her fingers cleaning out Cass’s trunk.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Is there any point in arguing with you?”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“No, Mistress Cassie.” She can’t help the small smile at the house elf’s behavior. Before she can prod further, her door opens, Walburga standing there. All of Cass’s defense shoot back up with her mother at her back.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Your Grandfather wishes to see you, Cassiopeia.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Yes, Mother.” Then she’s gone again, and Cass’s shoulders relax a touch. She takes a deep breath to ease the lingering apprehension and places a brief kiss on Flippy’s head. “Thank you for your help, Flippy.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Anything for Mistress Cassie.” She makes her way to the floo, stepping into her Grandfather’s office. She blinks once at the sight of Professor Babbling sitting across from Arcturus, another woman at her side. It only takes a moment to recognize her.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Grandfather, Professor Babbling, Mistress Argryis.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Cassiopeia, as you know, this is Rune Mistress Kira Argyris.” Arcturus motions to the woman. Of course she knows who that is. Kira Argryis is the biggest name in the Runes Academia. “She is an acquaintance of Professor Babbling. The Professor received your OWL the other day, and called Mistress Argyris.” Cass takes a seat with an ease that belies her nerves. Arcturus hands over a paper, and a perfect score, plus extra credit stares up at her. “It would appear she has a proposition.” He’s searching her face for a few moments, apparently satisfied with what he finds, as his chin tilts down slightly in approval.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“I have already discussed it with Dumbledore, and he’s approved,” Babbling starts, looking way too excited. “I don’t think my curriculum will actually teach you anything, and I think it would be a shame not to provide you with an education that will make you flourish. Kira has agreed to take you on as an apprentice if you choose to accept. Dumbledore has agreed to allow her in the castle for your lessons.” The opportunity to learn from a Mistress is literally being handed to her on a silver platter. There’s only one answer, really.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“I would be honored to learn from you, Mistress Argyris.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Andi is also sorted into Slytherin the next year. It’s Cass’ fourth year, and with her two cousins by her side, she works her way into the position of Slytherin’s Queen. She has to have it now in order to have enough influence in three years, because the next Black to walk through those doors will be Siri. And she knows he won’t be in Slytherin.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Cass took her Runes NEWT a month ago, Mistress Argyris refuses to stop her lessons. They meet every Monday and Wednesday night and Friday mornings. But finally, Cass finds it challenging.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“How far are you wanting to take your education?” Mistress Argyris asks one day out of the blue.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Is there a limit?” Her answer causes a tinkling laugh.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think you will ever find a limit to your hunger for knowledge. Do you want to stop here at your NEWTs or would you like to continue into your Mastery?”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Mastery.” No question about it.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Excellent. I received your NEWT score last night, and have spent the day talking with your professors. It was nearly identical to your OWL score, and your professors tell me your work in their class remains impeccable. If we start now, I believe you will be able to acquire your Mastery by the time you graduate. It will be hard work. It usually takes five to ten years, if not more, to achieve this. You will do it in three.” Dark blue eyes pierce hers. “Do you accept?”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“I accept.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>She’s in Grandfather’s library, nose deep in a runes book, when Arcturus drops a letter on the table in front of her. It produces a clunking noise.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Hogwarts letter, Cassiopeia. Do your parents know you’re here?”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“No. They’re still asleep. As are Regulus and Sirius. I told Flippy to retrieve me if any woke.” She puts the book down to open the letter, the Slytherin Prefect badge falling into her hand.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Working on homework, child?”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“I already finished that. This is for the Mastery I intend to get.” Arcturus’ eyes widen.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Mastery?”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Yes, I intend to start obtaining my Runes Mastery this year. Mistress Argyris believes that I can finish by the time I graduate.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Can you handle a Mastery on top of heir training, Prefect duties, OWLs, and quidditch?”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Heir training?” She turns a wide eyed gaze on him.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“I have come to realize that Orion is not a good fit for the Black family in today’s time. You, however, are.” Cass tilts her head, then stands and moves to a section of his library. She comes back with a new book. “Time magic?”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“I have an idea to ensure I stay on top of all of my responsibilities, including those given to me with the title of Slytherin Queen.” She gives him an innocent smile. “Can you, by any chance, acquire a time turner for me?”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Mistress Cassie, Master Orion has awoken.”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Thank you, Flippy. Grandfather, can we keep my heirship a secret until I can use it to protect my siblings and cousins?”</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Yes, my child. I will also look into obtaining a time turner for you.” She curtsies.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>“Thank you, Grandfather. Flippy, let’s return home.” The little house elf smiles up at her and takes her hand, popping them back to Grimmauld Place’s library. She lets loose a sigh, running a hand through her hair. This year is going to be fun. She’s slightly glad the Prewett twins graduated. They were such a pain in the arse to the prefects.</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <strong>
    <strong>
      <strong>
        <strong></strong>
      </strong>
    </strong>
  </strong>
</p>
<p>Her first thought when she steps into the prefect compartment is ‘fuck’. Not very ladylike, or proper, but it’s the only word that springs to mind at Lucius Malfoy’s smug expression.</p>
<p>
