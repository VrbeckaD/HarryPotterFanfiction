  <span>He only loved dragons. It was his true love. With people it was just sex. Great sex, sure. Sometimes friendship. Quite rarely, only with a few. But with dragons it was something much bigger, much better. He knew their hearts. Strong and powerful. He accepted their moods, their malicious temperament, their nasty characters, their dangerous issues. He loved them unconditionally. After all, he was a dragon fancier. Not a dragon tamer, as it was written in his job documents, oh, no. He loved them too much to tame them. He wanted them to be safe and free. He left his country, his family, his beloved quidditch only to be with them. Sometimes he wanted to be one of them. He knew that he also was strong and powerful, no fears, no regrets, no pleasantries. He was rough. But hidden deep inside, well, he had his weaknesses...</span>

  <span>She</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Charlie, Charlie, wake up! The eggs!!!” Jesus, it was 4 a.m., completely dark in this godforsaken country, and he went to bed two hours earlier. After all, a man of his age can have some fun on Saturday night, even deep in Romanian province. And then a lightning came through his poor head. “The eggs?! So early??? It should be one more week!” Charlie jumped out of the bed, without a thought put on his best clothes from the club, that were lying on the chair, and ran towards the barns.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His assistant Max explained the situation. Of course, that young Norwegian Ridgeback female had not enough experience to sit her two eggs properly and they started to hatch too early. It was quite dangerous because she didn't allow anybody to come closer and the team (he always thought of them as of a team, such a quidditch habit) were afraid she could just smash the eggs or the hatchlings could suffocate without air. So the situation was stalemate. And the time was against them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>About an hour later nothing changed. For better or worse, thanks Merlin. Charlie wanted to talk to young dragonesse, he could communicate with dragons, but only when he was able to put his hand or head onto dragon's skin. He not only could interpret dragon's emotions and behaviour (after eighteen years of practice it was much easier), but also knew their thoughts, thanks to his legilimency abilities, totally different thing comparing to human mind-reading. One cannot read dragon's mind, 'cos there's nothing to READ, so to speak. Anyway, the deadlock was exhausting, both for the animal and people. Norgie kept refusing whiskey or meat, watched everybody with wild eyes, stood still above her eggs and was ready to kill anyone who would dare to approach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And suddenly Charlie heard a tiny voice behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good morning. Could I help? She seems to be so scared, doesn't know what to do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everybody turned around. There she stood. Tall for a girl (or a woman?), all slim with long legs in dark jeans. Charlie noticed black heavy boots and short leather jacket. He also noticed strange haircut – black short sides and light blond top of long hair, firmly tied in sort of samurai fashion. And a lot of earrings, in the right ear only. And one more, piercing her eyebrow, on the left side of the face. The face he found pale, triangle and too beautiful with delicate nose and high cheekbones. But he couldn't look at her eyes or her lips. So instead, he asked abruptly: “And you are?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your new intern, Olya Orlowska,” she sounded somehow insecure as if they should have known who she was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yes, sorry, I've forgotten to mention about you to Mr Weasley,” his bloody assistant almost choked. “My bad, your wonderful cv, with recommendations from Mrs Castello (Charlie's eyebrows up with a surprise, well, well...) and all papers came last week, but we were very busy here and I'd forgotten. So sorry,” Max was all red and excited. Seemed the beauty of the girl had thunder effect on this stupid boy. Thanks God, Charlie was a gay!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And all this situation was too much. Charlie was damn tired, tense, worried about Norgie, exhausted and dehydrated after several too many at the club. His frustration burst up in the girl’s face. “Soooo, Miss, what do you suggest in this case?” It was nastly of him, expecting anything of the rookie while all of them couldn’t make any decision. Max glanced at him with disbelief. But the girl was calm. “I’d like to talk to her,” she said. Charlie’s laugh was very unpleasant, on the edge of hysteria. “Oh yeah? Would you probably like your first day of work was the last one of your life… girl?” He was furious. “Are you going to come to the dragon’s </span>
  <span>primipara </span>
  <span>which can’t help her offspring and is mad about it? Yelling, he came very close to her. He wanted to strangle her for her silly bravery. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, sir,” she answered unruffled. “I’m going to talk with her from here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then he just had to look at her. A pair of huge eyes, dark framed. And Merlin. The colour! The colours, in fact. It was a kind of heterochromia. Or whatever. The irises were green and blue and brown, with several hues, smoothly shading from one into another. Never in his life had he seen anything like that! Ok, Teddy changed colours. But it was always ONE colour. And these? Gorgeous. Stunning. Unique. All these thoughts galloped through his mind. It lasted one blink of her eye. And she didn’t wait for his acceptance. She came to the barrier and stood still. Her magic hit them powerfully. They looked at each other. And waited. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Charlie felt the earth combined with fire magic and also some wind power. It was almost impossible. So many? Fire and air was typically dragon magic. How could so young person possess not only them but also the oldest one, the power of Mother Earth? Unthinkable. No, he must have made a mistake in recognising her powers. Yes, it’s the exhaustion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a few minutes of intense silence the dragoness nod her great head and took several steps back. “We can come and help, sir,” this silver voice with a little bit of soft Slavic accent got on Charlie’s nerves. “She calmed down and let us.” Olya smiled happily, not aware of everybody’s stunned look. She was watching only Norgie. With so unabashed and open love that it was almost erotic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. Get to work everybody. I’ll go to my place.” Oh, no, he was not going to thank that little stray. “Max, give her a room.” This was a proper ‘thank you’, wasn’t it?</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>*</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He got up again at about noon, hungry and pissed off. A remembrance of the night made him sick. After breakfast or lunch, whatever, he walked to his office, unshaved and crumpled. And of course, Max put the girl’s papers on his desk. Jesus Christ! Charlie thought that eating scrambled eggs was a big mistake! The date of birth. Fuck! It should have been forbidden! How many? Shit! Only six years older than Teddy. That makes her bloody twenty years younger than...! WTF?! Does it matter anyway? What’s here? Aaaa, a scholarship in Hogwarts, oh-how-surprising, OWLS with flying colours, not only Care of Magical Creatures, but also with too many others. Even Muggle Studies? Bloody Ravenclaws! Then, that posh Yellowstone University with Maria Castello as a mentor. How the hell did that Olya made the Old Lizard to be her mentor? No idea! And sure, sure, a lot of research around the world, and more awards, academic titles, bla bla bla! Disgusting! And what for, may he ask? To end up in Romania? Hmmm, not so far from her birthplace in the Carpathian Mountains anyway. Its name reminded Charlie of something. Something from the distant past. But his head hurt so much… Dim pictures, high peaks, a cave, melted snow, and that awful smell… the smell of burned flesh and fear...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello, Mr Weasley,” he jumped up on his chair and shrugged. “The door was open and I would like to ask you about my job specification, if you would like to... ” She! Fresh and ready! Fuck! His Weasley temperament boiled him up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You do what you are told to! I’m the most demanding boss. It’s not a university!” he waved her diplomas. “You are at the lowest level of the ladder, so to speak. You must obey to everybody! The work is hard and tiring. The payment’s poor! Sooner or later you’ll understand that is not a place for a delicate woman’s hands!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then she laughed. She laughed! “Good, sir! I expected exactly like this. Now I’m going to clean thestrals pooh and brush them. I hope it’s stinky enough to satisfy your anger!” She smirked. “And my hands are very delicate, you know.” With that she marched off, heavy boots resounding firmly. Her slim, boyish figure, that ridiculous two-length, two-coloured hair. Suddenly, Charlie knew he was going to hate her. He was sitting for a long time, unable to put him together. And then a sharp thought stroke him. She was able to see thestrals!</span>
