<p> </p>
<p>  This is not the wisest thing they'd ever done, Tina admitted.</p>
<p>  Hiding in Jacob and Queenie's closet. Back against the locked and silent-charmed door. One leg draped on Newt's shoulder while having his head between her thighs. <em> This is insane. </em> </p>
<p>  Tina wasn't even sure what came over them. They did plan to do it later once they're home. But perhaps the frustration for having their intimate time interrupted since the very morning, and the fact Queenie left the house to pick up Jacob in his new bakery (she forbid them to join, because she and Jacob are preparing some 'surprises' for Tina's birthday today) made Newt decides they shouldn't waste this chance.</p>
<p>  "<em> Newt! </em>" Tina gasped as her husband closed his lips around her clit and sucked. One of Tina's hands tightened its grasp on his messy hair, while the other desperately reached for a hanger next to her.</p>
<p>  The man hummed, delighted by the slight pain on his head as it encouraged him even more. Thumbs kept her lips apart. Alternating between sucking the small bud and diligently licking her. Newt gazed upwards. His lovely wife had her head thrown back against the door. Mouth endlessly releasing heavy sighs and sweet moans, his favorite sound. Oh, how he wanted to see such a view longer, if only they had more time…</p>
<p>  A certain lick on her clit caused Tina to buck her hips forward, crying out her husband's name. Loving the reaction, Newt gave her wetness an appreciative kiss, before closing his eyes and focused more on his task. Pushing his jaw a little further to slide his tongue in. Tina had to cover her mouth with her palm to suppress her scream. Feeling the wet, flexible material caressing her walls. Exploring her. Pleasuring her.</p>
<p>  "I'm c-comingㅡ"</p>
<p>  But just when Tina said that, Newt, to his wife's utter confusion, drew back his tongue and stood up. Tina gave him a protest look, why would he stop when she was <em> this </em> close? "Newtㅡ"</p>
<p>  Her husband interrupted her with a soft kiss. "I'm sorry, Tina, but they could arrive any moment," He said while reaching his trousers, opening the buttons with slightly trembling hands, "I promise i'll make it up to you."</p>
<p>  Tina couldn't help but smile, and gladly offered her assistance, "Let's make it quick then." </p>
<p>  As Newt's trousers now unbuttoned, they pulled down his briefs just enough to release his throbbing length. Newt moaned feeling Tina's thumb gently circling his tip. He hooked the bent of his elbow under her thigh and guided it to circle his waist, while his wife rested her chin on his shoulder. Lining herself up to him. They moaned in unison as Newt finally filled her.</p>
<p>  He didn't bother to start slow. His thrusts were focused and deep, trying to catch up what he'd left earlier. Tina ran her fingers through his ginger hair, caressing them as her mouth hung open.</p>
<p>  Newt raised his head. Gazing at her with half-closed lids, "Like this?"</p>
<p>  "<em> Yes," </em> Tina leaned forward to kiss his lips, "Just like that, darlingㅡ <em> ohhh!" </em></p>
<p>  The man buried his face to the crook of her neck. Hot breath against his skin as he rocked his hips harder. Tina could only hold him close, gladly taking each thrust he gave. The small and cramped place, the friction of their clothes, and the rushed adrenaline because of the thought of getting caught, it was nothing like she'd ever felt before. A whole new sensation which makes it easier for her to build up her orgasm again.</p>
<p>  <em> They should do this more often </em>.</p>
<p>  Tina felt her walls began to twitch, clenching around him a little tighter. If they were in bed, Tina would've let it last, enjoying the fullness until she found her own release. But since they were chased with time, Tina realized she needed some more push to make it quicker.</p>
<p>  "Sorry, Newt, can I justㅡ" Tina raised her back from the door, bending her body to angle her hips lower enough to make his thrusts stimulate her clit. Knowing what she intended to do, Newt helped by adjusting his own angle. Tina gasped once she found the friction she needed, "Ahhh, yes, that's it!"</p>
<p>  Newt shifted his hand from her thigh to her jaw, sloppily pressing his lips against hers. "Yes.. Come for me, love." He whispered between kisses. Increasing his pace.</p>
<p>  A few moments later, Tina muffled her cry with her mouth pressed onto his shoulder as she reached her high. Newt stopped his thrusts, his length deep within her as he gazed at his wife lovingly. He loved seeing Tina like this; breathless, sated, all because of him.</p>
<p>  Tina slumped against the door. Her legs weakened to the point she could've fallen if Newt didn't hold her. A satisfied smile was formed on her lips, "Mmm, thank you." She murmured.</p>
<p>  "Happy birthday, Tina."</p>
<p>  Tina let out a weak giggle. She reached to push his messy fringe out of his face. "Come on, now." She said as she rolled her hips, a cue for Newt to continue, which he gladly did.</p>
<p>  They kissed deeply. Newt's low moans muffled against Tina's mouth. Her slick essence made his thrusts faster, more relentless to the point Tina's back kept hitting the door, creating thuds that definitely sounds suspicious if there were someone else in this house.</p>
<p> "I'm… almost there, Tinaㅡ <em> ah. </em> " He whimpered. Tina began seeing stars. She pressed her heel to his arse, encouraging him even more. She was too overwhelmed with pleasure she couldn't speak or think properly. All she can do is chanting <em> yes, yes </em>, until finally, Newt pushed into her for the last time. He choked out her name, his head fell to her collarbone as he filled her with warmth. Tina moaned softly at the sensation. Both breathing hard and somehow in sync.</p>
<p>  Once their bodies have calmed down, and their breaths steadied. Tina held him and brought his face to hers, giving him gentle and lingering kiss, "I love you."</p>
<p>  Like Newt himself, Tina wasn't the type of person who's often expressing herself through words. They have many of their own ways to show their love to each other, so whenever she says those three simple words, it feels more endearing than when everybody else says it, and it never fails to make Newt's heart warm.</p>
<p>  Newt had to lower his head for a split second, staring at her eyes for too long would be too much for him. "I love you too," he chuckled, "Now, how about we clean ourselves up before Jacob and Queenie caught us embarrassed?"</p>
