    <p>Slamming the door to the Gryffindor boy’s dorm behind him, Ron paced hurriedly down the stairs. A surprised Neville only just managing to flatten himself against the wall as he stormed past. Ron didn’t stop, he’d apologise to him later. Right now he could feel the anger boiling up inside him and knew he had to get as far away from Harry as physically possible.  </p><p>Four years they had been friends. And best friends at that. How could Harry put his name in the Goblet of Fire without letting him know?  </p><p>Ron huffed as he sped through the common room. Hermione was curled up on the chair by the fireplace with a well-worn copy of their fourth year Charms textbook perched snugly in her lap. George was sitting beside her, applying wax to the curve of his broom. Or was it Fred? Ron was too angry to look closely.    </p><p>“Ron, wait it’s past nine,” her voice called after him, but Ron didn’t acknowledge her, wrenching open the portrait hole and taking off down the corridor, Hermione’s voice getting lost behind him.  </p><p>“Four years. Four bloody years,” Ron muttered.    </p><p>Ron raced up the astronomy tower, taking the steps two by two. Reaching the top, the red head leant over the stone wall surrounding the tower. Letting out large huff, he looked over the Hogwarts grounds, taking in the vast expanse of the forbidden forest and the glittering black lake. Ron always came here when he needed to think. He had a quick temper but there was something calming about being in the fresh air. He took a deep breath in and exhaled slowly: a trick Hermione had taught him. A muggle technique to improve mindfulness she had told him. He wasn’t exactly sure what his mind was meant to be filling with, but he found it calming, nonetheless.  His musing were cut short by a voice to his left. Turning around sharply he noticed Malfoy on the opposite side of the tower. He’d been so caught up in his frustration that he hadn’t spotted the skinny blonde perched on the tower wall.   </p><p>“What do you want weasel?” Draco’s slightly nasal tone succeeding in refueling any frustration the breathing exercises had released. He bounced a small golden ball against the floor and caught it. Ron recognised it as one of the non-magical quidditch balls used for snitch catching practice. His hands clenched into fists as Draco continued to bounce and catch the ball, as if he knew how much it was winding him up.      </p><p>“Scurrying around looking for golden boy Potter no doubt. You two can’t seem to spend longer than ten minutes away from each other. We’ve got a bet running in Slytherin, how long it’s going to take you two to come out. My money is on the end of this term. Unless this Triwizard Tournament gets him first that is.” Malfoy looked away from Ron, knowing this dismissal would anger him further. He’d spent four years watching the red head closely and knew exactly how to push his buttons.    </p><p>“Fuck off Malfoy, you can’t talk. I’m surprised you’re even out here on your own without your bodyguards. And I don’t care where Harry is.” Ron turned away from Draco muttering, “He can go fuck himself as far as I’m concerned.”  </p><p>Malfoy’s hand stilled in the air, long fingers curling around the ball as his face turned to look at Ron. He was surprised. He thought it was always sunshine and rainbows over in Gryffindor Tower.  </p><p>“Trouble in paradise?” Malfoy didn’t even try to disguise the delight in his voice. The friendship the golden trio shared has always been a particular sore spot for him. Why did Potter get to have such close friends when all he was left with were two bumbling idiots and a gaggle of girls wanting to marry into the Malfoy name. It was exhausting.     </p><p>“I...” Ron stuttered knowing he had said too much. Malfoy would take great pleasure in spreading the news of their fight through the castle by morning time. As angry as he was at Harry, he didn’t want news of their fight passing up and down the tables in the Great Hall at breakfast tomorrow. The whispering and staring would drive him mad, not to mention the disapproving talks he would be given by Hermione and various members of his family.    </p><p>“How come you are up here by yourself? Given your friends Crabbe and Goyle the slip? Where are they, searching for the singular brain cell they share between them?”  </p><p>A laugh escaped Draco’s lips before he could stifle it. Dammit, he thought. “Didn’t realise you were such a comedian Weasley.” Draco hoped his sarcastic tone would cover his genuine laugh. He had always found Ron funny, but had gotten used to stifling his laughs for fear of disapproval from the Slytherin house. He didn’t care what his peers thought of him, but he lived in fear of his father knowing he felt anything but hatred towards a ‘blood traitor’ Weasley. During his first few years at Hogwarts his view of Ron, and the rest of the Weasleys, was one of hatred and moral superiority. They were nothing but ‘muggle loving disgraces to magic’ as his father would say. His mother would then hastily agree, spewing sentiments to match her husbands. Draco did not judge her; he knew that she has lost the right to own her own opinion the day she became a Malfoy.         </p><p>Ron thought it was best to just leave. The fresh air had calmed him down and he knew starting a flight with Malfoy would not be a good idea.    </p><p>“You know if Potter’s pissing you off, I could always hex him for you.” Ron stopped dead in his tracks. Did Malfoy just say something almost nice to him? He looked around to see Malfoy’s pale cheeks tinting with a slight pink.  </p><p>“I mean, you know, because I hate Potter. Any excuse to hex him really, I” Draco trailed off. For a Slytherin his lying really needed work. He sighed, “Look I’m not going to tell everyone you had a fight with Potter. I’ve got better things to do than spread idle gossip about people I don’t care about.” Another lie, this one sounded only slightly more convincing. Potter was a self-righteous wannabe savior. Master of the right-place right-time stroke-of-luck technique. His strategy of run straight towards the danger and think later pissed Draco off no end. But Weasley was different. Sure, he was brave, but he didn’t run headfirst into decisions just because he needed to be seen to be the hero. He did have a quick temper and could be impulsive when fired up but Weasley was smart. Not ‘remember everything I’ve ever read’ smart, like Granger, strategically smart. Draco thought that Weasley would have fitted well into Slytherin if his moral code wasn’t so set in stone.        </p><p>Ron wasn’t sure what to say. This whole conversation had been weird. Was Malfoy blushing? And why did Ron find that slightly endearing? It’s Malfoy for Merlin’s sake. Ron thought it best that he leave the whole strange situation as soon as possible. “Right. Thanks, I guess.”  </p><p>“Wait,” Draco said suddenly, fumbling around in the pockets of his robes. “I’ve got something you might want. I’ve been creating these for when the trials begin. It’s just a prototype at the moment.” Draco threw over the small object before smirking and taking off down the astronomy tower steps, the pink tint on his cheeks turning decidedly more red. </p><p>Ron looked down into his hand to see a small round black badge with the words Potter Stinks flashing across the top in luminous yellow. He laughed and looked up to see Draco’s blonde head retreating down the steps.  </p><p>“What the fuck just happened?” Ron muttered to himself, shaking his head as if to check he was awake and not dreaming. Ron walked slowly back to Gryffindor tower, trying hard to shake the image of Malfoy’s blushing face which kept popping back into his thoughts.</p>
