  <em>I still feel your hand in mine</em>

<hr/><p align="left">Tina Goldstein was used to a racing heart.</p><p>Endless hours of training and hundreds of missions had almost desensitized her to the rush of adventure, but nothing could’ve prepared her for the absolute chaos Newt Scamander would cause.</p><p>First he was suspicious. His demeanor seemed shifty, so she followed him. Rightfully so. He was reckless, using magic as haphazardly as he did, in a building full of No-Majs no less!</p><p>Then he was kind. He covered for her when Abernathy came for her over the Second Salemers. Maybe Abernathy didn’t believe them, but the gesture was nice nonetheless.</p><p>Next he was inconsiderate. She and Queenie opened up their flat to Newt and Jacob, and as soon as he got the chance he ran off, and dragged the No-Maj with him. She had only been trying to help, and this is how he responds?</p><p>After that he was amazing. She was an Auror. She could always find a way out of a tricky situation, but as Bernadette walked her down the hall to the execution room, she felt utterly hopeless for the first time ever. As she was dragged through the process leading to her own death, she stared down into the hazardous potion she knew all too well from training. She was almost ready to get in, when suddenly everything became clear again. Where she was, what was happening, and him. And seconds later she was in his arms, her heart pounding in a way it hadn’t in years. He took her hand and they ran, as far and as fast as they could before finding Queenie, Jacob, and his case.</p><p>Soon after, he was brave. He put himself in harm’s way for Credence. He faced Graves directly, although he knew he’d be overpowered.</p><p>Finally, he was sweet. He said goodbye to her in person. He stayed with her until the last moment possible. He tucked a stray hair behind her ear, that small touch electrifying them both. He promised to return to her. Then he left.</p><p>They sent each other letters for a long while after. They were tentative at first, nothing but greetings and cordiality, until something snapped and they shared everything. They each waited eagerly for the other to respond, desperate for a piece of the other.</p><p>Until one day Tina stopped hearing back.</p>
