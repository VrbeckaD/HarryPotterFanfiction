    <p>It’s a nice day. Winter break has started, the weather is chilly in a nice way, and for the first time this week, it isn’t raining. James, the ever-active one, decided to go outside for a walk, but Sirius is content slumped in his browsing position on the sofa and scrolling through tumblr. </p><p>The peace is broken when James bursts into their apartment, hair even wilder than usual, and basically drags Sirius out without so much as an explanation.</p><p>“What the hell, Prongs!” Sirius pants, narrowly missing a lamp post as James carelessly pulls him along the street.</p><p>Instead of answering, James keeps sprinting forward, until they reach the new cafe around the corner.</p><p>“Look.” He says, slightly out of breath himself.</p><p>Sirius peeks through the window, and immediately spots an attractive young man around their age behind the cashier. It’ss a slow time at the shop, so there is nothing blocking his view to the man’s breathtaking lithe form.</p><p>“Bloody hell, he’s <i>gorgeous</i>”. He breathes.</p><p>“Exactly! That’s what I- Hold on, <i>he?</i>” James frowns as he looks over Sirius’s shoulder. “No, no, I’m talking about the girl, come on, Padfoot-” Grabbing Sirius’s shoulders, he turns him slightly to the right towards the coffee machines, where a young woman with red hair is standing.</p><p>“Ah.”</p><p>“Yes. Isn’t her absolutely beautiful?” James practically swoons.</p><p>Sirius sighs dramatically. “And here I thought you brought me here to play matchmaker for me. You want <i>me</i> to play matchmaker for you, don’t you?”</p><p>“No, not exactly, I…” Sirius is alarmed to see James actually fretting, “I can’t go talk to her!”</p><p>“James Potter, shy?” Sirius teases, but James grimaces in response.</p><p>“Erm, I may not have made a very good first impression,” he mumbles.</p><p>Raising an amused eyebrow, Sirius smirks and crosses his arms, waiting for James to elaborate.</p><p>“Apparently she doesn’t fancy the ‘pretentious asshole that thinks all ladies must trip over themselves for you’ type.” James mutters, glaring when Sirius starts laughing half-way through.</p><p>“Pick-up line didn’t work, then, Prongs, my dear friend?” He wipes a stray tear from the corner of his eye, and wraps an arm around James’s shoulder. “You know, the thing about women, sometimes you just have to properly <i>woo</i> them.”</p><p>“How do you even-?” James runs his hand through his hair, his frustration clear. Taking mercy on his best mate, Sirius steers him away from the cafe by the shoulders.</p><p>“First thing to do, Prongs, is a proper apology.”</p><p>“I know, but how? And where are we going?”</p><p>“You can’t go wrong with flowers, now, can you?”</p>
<hr/><p>Sirius leans on the counter as he watches his best friend tries (and fails, as far as he can tell) to flirt with the red-haired barista. If he happens to stand right in front of the young man he had his eyes on, well, nobody can prove it was on purpose.</p><p>Up close, the man looks even more attractive. He has bright, warm brown eyes that looks rather tired, with a faint ring of grey under them, and his glasses gives him a scholarly feel that makes him look even younger. His whole appearance and gesture is an epitome of gentleness and shyness, and Sirius, who actually uses his brains before he starts flirting (unlike James, the fool), immediately knows that an advance too direct would scare him off. Anyway, by the looks of it, being James’s emotional support would give him plenty of chances to come here in the future.</p><p>He peeks at the man, who is also caught up in watching James further embarrass himself, and catches the name on his nametag. <i>Remus.</i> He files the name for later use.</p><p>To his surprise, it is Remus who starts the conversation.</p><p>“Is your friend always like that?” He whispers, his dry tone somehow showing despite the low volume.</p><p>“I’d say no, but…” Sirius whispers back just as quietly, so they can still hear the disaster happening right next to them, “well, to be fair, his advances usually receive more positive response.”</p><p>Remus snorts. “Lily’s going to give him hell. Is your friend the persistent kind?”</p><p>“Probably. I’ve never seen him so enamored.” Sirius says, a quirk in his mouth, “he’s probably going to keep going until he either gets a date, a girlfriend, or a restraining order.” </p><p>Remus chuckles just as Lily snaps, “If you are just going to keep harassing me, sir, please leave the shop.” in the coldest, most venomous tone Sirius has heard in a while. Jame gapes, then bravely declares that he “will be back soon, sweetheart!” before making his escape.</p><p>“...Bet you five pounds it’s the restraining order.” Sirius whispers out of the corner of his mouth. Remus actually laughs out loud at this, but before Sirius can properly feel elated at hearing such a pure, wonderful sound, Lily has turned her glare at them.</p><p>Sirius raises his hands in surrender, backing up until he reaches the door. Remus hides his grin behind his hand, but his shaking shoulders betray his amusement.</p><p>“Erm, I’ll… see you around, Remus.” Remus gives him a friendly wave, and Sirius winks as he nudges the door open with his shoulder. He turns to leave, but not before seeing a beautiful blush make its way up Remus's cheeks.</p><p>Sirius still has a grin on his face when he arrives home to see a sulking James.</p><p>"We'll go back tomorrow." James announces.</p><p>"Of course we would, Prongs." Sirius nods. His best friend's responding eye roll is perhaps a bit too knowing, but Sirius is not one bit embarrassed as he whistles happily in his shower that night, already thinking of things to say to a certain shy, smart barista tomorrow.</p>
