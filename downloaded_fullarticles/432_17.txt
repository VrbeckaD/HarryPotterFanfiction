  <strong> <em>Nurmengard Castle, Austria. 13 October 1935.</em> </strong>
</p><p align="justify">At age fifty-three, the man that once planned to rule the world —and could’ve done it, he is certain— has a simple routine that consists mostly of reading and writing. He’s spent more than half his life in prison, and he rarely wastes his excessive time missing the things he knows he’ll never have. No, he stopped doing that about twenty-three years ago. His life is not so bad, he thinks each morning as he reads the papers, both magic and muggle, because he has the time, and he’s almost happy he is not out there, watching in the flesh the preamble of what he knows will be a dark chapter in muggle history.</p><p align="justify">Almost. He never had the <em>pleasure</em> of experimenting a <em>real</em> war. He was stopped before he could make one and locked for the duration of what muggles still call ‘The Great War’. But from what he sees in his visions, he knows that another is coming. An even greater one. Yet he suspects wizards and witches will stay out of it, like they always do. Because they’re cowards. Muggles are barbarians and they’ve always been, but all magical creatures have the power to stop them, and still they are forced to hide. It’s absurd. And he knows that a lot of people think like him. They still write to him, and he spends most of the hours of the afternoon replying to their letters.</p><p align="justify">He hadn’t, at the beginning. He hadn’t seen the point. But he had extremely loyal acolytes, people that were willing to give their lives to change the world into a better one, one where all of Gellert’s plans could come true. People that were still, even now, thirty years later, trying to find a way to break him out of the prison he himself had built. Their passion and fidelity resulted quite amusing to him, if he had to be honest. But he encouraged it, of course. It was nice to feel important even there, in that miniscule cell. It had taken a few years, but eventually he made a habit of answering all their letters, at least the well-written ones. He knew that each and every one of the words he wrote to Vinda Rosier, one of his oldest and most loyal followers, ended up as a statement she used to expand his influence even now. In all honesty, it astonished him, to think that people could still follow him. They ought to see him as a failure, and yet he seemed to be some kind of symbol for rebellion and freedom. It isn’t an unwelcome responsibility, really. He just wishes he could do something about it, besides writing some empty words every few days.</p><p align="justify">Once he’s done with the papers and his —rather pathetic— breakfast, he considers his options for leisure while he brushes his teeth. He decides to make a couple of sudokus before his exercise routine, which consists mostly on push-ups, really. There isn’t much space, lest alone something like rope, and he honestly hates exercising anyway. He knows his body needs it, that’s the only reason he does it. But if he spends just a little too long doing a sudoku that his lunch ends up coming before he can exercise, at least no one can judge him.</p><p align="justify">Many of his followers send him compilations of sudokus nowadays, after he mentioned on a letter that he enjoyed them, but he still likes better the ones he makes himself. He has the habit to design four or five at a time, and then wait at least a weak to try to solve them, once they’re long forgotten. He can’t tell if they’re becoming easier because of his excessive practice, or because he’s getting better at remembering what he writes, but he’s sure that one of these days, sudokus will become maybe even worse than exercising, which is quite a depressive thought.</p><p align="justify">He’s running out of pastimes. Maybe he should try to invent an instrument from all the paper —and nothing else— that he has in his cell. He’s gotten quite skilful with the small nail clipper; the one sharp object he’s allowed to own. And it could be nice to hear a sound other than his voice and plastic sliding down the floor. He hasn’t heard any music in thirty years and nearly two months.</p><p align="justify">He wonders if one day he’ll stop counting, or if he’ll ever forget the important dates. Maybe in the far future, when he’s old and senile. But how long can a person live in captivity? He never cared to ask before. Before prison, he always assumed he would live well into his three hundred, but now he can’t tell. He’s in his early fifties, but he feels so old. And yet, he’s barely lived at all. What is a life in a cell, confined to a small square of cold stone walls and a small window with a view he knows by heart?</p><p align="justify">He still stares at it, often. It’s a habit.</p><p align="justify">A moment later, he’s grateful the bed is glued to the wall on the left, as he watches with incredulity part of the opposite and adjacent walls blow up in pieces. It’s a small miracle none of the debris hit him.</p><p align="justify">No, not a miracle. It’s <em>magic</em>. He hasn’t done magic in thirty years and two months. He doesn’t waste his time envying the group of people standing inside his cell, that never had such restriction. He’s too happy to care. He recognizes a few faces, and he knows exactly what is happening.</p><p align="justify">“Vinda? Why, if it isn’t nice to see you,” he says in an amicable tone, hoping his easy smile and his relaxed stance can somewhat distract his audience from his long hair and his dishevelled form.</p><p align="justify">The smile she gives him revitalizes him. She’s excited, they all are, and no one seems to be disappointed by his appearance. Good. They shouldn’t be. If they were, Geller wouldn’t hesitate to kill them.</p><p align="justify">“Come on now, we don’t have much time, sir,” says the man standing closest to her. He’s tall, imponent, eyes of a killer, and Gellert is certain that’s the man that figured out a way to get him out of prison.</p><p align="justify">His smile shifts into something more dangerous, although he’s happy, energy running through his veins like it hasn’t in years. He takes a step closer to Vinda and says: “Very well, let’s go then. Do you have space to carry my correspondence with me, or…?”</p><p align="justify">Vinda’s face falls. “Oh, my Lord, I’m so sorry. Maybe if it’s just a few…”</p><p align="justify">Gellert knows the man by her side is struggling to keep his mouth shut, but his mask is slipping. He’s irritated, and maybe, under different circumstances, Gellert wouldn’t blame him. Under different circumstances, though. Now, he just <em>knows</em> he’s not going to like that man. However, he ignores him and focuses on Vinda. Beautiful, faithful Vinda, whose face looks so strained for having to tell him no. He laughs. “I’m only joking, dear. They kept me sane, and I’ll always carry them in my heart, but I won’t miss them. I won’t miss anything from this cell. Let’s go. I haven’t felt the air on my skin in thirty years. I can’t wait.”</p><p align="justify">They use a portkey, and in a matter of seconds, they’re no longer in Austria. The air is warmer in what seems to be an attic, all wood around them, and even though there is dust everywhere, Gellert takes a deep breath and feels free. He’s not going to miss the sudokus, the heavy wool blankets, not even the books he read and reread a hundred times. He feels lighter, even as he stands still for Vinda and the rest to work on the spells that had been biding him and his magic. He doesn’t know how long it takes them, but he knows immediately once they’re gone, and he’d been worried for a second that he no longer would know what to do with himself but, oh, he never needed to worry. He feels like a fish returning to the water right before he suffocated.</p><p align="justify">“You are finally free, my Lord,” says Vinda. “What do you want to do now?”</p><p align="justify">Oh, he has many ideas. He knows his followers want to hear all about his plans to change the world, and he doesn’t think they’ll be disappointed. He had thirty years to plan, even if he never expected to leave that cell. He has thousands of ideas. But he also has many needs. He’s been locked down for way too long. His followers and his ideas can wait a little longer.</p><p align="justify">“Well, the first thing on my list, dear, would be a haircut.”</p><p align="justify">He doesn’t care to see the reactions of the people around him. Vinda smiles, and he easily places his hand on top of hers when she extends her arm. She apparates them in another room of the same building, and they’re thankfully alone. Even before prison he never found himself surrounded by strangers like that. He definitely does not wish to turn that into a habit.</p><p align="justify">She tells him that is his room, and she hands him a wand. His old wand. He doesn’t know how she found it, but he doesn’t ask. He simply smiles at her as she leaves, and he’s glad to be completely alone. He’s glad he’s been writing to people every day for so long, because he hasn’t talked to another human in thirty years and it could be even weirder, he knows, the idea of conversation, if it hadn’t been for those.</p><p align="justify">He takes his time fussing over his appearance until he’s satisfied, and he doesn’t keep track of time. They shouldn’t be in a hurry anymore, and looks are a very important part of a leader. And he is a leader. He never stopped being one, but now he needs to really play the part, fulltime.</p><p align="justify">He’s no longer twenty-three, but he likes what he sees in the mirror once he’s done, even if his face is perhaps too bony. The first couple of years were the hardest, starving. But lately he no longer cared. He’s sure he’ll get used to healthy amounts of food soon, though. He has to. He doesn’t look healthy, but he must if he wants to inspire anyone new into following him. He’s supposed to be a strong leader. Maybe now he’ll even exercise more. He can imagine himself jogging. He has the space, now. He’s free.</p><p align="center">♠</p><p align="justify">
  <strong> <em>Great Hall, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Scotland. 14 October 1935.</em> </strong>
</p><p align="justify">Ever since he can remember, getting up in the morning has been a struggle for Harry. For a while he hoped that maybe going to Hogwarts would change that, but it didn’t. By his sixth year, that hope is long forgotten, and most days he stumbles upon the Great Hall like a zombie, especially on Mondays. It takes him at least ten minutes, an unhealthy amount of tea, bread, pastries and sausages, before he can even open his eyes properly, but his friends don’t care. They’re used to it. Hence it isn’t strange when nobody greets him, except after a while, he notices most people are either reading a newspaper or talking lowly to their neighbours, all looking rather alarmed.</p><p align="justify">“What is it that everyone is whispering about?” he asks after a minute.</p><p align="justify">“Grindelwald escaped from prison,” explains Ron in a whisper, looking pale and frightened.</p><p align="justify">Harry knows he’s heard that name. He does. He just can’t quite remember where.</p><p align="justify">“Uh,” Neville mumbles, looking embarrassed but clearly finding an ally in Harry, “I’m sorry, but could you tell me what he did? They don’t say that in the article…”</p><p align="justify">Ron’s face is the definition of incredulity, but when he turns to see his best friend and notices his sheepish smile, a clear indicator that he’s none the wiser, he sighs, resigned that he’ll have to give them a small history lesson. It isn’t by far the first time he has to do so. Ron, being one of the youngest in a large family, grew up listening to the same stories over and over that he learnt them all by heart. Harry would hear the revised version, since his father liked to give too many details for a toddler and his mother would usually interrupt him. At the end, Harry hardly ever heard the full story, and when he did, often it wouldn’t make much sense, so when it comes to anything that involves violence prior to 1929, his knowledge is questionable at best.</p><p align="justify">Neville, on the other hand, has been raised by his grandmother, and she sheltered him from the world in such a way that he was embarrassingly ignorant at times, more often than not.</p><p align="justify">“He didn’t do much,” admits Ron, “but it is told that he was extremely powerful, even though he was in his early twenties. He could’ve conquered the world.”</p><p align="justify">“Even after all his years in prison, he was still gathering followers, apparently,” adds Hermione, who of course has read all about it already.</p><p align="justify">“He wanted to enslave muggles,” says Ginny, brow furrowed. “Everyone’s surprised he escaped, but he was the one to <em>build</em> the prison they locked him in.”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, but if it took him thirty years then it was probably not such a bad idea, don’t you think?” says Ron.</p><p align="justify">She purses her lips and hums, unconvinced, even though Harry thinks her brother has a good point.</p><p align="justify">“The point of his rebellion is that he wanted to <em>free </em>us from the Statute of International Secrecy,” says Hermione, gaze fixed on her plate, although Harry doesn’t think she’s seriously looking at the food that’s still there. Her mind seems to be elsewhere. “That’s why he had so many followers, I guess, and why he keeps getting them. They don’t focus on the means, the hunger of power behind it, just in how we’re hiding. And how it seems to be there just to protect muggles, instead of protecting us.”</p><p align="justify">“Well, when you say it like that…” mutters Neville.</p><p align="justify">Hermione nods her head. “That’s what made him so dangerous. That’s what makes him so dangerous <em>now</em>. The number of followers he has is <em>massive</em>. If he’s planning on ending what he started all those years ago…”</p><p align="justify">“Well,” says Lavender Brown, who hasn’t really been a part of the conversation, and is sitting two seats away from Neville; on a normal morning, she would need to yell so they could hear her, but this is not a normal day, “maybe if politicians dared to question a law that’s been in action for over two centuries, he wouldn’t be so convincing.”</p><p align="justify">“The Statute of Secrecy is for our safety,” argues Hermione. “Haven’t you read what it used to be like? When muggles hunted us?”</p><p align="justify">“Aren’t your parents muggles?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes. And I love them. But I understand why the law is the way it is.”</p><p align="justify">Harry isn’t sure he does. If he’s honest, he’s never given it much thought; the only muggles he knows are his relatives. They’re aware of magic, but they’re hideous people, and if it weren’t because he knows it makes his uncle Vernon quite jealous, he would think that they don’t even <em>deserve</em> <em>to</em> <em>know</em> about it, for it makes the world so much interesting. He knows there are good muggles out there, of course — Hermione’s parents, for starters. He’s only seen them a couple of times, but he knows they’re kind and loving. Still, he doesn’t know how many of them are there. Bad wizards cannot be kept from seeing the wonders of the magic world, but at least bad muggles can be kept at bay, with such a law.</p><p align="justify">He’s never been inconvenienced by having to hide. He lives surrounded by wizards. Sure, it can be a bother not to be able to use magic outside of Hogwarts, and on the few occasions he has to see his cousin he would love to demonstrate a few things just to mess with him, but aside from that, he’s never thought that he was <em>actively hiding</em>. He never thought that hundreds of people could be motivated enough for it to fight a war.</p><p align="justify">Now power, that is a different story.</p><p align="justify">Of course that most magical creatures can overpower a muggle if they really want to, but Harry would like to think that what stops them isn’t just a law. He wants to believe that people are better than that. He really wants to. But dynamics of power are a complex thing, and he doesn’t fully understand it. He just tries to make sense of what he’s seen and heard but it escapes him, many times, how easily some abuse their position just because they can, and how understandable yet reproachable it is when the powerless find a way to act in revenge.</p><p align="justify">At some point, the conversation has turned into an argument and Harry isn’t sure if it’s because Lavender truly opposes the Statute of Secrecy or she just wants to fight Hermione, but he’s glad when it’s time to go to class and they have to stop it. They still glare at each other occasionally, but no words are exchanged. When they go back to the Great Hall for lunch, Lavender sits even further away, and Harry relaxes. Conversation is loud, and it almost feels like a normal day, but it isn’t. If he pays attention, he can tell that most people are still talking about Grindelwald.</p><p align="justify">After lunch, it is time for his favourite class, with his favourite teacher: Defence Against the Dark Arts, imparted by Professor Albus Dumbledore. The man is a legend, and the one that stopped Grindelwald, too, but he isn’t sure if bringing that up will be a good idea. It’s unlikely no one will, though, so he just hopes Lavender will sit far enough from them and not cause trouble. If the tension between her and Hermione doesn’t stop soon, he’s going to be the one to smack Ron and force him to do something about it.</p><p align="justify">In the end, they’re not even seated when Susan Bones, a Hufflepuff he’s hardly ever talked in all the years they’ve been classmates, asks: “Did you hear the news, Professor? About Grindelwald?”</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore’s face is unreadable on most days, but Harry thinks he sees something like discomfort there.</p><p align="justify">“Yes, indeed. I believe everyone in Europe has, Susan.”</p><p align="justify">“You were the one to put him in prison, weren’t you, Professor?” says Ernie.</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore supports himself against his desk, casually folding his arms on top of his chest, and nods. “Yes.”</p><p align="justify">“Are you scared?”</p><p align="justify">“Are you going to join the Aurors to fight him?”</p><p align="justify">“Do you think he’ll seek revenge against you?”</p><p align="justify">“Children, children,” his voice is soft, and his body language is the definition of relaxed, but the classroom falls silent at once. “You don’t have to worry about that. In fact, what I have prepared for this class will need you all to be completely focused, ready to face your fears, your personal demons. Don’t be concerned about mine.” He moves to the middle of the classroom, smiling and vibrant with energy, and claps his hands. “Come on, now, help me clear the room.”</p><p align="justify">And just like that, all talk about the escaped criminal is forgotten. Dumbledore’s enthusiasm is contagious and soon enough they’re all eager to start with the lesson, even after they hear what it is — although most of them get a little nervous, some retreat to the back of the line when they had done their best to make it to the front before they’d known what it was that they were lining up for. Harry’s just a tiny bit scared, which is normal, but he doesn’t move from his place as the sixth in line. He trusts Professor Dumbledore — they all do.</p><p align="justify">“Now, remember that it’s just a boggart. It can’t hurt you,” repeats Dumbledore, only incrementing the adrenaline that’s running through everyone’s veins.</p><p align="justify">It’s about to be Harry’s turn when the door bursts open.</p><p align="justify">“Out of here,” says the man at the front of the large group that invades their classroom.</p><p align="justify">Harry has seen him before, he’s sure, but he can’t place him. Then a moment later he sees his father among the men, discreetly waving a hand at him and winking, and he realizes it’s the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, with several Aurors behind him. He doesn’t like that man, and he doesn’t like that they’re interrupting the class so rudely, but he manages to smile at his father before he exits, because it’s nice to see him. He hopes they’ll get a chance to chat before he has to leave. He misses him. Letters aren’t nearly as nice as hugs.</p><p align="center">♠</p><p align="justify">
  <strong> <em>Classroom 3C, Serpentine Corridor, third floor.</em> </strong>
</p><p align="justify">Albus watches his students leave and deliberately ignores the Auror. Many of them were once his students too, and he remembers them well. Some of them have the decency to look uncomfortable with the rashness of their actions, but there are quite a few who seem to have enjoyed it.</p><p align="justify">Those are the ones Dumbledore wishes would’ve picked a different career path.</p><p align="justify">“I’m sure you’ve already heard the news,” says Torquil Travers, current Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. He’s one of the smug ones, although he wasn’t a student of his.</p><p align="justify">He was a few years younger than Albus. He knows they were together at Hogwarts at some point, and they went to the same house, but Albus just can’t, for the life of him, remember a single occasion in which he’d seen him there. All he knows about him is what it is told on papers, but he doesn’t like him. And looking in his eyes right then, he knows the man doesn’t like Albus either.</p><p align="justify">He tilts his head to one side. He doesn’t smile, not really, but he knows there’s a hint of humour in his voice as he says: “About Grindelwald? Yes. Well, I read them.”</p><p align="justify">He notices from the corner of his eye that James Potter smiles briefly, entertained now instead of apologetic like before, and he has to stop himself before he winks an eye at him. He was one of his favourite students, and now so is his son.</p><p align="justify">Travers hums and stares at him in a way that Albus guesses is supposed to make him nervous. It doesn’t have that effect.</p><p align="justify">Albus really doesn’t like that man. He makes sure that doesn’t show on his face and says: “And?”</p><p align="justify">“And? Well, professor, we all know that you were the one to stop him the last time. We’re hoping you’ll be willing to do it a second time.”</p><p align="justify">He knows he shocks every single one of them with his answer. He doesn’t care. He keeps his face open, his stance relaxed, his speech honest, and he hopes his eyes deliver how much he genuinely cares for peace regardless of the words that leave his mouth.</p><p align="justify">Albus watches them leave and wonders if he can get away with finishing his day early. He doesn’t think he can continue with the lectures. He’s too distracted. Way too distracted to be trying to teach others how to cast defensive spells. He doesn’t ask anyone, and he just leaves. He walks the distance until the apparition restrictions are over and then travels to his childhood house, the only home he has outside of Hogwarts, and hopes his brother isn’t there. He’s the last person he wants to see now that Gellert is out there again.</p><p align="justify">But that really isn’t his day, and Aberforth Dumbledore is standing right in front of him an instant later, on their childhood living room, arching one eyebrow. There’s mud on his boots, and he’s holding a mug probably filled with a mix of tea and alcohol.</p><p align="justify">“Shouldn’t you be working?” he asks, because of course he does.</p><p align="justify">Albus sighs. “Yes. But I had an unpleasant visit and I just needed to clear my mind.” He realizes his mistake right away, but it’s too late, and his brother is already tense, brazing himself for a fight due to a ridiculous misunderstanding. “Travers and a bunch of Aurors stormed into my classroom and kicked out the students rudely just to talk to me. It was rather uncomfortable,” he explains a little hurriedly, hoping it’ll be enough to appease his brother. Hoping the conversation will be over soon.</p><p align="justify">It had taken a lot of patience, back in 1900, trying to mend his relationship with his brother, who rightfully hated him at the time, and it had all been Gellert’s fault. Nowadays, Aberforth knows exactly how Albus feels, and in turn, Albus knows exactly what his brother thinks of it. He really doesn’t want to argue.</p><p align="justify">But it doesn’t matter what he wants, because Abe is an idiot.</p><p align="justify">“They want you to catch your boyfriend a second time and you don’t want to? Come on, Al,” he places the mug carelessly on top of the short cupboard at his back, “you must have known they would come asking for that. And you should, anyway. He’s a danger and you know it.”</p><p align="justify">“He barely did anything last time.”</p><p align="justify">“Because you stopped him. And he still murdered about two hundred people and almost exposed the magical community a few dozens of times. He wanted to start a war and he almost did. I’ve heard that his followers kept growing in numbers even while he rotted in prison.”</p><p align="justify">Albus knows all that, of course he does. He doesn’t have to hear it again. Doesn’t want to. It hurts. It hurts too much.</p><p align="justify">“Albus, it’s been thirty years. You can’t possibly still…” his brother stops talking, and Albus suspects everything he’s feeling and thinking must be clear on his face.</p><p align="justify">He knows what his brother is thinking. Knows what anyone would think if they heard him. But he can’t help it. Gellert has been the only person he’d ever imagined a future with. He knows he did the right thing, stopping him, and he doesn’t allow himself to regret it, but his heart aches each time he closes his eyes and sees the monster he still loves locked inside a cell because he put him there.</p><p align="justify">Because Gellert Grindelwald is a monster. He is. But he is also the most interesting, most captivating, most similar person Albus has ever met. No one has ever understood him the way Gellert did. No one has ever made his heart beat faster. And he misses him, Merlin, he misses him. He has missed him every day since they parted in 1899.</p><p align="justify">Abe doesn’t open his mouth again. Instead, he storms out of the house indignantly, not saying all the things he’s thinking, that Albus already knows anyway.</p><p align="center">♠</p><p align="justify">
  <strong> <em>Gryffindor Tower, Hogwarts Castle.</em> </strong>
</p><p align="justify">It’s late, but Harry cannot sleep. Dumbledore’s face after they asked him about Grindelwald is stuck on his head. Not only that, but the way the Aurors stormed off after whatever they discussed with him, too, cannot leave his mind. He barely had time to hug his dad goodbye. He wants to ask Dumbledore about it. It’s late, but he’s been to his office around this time in the past, and now he cannot stop thinking about going there and asking. He grabs the Invisibility Cloak and slips out of the dorm without waking anybody, which isn’t particularly hard to do.</p><p align="justify">He’s nearly out when he notices there’s still someone on a couch, surrounded by a couple of books. He recognizes her right away, and his feet are taking him towards her without waiting for his brain to catch up, but that’s okay.</p><p align="justify">“Euphie,” says Harry, a warning clear on his face, “what are you doing up so late?”</p><p align="justify">The eleven-year-old rolls her eyes at him, and he really shouldn’t be surprised. She’s heard way too many stories about her parents and about Harry and his friends to take him seriously when it comes to follow the rules.</p><p align="justify">“Come on now, you must go to bed,” he insists anyway.</p><p align="justify">She looks like she can’t believe him, but at least she starts collecting her things on her satchel. “You are unbelievable, Harry Potter,” she says, sounding just like Sirius. “Shameless. I’ll tell papa and we’ll laugh at you, I’m sure.”</p><p align="justify">Harry hums. “Well, I’ll tell your dad, and I’m sure he’ll be scandalized. It’s well over your bedtime.”</p><p align="justify">She gasps, turning on her heels to stare at him with a sheer panicked expression. “You wouldn’t!”</p><p align="justify">Harry smirks. No, he wouldn’t. But she doesn’t have to know that. He’ll just remember to use Remus as a threat more often.</p><p align="justify">Once he’s certain she went to bed, he resumes his way to Dumbledore’s office, thankful Euphie didn’t ask him what <em>he </em>was doing up so late.</p><p align="justify">“Harry?”</p><p align="justify">“Hello professor, I’m sorry to bother you at this hour, but I couldn’t sleep.”</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore smiles knowingly, nods, and invites him to take a seat across his desk. “Would you like some tea?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, thank you,” he says as he sits down in a comfortable chair, the sound of his own feet against the wood a little too loud in the familiar room that feels just a tad alien at that hour of the night. He waits comfortably and watches the teacup being prepared mid-air by a man that hardly pays any attention to it, his gaze focused instead on a pile of papers he still has in front of him. Once it’s ready, it flies to his face and he’s only mildly worried about it burning him — it’s more amusing than frightening, the white porcelain coming his way in threatening speed. He smiles and sips it silently, giving the professor all the time he needs with his work.</p><p align="justify">“You want to ask about Grindelwald,” Dumbledore mutters without meeting his eyes yet, sliding one paper from the reading pile to the one on the left with a flick of his wrist.</p><p align="justify">Harry swallows faster than he should have, burning his throat in his hurry to admit: “Yes.” He puts the offensive cup down on the desk, careful not to stain any papers, and clears his sore throat. “Well, not exactly.”</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore arches his eyebrows, finally giving him his full attention, even though he’s not nearly done.</p><p align="justify">“You clearly didn’t want to talk about him in class,” he explains quietly. His fingers find a loose thread on the inside of his right sleeve and he absentmindedly starts playing with it. “And some of the Aurors were pretty angry when they left.” His father wasn’t, but he looked disappointed. He didn’t give Harry any details, but it wasn’t hard to decipher how that conversation must have gone. “I just want to try to understand,” he licks his lips, “why you don’t want to be involved a second time. Don’t you think he’s dangerous anymore?”</p><p align="justify">“To be honest, Harry?” He puts all the papers away in one neat pile that flies to another desk on the back of the room and pours some tea for himself. “No. I believe that it isn’t my job to stop him this time.”</p><p align="justify">The thread snaps away from his sleeve, and he barely registers the pain in the paling finger to which it’s still attached to.</p><p align="justify">“But—”</p><p align="justify">“I already did it once, because I thought I had to. Now…” he takes a long sip of his tea, closing his eyes for a moment, but he doesn’t look relaxed. He doesn’t look precisely tense either — or at least, Harry doesn’t think so, but Dumbledore has always been difficult to read. Still, to him, the way his face wrinkles, it looks to him as if the professor is hurting, for just a second. “There are others, professionals, far more qualified for it than me. Back then I was young and barely knew what I was doing, Harry. I was twenty-four years old.”</p><p align="justify">“That only means now you’re better,” Harry replies softly, trying to sound encouraging and supportive. He’s at a loss, though, for he hasn’t got the least idea of what it is that the man is in need for.</p><p align="justify">A long time passes, or at least it feels very long, in which none of them makes a sound. Slowly, the professor fixes his intense gaze on Harry, looking more serious than he’s had in all the five years he’s been his teacher, assessing him as if Harry was not a student but a cursed object he needs to deal with, and a shiver goes down Harry’s spine. He almost tilts his chin up defiantly but decides not to.</p><p align="justify">He’s not a threat. Not to the great Albus Dumbledore, for sure, and certainly not to his favourite professor. He doesn’t smile either, but he hopes his expression is as open as he wishes it to be.</p><p align="justify">“I’m going to tell you something, Harry, something very few people know. But I would really appreciate it if you didn’t tell anyone else.”</p><p align="justify">“Of course,” he says earnestly, leaning forward slightly. If he had longer hair, it would fall into his cup.</p><p align="justify">“I knew Grindelwald.”</p><p align="justify">He involuntarily gasps, but the professor was probably expecting it, and he seems unfazed.</p><p align="justify">Then he realizes he doesn’t exactly know what that means, and he frowns.</p><p align="justify">“Sir?” he asks, probably looking as puzzled as he feels.</p><p align="justify">“I knew him, before he started his army. That’s why I stopped him. He was… he was my friend. And I thought I had some responsibility, that I had somehow encouraged him to become the criminal he turned into. But now, I know I haven’t. I did my part, Harry, and as long as he’s not hurting anyone, I’m not going to leave my job, my genuine responsibilities, to chase after a ghost. Do you understand?”</p><p align="justify">Harry isn’t sure he does. Does that mean Dumbledore had only been motivated by guilt in the past? No, otherwise he wouldn’t have mentioned the safety of others. Does he believe his old friend might be reformed? He surely is always seeing the best in people. But they’re talking about a mass murderer that wanted to take over the world. Surely, he knows better than to think he could change?</p><p align="justify">Then something clicks in Harry’s head.</p><p align="justify">“Is he still your friend, Professor?”</p><p align="justify">Dumbledore smiles enigmatically around his nearly empty cup of tea and says: “You are a very intelligent young man, Harry. Don’t let anyone ever tell you otherwise.”</p><p align="justify">“Sir?”</p><p align="justify">“Friendship is a rather large concept, Harry. I’m not sure I can answer your question tonight. Besides, it’s rather late. Better go to bed before somebody notices you and we both get in trouble, okay?” He winks an eye at him, and Harry’s moving before he knows it. He still wants to ask more questions, but he knows he’s not going to get any more answers, so he leaves.</p><p align="justify">Maybe some other time. He likes these late-night conversations in Dumbledore’s office. It might be a good thing he’s got things for another occasion.</p>
