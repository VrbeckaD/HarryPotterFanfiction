</p><p> </p><p>A wand was on the table.</p><p> </p><p>It was made of reddish wood - long - eleven inches with a hairline crack in the center where it had been mended. Wands can’t be repaired, but this one had.  </p><p>The pale wood of the table underneath made the wand stand out. It had scrapes and gouges one would expect for a table, well used and washed down often — a good table for a hospital. The small window showed a dark sky, and the light was dim in the tidy, bland sick room. A man was resting in a dull grey metal bed made up with white sheets in the center of the room. A woman with brown hair that curled almost audibly, freckled tan skin, and tightly clenched lips sat in a hard wooden chair next to the bed. She watched the man in the bed as his chest rose and fell, shallowly. His black hair was a thick, matted mess that had left faint red stains on the pillow. His face covered in purple bruises, and his skin had an unhealthy grey pallor to it. He was sweating; she didn’t need to feel his brow to know it was clammy. </p><p>A pair of gold, round-framed glasses lay next to the wand. One lens was missing, and the other was shattered and would fall out if jostled slightly. </p><p>The woman reached into her sleeve and pulled out a wand. She waved it over him and scowled when the man’s body glowed faintly; he was frail. A hitch in the rise and fall of his breathing drew her attention. The woman sat up and moved forward, grabbing the hand closest to her; his steady breathing resumed. She didn’t let go of his hand. “I’m so sorry I wasn’t there. I don’t know if I would have made a difference. Being left behind - this is worse.”</p><p> </p><p><em> Her recent breakup had made things awkward with her former boyfriend's family; it wasn’t right to lead him on. </em> <em>She had developed feelings for her best friend and was finally about to act on it when he announced his engagement. She was happy for him, sad for herself. I</em><em>nvestigating the recent breakout from Azkaban was an excellent excuse to stay away. She told the boys to take a night off and enjoy the party, while she buried herself in reported sightings, hoping for a pattern to emerge. When the stag Patronus burst through the wall, she was up and running before she heard the message, ‘Attack at the Burrow, send everyone.’ She had torn out of her office, shouting for help.  </em></p><p>
  <em> They apparated to the other side of the hill. She could already see smoke curling toward the sky in large, sooty columns. Then the acrid smell of burnt meat and ozone from clashing magic hit her. She raced toward the crest of the hill. At the top, she gasped taking in the burning hellscape that had once been the pleasant front garden. It was now a smoking crater, evidence of an explosion. She heard the zings of spells slung and countered as well as the few screams of the dying. It had been a family party celebrating the engagement of their only daughter. The table that would have held the food overturned. Someone had tried to use it as cover, but it hadn’t worked, as the blown apart pieces could attest. She saw a pair of legs unmoving behind it.  </em>
</p><p><em> She launched herself toward the nearest knot of black robes, shrieking like a berserker. She dodged and jumped, firing off </em>bombardas<em>, </em>stupefies,<em> even a few </em>sectumsempras<em>. Years ago she had worked out a way to chain a shield charm to an offensive spell so she could cast offensively while still protected defensively. As she drew closer to the group in black, about forty by her count, they began to apparate away. She would have set anti-apparition wards, had she been thinking clearly, but she had been too caught up in getting to her friends.  </em></p><p>
  <em> The pops and cracks of apparition continued until there was only one person left. He rounded on her and smiled. He wasn’t hiding behind a mask today, his once handsome face a ruin from his time in Azkaban and Godic only knew where else since the Battle when his crazy wife had met her end. “She’s all yours, what’s left of her.” With a harsh laugh, he disappeared with a crack. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> An older, plump woman with brown eyes and greying hair was struggling to breathe, “-made me watch. Watch as they killed them all. All of them. He cast a spell so I couldn’t close my eyes -” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> She rushed toward the older witch, but some perverse ward stopped her. She could only watch as the woman bled out, weakening before her eyes. “Molly, I’m here. You are going to be okay. Just hang on.” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Roused from her musings the older woman looked up, “Oh good dear, you came after all. We’ve missed you. Sorry, it’s a bit of a mess just now, I think George must have set off one of his firecrackers.” The young woman swallowed a sob; she was quite sure that she had seen him, only with half his head missing. “Why don’t you call in the children from the orchard so we can tuck in.” With that, the older witch breathed her last and slumped over.   </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Later, as they were categorizing the dead, a cry went up. One of the Aurors found a survivor. She rushed over, not sure who she was hoping for: her best friend, her ex, or the bride-to-be? She wept at the scene she found: brother and sister were holding each other, the parts that hadn’t been blown apart. Their sacrifice had saved her best friend, who was barely breathing but alive. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>They had told her that he was fading. He was a whisper from death. The Healer said it was the worst case of magic depletion he had ever seen. <em> If</em> he recovered, his magic would be gone forever, little better than a squib. He hadn’t responded to any of the treatments the Healers had tried; he remained in a coma, unresponsive. His body was rejecting magic. After what had happened, she could understand.</p><p>She picked the wand up off the table. Breaking a wand was a ritual act done only when a witch or wizard died or left the Wizarding World to live as a mundane. She wouldn’t break it; this wand had seen and done too much. She twirled her wand around it, visualizing the transfiguration. It was slow work with her wand. It wanted more violent tasks. Finally, his wand melted into a metal bracelet with a flat plaque with his name and condition on it. She whispered another incantation over the bracelet. Then she fastened it around his wrist, sealing the open link shut with his name. A wizard should never be without his wand, even if he can’t use it.  </p><p>She opened the bag slung across her chest and reached inside until she found a parchment and quill. She dug deeper and pulled out a small vial of sparkling black liquid and set it on the nightstand. Her quill scratched across the parchment, and she paused a few times to read over what she had written then she pricked her finger to make a bloody thumbprint. She passed her wand over the parchment while murmuring the incantation and the blood soaked into the paper leaving only the pale sheet. She leaned closer, and the magic practically jumped off the page; blood really did augment the compulsion. She folded the letter to drop it in the post soon. Time was of the essence, and it had far to go.</p><p>She took the vial and stood over the man. Her friend. Her <em>best </em>friend. The only family she had left. This was mercy. It was a hard decision, but that is what she did, she made the hard decisions. It’s not like she hadn’t done this before, but it didn’t make it any easier; saying goodbye to someone you love is always hard. She did love him. For eight years she had stood beside him, but there was never time for them with the trolls to fight and dark lords to defeat. Now it would never be. She carefully dripped the sparkling liquid into his mouth, lifting his head so it trickled down his throat, and the reaction was immediate. He thrashed for a few moments then stilled, his chest rising once more, stopping after a soft exhale. </p><p>It wasn’t hard summoning tears. </p><p>The door burst open, and the Healer and Mediwitch on night duty filled the room with activity. They were good people, but it was the end of the shift, she was counting on them not noticing things, caught up in trying to save their charge. The girl watched as they worked frantically around the man in the bed, but it was too late. Harry Potter was gone. </p><p>She had made sure of it. </p><hr/><p>She folded the newspaper and put it down. A large picture on the front page showed Hermione Jean Granger clothed in black standing between two coffins, she reached out and touched one then the other. Head bowed, her body shook with sobs before the loop started again. Some editorial prat had included a small inset picture that showed the three friends — Ron on the left, Hermione in the center, and Harry on the right — making the macabre point that this was how they started and how they ended. Toward the bottom of the page, another picture showed a distraught Fleur Weasley clutching Victoire; had it not been for a runaway fever, she and the little one would have been among the dead. </p><p>Inside the paper, articles were calling for justice and inquiry into the “Bloodbath at the Burrow." The Ministry’s measured response, “We are investigating, this will take time to resolve,” satisfied no one. </p><p>She wondered if vigilantism was just a reaction to circumstances or if she had she been on this path from the beginning.</p><p>She'd set a teacher on fire. Helped a convict escape. Permanently disfigured a schoolmate. Sent a woman into the forest to be trampled to death. Altered her parents' memories. Robbed a bank. Fought and killed in a war. She had done it all under the auspices of the<em> Greater Good. </em> </p><p>Was this part of the <em> Greater Good</em>, too? Did it matter anymore?</p><p>She wrestled with this question as she sat through the interminable inquests and reviews resulting from the attack. It didn’t take long to realize there was a hush-up, there would be no justice, considering who was on the panel she wasn’t surprised. She wondered who Umbridge had imperiused to have a job in the Ministry still. She began her preparations then, hoping she was wrong. When she sat across from the Minister, and he wouldn’t meet her eye, she knew what she needed to do. Causing a scene in the Ministry was easy; it was a pleasure to punch Inspector Umbridge in the mouth. </p><p>Hermione Jean Granger retreated from the public spotlight for ‘time to heal.'</p><p>That was a lie; she needed time to kill.  </p><p>Making new magic is a bit scary. The Fidelis charm for ‘secret keeping’ is meant for places, not people or things. She had already experimented with things, people were much different, though, and with magic anything is possible. In theory, self-obliviation is possible, but in practice, one does not want to end up like Gilderoy Lockheart. She started with something small. She made the sobriquet ‘Brightest Witch of Her Age’ a secret. It was a delight to read the <em> Prophet</em> without that particular phrase. Then in her next interview, her last, where she shared her thoughts on the Ministry’s failure to act, she watched the reporter struggle with what to call her. When she wrote the phrase out for the intrepid interviewer, it was like watching the light dawn. The next day’s <em> Prophet</em>’s headline read <em>"'Brightest Witch’ casts shadow of doubt on Ministry." </em>A nice turn of phrase.  </p><p>She looked down at the small, red booklet with gold writing, a passport, with the name Jean White on the first page. White had been her mother’s maiden name, Jean, because she wanted to keep something of herself. Next to it was a sheet of parchment with ‘Kill List’ written neatly across the top and forty names of the alleged neo-Death Eaters and escaped Death Eaters there; Dolores Umbridge was at the top of the list followed by Rodolphus Lestrange. There was a black credit card, the newest innovation from Gringott’s that would convert her gold into Muggle currency. Next to the card was an airplane ticket, because portkeys made her sick and the people she was going to kill wouldn’t expect her to use Muggle travel. Of course, if the enchantment worked, they wouldn’t expect her at all.</p><p>She picked up the small, well-worn beaded bag and began packing: a tent, a portable potions lab that folded itself into a tidy wooden box, a roll of knives in all shapes and sizes, a pair of manacles, grenades, a beautiful cloak that looked like a starry night, and a broom with the word Firebolt on the side of the handle. She added the passport, credit card, and ‘Kill List,’ but left the airplane ticket. The bag made a satisfying<em> clunk </em>when it set on the table.</p><p>She sat down at the table; she knew from experience that creating an enchantment this far-reaching and complicated would knock her legs out from under her, no need to sprawl on the floor if she could help it. She reached into her bag and drew out a scrap of parchment, an inkpot, and a quill, and jotted down the short phrase. She traced a spikey C — the rune for Pertho, secrets —  on her body at the four cardinal points, then did the same on a scrap of paper. The outflow of magic from her body was shocking. </p><p>She awoke face down on a table a minute, or maybe hours, later, exhausted and confused. She sat up and found a small slip of paper. <em>No not paper, parchment.</em></p><p> </p><p align="center"><em> Hermione Jean Granger is Jean White</em>.</p><p> </p><p>She shook her head as her thoughts clicked back into place, then stood, wobbled a bit, and gathered her bag and the ticket. Her secret was safe, and she had a plane to catch. </p>
