    <p>     Lucius had always liked Potions. To him, it was the class that made the most difference in a wizard’s development. While Defense Against the Dark Arts was applicable in his everyday life, most students already knew how to duel; few knew how to brew. It gave him the upper hand in many areas, as a good Polyjuice or Felix Felicis always beat the spell equivalent. In fact, he had just finished making the latter in Advanced Potions, and was the only person to successfully do so. Professor Slughorn had praised him enthusiastically in front of the other students and had continued to do so even after he exited the classroom. Several girls had even asked to study for the winter term test with him. He simply couldn’t help but look smug as he sauntered through the corridors with his friends, headed for the Slytherin common room.<br/>
     The look on his face quickly hardened as he rounded the corner. The first-year Gryffindors and Slytherins were crowding the hallway, chattering noisily as they headed to Potions. As a Prefect, a disruptive passageway naturally irked him, but it was not this that bothered him so. Rather, it was the group of Gryffindor boys attempting to jinx Severus Snape. There were four of them: one tall and tired-looking, another short and fat, the third with long black hair, and the last wearing circular glasses.<br/>
     “Stop it!” a feminine voice exclaimed. Lucius moved his eyes from the boys and found near Severus a small, red-headed girl with an annoyed look plastered on her delicate features. He had seen her before, as she was always with Severus.<br/>
     “Piss off, Evans,” said the dark-haired boy that Lucius knew. He was Narcissa’s little cousin, Sirius Black.<br/>
     “We’re just trying to get to class,” the Evans girl continued sternly, grabbing Severus’ arm. She pulled him further away from the bullies, but was met with a visible frown from the bespectacled boy.<br/>
     “Why do you care so much anyway, Evans?” he asked cruelly. “Do you like this <em>freak</em> or something?”<br/>
     The posse sniggered. The girl’s face instantly flushed and twisted furiously. It seemed as if a nerve was hit. “I like him much better than I’ll ever like you, Potter!”<br/>
     The boy called Potter puffed out his chest defensively. By now, a small crowd of first-years had gathered around the six involved. He glared at her and then at Severus, but did nothing. “Get out of here, Evans, and take Snivellus with you.”<br/>
     She wasted no time in shooting him a nasty look and turning away from the group. As she left, however, Lucius saw the stubby member of the gang stick out his foot.<br/>
     “Take that!” the chubby boy shouted as the girl fell to the ground. The books in her hands, as well as the paper tucked between their pages, went flying in all directions. The sleepy-looking boy, surprisingly attentive, quickly grabbed and restrained Severus before he could attack the offender. A roar of laughter erupted from the audience.<br/>
     Lucius decided that his role as an onlooker was over. He told his companions that he would catch up with them, then straightened his posture slightly and strided over to the scene, his Prefect badge gleaming menacingly on his chest. The spectators, having noticed him, swiftly scattered, leaving only the victims and perpetrators. As soon as Severus saw him, his face relaxed, while a mortified look spread across the faces of the Gryffindor troublemakers. Instead of disciplining them immediately, however, he couldn’t help but notice the girl dejectedly collecting her possessions off of the dungeon floor. Something peculiar came over him as he kneeled down and retrieved her copy of <em>Magical Drafts and Potions</em>.<br/>
     “I believe this is yours,” Lucius said, extending the textbook towards her.<br/>
     She looked first at the book and then at his robes with a puzzled expression on her face. It was clear that she was mistrustful of his gesture, but he kept his arm outstretched patiently. After a few seconds, she slowly reached for the book, locking eyes with him as her small hand touched the hard cover. There was a flash of green the color of spring growth, and, before he realized it, she was up.<br/>
     “Thanks,” she mumbled bashfully, eyes downcast. Her face was the same shade as her hair.<br/>
     “My pleasure,” Lucius said coolly, shifting his gaze from the flustered girl to the petrified boys. They had released Severus from the headlock and were now standing rigidly in a line. Severus had the ghost of a smile on his pallid face.<br/>
     “How foolish can one be,” Lucius began sourly, “to bother a Slytherin student in the vicinity of his own common room? Wouldn’t you figure that a prefect would be around to correct you?”<br/>
     The boys were silent. The portly lad looked especially spooked. Not many first-years knew a seventh-year student, but it was evident that they had heard of him. Of all the Prefects at Hogwarts, Lucius was regarded as the most ruthless. Tales of his verbal abuse and expeditious deduction of house points spread among the underclassmen like wildfire. Handsome, rich, and the star of the Slytherin Quidditch team, he was still popular despite it all. His reputation preceded him and that fact aided him in situations like this. Choosing his prey, he stepped closer to Sirius.<br/>
     “I’m especially disappointed in you, Sirius. Narcissa won’t be happy knowing you run with a crowd like this,” Lucius said sharply. The boy's face dropped and he shifted uncomfortably at the mention of his favorite cousin. "But isn't she already displeased with you for your house assignment?"<br/>
     “Leave him alone.”<br/>
     Lucius looked to his left and found that the Potter boy had stepped out of the line, defiance lacing his words. Normally, such an act would warrant aggression on Lucius’ part, but he remembered that the boy before him was only eleven years old. A mocking smile crept along his lips.<br/>
     “I was only going to take away forty points for this incident,” Lucius started condescendingly, “but I’ll make it fifty for you.” He heard Severus snigger.<br/>
     The drained-looking boy immediately grabbed Potter and pulled him back into formation. He straightened his posture slightly and, for a split second, he didn’t look so childish. “We’re sorry for the commotion. Please let us go to class.”<br/>
     “Us too,” a voice piped up behind him: the girl with flames for hair and a forest for eyes.<br/>
     Lucius scanned all of their faces once again before saying, “Nobody’s going anywhere until a proper apology is issued.”<br/>
     They reluctantly turned to Severus and were about to mutter their most insincere apology when Lucius stopped them.<br/>
     “Apologize,” he stated, “to her.”<br/>
     The girl looked confused as all heads turned to her. The pink color was returning to her cheeks as Lucius explained.<br/>
     “It’s unbecoming of any young man to involve a woman in his quarreling. Leave a lady out of your pointless feuding.”<br/>
     An uncomfortable silence fell over them. They were only children, but Lucius knew that they were on the cusp of grasping this concept. He was therefore unsympathetic to their anxious fidgeting, especially that of the plump boy. After a minute, the drowsy boy piped up.<br/>
     “Lily,” he began slowly, raising his eyes from the ground to her face, “I’m sorry.”<br/>
     <em>What a pretty name</em>.<br/>
     The rest of the gang followed suit, bashfully interacting with the vivacious girl. Her face remained unamused with each apology, her disdain deepening when Potter, the last of them, stepped up to her. His mouth quivered slightly as if he was about to either laugh, cry, or both.<br/>
     “I’m sorry about Peter,” he said, trailing off, “and that you’re friends with such a loser.”<br/>
     The girl’s expression contorted into anger. Lucius too became cross, but he quickly neutralized his frustration. It was unlike him to lose his composure.<br/>
     “Professor McGonagall will hear about this,” he declared venomously, ending the interaction before Lily could get a word in.<br/>
     Severus was at her side in seconds. “Let’s go, Lily.” The girl nodded, giving James another look before putting her back to them altogether.<br/>
     Lucius watched as the duo left the scene. It sure was a peculiar site, an awkward Slytherin boy with a fiery Gryffindor girl, but he guessed they had history. Severus had once shamefully mentioned where he was from, a shabby muggle neighborhood, so he figured they had met there. Even with the years of friendship, however, Lucius knew a place like Hogwarts would tear them apart. With opposing houses, friend groups, and blood statuses, they simply stood no chance. Still, he watched them gently as they hurried to class.<br/>
     As they turned the corner, he noticed Lily glance over her shoulder. It seemed as if she was peering at Potter at first, but the softness of her expression revealed something else entirely: she was looking at him. A funny little smile was on her lips, and Lucius considered returning it. In one instance, grey met green, and, in the next, she was gone.<br/>
     Lucius dismissed the four hoodlums and headed to the common room with the sudden thought of a flower arrangement. His anniversary with Narcissa was coming up, and he wondered if a bouquet of lilies would suffice.</p>
