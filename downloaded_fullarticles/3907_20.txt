    <p>Fred and George were unique children. They were very different from their older brothers and younger sister. They were mischievous and sweet children though and that’s all that their mother and father, Molly and Arthur Weasley, cared about.</p><p>The boys were inseparable and had a kind of synchronicity that was almost unbelievable. But then again they were twins, and not to mention wizards. Even the first time they performed accidental magic they’d done it at the same time, though to this day their parents still don’t know which twin did what or if they’d somehow managed to combine their magic. It had been an interesting day for the family of redheads. The two toddlers had been playing together in the living room when suddenly object started floating and catching fire around them the two boys giggling and clapping in delight. Their parents had been quite shocked to discover that the fire didn’t actually burn and the floating objects could not be put back on the ground.</p><p>The two boys lived in such perfect unison that it got to the point where no one really knew which twin was which. Not even the boys themselves. They would make a game out of it though, where they would always tell people that they were the were the other twin, keeping everyone in constant confusion of who was who. The boys would sometimes call each other Gred and Forge to simplify things, but they wanted names that they could well and truly claim as their own. So one day they gave each other names. These names were Cielo and Terra. They don’t know why they chose these names. They just felt right. They never told anyone about these names they called themselves, wanting to keep up their fun game. So in the confines of their room, in the privacy of their favorite hiding spots, they called each other these names as they laughed and planned their next pranks.</p><p>Life was good and free. They had a loving family with lots of cool older brothers and a cute, but also scary, little sister. Though there was something about their big brother Ron and their little sister Ginny. The twins didn’t know what, but whatever it was it wasn’t bad it was just...familiar.</p><p>Yes, life was very good. After all they’d never really had the chance to be honest to god happy and carefree children in their last life. </p><p>The dreams of their past life started when they were six. Slow and gentle, easing their ways into their minds. By the time they were seven they remembered everything about who they’d been. </p><p>But, it didn’t matter, because that was their last life. They now had a new one to live. They didn’t know if the others were brought back too, but for now that was okay. They missed their family, but they also knew that they wouldn’t want them to spend their new lives unhappy. And besides, it’s not like they were alone, because they had each other. And they always would.</p><p>They started practicing with their flames in secret with no one else around and whenever someone came anywhere near them Cielo’s special super power always warned them. They became good at keeping secrets and sticking together.</p><p>Their big brother Ron would still give them weird looks from time to time, but he still cared about them. Even if he could be so grouchy sometimes. And loud. He was always very loud. The boys wondered if the older boy knew how to whisper.</p><p>Their little sister also gave them weird looks now and again, but mostly left them alone. Unless she was helping them with a prank, she was very mischievous despite her usually monotonous ways. The twins quickly discovered that their sister was the Queen of sass and sarcasm and they loved it. </p><p>Life continued to be good and then got better when they got their hogwarts letters. They were so excited to learn magic.</p><p>When they arrived at Hogwarts they started digging in to the library and absorbing all the information they could and planning all kinds of cool pranks. At least once a week they’d initiate one of their plans and no one was the wiser. After all, no one expects the two sweet twins to ever cause trouble. Molly always told them they had angelic smiles. They considered letting people know it was them or at least alluding to it, but part of the fun was getting away with their jokes and giggling about them behind everyone's backs. It was when they heard about the Marauders near the end of their first year that they came up with the idea. At the scenes of their biggest pranks they would leave a calling card. Nothing that people would associate with them of course, but something that only they would recognise as theirs.</p><p>Cielo and Terra were also very curious about the big bad snake that apparently lived somewhere in the school. Especially since it apparently had to do with their House as well as their older brothers best friend. </p><p>Harry Potter was also a bit of a curiosity to the twins. He wasn’t anything like the stories, but that was okay, he was still plenty cool. He could be even grouchier than Ron and almost as sarcastic as Ginny. But he also didn’t care one bit about what everyone thought about him. And even though he was a Gryffindor he didn’t really seem that reckless. </p><p>He was amazing on a broomstick and was the Gryffindor’s team star player. The boys couldn’t wait until they could try out for the Quidditch team so they could fly all the time instead of only when they could sneak away from everybody. </p><p>Ron still worried about them every now and then, but he seemed to understand that as long as they were together they’d be just fine.</p><p>There others at the school who seemed interesting to the twins, like the nice, clumsy Malfoy boy that Ron hung out with or the scary and smart brunette girl who reminded Terra of diamonds for some reason. Though they were almost all second years so they didn’t interact with them much. The rest of the interesting people were teachers and while the boys saw their teachers often they didn’t always have the opportunity to talk to them. Besides they both always got a little nervous when talking to teachers. Old habits die hard.</p><p>They got a bit worried when people started turning up petrified. But they didn’t worry too much because Cielo’s special power told him it would all be ok and that everyone would be fine.</p><p>That didn’t keep Terra from nearly crying when he’d heard that scary smart diamond girl had been caught too. Or Cielo from nearly having a panic attack at hearing that the little blond boy first year with the camera obsession and the familiar smell of candy and chocolate had also been petrified. They’d never been so relieved in this life than they had when they heard that everyone was going to truly be okay.</p><p>They still didn’t know why they felt like this, maybe it had something to do with who they were? They weren’t sure yet. But either way they wouldn’t go looking, because it wasn’t yet time. They didn’t know when the time was, but they knew they weren’t supposed to let anyone know till then.</p><p>Till then it would be just them two and they could live with that, because no matter where they were, no matter who they were, they would always be best friends.</p><p>-BRAKE LINE-</p><p>Harry sighed as he stood and left his class. It was his third year at Hogwarts now and after the whole shitty situation with the snake last year and the stone the year before he found himself actually hoping for a calm year. Ha! Him calm!?! That was a funny joke. </p><p>He tightened his hold on his wrathful sky flames to keep them from escaping. He needed to go let out his frustrations somewhere or he might actually end up killing someone. He continued to walk down the hall the image of grumpy nonchalance with his rumpled clothes and his firm scowl. The effect no longer ruined by those horrid glasses since he’d found a spell to fix his eyes. </p><p>He stooped for a second as he heard the sound of cheerful laughter. And a moment later from down the hall came the young weasley twins, jumping and running around each other playfully as they made their way back to their common room. Xanxus watched them go and had to keep himself from grinning. Of course he knew the boys, not well, but he knew them. After all they were that damned sharks little brothers. Harry didn’t normally like kids, with some exceptions, but these two were okay. He grinned as he remembered the uproar they’d caused during their sorting ceremony last year. Who would’ve thought the youngest Weasley boys would have both been put in Slytherin of all places. Then again they hadn’t been the only ones to shake things up with all the old family traditions and shit. Harry still got a kick out of the memory of seeing everyone’s faces when Draco had been sorted into Hufflepuff. Bronco sure did know how to cause a ruckus. Not to mention Ginny’s sorting this year, the Frog had smirked as she’d sashayed her way to the Ravenclaw table. It had been hilarious.</p><p>Harry kept walking down the hall to the Gryffindor dorms, he was itching to get his hands on his broom so he could fly up high in the sky. Maybe then he could get himself to relax a bit.</p><p>He turned the corner only to run into none other than Bronco and his right hand man not two steps behind him. “Draco, Oliver.” He greeted with a simple nod. “Hi Harry. Are you heading out to the Quidditch field?” Draco asked with that friendly smile of his that made Harry want to punch him and then apologise for it. “Yup. Where are the others?” Harry asked as there were almost always at least a handful of the others with Draco. They’d almost all been brought back. Marshmallow freak and his lot, the princess girl and the babies, the earth brats people, baby boss’s friends, his insane lot and many others. Most of them were here at Hogwarts, others were at other schools or were already adults.</p><p>“They went to go look through the first years again. To see if maybe they missed them by accident.” Draco said and his smile was gone now and there was a sad look in his eyes that reflected in Oliver’s behind him. Hell, Harry was pretty sure his eyes looked similar as well.</p><p>It had been bloody hard to find everyone because in this world it was practically impossible to sense flames since there was too much magic interfering with it. The only way you could sense flames was if they were being actively used and you were in close proximity. The fact they’d all managed to find each other was mostly dumb luck and being in the right place at the right time. Harry doesn’t think he’ll ever forget the day he walked into his dorm room back in their first year to find his new red haired roommate playing around with blue flames in his hands, if only cause the look on the sharks face was hilarious. Since then Ron had been by his side again, just as he always will be.</p><p>“Do you think they might find them?” Draco asked again and even Harry with all his emotional constipation could hear the hopelessness and desperation in his voice.</p><p>Cause they’d found everyone. Well, almost everyone. They were still missing two important people. But it had been three years now and everyone else had already been found, even those who were outside of the school. Every year they would search through the new first years looking for something, something that might give away the ones they were looking for. And every year, for three years, they’d been disappointed. None more so than Hermione and her lot as well as Blaise and his friends, after all the people they were looking for were their missing pieces. Smoking bomb and Ice queen never gave up though, and every year it was them who would rally everyone saying they’d find them for sure eventually. Harry really hoped so. And he also hopped, that wherever they are they were together. He knew how they hated to be alone.</p><p>“I don’t know.” Harry answered with a long sigh that sounded much older than the thirteen year old boy looked. Draco released a similar sigh and simply nodded.</p><p>“I’m going to grab my broom and for a ride, wanna come with?” Harry asked tiredly, while normally he would have preferred to go alone, he just wasn’t feeling like it today. And besides, it always felt nice to fly with another sky. </p><p>“Sure I’m not as good as you, but I think we both need this. Oliver you want to come?” Draco grinned sheepishly before turning to his right hand man and best friend.</p><p>“I may be the Gryffindor Quidditch team Captain, but even I can’t keep up with a pair of skies while they’re flying, I think I’ll just watch from bellow to make sure you don’t fall down Boss.” Olive grinned kindly down at the blond boy.</p><p>“Muh, I’m not that clumsy.” Draco pouted as they all continued walking in the direction Harry had been headed.</p><p>“Yes you are.” Harry stated simply as they continued walking. Draco just pouted harder.</p><p>The trio continued walking down the hallway in comfortable silence until they heard a screech come from one of the nearby classes. Curious, the three boys opened the door and found a class of first year Charms students all floating around in the air screeching and squealing and panicking as they didn’t know what had happened. “What the fuck happened here?” Harry asked with a puzzled look in his eyes, somebody didn’t honestly screw up the Leviosa charm that badly. Sure Seamus blew his up, but Seamus was an annoying idiot. “It looks like last years mystery prankster may have struck again.” Draco chuckled to himself, he always found these pranks entertaining. Even when they were on him.   </p><p>“We don’t know! One minute we’re listening to the professor and the next minute we’re all floating in the air and flash of light happened and then that appeared.” one of the kids said panickedly as he pointed at something at the front of the class. Harry, Oliver and Draco all turned to look and were shocked to find that right in the middle of the black board was a sunset orange and magma red graffiti design that spelled out two words. Terra and Cielo.    </p><p>Could it be? Was it possible?</p><p>No one else had any obvious reasons to use these monikers, right?</p><p>Could they have finally arrived?</p><p>Could it really be them!</p>
