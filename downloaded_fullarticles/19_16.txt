              <span class="">The wise Rowena Ravenclaw had sent the Baron to save her only daughter from a savage nest of Albanian vampires. It was only now that the man realised the complication he had not anticipated: Helena Ravenclaw had no intention of returning home to civilised society. When he had arrived in the forest, he expected to find a fragile, frightened young woman, but instead he barely recognised his betrothed. A tough, stubborn, warpaint covered huntress, who had been accepted and honoured within the vampire clan soon after her abduction, much to the Baron's confusion and dismay. </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">"Lady Helena?" He said tentatively, palms raised to indicate he meant no threat. </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">The woman stiffened and her eyes narrowed as though the name offended her or perhaps she was unused to hearing it. It had been almost two years since she had vanished from Wizarding Britain, after all. </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">"I'm not going to hurt you." the Baron said gently, using the tone he reserved for small, frightened children. "Your mother worries about you." He said, hoping the reminder of home and family would soften the woman's fierce nature enough to return with him. She was clearly in need of an entire team of healers to analyse her current mental state, and she would have them. The Baron did not merely hold an esteemed title, but all the landholdings and galleons that went with it. </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">At the mention of Rowena however, Helena hissed furiously, brandishing a spear at her fiance. It was tipped not with stone or blade, he now realised, but with her wand. "Did she send you?" Helena asked quietly. Relieved and hoping that she was returning to her senses, the Baron nodded eagerly. </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">"Yes! I've come to take you home Helena. Your mother misses you very much." </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">Helena snorted derisively, (a most unladylike sound that made her companion cringe) as she pressed the wand tip of her spear against his throat. "And what did Mother promise you in return?" She said shrewdly, a dangerous edge to her voice. </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">"Nothing!" The Baron exclaimed. Helena tossed her head disbelievingly, her many beaded braids glinting in the twilight eve. "Nothing that wasn't already promised." He amended. "Come home Helena. Be my wife as you promised." He implored her, looking deep into her eyes for some sign that she still had some tender feeling remaining for him as she once had. </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">For a moment, Helena seemed to soften, her expression relaxing as she removed the wand tipped spear from his throat and studied his handsome face. But with a speed that was hardly to be believed, Helena struck him with the handle of her spear, knocking him to the ground, as seven or eight vampires appeared in the clearing, binding the Baron and dragging him blindfolded to the location of their nest. </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">When the Baron came to, he found he was in the centre of a circle of vampires - at least 40 by his rough estimate. Glancing to his side, he saw that his blade had been taken from him while he was unconscious and he sighed inwardly. Not that the sword would have helped much against this small army of vampires, but it was a treasured family heirloom and he hated to think it could be lost forever in this forest. He suddenly realised that he was being spoken to and quickly focused his gaze on the vampire addressing him. </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">"You were unwise to come here, stranger." The vampire said. Odd to be scolded by a creature intent on killing him, the Baron thought wryly, before refocusing his attention. Oh no, he had just been asked a question and he hadn't heard what it was. Given the situation he found himself in, he thought it best not to try the patience of vampires by asking them to repeat themselves. </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">"I am no stranger." He said proudly. "One of yours is known to me. Lady Helena - my betrothed." There was much muttering as the vampire presiding over the interrogation turned to confer with the Council of Elders who were seated behind him. Finally, the interrogator turned back to face the Baron. </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">"There is nobody here by that name." He said dismissively. </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">"Her." He said, jerking his head in Helena's direction - she was easily recognisable, the most beautiful woman in the crowd and the tallest. </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">"You speak of Chieftainess Cadî?" The interrogator inquired. </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">"Yes." The Baron said, relieved to finally be getting somewhere. "Helena or Cadî, she is my betrothed. We are engaged to be married." </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">"This cannot be true." A tall vampire said furiously, scowling at the Baron. "Cadî is my intended. I am named the bridegroom of the Chieftainess!" </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">Angry muttering broke out all around the circle. "She is not one of us." One vampire said furiously. </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">"She has not taken the bite." Another agreed. The betrothed vampire raised his hands for silence, speaking only to Helena and inquiring if it was true that she was promised to another. When Helena acknowledged this as truth, there were whispers of "shame" and "scandalous" passed around the circle.</span>

<p></p><div class=""><p>"So be it." The tall vampire said quietly. "Release him and return his weapons." The Baron was stunned. They were going to let him go? "Let it be known, that I Vladimir of the clan Malus, proclaim my right to be the sole betrothed of my bride, this dishonor cannot stand." The tall vampire proclaimed for all in the circle to hear. "Stranger, I challenge you to a fight to the death, as is our custom. Should you defeat me, Chieftainess Cadî shall wed you and return to her homeland in your company. But if I should prevail," he said, throwing Helena a dark look, "the Chieftainess becomes one with our clan this night and takes the bite."</p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>The Baron thought he detected a flicker of fear in Helena's eyes, but the uncertainty in her face quickly vanished as she nodded approvingly at Vladimir in understanding of his terms. Vladimir took a long spear, a pike as his weapon and he and the Baron (now reunited with his heirloom sword) faced each other. The Baron stood still, calculating, sword ready in hand as Vladimir prowled in a circle around him, making a few thrusts with his spear to test his reaction time.</p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>Too late, the Baron realised that his heavy armour was more likely to be a hindrance than a help. Vladimir was quick, too quick and the Baron tried not to think about Helena's fate if he should fail.</p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>"She's mine you know." Vladimir said, taunting him. "She is promised to me for eternity."</p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>"She will never be yours." The Baron said, swinging at Vladimir with his sword. He missed, metal striking stone as Vladimir dodged the blow easily, thrusting his spear toward his opponent's chest which was swiftly blocked. Helena watched anxiously, unsure as to who she wished the victor to be. She had a place in the clan forever if Vladimir claimed her tonight, but if the Baron was victorious, she would be forced to face up to past mistakes, not the least of which was the theft of her mother's prized diadem.</p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>She winced as Vladimir's spear glanced off the Baron's armour. Her old friend grinned to himself, knowing it was the best goblin made armour galleons could buy. His grin quickly faded when Vladimir struck him on the jaw with the handle of his spear. The Baron stumbled backward, off balance for a moment as he reeled from the sheer force of the blow. He recovered quickly slashing his sword across the vampire's throat but Vladimir leaped backward just in time.</p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>"You'll have to do better than that!" Vladimir exclaimed cockily, but the Baron was too focused on staying alive to bother with a quick witted retort. He charged at the vampire, thrusting his sword at Vladimir's chest. The vampire parried the stroke of the sword as blows were exchanged and blocked time and again between the two, who were suprisingly evenly matched. As the Baron twisted and spun to evade another of the vampire's strikes, he felt the blunt end of Vladimir's spear catch him on the back of the head. He stumbled forward, stunned by the blow as he felt a soft trickle of blood course down the back of his neck.</p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>He heard the vampire approach and spun quickly slashing through the air in front of Vladimir's face with surprising ferocity. Vladimir blocked the blow of his rival's sword yet again and the pair exchanged blow after blow, the vampire seeming to evade every single one of the Baron's attacks. The Baron felt himself getting angry and frustrated as he swung at the vampire again and again. Anger granting him renewed vigour, he swung his sword so fast and furiously that the vampire almost backflipped to evade his attacks, putting some distance between them as they squared off against each other again.</p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>Charging forward, the Baron struck such a blow that when Vladimir blocked it, the shaft of the spear snapped clean in two. The vampire caught a second spear from one of his supporters as the Baron gritted his teeth furiously. It didn't feel fair, though he knew he would never kill an unarmed man, or vampire for that matter. Just as he reached this conclusion, his legs were swept out from under him and he landed on his back hard.</p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>Winded and exhausted, he didn't even try to fight off Vladimir's attacks as the vampire landed on top of him, casting his spear aside and punching the Baron in the face, time and time again, with all the strength he could muster. Bruised, bleeding and feeling a radiating pain from what he suspected was a broken jaw, the Baron croaked out "Finish it then." Blood trickled from the corner of his mouth. </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>The vampire smiled, reaching for his spear before changing his mind. "Not yet, my friend." Vladimir muttered into the Baron's ear. "You see, all this fighting has made me thirsty. Looks like the first round's on you!" And with that, he lowered his mouth to the Baron's throat, his sharp fangs revealed as he prepared to drink from him. But with a sudden surge of strength, the Baron swung his hidden long-knife upwards, Vladimir's head rolling across the ground scarcely a moment later.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div>

              <span class="">There was a deathly silence as the clan of vampires were rendered speechless in shock at the defeat of Vladimir who was an esteemed warrior among them. Helena howled in grief, her screams of anguish echoing in the clearing, for she had truly cared for Vladimir and now all was lost. Knowing he had mere seconds before a horde of angry vampires murdered him, the Baron rolled to his feet and sprinted to a sobbing Helena. </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">Grabbing her hand, he twisted and spun, disapparating away with her before any of the assembled vampires could react. The Baron and Helena appeared on the outskirts of the forest, for he knew the vampires were unlikely to venture beyond its borders once daybreak came. A grief stricken Helena collapsed on all fours and sobbed as her future husband looked on with pity. </span>
            </p></div><div class=""><p> </p></div><div class=""><p>
              <span class="">Knowing it was dangerous for them to linger on the edge of the forest, the Baron took her arm intending to apparate directly to Rowena Ravenclaw's residence in Britain. But Helena wrested her arm from his grip, downing a tiny phial of silvery liquid before he could stop her. The effect was instantaneous, Helena Ravenclaw lay motionless in the Baron's arms, a lingering expression of grim satisfaction on her face... </span>
