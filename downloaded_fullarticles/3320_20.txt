          <div class="userstuff"><p align="justify">We didn‘<span>t have any agreement about our meetings. So I wasn’t </span><span>upset when he didn’t appear for a month. Month and a half.</span></p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>I was not upset at all.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Sure, it was weird at the beginning. I got used to a lot of sexual activity. And when I wasn’t getting any, I was agitated.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>But otherwise I was fine. Because it had to come to an end. </span>
  <span>I was thankful it did.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>I was finally regaining my balance.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>My thoughts belonged to me once again.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Here and there I was wondering what happened. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>I didn’t seek any information about him.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>I was free.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="center">***<br/>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>I was getting ready for a</span>
  <span>n evening</span>
  <span> out with Pansy, when I heard knocking.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>My jaw almost fell to the ground. Almost.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">‘<span>Hello.’ </span><span>Potter was standing on my threshold. </span><span>With a scar from his forehead to his jaw. Not deep but still visible.</span></p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>I raised my eyebrow in a calm manner. ‘Hello Potter.’</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">‘<span>Are you going out?’ he looked at my </span><span>dress shirt and trousers.</span></p>
<p align="justify">‘<span>Yes,’ I nodded.</span></p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>He shrugged. ‘Right. Well I’ll be going then. I just wanted to see you.’ </span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>No! No, no, no, no.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>It was supposed to be done. And if it wasn’t, I should have ended it right there and then.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>I was going to say: ‘Don’t come here again.’</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">‘<span>Do you want to come in?’ I said nonchalantly </span><span>instead</span><span>.</span></p>
<p align="justify">‘<span>Yeah, sure.’</span></p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>I led him to the kitchen and offered a drink.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">‘<span>So,’ I gestured at his face.</span></p>
<p align="justify">‘<span>It’s nothing, just a scratch.’ He drank.</span></p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>He came where I stood. He rubbed my collar between his fingers. ‘You look really hot in this.’</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>I felt his warm breath against </span>
  <span>my lips. ‘Of course I do.’</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>He smiled but he looked tired. ‘</span>
  <span>When are you leaving?’ he asked.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">‘<span>Soon.’</span></p>
<p align="justify">‘<span>Okay. I’ll go.’ H</span><span>e turned and walked to the door.</span></p>
<p align="justify">‘<span>What happened Potter?’ I blurted. I was morbidly curious.</span></p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>His brows were furrowed when he turned around. ‘What do you mean?’</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Either he was honestly this thick or truly exhausted. I was thinking former.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">‘<span>Why is your face even uglier than before?’ </span></p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>He snorted and rubbed at the scar. ‘We were on the job and a </span>
  <span>seriously nasty spell hit me. It was bleeding on and off for weeks, couldn’t be healed.’ </span>
</p>
<p align="justify">‘<span>Well that’s too bad,’ came my brilliant answer. </span></p>
<p align="justify">‘<span>I think I’ll live,’ he shrugged.</span></p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>I </span>
  <span>made three long steps and kissed him. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>Was I possessed? Possibly.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>He kissed back with need. Pulled my head and body closer.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>I could feel his heartbeat where I was holding his wrist.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">‘<span>God, I missed you.’ He mumbled into my mouth.</span></p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>I was breathless for a moment. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>This was so careless. I was </span>
  <span>so </span>
  <span>careless. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>I should have just thrown him out when I could. I was excellent without him.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>But </span>
  <span>I went back to being a mess. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  <span>With his arms around me.</span>
