  <em>
    <span>The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>One minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds. . . twenty. . . ten. . . nine -- maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three. . . two. . . one. .</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The door to the shack opened on soundless hinges, where earlier it had creaked and scraped terribly across the floor; and a figure emerged from the darkness outside as if made from it. Harry froze, staring wide-eyed at the face of what he assumed to be a man.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Pardon me,” the man whispered in a voice that carried, “for the intrusion, Harry Potter. I have been sent to ensure the receipt of your letter in my colleague’s stead.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He stepped forward into the dim moonlight; Harry took in details of the man’s face, what little could be seen of it, as he sat up from his spot on the floor, shivering a bit in the draft from the walls. The visitor’s face was thin, but showed few signs of age; he could be anywhere between twenty-five and forty-five. Harry would have tried to puzzle it out using his hair color, but the man’s head was wrapped in a black (or red, maybe, he couldn’t tell in the light) turban. The headwear probably matched the essentially-black, flowing outfit that the visitor wore, underneath the long grey coat from which he drew another envelope, just one, when Harry had tiptoed past Dudley to approach him.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thank you, sir,” he offered, accepting the smooth white envelope from the visitor’s hands. Harry stared down at it, thumbing over the large wax seal -- entirely oblivious to the brief surprise and twitching smirk that crossed the man’s face.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Harry stifled a snort at the address. He looked back up at the visitor’s face. “Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t ask your name. Thank you for coming all the way out here in the rain.” Although, was it a trick of the light, or did the man’s coat seem far drier than circumstances would suggest it ought to be?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It is no trouble, Mr. Potter. My name is Quirinus Quirrell; under the circumstances, I invite you to call me Quirinus.” Harry stepped aside as the man -- Quirrell -- strode forward into the room, hanging his coat on a coat-hook Harry hadn’t noticed on the wall before. He crouched down beside the fireplace, fiddling quietly with the bits of chip bags Uncle Vernon had left in the hearth, and a moment later, to Harry’s great surprise, a small glow soon lit the place. Dudley, for his part, barely stirred on the couch.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He glanced back down at the envelope, then back at Quirrell -- who was indeed wearing all black -- then at the door where his aunt and uncle were still sleeping. “...Circumstances, sir?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Indeed,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Quirrell murmured, seating himself cross-legged on the floor by the fire. “Given the extent to which your… relatives,” he said the word with some distaste, “have refused you access to your letters, I believe there is much you need to know. Let us discuss this matter where it is warm, yes?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Puzzled, but curious, Harry took a seat opposite the man, basking in the heat of the flames. From a pocket, Quirrell produced two small, clear bags of what appeared to be mixed nuts and dried fruits. He handed one to Harry, and picked idly at the other for a moment.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The trail mix was, frankly, a godsend; Harry had been hungry for several days at this point, and had barely managed to keep down the greasy crisps Uncle Vernon had given him a few hours ago. He tried not to eat too quickly, lest he make himself sick.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After a few minutes of surprisingly comfortable silence between them, Quirrell spoke again, though he paused to take a mouthful of his own bag of mix every few sentences. “Tell me, Mr. Potter, have you ever caused, or had something happen to you, that was especially convenient or inconvenient? Something which seems almost impossible for you to have done, and yet you -- or your relatives -- are convinced is your fault?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The shrinking sweater. The blue wig. The Roof Incident. His hair growing back overnight. The </span>
  <em>
    <span>disappearing glass --</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, I think so. Several times.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Then perhaps what I am about to tell you will not seem so far-fetched.” Quirrell leaned forward slightly, fixing Harry with a serious look. “These events, seemingly impossible, were caused by magic. You and I, and many others worldwide, are magicals -- capable of bending magic to our will.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry blinked. Several times. He found he didn’t quite doubt Quirrell’s claim, when he put it that way. “So… I’m a magical.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“Indeed,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Quirrell agreed. From one sleeve, he retrieved a long white stick, vaguely bone-shaped at one end. “In Britain, we refer to ourselves as ‘wizards’, and to female practitioners of magic as ‘witches’. What I have here is a wand: a conduit for magic that most practitioners use for modern magical workings, generally referred to as ‘spells’ or ‘spellwork’.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry gazed at the stick -- the wand -- with no small degree of wonder. “May I see a spell, sir?” He hoped he didn’t sound overeager.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Quirrell’s lips quirked up in an encouraging smile. “I had hoped you would ask that. With your permission, I would like to cast a privacy ward -- a wide-area spell -- so that we need not worry about interruptions from your relatives.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Given how worried Harry had been about that very possibility, he nodded eagerly, and watched Quirrell direct the wand in a quick motion, murmuring several phrases in what sounded almost like Latin. Then, he clapped his hands very loudly, several times, and Harry watched, delighted, as Dudley didn’t even stir.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Excellent. Now, if I may take a few more liberties to make this hut more comfortable…” He snapped his fingers, and the fire roared, crackling loudly, pouring out much more light and heat than it had a moment prior. Harry leaned slightly away from it, grinning, and realized he was now sitting on a very comfortable cushion, instead of the hard stone floor. Quirrell, for his part, was leaning back on his hands, basking in the heat. “Ah… much better,” he sighed. “As you can see, with magic, we need never go without basic comforts. I believe it is a prime time to mention that the trail mix bag is ever-refilling, so long as there is at least one nut or fruit left inside.”</span>
</p>
<p><span>Harry’s eyebrows climbed into his hairline. “Magic is </span><b>great</b><span>,”</span> <span>he breathed.</span></p>
<p>
  <span>“Indeed.” Quirrell sat back up again, rolling his shoulders, and returned his wand to his sleeve. “But I digress. You know now that you are a wizard -- albeit an untrained one. The letter before you is an offer to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a boarding school in Scotland which is Britain’s place of magical education. I am presently employed at Hogwarts as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, and it is in this capacity that I was sent to bring you your letter and introduce you into the magical world. Would you like a letter opener?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>By this point, Harry had already used a fingernail to break the wax seal and open the heavy envelope. He smiled sheepishly up at Quirrell, then went back to it, retrieving the contents with faintly trembling hands. There were several pieces of equally-heavy paper inside.</span>
</p>

  <em>
    <span>Dear Mr. Potter,</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Yours sincerely,</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p align="center">

  </em>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Deputy Headmistress</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What does the letter mean by ‘await my owl’, sir?” Harry squinted down at the neat script, wondering if he’d misread it. His glasses were a bit blurry.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Magicals in Britain and Europe use owls to carry their post -- and sometimes other birds, such as falcons,” Quirrell explained. “I have also seen, on rare occasions, such different birds as ravens and flamingoes.” Harry shared the man’s smile at the idea. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Flamingoes.</span>
  </em>
  <span> “As I have successfully brought you your letter in person, you need not owl back if you decide to attend; I can pass that information along directly.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’d like to attend,” Harry said immediately.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Just then, the door from the other room creaked open, revealing a groggy Aunt Petunia rubbing at her eyes and squinting about the room. Harry couldn’t restrain a giggle when she ignore both him and Quirrell, instead shuffling over to where Dudley lay in order to read the time on his digital watch. (It was half past midnight.) Quirrell watched her with equal amusement, eyes glittering. “At present, only magical folk can detect the presence of anything within the confines of our warded space,” he reminded Harry. “Muggles -- non-magicals -- such as your aunt here, and her son, if the boy were awake, will not only ignore us, but they will ignore that anything is here to </span>
  <b>be</b>
  <span> ignored. In other words, we are hidden so well, that we do not exist.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Wicked,” Harry breathed.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Perhaps this is interfering of me to suggest,” murmured Quirrell thoughtfully, as Aunt Petunia returned to her room, “but by magical law, your Muggle relatives are considered your property, rather than your guardians. If we were, say, to erase all traces of magical activity within this hut and take our leave before they awaken in the morning…” he shrugged. “There would be no legal consequences. And I might suggest several well-reputed magical inns across Britain, several in London, where one may find a bed, a bath, and regular meals for the remaining month until Hogwarts classes begin, were you so inclined.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry considered the suggestion. “Would I be able to afford it?” he had to ask.</span>
</p>
<p><span>“Certainly,”</span> <span>Quirrell answered immediately. “Your substantial inheritance of magical currency notwithstanding, I would be more than happy to pay on your behalf.”</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Harry considered the suggestion a second time, minus that concern. He looked back to Quirrell with a small smile. “Should I leave a note?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Only if you wish to.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Slowly, a smirk spread across Harry’s face. “Then… I won’t.” An answering smirk from Quirrell, a conspiratorial glint in his eyes. “When will we leave?”</span>
</p>
<p><span>The man rose from his cushion; it disappeared in a puff of silver sparks. He crossed the room to where his coat still hung on the coat-hook, and put it back on. “Now, if you like,”</span> <span>came the reply.</span></p>
<p>
  <span>The fire faded away as Harry picked himself up off the floor. The sound of the rain grew louder; the hut went cold and drafty once more. It was incredible to think that he’d been huddled, hungry and shivering, in the corner of this room less than an hour before.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Albus -- Dumbledore, that is -- believes I will be transporting you to London by Muggle means. Kindly allow him to keep believing that, if he ever asks.” Quirrell offered Harry his elbow. “It will be much more practical, however, if we link elbows and travel by the magical instant transport known as Apparition.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry hooked his arm in the crook of Quirrell’s elbow, grinning. In a blink, they were no longer in the hut, with nary a sound to indicate their departure.</span>
