    <p>"Ravenclaw!" With shaking hands, Jungkook raised from the chair in the front of the great hall.</p>
<p>Someone lifted the sorting hat off his head, as if they lifted an imaginary weight of his shoulders. It seemed like the ground was shaking beneath his unsteady feet and from around him, the people were clapping and the light sound echoed through the seemingly endless room. Trying not to stumble over his own feet, he managed to step down the few stairs and walk to the next best table, not bothering to even spare a second glance at the banner waving above it, or the colours of the students' uniforms. As soon as he sat down and there was a loud wave of laughter going through the crowd, he realized something was off. Did he sit on a whoopee-cushion or something?</p>
<p>Next to him, an older boy leaned over and mumbled; "Sorry mate but this is the Gryffindor-table."</p>
<p>Jungkook could feel a soft blush creep up his cheeks and he quickly rose from where he had been sitting again. After a slight bow to the former Gryffindor, he was quick to turn and automatically went for the table where people were gesturing to sit at their table, with an amused shimmer in their eyes. He could feel countless pairs of eyes on him, most of them amused, a few annoyed and some even nonchalant. As if this wasn't the very first time in years that a new student sat on the wrong table. At that very moment was the first time within the Hogwarts castle, in which Jungkook actually wanted to sink into the floor and disappear but most certainly not the last one.</p>
<p>A Ravenclaw, yeah right... The young boy could remember the conversations on the dinner table of his family's house the evening before. "I bet you would make an outstanding Gryffindor dear!" his mother had said, while she shovelled some fried potatoes onto his plate. His father on the other hand, seemed to have different plans for him, "don't be silly sweetheart, this boy is fairly obvious a born Hufflepuff, don't you think so, son?" Jungkook could only shrug barely visible, too occupied in pretending to be busy with his dinner.</p>
<p>On the other side of the table, his brother had snorted loudly (afterwards hissing from the pain of food in his nose, thanks Karma) and gave a sceptical look to their parents. "You don't know him the way I do." he said, "This boy right there is pure evil. I say, he'll get sorted into Slytherin." In the end they all ended up betting their last Christmas-presents on which house Jungkook would be put into. But there was never a word about Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>Pulling himself out of his thoughts again, Jungkook sat down at the Ravenclaw table and watched the ceremony go by. There were a lot of Hufflepuffs this year and Jungkook smiled whenever he saw the students with the yellow ties jump up excitedly to welcome a new part of their family. He himself had been addressed by a few other students already, but the conversations had never been very long, rather a sign of formal politeness.</p>
<p>After a few other people had been sorted, his eyes wandered back to the Gryffindor-table, to eye the guy that had kindly pointed out to Jungkook that he was actually sitting on the wrong table. On second glance, he was fairly beautiful; natural brown hair falling in perfect strands into a pair of bright, doe eyes. Looking at him now, it seemed like he was already a lot older than Jungkook himself, if he had to guess, probably even a sixth year. There was a girl clinging to his arm on one side and another boy, probably a bit younger than him opposite to him, every now and then leaning over the table to whisper something to him. Jungkook didn't notice he was staring, until the former boy met his eye and gave him a blinding smile, winking barely noticeable.</p>
<p>Shyly averting his gaze, Jungkook looked in the opposite direction, over at the Slytherin-table. Most of the students seemed to already be bored by the ceremony, but some still clapped whenever a new student got sorted into a different house. Jungkook always thought that Slytherins would be impolite and grumpy all the time, as superficial as it sounded. But seeing them give warm smiles and bright gazes to their newcomers, some even opening their arms to start a comfortable hug, made Jungkook slowly but surely believe otherwise. To be honest, in the beginning he might have even been scared of the house but maybe they'd surprise him in the end.</p>
<p>Most of them had dark hair, maybe some dyed strands but there was only one person that seemed to stick out a little too much on the long table. He was sitting a bit further in the back, which made it hard for Jungkook to look at him but the bright, bubble-gum-pink hair was helpful in finding the boy in the middle of the Slytherin crowd. And it seemed like Jungkook wasn't the only one directing his attention to the bright boy, since he found a lot of other students pinning their gazes at him in an interested way. Something about him was just confusing. Not necessarily in a bad way, just in a rather... mysterious one.</p>
<p>Compared to the boy with black hair and a few blue strands, that sat next to him, the pink-haired boy seemed a little out of place on the Slytherin-table. Whenever there was a newcomer, he was the loudest to cheer, and his face never showed any nonchalance, like the other people on the Slytherin-table. Sure, he wasn't the only one that seemed a little brighter than the others but Jungkook found him to be especially bubbly, compared to his housemates.</p>
<p>Suddenly Jungkook felt a nudge in his side and he looked over to meet a young boy his age, with a pair of big, smiling eyes, "what are you looking at?"</p>
<p>At first, Jungkook was surprised by the sudden curiosity that came seemingly out of nowhere... until he remembered at which table he was sitting, "Uhm... I was just-"</p>
<p>"Did you hope you were getting into Slytherin?" the other rambled on, without giving Jungkook the chance to even attempt putting a bad excuse together.</p>
<p>"Honestly, I was just-"</p>
<p>He should just give up, he realized as soon as the other started talking again; "I would've thought you to be a Slytherin rather than a Ravenclaw too... maybe also a Gryffindor." he smiled widely and Jungkook found himself subconsciously reflecting the motion, if only a little bit, "I, for myself think I'm in the right house, even though everyone thought I was bound to be Gryffindor."</p>
<p>For the first time it seemed like the other boy was done talking and Jungkook, without thinking twice, used his chance to contribute something to the conversation; "It was unexpected for me too, believe me. I'm Jungkook by the way."</p>
<p>"Yugyeom." the other responded fondly, "So what do you find so interesting about that Mister pink Slytherin over there?"</p>
<p>Jungkook felt his eyes widen comically. How could he have noticed? "Uhm I wasn't..."</p>
<p>"Please students calm down a little!" Thank the heavens for Professor Dumbledore.</p>
<p>All through the head's speech, Yugyeom remained quiet and gave Jungkook the chance to cast another look at the Slytherin with the pink hair. He didn't seem too interested in the speech, as if he had already heard it a few times too often and instead exchanged a few mumbled words with the raven haired next to him, who seemed ready to step right out the door, to the common room of the Slytherins and fall right into his bed. Jungkook gulped when he watched the pink haired a little more precise.</p>
<p>If the Gryffindor from before was beautiful, then this boy was stunning. Soft features, that would have made boys just as much as girls jealous, eyes that were curved like they had been sculptured into his face and lips, so full that Jungkook found himself wondering if they actually tasted the way his hair looked. The robe he was wearing, seemed to be a little oversized on him and his hands, although seeming strong looked like the one's of a baby. Just when Jungkook was about to avoid his gaze he met eyes with the other boy, next to the pink haired and he shivered.</p>
<p>Those feline eyes were literally burning holes into him and he had never turned around in his whole life so quickly. Every now and then he could still feel the raven's dark glance on his back and whenever he tried to turn around and get another glance at the pink boy again, he was only met with the same death glare from the previous times. After a while, he decided to give up and get himself together again, locking his eyes on Professor Dumbledore instead.</p>
<p>Soon enough the speech was finished and as if by magic, the plates and bowls on their tables filled with a delicious spectrum of meals. Not hesitating a second, Jungkook reached over to get himself a piece of pumpkin-cake and after only a few seconds had his mouth stuffed with white cream and delicious cake. A blissful feeling spread in his stomach and he closed his eyes for a second to enjoy the moment that the amazing meal caused inside his chest. But the moment should not last for too long, as he felt a slight jolt against his shoulder, causing him to drive his ribs against the edge of the table in a slightly painful manner.</p>
<p>Jungkook could have sworn his soul left the shell of his body, as soon as he turned around and made eye contact with the person that had shoved him. Standing in front of him, was the raven-haired boy from the Slytherin-table. He was towering over Jungkook like a hawk, cold eyes freezing Jungkook's body and forbidding him to move even a finger. Truth be told, if Jungkook would've stood up, he would have beat the other boy by size with ease, since he seemed to be almost half a head taller than the other. But that was only if he got up and the iron hand that had settled on his shoulder was more than convincing for him to stay down.</p>
<p>"Uhm, sorry can I-"</p>
<p>"Stop molesting Jimin or I get you killed."</p>
<p>Jungkook felt the grip on his shoulder tighten just the slightest bit and he did his best to refrain from hissing in pain. The burning eyes of the other boy were like spikes that split Jungkook's scalp and burned themselves into his brain, accompanied by an extremely unpleasant feeling of anguish. Around him, he could hear a part of the Ravenclaw-table fall silent and even a few Gryffindors were directing their attention to the unpleasant conversation. This was the second time in the Hogwarts castle in which Jungkook wanted nothing more than to disappear.</p>
<p>He flinched again, when the other shook his shoulder again to get an answer or another sort of reaction, "I- I'm sorry I'm not sure I understand."</p>
<p>The raven rolled his eyes, feline silhouettes flickering with pure annoyance, "I thought you were a Ravenclaw, you should be able to figure out what I'm talking about." but Jungkook stood silent, "listen if I ever find you staring at Jimin like a total creep again, you won't see the next sunlight, have I made myself clear enough for you?"</p>
<p>In Jungkook's mind, finally something clicked into place and at last the situation started to make some kind of sense. This was about the pink haired Slytherin. Finally seeming to be in the picture about what was going on, he gave a hurried nod, eyes pressed closed a little scared of a punch coming his way. But his fear seemed to be unnecessary, when the death grip on his shoulder finally disappeared and only left an insipid trace of pain behind on his body. However he still felt the other's presence behind him and didn't dare to look up just yet.</p>
<p>"You better put a leash on him Jaebum, I can't afford wasting my time with a pubertal, love-struck teenager." and just like that, he was gone, swiftly sliding between the tables of the two houses and slipping back onto his spot next to the pink haired boy.</p>
<p>Finally Jungkook allowed himself to breathe again, a thick wave of air leaving his body that he didn't even realize he had been holding. The Ravenclaw around him were staring at him in pure confusion, some even with a hint of sympathy or worry. And supposedly they were right to worry about their housemate, after all Jungkook had just been in the castle for about two hours and already seemed to have gotten himself into trouble. Just great, his family would be delighted.</p>
<p>"Don't take him too serious", Jungkook looked up to meet eyes with an older boy, which the Slytherin had addressed as 'Jaebum' before, "Yoongi is an asshole at first but he's really just caring a lot about his friends."</p>
<p>"Speaking of, what's your deal with Jimin?" Another Ravenclaw asked curiously around a mouth of rice.</p>
<p>Gulping down a thick lump in his throat, Jungkook moved his hand to stab at the remains of his cake, not really feeling all that hungry anymore, "It's nothing really... I don't even know him."</p>
<p>"But you must've done SOMETHING to him." Yugyeom tried to dig further, "Otherwise that Yoongi-guy wouldn't have acted like that."</p>
<p>"I really didn't-"</p>
<p>"I think that's enough of that Yugyeom." Jaebum interrupted and earned a thankful gaze from Jungkook, "let's enjoy dinner for now, the food isn't going to eat itself. Tell us about you Jungkook, what's your hometown like?"</p>
<p>They carried on with their conversation through the whole meal, Jungkook finding out a lot about Yugyeom and Jaebum, while the two were just as well firing questions at him all through. He was glad that the topic about the boy called Jimin seemed to have been forgotten and he tried to keep his mind from suggesting the idea to throw another curious look at the Slytherin. Successfully ignoring the Slytherin table until the end of dinner, he managed to enjoy his time, talking to other Ravenclaws on the table as well and starting to memorize a few names.</p>
<p>Nonetheless he could still feel a pair of eyes dig into the back of his neck, but strangely they didn't seem the feline ones from before but rather a pair of dark, curious eyes that he had tried to meet so much before.</p>
<p>-*-</p>
<p>"I'm so late." Jungkook huffed to himself, wandering the empty hallways of the castle and trying to somehow follow the small map in his hand, "I'm so dead."</p>
<p>When everyone told Jungkook about how amazing the architecture of Hogwarts was, they all forgot to mention just one little detail; this place was a fucking labyrinth. He already knew that he'd have to spend a lot of time later on, trying to find his dorms and probably ending up sleeping in the courtyard anyways. Because that was the only place he had no trouble with finding, since he somehow always ended up there in the end, no matter which direction he took, as if the castle itself was moving it's walls and hallways to make him run in circles.</p>
<p>He turned around a corner again and once more found himself staring at the fresh green of a bunch of small trees and the waving motion of long blades of grass. A sigh escaped him and Jungkook was about to scream to make at least SOMEONE notice him and maybe help him out, until he realized that he wasn't alone anyway;</p>
<p>Two smaller figures sat hidden in the crown of one of the huge trees, the thick layers of leaves almost hiding them completely. Maybe Jungkook would have just passed them by, if he hadn't gotten a glimpse of fluffy, pink hair, breaking through the poisonous green. Admittedly, he felt a little like a stalker when he abruptly stopped in his tracks, to hide behind a pillar that kept the roof above him and around the yard steady. They were facing away from him and the sounds of a still on-going conversation were seemingly a sign that they hadn't noticed his presence yet.</p>
<p>"I'm telling you, you don't have to worry Yoongi." Jungkook's ears perked up at the soft voice, speaking so calmly as if there was not a single problem in the world.</p>
<p>It was an endearing sound, compared to the rough voice that sounded next and made Jungkook subconsciously flinch in a bad memory, "Don't give me that shit Jimin. You haven't answered any of my owls throughout the whole summer. I was worried. And if you were with those people again-"</p>
<p>"You always knew that I would be part of them one day Yoongi. We've had this discussion before. This could finally get me somewhere." Jimin interrupted and Jungkook felt impressed to say the least, that Jimin indeed managed to make Yoongi hold his breath in favour of letting him talk, "why can't you just leave it alone?"</p>
<p>A loud huff sounded through the yard and almost drowned in the rustling of the leaves around them, "You know things have changed within the game, Jimin. No one can be sure what their plan is. What if they hurt you? What if HE hurts you?"</p>
<p>"I doubt he would." a long pause followed, which gave Jungkook time to notice the slight insecurity in Jimin's previous words, "and even if he would... if it's the best for us, I'll accept the fate that is defined for me."</p>
<p>"Sometimes I really wonder what is going on inside your brain." Yoongi just answered and around the corner of the pillar, Jungkook could see a soft shake of black hair.</p>
<p>After a short moment of silence, a slight giggle interrupted the white noise around them. A light sound that could only be compared to a flower blooming at the first day of spring, "you really worry too much Hyung."</p>
<p>"Ah, now I'm your Hyung again?" suddenly Yoongi's voice seemed a little softer than usual and Jungkook could say that it somehow shocked him to hear the Slytherin talk like this.</p>
<p>Another giggle and Jungkook could feel his ribcage becoming strangely warm, "if you want me to, I can always drop the honorifics."</p>
<p>"That's not what I said, I'm just saying that you should stop-" THUMB.</p>
<p>Jungkook eyes went wide when the sound echoed through the yard and the two of them fell silent almost immediately. His gaze went down to find his heavy schoolbag, having dropped to the stone floor with an uneasy loud sound. There was a sound of leaves rustling and Jungkook could hear one of the boys jump down from the tree, spotting only a bunch of black hair down at the foot of the tree, slowly coming closer to his location.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>Holding his breath in panic, he looked around to search for any way to escape, but was left with no other choice but to leave his hideout. The footsteps of the Slytherin were slowly creeping closer and he felt his eyes water slightly in fear. If he found him here, there'd be no one to protect Jungkook this time and his first day at Hogwarts would way too soon, as well be his last. Just when he even thought about standing up and facing Yoongi, he suddenly was pulled further down to the ground.</p>
<p>A short gasp escaped his lips, but before a sound could slip, a huge hand had covered his mouth tightly, not even letting a bit of air leave. All of a sudden, Jungkook was staring into huge, dark brown eyes and the scent of mint drops was surrounding him. There was another hand on his shoulder and the boy that was crouching down next to him, was now carefully looking over the edge of the small stonewall, that separated the yard from the hallway.</p>
<p>A growl sounded through the yard, when Yoongi suddenly found an intruder, "Yah! Kim Taehyung!!"</p>
<p>And before Jungkook could think, he was being pulled up, the hood of his robe covering his head like a huge blanket. They ran, like the devil himself was chasing them and admittedly, Yoongi wasn't all too far away from that image. They crossed several hallways, until suddenly the other boy stopped in front of a small door, quickly opening it and pushing Jungkook inside, his own body following close after, before he smashed the door shut again. It all left Jungkook panting heavily and he had to support himself, by putting his hands on his knees.</p>
<p>"You're actually a really good runner." the other suddenly broke the silence, "Wouldn't have thought. You Ravenclaws don't really seem like the sporty type."</p>
<p>Jungkook lifted his gaze to have a glance at the newcomer for the very first time. His hair was a pretty hazel colour and through their strands, he could see those friendly eyes again, well endowed with long, dark lashes. The tie around his neck had a pretty, golden colour, matching a little with his hair and his robe seemed to be old and a bit too small on his body. He was panting too, his deep voice not at all matching his appearance but somehow still nice to hear.</p>
<p>"You're not so bad yourself." Jungkook answered as soon as his breathing had calmed again, "although I wonder why you were actually running in the first place."</p>
<p>A silent laugh escaped the other boy's lips, "I just saw you eavesdropping on Jimin and Yoongi and I knew you were in trouble as soon as I saw Yoongi's face."</p>
<p>For a split second, Jungkook debated whether he should actually deny that he had listened to their conversation but soon remembered his reputation for being the worst liar that the earth had ever seen, "You know them?" he asked.</p>
<p>The Hufflepuff's eyebrow arched a little and he gave an unbelieving smile, "I'm surprised you don't. At least not well enough."</p>
<p>"If you ask me, I know them well enough to say I don't want to have anything to do with them." Jungkook mumbled, fiddling with his bag so that it wouldn't fall of his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Don't be too harsh on Yoongi." The Hufflepuff said softly and gave a uniquely shaped boxy-smile, "although I guess you're right about Jimin. Staying away from HIM might not even be a bad idea."</p>
<p>Jungkook felt his eyebrows furrow, "I had the impression that it was quite the opposite."</p>
<p>The other only lifted his eyebrow, as if he couldn't believe what he was hearing, "you must be a first year huh? I've never seen you around here but you seemed somewhat familiar, that's why I thought you're already in second year." Jungkook shook his head no, "don't worry though, Yoongi won't find you here... and Jimin probably has bigger worries than to look for you now. We're safe here."</p>
<p>"Speaking of", Jungkook said and turned around to eye the room that they had entered, "where the hell are we?"</p>
<p>The hall was gigantic and given the distance between the wall and the next classroom, absolutely illogical to be placed in this location. It was just too big. The next wall was so far away that Jungkook couldn't even see it anymore and the ceiling was almost as high as the astronomy tower looked like from the outside. Thousands and thousands of random items were spread over the room, set on tables or in racks, some even just thrown onto piles that almost touched the ceiling. And the room was filled to the brim, although it seemed to be almost as big as Hogwarts itself.</p>
<p>"This is the room of requirements." The Hufflepuff answered and moved to sit down on a dusty, red chair, "one of my best friends in Hogwarts, since a long time now."</p>
<p>"Best friend?" Jungkook asked, sceptically raising a brow.</p>
<p>"Yep", the other nodded, with enough seriousness to make Jungkook arch his brow even higher, "you see, he only shows up if you really need it and it will always take the shape that you require. Now for example, there's enough space to hide, even if someone else manages to enter the room." Jungkook nodded slowly, gaze wandering over the insides of the huge room, "I often used to come here, when the teachers or some bullies were chasing me. I'd just sit in here for a few hours, finding a good book in one of those gigantic piles or just exploring a bit, until everything outside has cooled off."</p>
<p>"You used to run from teachers?" the younger asked in disbelief.</p>
<p>"Sometimes yeah... you know some of them aren't too fond of magical fireworks in the middle of the great hall, even though the students absolutely dig it." A small giggle escaped Jungkook and he saw how the stranger joined in shortly after, "by the way; the name's Taehyung."</p>
<p>"Jungkook." he answered and stretched his hand towards the other, "nice to meet you."</p>
<p>Taehyung just nodded and shook it fondly, before leaning back into the chair again, "so. Why were you stalking Jimin and Yoongi, hm?"</p>
<p>"I was not stalking." he saw the sceptical look on the Hufflepuff's face and decided that this conversation wasn't going anywhere, "I was just curious... Yoongi seems to hate me. He confronted me at the dinner table yesterday, after the sorting ceremony about molesting Jimin. Honestly... are they boyfriends or something?"</p>
<p>Taehyung chuckled loudly at that question, "god no, Jimin would never get together with Yoongi. He's more into younger guys and besides; Yoongi is like a brother to him so I suppose that would be kind of awkward." then he fell silent for a second, "wait a minute... you're that Ravenclaw that sat on the wrong table, aren't you?"</p>
<p>Jungkook could feel his cheeks heat up a little. Great, he already had an uncalled sort of fame, "I suppose."</p>
<p>"That was really funny to watch!" Taehyung laughed and pointed at Jungkook.</p>
<p>"I'm glad I was entertaining to you." the younger sighed and rolled his eyes a little in distress, "But anyways; why are you even out of class?"</p>
<p>"I could ask you the same question", Taehyung just responded and shrugged in his seat.</p>
<p>Thoughtfully looking down at the Hufflepuff, Jungkook bit his lip before answering a little sheepish; "Couldn't find my classroom."</p>
<p>"Ah... the first year problem. I know your struggle believe me." then he huffed, "as for me... I was actually planning on placing a small welcome firework in the yard for the first years but yeah... your situation kind of interrupted me."</p>
<p>"Sorry about that." Jungkook grinned a little shyly and rubbed the back of his head.</p>
<p>"Hey it happens", with a quick wave of Taehyung's hand, the topic was off the table, "we should get to class now though, otherwise you'll get a punishment on your first day already and we don't want that huh?"</p>
<p>With a quick nod, Jungkook followed Taehyung out of the room again, watching as the door they had stepped through a second ago slowly disappeared within the stonewalls of the castle. Together they walked down the hallway, by now a few more students were populating the corridors and they were soon drowned in wild chattering and the noise of several footsteps on the ground beneath them. While they were walking, Jungkook noticed how a lot of people were staring weirdly at them. Well actually not both of them, but rather Taehyung.</p>
<p>"Why are they all looking at us so strangely?" Jungkook mumbled a little confused.</p>
<p>Taehyung seemed to find the question rather amusing, "they think I'm crazy."</p>
<p>"You aren't?" the Ravenclaw asked jokingly.</p>
<p>"Not crazy enough to smuggle drugs into the school and sell my ass for homework." Taehyung stated and Jungkook had to stop in his tracks for a second, before he could continue following the elder further down the corridor, "those are just rumours though, about me being a drug addict or a sex addict or whatever else you hear around here."</p>
<p>Jungkook shook his head, "that sounds awful, who'd spread rumours like that?"</p>
<p>"Yeah... I had a hard time after they came out to everyone and they actually believed it. That was the worst time of my life." He looked over at Jungkook with a fond smile, "but honestly, I'm just a normal boy, like you."</p>
<p>Something inside Jungkook moved a little and he smiled fondly, "yeah, that's not hard to believe at all."</p>
<p>--*--</p>
<p>The first few days of the school year passed comfortably and the Friday of the second week was slowly rolling closer. As soon as Taehyung had explained to Jungkook that the younger had in fact held the map incorrect, it was immediately easier for Jungkook to find his path around the huge school. And even though he hadn't necessarily made a very good first impression on Professor Sprout for coming an hour late, he managed to take back her first assumption of Jungkook being a good for nothing, when he managed to fulfil a task, including a huge, moving plant with poisonous thorns as the only one of the whole class.</p>
<p>All in all, it was easier to get used to the busy school life than Jungkook would have thought in the beginning. He was also starting to make some friends; while Yugyeom acquainted him with a bunch of his own friends, including a boy named Jackson from Gryffindor and another boy named Youngjae from the Hufflepuff-house, Taehyung soon convinced Jungkook to meet up with his own friends Hoseok from Taehyung's own house and Bam bam, who surprisingly was part of the Gryffindor house. After only 12 days, Jungkook had already made more friends than he had in his whole life before Hogwarts and it was nothing but pleasant to say the least.</p>
<p>They all had told him everything that was necessary to know about Hogwarts and it's students, just as well as teachers. But most of all (and admittedly that kind of took him by surprise) they had warned him about Jimin. Especially Jackson, who apparently had a boyfriend in the Slytherin house and claimed to hold some inside information about the mysterious students of the snake's house. It seemed like Jimin was more disputed rather than completely odious. A lot of students claimed him to be the biggest sweetheart of the whole school, while others were firmly convinced that there was something dark lurking beneath that pretty, pink head.</p>
<p>It was surprising that no one ever mentioned Yoongi, although to him it seemed as if the raven was a way bigger threat. All in all, no one really knew Jimin personally. There were tons and tons of rumours but not even the Slytherins were aware of the complete truth, everything they could give were vague assumptions and shaky accusations. Nonetheless, Jungkook wasn't planning on becoming best friends with the two Slytherins, even though he had to admit there was still a thin layer of curiosity about Jimin, inside his mind.</p>
<p>However all through those days he didn't cross paths with neither Yoongi nor Jimin anymore in the first place and the two were almost a forgotten memory, by the end of the last class on Friday. At least until Yugyeom decided that Jungkook should definitely give himself a break and enjoy the nice weather outside. Yugyeom was probably right though, because Jungkook had been busy 24/7 the first two weeks, occupied with handling his social life and studies at the same time. It was new to him, since he was more used to only having to deal with the latter.</p>
<p>So, as soon as the last class was dismissed, he made his way outside towards the huge river that crossed Hogwarts. The sunlight of the noontime was glistening in the flowing water and Jungkook found the peaceful silence to be something that he didn't know he needed a lot. Settling down on a rock, at the edge of the river, he sighed heavily, rummaging through his bag to dig out a book.</p>
<p>While he was occupied with pushing different books and other items aside to find his desired volume, he didn't notice the movement, going on behind him. Not until suddenly there was a foot nudging him in his back. Shocked out of his mind, Jungkook gasped and turned around, just to find a pair of familiar eyes staring down at him. At first glance, Jungkook only saw the poisonous green tie around the person's neck and his first instinct was to run away from Yoongi. Until he realized that it wasn't Yoongi in the first place.</p>
<p>Staring down from above him was Jimin, pink hair perfectly in shape and his clothes tugged neatly into place like usual. There was something that seemed like amusement in the Slytherin's eyes as he reflected the younger's shocked gaze in a mocking manner. For a long time none of them said anything, Jungkook only trying to get on his feet within the small space that was left between Jimin and the river.</p>
<p>The silence was kind of uncomfortable, but Jimin was quick to fill it, "are you following me around?"</p>
<p>Jungkook could picture the bare confusion on his face, "Follow you?"</p>
<p>"Here I am, just enjoying my free time", Jimin carried on, pointing at a place to their right with a jerk of his chin. When Jungkook looked over, he could see Jimin's bag and robe thrown onto another stone nearby, "and then suddenly you appear out of nowhere."</p>
<p>"Isn't it a bit narcissistic to think someone was following you around?" Jungkook blurted out without thinking. Good start Jeon, good start.</p>
<p>Idiot.</p>
<p>"Oh, but is it a bad thing to be a bit narcissistic, when that someone stares at me, whenever he gets the chance?" the Slytherin laughed loudly at Jungkook's face taking a paler colour with every spoken word, "What's your name? I'd like to know what I should call my stalker."</p>
<p>After a short time of staring into Jimin's mocking eyes, Jungkook crossed his arms, "It's Jungkook."</p>
<p>"I'm Jimin, although I assume you already knew that." Jimin grinned and Jungkook felt a warm shiver, crawling up his spine like a spider, "say Jungkook, don't you know that it's dangerous to walk around outside of Hogwarts all on your own?"</p>
<p>Balling his hands into fists a little, Jungkook tried to swallow the lump in his throat for a second before he answered: "And what about you? Got Yoongi hiding in the bushes just in case I look at you for too long again?"</p>
<p>Jimin didn't seem fazed by the comment at all, "so you admit that you were looking at me." All that the younger could do was to mentally face palm, "you know, compared to you, I'm not the one that fears the danger outside the castle. I am the danger that is feared."</p>
<p>"...That's probably the dumbest thing, I've ever heard." the Ravenclaw stated bluntly, not even trying to control his words again.</p>
<p>"Oh, so you don't believe me?" Jimin asked, arching a brow mockingly and crossing his arms over his chest as well.</p>
<p>"Let's just say" Jungkook shrugged, "I'm more afraid of Yoongi than I am of you."</p>
<p>"And I thought all you Ravenclaws were smart." Jimin mumbled under his breath, shaking his head softly.</p>
<p>Jungkook frowned slightly, trying to straighten his back a little, so he'd tower over Jimin. That boy was even smaller than Yoongi, "and I thought all you Slytherins were actually intimidating."</p>
<p>"So you don't find me intimidating?" Jimin asked amused, honey covering his voice, "How about now?"</p>
<p>There wasn't even a second for Jungkook to react, before he felt a strong push against his chest and his balance slipping away. In the next moment, ice-cold wetness surrounded him everywhere, soaking his clothes and making them stick to his skin. The river wasn't deep, so close to the dry ground and as soon as Jungkook got up, only his knees and feet were in the water, the rest that still remained on his body was dripping down and made soft noises as it hit the water surface. He was to say the least furious.</p>
<p>Jimin on the other hand was just laughing his ass off, still standing on the same stone that Jungkook himself had populated a few moments ago. The pink haired boy was literally hunching down and holding his stomach because of his uncontrolled laughter, thumbs rubbing at his eyes to get rid of tears that leaked out. It all suddenly caught Jungkook off-guard, seeing Jimin so lively and not at all nonchalant, not calm, not even slightly conservative. The smaragd tie and the emblem with the silver snake suddenly seemed ridiculously out of place.</p>
<p>"Damn you look like shit!" Jimin continued to laugh and pointed his finger at Jungkook.</p>
<p>The young Ravenclaw narrowed his eyes, pulling his wand from his pocket and pointing it at Jimin's tie, mumbling a silent 'Accio'. Jimin's eyes went wide when suddenly, there was a strong pull at his tie and he stumbled over the edge of the stone, a loud splash sound the next thing to be heard. Now it was Jungkook's time to laugh, seeing Jimin's soaked frame slowly trying to stand on his feet again with a not amused expression.</p>
<p>"I'll make you pay for that." Jimin mumbled, running a hand through his hair.</p>
<p>The motion made his pink strands stick to his head and his usually covered forehead suddenly appeared in the sunlight. It was shocking because all of a sudden, Jimin seemed indeed a lot manlier than before and Jungkook had to bite down on his lip for a second and process the view in front of him. Jimin might have been attractive before already but this was... wow.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" he carried on and looked over at Jimin, trying not to look too affected by Jimin's current appearance, "what are you gonna do? Send your boyfriend to send me flying out the window of the astronomy tower?"</p>
<p>"He's not my boyfriend." Jimin shook his head, as if Jungkook had just said something so obviously stupid that the Ravenclaw himself should have picked up on it by now, "and I don't need someone else to my duels out for me."</p>
<p>With that and a quick mumble of 'stupefy' there was a harsh push at Jungkook's foot and he fell back down into the cold water, groaning at the sudden fall. With fury burning in his eyes, he looked up at Jimin and suddenly got up, reaching for the other's tie again. Fuck this; he wouldn't need any magic to settle this with Jimin. The elder seemed shocked for a second, when he was pulled down and pushed into the water, but quickly reacted and grabbed a tight hold of Jungkook's hair. He noticed though, that it wasn't tight enough to hurt.</p>
<p>They rolled around in the shallow water, trying to push each other's head beneath the surface of the river and attempting to get the other as soaked as possible. Carrying on like this for another few minutes until they were out of breath, the two of them laughed silently next to each other, slowly standing up. Jungkook didn't realize that suddenly Jimin's hand was running through his hair, pushing it out of his face and he startled at the motion.</p>
<p>But the Slytherin had already pulled his hand back again, "you should expose your forehead more often, it looks good on you." he mumbled and looked at Jungkook with a smile that even seemed to hold something like fondness.</p>
<p>Without thinking too hard about it, Jungkook smiled back shyly, "yeah, you too."</p>
<p>They looked at each other like this for a few seconds, before Jimin turned to the edge of the river again and dragged himself out of the water, "come on let's get out of the river before I drown and you have to give me mouth-to-mouth resuscitation."</p>
<p>Jungkook blushed wildly at the thought but followed Jimin's example anyways, since it didn't seem inviting at all, to spend another minute in the cold waves of the river. He also barely managed to not stare at the lines of Jimin's abs that were suddenly way too visible, thanks to the wet fabric of the Slytherin's clothes now sticking to his body. Thankfully the sun had heated up the stones on the edge of the river and when they both laid down to dry, the cold dripped out of them like the water was running down the stone and back into the river, where it came from.</p>
<p>"You're actually not that bad, you know?" Jimin said, after a short while of surprisingly comfortable silence.</p>
<p>The Ravenclaw huffed a little indignant, "well thanks. I can't say the same about you."</p>
<p>Once more, Jimin didn't seem to mind the comment at all, although Jungkook had to admit that he probably didn't sound very convincing in the first place, "I mean it though... I honestly thought you were just some kind of creep, that was overflowing with hormones."</p>
<p>"Yeah I hear that often." they both laughed loudly, next to each other, Jimin patting Jungkook's shoulder in the motion. Right where Jimin had touched him, he could feel a slight warmth in the shape of a tiny hand.</p>
<p>"I guess I should apologize for Yoongi too... he's been a bit... how do I say it?"</p>
<p>"A bit of an asshole?" Jungkook suggested and Jimin gave another blinding smile.</p>
<p>"I suppose." He admitted but then turned his head, to look over at Jungkook, their shoulders touching, when he moved a little, "But don't be too hard on him. He's just a little overprotective."</p>
<p>Another huff escaped the younger's lips, "well you seem to be capable of protecting yourself just fine."</p>
<p>"Against a first year, yes" Jimin snorted, but this time it didn't sound as amused as the times before, "there are a lot of dark things out there Jungkookie, don't be mad at me if I say you're my smallest problem in the world."</p>
<p>How could he be mad at that? Jungkook thought and smiled sheepishly at the nickname. They fell into a soft silence again, Jungkook glancing over at Jimin, whose gaze was locked to the blue sky above them, lips parted slightly and breathing deep and slow. His hair seemed almost dry, falling back into his face to cover his forehead again and without thinking twice, Jungkook reached out curiously to see what it felt like. He was surprised to find it feeling just the same way it looked; soft and fluffy, especially now that it had been dried by the sun. Jimin's curious eyes were now directed at him, when he ran his fingers through the soft pink but the Slytherin didn't even make an attempt to stop Jungkook in his motion.</p>
<p>After a while, Jungkook removed his fingers again, leaving Jimin with a shy pink tone on his cheeks, "what makes you think you'll be confronted with those things?"</p>
<p>Jimin's next expression was to say the least shocking. He had a smile on his lips, yes that was nothing new. But the short glimpse of darkness and grief in his eyes was something that threw Jungkook completely off-guard. It took Jimin long to respond and in that time, Jungkook could see the elder tugging at his sleeves, as if to hide himself at all cost. A terrifying image of red lines grazed Jungkook's brain but he pushed it aside, when Jimin finally opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"I suppose you don't have anyone that dictates how your life is going to lapse, am I right?" he looked over at Jungkook again and the younger had to avoid his gaze, not able to deal with the expression in the soft eyes of the Slytherin and instead intently studied his own hands.</p>
<p>He thought carefully before he answered, "No... I think no one should. Because after all, we're our own monarchs."</p>
<p>That sentence seemed to strike something inside Jimin because suddenly, the small, honest smile from before was back in his eyes, "Yeah I think so too."</p>
<p>Giving himself a small jolt, Jungkook faced Jimin again, "Do you really have someone like that?"</p>
<p>Silence settled again, something unspoken waving in the air, as Jimin studied Jungkook's face, hushing over his eyes, lips, nose, cheeks and brows as if he was looking for something. Something evil that Jungkook hid. As if he doubted that Jungkook really was the person he claimed to be.</p>
<p>It seemed like Jimin couldn't find what he was looking for though, because he finally carried on; "I might just have lost control about telling apart what I want and what others want... Sometimes I wish-"</p>
<p>A loud sound next to their heads interrupted Jimin's voice and they looked up towards the trees that were growing close to the river. Through the silence a soft sound waved over to them, something very similar to a 'meow'. Suddenly a completely black cat, with shining emerald eyes parted the green of a few brakes and stepped onto a rotten trunk. Jungkook only heard a silent 'shit' from Jimin, before the elder had already gotten up from where they had been laying.</p>
<p>He sheepishly bit down on his bottom lip, "that's Yoongi's cat."</p>
<p>A sudden wave of annoyance drifted through Jungkook's body, "and you're still sure I am the stalker here?"</p>
<p>He smiled lightly when Jimin just giggled in response and reached a hand out, to help the Ravenclaw get to his feet, then he directed his attention back to the cat; "tell him; at the forbidden forest in ten minutes, I'll be right there." The cat blinked once, twice and then turned around, disappearing in the green again.</p>
<p>"The forbidden forest?" Jungkook arched a brow, "are you nuts or something?"</p>
<p>"At daylight it's not that bad really, the trick is just to be out of it at sunset again." Jimin explained, walking over to his own stone to collect his stuff.</p>
<p>A little irritated by Jimin's honest nonchalance, all that Jungkook could manage was a small: "just take care, okay?"</p>
<p>"Aw Jungkookie, are you worried about me?" Jimin asked mockingly and smirked at him, coking his head in the motion.</p>
<p>Rolling his eyes in annoyance, Jungkook shoved the Slytherin's shoulder softly, "you should be thankful I am."</p>
<p>A small smile spread over Jimin's lips and Jungkook pleasantly found it to be honest, "I am, believe me." When Jimin had collected his things and moved to leave, he stopped for a second and turned back around, to look at Jungkook, "Would you mind meeting up on Sunday or something? You know we could just sit down in the library and maybe do some homework and talk a little... get to know each other a bit better."</p>
<p>Jungkook felt his body flutter a little at the offer and then he presented a wide smile, teeth standing out and making him look like a bunny, "I'd like that."</p>
<p>Seemingly pleased with the answer, Jimin nodded his pink head and stuffed his hands into his pockets; "I'll see you at three?"</p>
<p>As soon as Jungkook had given a slight nod, Jimin smiled a last time and turned away a little slower than necessary, "Goodbye Jungkookie."</p>
<p>The Ravenclaw's eyes followed him, until Jimin disappeared between the trees next to them and he was once more left in a blissful loneliness that finally gave him the chance to process what had just happened in front of his eyes. Maybe Jimin wasn't such a bad person after all and the others just had a completely wrong impression of the young Slytherin. And maybe they'd become good friends, he figured, finding himself anticipating the meeting.</p>
<p>--*--</p>
<p>"Ah not again!!" Taehyung sighed loudly, when Hoseok put down his final card and rose to fulfil a dance of victory. Jungkook was just sitting in the chair next to them, laughing loudly at Hoseok's movements, "I can't believe you're always winning!"</p>
<p>"Well, you're probably just not smart enough to play this game.", the older Hufflepuff answered mockingly but ruffled the others hair to show his affection nonetheless.</p>
<p>Taehyung only huffed but it was easy to see that he wasn't necessarily hurt or anything, "Next time I'll win for real."</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah", Hoseok nodded, still chuckling, then his eyes went over to the huge clock at the wall of the Hufflepuff common room, "well you'll have to prove me different another time Taehyungie, Professor Slughorn is calling. I can hear his snoring over the whole castle already."</p>
<p>Jungkook and Taehyung laughed loudly, as they watched Hoseok gather his things and rise from his spot at the fireplace. The bright boy with the wildly coloured hair had spent the whole evening with them in the Hufflepuff common room, playing cards and debating whether the chocolate frog card of Dumbledore was worth two of McGonagall's or three. When he came back from the river meeting with Jimin, Taehyung had collected a very lost Jungkook in the midst of the courtyard and invited him to visit the Hufflepuffs for once. The Ravenclaw of course, had agreed right away and on their way they had met Hoseok and Youngjae as well, but the latter had already left for an evening class an hour ago.</p>
<p>"I'll miss you Hyung, please hurry back soon." Taehyung said sweetly and Jungkook couldn't hold back a knowing smirk at how the Hufflepuff was acting towards Hoseok.</p>
<p>"Of course Baby", he could see Taehyung's ears redden a little at the nickname, "I'll be back before you can count to three."</p>
<p>With that he was gone, Taehyung's gaze still fixed on the door, that the elder had left through. Jungkook watched Taehyung carefully now; the elder avoided his gaze as well as possible, as if nothing ever happened. The Hufflepuff merely stared into the fire with a fond smile and an unreadable expression in his eyes, reflecting the dancing flames of the fireplace.</p>
<p>"So what's going on between the two of you, huh?" Jungkook finally broke the silence.</p>
<p>Startling at the sudden voice, as if Jungkook had just woken him from a deep trance, he looked over at the Ravenclaw, "I don't know what you're talking about."</p>
<p>"Oh don't you even try to fool me Kim Taehyung!" Jungkook said, pointing an accusing finger at the elder, "You like him don't you?"</p>
<p>Taehyung could only look around with a distressed expression, "Say it a bit louder please, I think the two girls in the back didn't hear you yet."</p>
<p>"Sorry, Sorry!" the younger only giggled and leaned a bit closer to Taehyung, so that he could understand his silent whisper; "So is that a yes?"</p>
<p>Short silence. And then; "...I'll kill you, if you tell someone." the Hufflepuff finally mumbled sheepishly, the blush on his ears now spread all over his cheeks.</p>
<p>Jungkook made a loud noise, that sounded like a puppy yelping excitedly, "oh my god that's the cutest thing ever. Since when? Did you guys kiss already?"</p>
<p>"Can't you stop?" Taehyung huffed in annoyance but there was still a warm smile on his lips, "I'm not sure when it started but I think I have feelings for him, since a pretty long time now. He's done a lot for me." when he noticed the dissatisfaction in Jungkook's gaze, he sighed again, "and no, we haven't kissed yet."</p>
<p>"I can imagine you too together really well." Jungkook admitted and leaned back in his chair again, playing with a loose strand on the armrest, "will you tell him?"</p>
<p>Scratching the back of his neck, Taehyung reflected Jungkook's motion, the chair beneath him giving a silent 'thump'-sound, "I planned on doing so a while ago but... I'm just not sure about it. I mean, what if I destroy our friendship?"</p>
<p>"Taehyung", Jungkook breathed deeply, as if he had to explain to a little kid that the earth was actually a sphere, "he just called you baby. You two are so way past the 'friend'-boundaries."</p>
<p>"Isn't that a normal thing to do between best friends?" As soon as Taehyung saw the look on Jungkook's face, he knew what an absolutely dumb question that actually was, "okay, maybe we're treating each other a little different, but-"</p>
<p>"No buts anymore Taehyung", Jungkook said and raised his hand, "I refuse to accept anything like that. It's so obvious that you like each other. You're just both too shy to make the first step."</p>
<p>Taehyung only giggled and shook his head, "alright, I heard you. I'll confess soon, alright?"</p>
<p>"Pinkie promise."</p>
<p>"Jungkook that's such a kindergarten-thing are you really-"</p>
<p>"Pinkie. Promise." the younger repeated again, his pinkie stretched out towards Taehyung.</p>
<p>After a short amount of disbelieving silence, Taehyung reached out and intertwined their pinkies, squeezing a bit harder than necessary and making Jungkook hiss silently in pain. A silent 'asshole' rolled over his lips and Taehyung could only laugh in response. After that they fell silent for a while, Jungkook listing all the homework he'd still have to get done through the evening, whereas Taehyung was just staring into the flames of the fireplace again.</p>
<p>"What about you?" Taehyung suddenly broke the silence again.</p>
<p>Jungkook looked up and smiled slightly, "what about me?"</p>
<p>The Hufflepuff turned a little in his chair, so that his legs were hanging over one armrest, and his back was placed on the other, "do you have a special interest in someone? I see you hanging around Yugyeom a lot lately."</p>
<p>At the image of him and Yugyeom that showed up in his head, Jungkook could only snort loudly, "yeah right. We're the perfect couple in a world that values awkwardness. Yugyeom only has eyes for that Gryffindor boy anyways."</p>
<p>"What Gryffindor boy?" Taehyung asked with his brows furrowed in confusion.</p>
<p>"Ah", the Ravenclaw shrugged lightly, "you know, that kid with the weird name and the weird hair and the weird everything. The small one."</p>
<p>A silent giggle echoed through the Hufflepuff common room, when Taehyung suddenly understood; "you're talking about Bam Bam?"</p>
<p>"Exactly!"</p>
<p>"You do realize, that's not his real name, right?" Taehyung asked jokingly.</p>
<p>"What?" Jungkook responded with mocking sarcasm "you're being serious right now?"</p>
<p>Taehyung only shook with laughter and left out a response, instead turning back to their old topic; "no but for real; do you have a crush or something?"</p>
<p>"What do you expect, it's not even been a month, since I actually came to Hogwarts." Jungkook responded, even though there was a warm memory of small hands and soft lips whispering a suggestion into his ear.</p>
<p>He ignored it though and watched Taehyung slump back into his chair, "you're so boring."</p>
<p>"That's okay." Jungkook said and giggled silently, before throwing a quick glance at the clock, "I should go too. There's still a lot of work to be done for me AND for you, if I might remind you."</p>
<p>The annoyance at the thought of homework was radiating from Taehyung but he responded warmly nonetheless; "yeah you're right... I'll go to my room and study and probably fall asleep on my notes again."</p>
<p>"Don't you dare Kim Taehyung. You'll study down here, where it's too uncomfortable to fall asleep." Jungkook said, as he got up and picked up his bag.</p>
<p>"Hah!" Taehyung gave him a knowing look, "you think that can stop me?"</p>
<p>"Worth a try." the other just said and hugged Taehyung at his spot on the chair as a good bye for the day, "I'll see you around tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Good night."</p>
<p>With that, Jungkook left the Hufflepuff common room and stepped out into the cool hallway. Even though it was still pretty warm from the summer, the nights started to significantly become colder and Jungkook had to pull his robe up to his neck a bit, so his teeth would stop chattering. By now he didn't need a map to reach his destination anymore and he moved with quick and confident steps towards the Ravenclaw common room.</p>
<p>On his way, he had to cross the yard though and the thought about the cold being able to bite into his skin without the thick walls around him wasn't very pleasant to say the least. Nonetheless he decided to take the way through it, since a different way would just cost him double the time. So he opened the doors that lead outside and stepped into the open. The sky was already a deep shade of black and only the moon made it possible to cross the small space without tripping over his own feet.</p>
<p>He was shocked however to find that he wasn't alone; there was another silhouette just standing in the middle of the yard, staring up into the star-filled sky. They were holding something soft in their arms that looked like a cat and the hood of their robe was pulled over one half of their head. Jungkook's heart skipped a beat when he recognized the deep, black hair and the pale skin, beneath the fabric of the boy's hood. Suddenly Yoongi turned towards him, an unreadable expression on his face and Jungkook was immediately ready to make a run for it and look for the room of requirements to hide in.</p>
<p>But the Slytherin didn't even move a finger, just petting the cat in his arms with a calm expression, which Jungkook recognized to be the one that had interrupted him and Jimin a few hours ago. What shocked Jungkook the most though, was when Yoongi suddenly spoke up, not even a trace of anger left in his voice and said a simple 'good night', before turning around and heading in the direction of the Slytherin dorms.</p>
<p>It all seemed so strangely surreal, that when Jungkook woke up the next day, he wasn't sure if this had really happened or if he had just been dreaming.</p>
