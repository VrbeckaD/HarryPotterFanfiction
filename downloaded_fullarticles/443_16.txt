  <strong>----1<sup>st</sup> of August 1997----</strong>
</p><p align="justify">These days, I could get a rise out of the Rectoress of Aretuza, my mentor, just by looking at her.</p><p align="justify">It was ridiculous, I just glance at her and she’d make some comment saying I was unfocused, a troublemaker and being disruptive. I would smirk and look at her harder. Usually, it was that just one remark and then she’d ignore me for the rest of the lesson however this time, she held my green eyes with her own blue ones and then said rather seductively, ‘My office, now.’ She drew out the last word and it made me shiver. Her left eyebrow shot straight up as if she knew exactly what she was doing to me which she probably did. Everything was on purpose with her.</p><p align="justify">I stood up, my chair scraping backwards with a horrible shriek but nobody flinched and I disapparated out of the classroom. Just before I left, I saw a look of disapproval from the Rectoress – she hated when I used magic I learnt from Hogwarts rather than what she taught us.</p><p align="justify">I apparated into my mentor’s office, only to find her already sat in her desk chair. I guessed sometimes portals were actually faster.</p><p align="justify">‘Do you get off disrupting my class?’ I smirked; no I got off on getting her flustered. The Rectoress’s cheeks redden, Ahh shit. ‘You do know; even though you are the true heir of Merlin, I can read your mind the easiest out of any and all my pupils.’ My own cheeks were burning now having being admonished by the Rectoress. She sighed. ‘Oh come on, get over here.’</p><p align="justify">I all but run over to my lover. ‘Tissaia…’ I moaned as I settled on to her lap, placing my face into her shoulder as her breath hitched slightly.</p><p align="justify">We sat there for a while, just enjoying the others company. Then I felt the tell-tale signs of a soft fluttering in my core, I needed Tissaia. ‘<em>Mistress, I need you</em>.’ I say through our bond, using our word when I wanted Tissaia to dominate me.</p><p align="justify">Immediately Tissaia picks me up and roughly throws me on her desk. I hiss at the pain when my back collides when the rough wooden surface but Tissaia doesn’t care when she’s is Mistress Mode. Tissaia moves out of my line of sight but I can guess where she is going, the cupboard of noughties.</p><p align="justify">‘Hmm how naughty have you been? You woke me up this morning with your fingers inside me; you wouldn’t let me use the bathroom…’ I smiled at that think back to how funny it was seeing the once uptight woman hop around bursting for the toilet. ‘… then we were late for class courtesy of you, then you disrupted the class now because you’re incredibly horny.’ Damn the woman could read me like an open book. ‘<em>Oh I can pup</em>.’ I moaned at the nickname. I knew I would pay for all that I had done today and the anticipation was to die for. Tissaia made a contented noise through the bond and it seemed like she had made her choice.</p><p align="justify">Immediately, I turn over and slide my feet to the floor before pushing down my pants, baring my ass to Tissaia. The cold draught in the room blew across the newly exposed skin making me shiver but it wasn’t from the cold.</p><p align="justify">Soft hands began to massage my ass before delivering a hard slap to each cheek. I gasped in pain which soon broke way to pleasure. ‘Pup, are you ready?’ I nodded my head but Tissaia hummed in disapproval. ‘Use your words Pup.’</p><p align="justify">‘I’m ready Mistress, hit me please. I’ve been a bad person and I need to be punished.’ Then out of nowhere, a long wooden rod came down hard against my white bottom. Tissaia made an appreciative sound in the back of her throat at the thin red line blooming on pale cheeks. Another lash came. There was just a hint of pain but mostly pleasure. ‘Count out ten Pup.’ I moaned at her voice, I loved to count her lashes.</p><p align="justify">‘Two.’ My voice was steady as I had a lot of practice with this but I knew by at least eight, it wouldn’t be so. Another lash caused me to gasp as I hadn’t expected it straight after my answer. ‘Three.’</p><p align="justify">This continued until we got to ten and then Tissaia demanded that I count another ten. The second I shouted twenty, Tissaia shot me an image of my bright red bottom through the bond and I moaned in ecstasy so much that I couldn’t stop my next words.</p><p align="justify">‘Please Tissaia, fuck me.’ I felt another lash and I screamed. I deserved that. ‘Please MISTRESS, fuck me.’ I shouted the word, Mistress and then Tissaia massaged my sore bottom before flipping me over. She trailed her fingers from my lips, down past the v of my breasts and further south; my arousal grew with each inch she got closer.</p><p align="justify">
  <strong>----<em>Many, many hours later</em>----</strong>
</p><p align="justify">I rolled off Tissaia’s body and landed with my head on feather-downed pillow, my breathing heavy and fast. Somewhere between my third or fourth orgasm and Tissaia’s second or third, my lover had portalled us to our bed leaving behind the dominant Rectoress and submissive Pup in the office. In our bed it was just Taylor and Tissaia.</p><p align="justify">Once my breathing had slowed, I quickly put up walls around my mind like Severus Snape had taught me and quietly sorted through my thoughts. Basically I had to ask Tissaia now before I went home in September. Now was the 1<sup>st</sup> of August so I didn’t have long and I think I would back out if I left it to the last second.</p><p align="justify">I got out of the bed – I seemed to always recover quicker than Tissaia – I walked over the table where a pitcher of whisky sat. I picked up the pitcher and downed the remaining liquid. A bit of Dutch courage never hurt anyone.</p><p align="justify">I felt over the table to find the small notch which I pressed and a drawer popped open. As my back was to Tissaia, she couldn’t see what I was doing so my little nook was still safe. From the drawer I pulled out the small velvet box. I took a deep breath and turned to my lover who had sat up; she was probably confused as to why I had my walls up if that glaring look was anything to go by.</p><p align="justify">‘I know we have only known each other for seven summers but I feel like I have known you forever and in that time I fallen harder and harder for you Tissaia. Now a Prince needs a Princess and one day a Queen.’ By this time I had moved over to the bed observing Tissaia’s shocked look. ‘I love you Tissaia and I want to be your Prince and one day your King. So I am asking if you will marry me?’ I bent down onto one knee and opened the velvet box to reveal a blue sapphire ring, the same colour as Tissaia’s cerulean eyes. The said Rectoress look as if she was about to cry and she nodded fervently.</p><p align="justify">‘Yes Taylor, I want all that, I love you and I want to marry you.’ I grinned and jumped onto the bed straight into Tissaia’s arms, kissing her passionately whilst putting the ring onto her finger. She admired it with appreciation.</p><p align="justify">‘I love it…’ She looked up into my green eyes. ‘… I love you.’ She kissed me again and I had a feeling I wouldn’t be sleeping that night.</p><p align="justify">
  <strong>----<em>The Next Day</em>----</strong>
</p><p align="justify">The next day was a Saturday so no lessons however Tissaia had gotten up early as usual to work on some papers leaving me to lounge in bed.</p><p align="justify">I was staring at the white satin sheets and it reminded me that I hadn’t actually asked permission to marry Tissaia as was the tradition for the children and grandchildren of the Monarch. I decided that this needed a face to face visit rather than a mirror call.</p><p align="justify"><em>‘Tissaia</em>.’ I said through the mental bond. When there was no answer, I tried again. ‘<em>Tissaia</em>.’ There was finally a sigh through the bond.</p><p align="justify">‘<em>Taylor if you’re going to ask for a sexual favour then you can borrow my vibrator; I am rather too busy to indulge you.</em>’ I blushed hard. ‘<em>I feel you blushing, stop it</em>.’</p><p align="justify">‘<em>No, I…</em>’ My voice cracked, god I was turned on by that one sentence. I coughed and straighten my back. ‘<em>I’m paying a visit home</em>.’ I said the words tersely; I’d rather be in Tissaia’s arms that face my family and my duties.</p><p align="justify">‘<em>Oh</em>.’ The voice was laced with hurt. Oh gods, I mentally kicked myself. Tissaia thought I was running, of course she would having been hurt before.</p><p align="justify">‘<em>No not like that. Just for one day, I have to-umm</em>…’ I trailed off now slightly embarrassed.</p><p align="justify">‘<em>Go on</em>.’ Tissaia said. I felt like I had her whole attention now.</p><p align="justify">‘<em>I have to ask permission to marry you</em>.’ I said in one breath but as Tissaia could read my mind she didn’t need for me to repeat it however she did.</p><p align="justify">‘<em>You need permission?</em>’ I sighed.</p><p align="justify">‘<em>Yes it’s tradition so that my parents can verify who I have chosen to make sure they are a suitable match</em>.<em> It’s ridiculous really</em>.’</p><p align="justify">‘<em>Does sound just a bit. Okay will you be back tonight?</em>’ Tissaia asked.</p><p align="justify">‘<em>I should be but I shall mirror you if not.</em>’ I said, I had a feeling that might have to fight for Tissaia.</p><p align="justify">‘<em>Okay, remember I love you Taylor</em>.’</p><p align="justify">‘<em>I love you too Tissaia.</em>’</p><p align="justify">
  <strong>----The next morning----</strong>
</p><p align="justify">I apparated straight into Tissaia’s office. I hated the news I had to give her but I hoped it wouldn’t ruin our relationship or our love but knowing how prideful Tissaia can be, I wasn’t too sure.</p><p align="justify">The moment I set my eyes on my lover, I wanted to burst into tears but I managed not however when the Rectoress looked up at me with hope and delight shinning in her bright blue eyes, the tears slid silently down my cheeks. I sank to the floor and within minutes Tissaia had her strong arms around me, hugging me tightly.</p><p align="justify">‘<em>They refused</em>.’ I sobbed through the bond, unable to speak the words lest they seem more real. Tissaia didn’t say anything but just layered the bond in love and affection. I sniffed and got my tears under control.</p><p align="justify">I pulled back as Tissaia wiped away the tears still falling. She took my face in her hands and looked me in the eyes, it was rather intense.</p><p align="justify">‘I don’t care what your parents say, I love you now and always,’ and like that I was crying again at Tissaia’s declaration of love.</p><p align="justify">That night we slept curled around each other with tangled limbs unable to let go for fear of the other disappearing.</p><p align="justify">
  <strong>----29<sup>th</sup> of August 1997----</strong>
</p><p align="justify">I marched into Tissaia’s office; I had made up my mind. What I was about to tell Tissaia would hurt her even more than the marriage refusal from my parents but in the long run she would be able to live a full long life without being attached to someone she couldn’t marry.</p><p align="justify">Tissaia looked up completely shocked that anyone would barge into her office, her students were too frighten of her and there was only one person who would even try to and luckily for her it was said person. Her gaze softens as she felt Taylor’s magic surround the room, she felt both safe and powerful.</p><p align="justify">‘What is… ?’ I cut her off; I had to get this out.</p><p align="justify">‘No, let me speak. If I don’t say this now, I will never say it.’ Tissaia looked at me confused. ‘I’m sorry but I’m leaving. I can’t do this anymore; watch you be un-happy because we cannot get married so I am leaving now so that you can live your life in happiness and to its fullest with anyone else but me. I will always love you but this was just a fling for me and it’s time for me to go.’ I pushed through the last bit knowing it would hurt us both. I clicked my fingers and apparated from the office, closing my eyes, I letting my body take me away from Aretuza, The Continent and my one true love.</p><p align="justify">When I finally opened my eyes I was in another office, this one more ornate with a red and golden bird perched on its stand. The wizened old man behind the desk, stood and bowed.</p><p align="justify">‘Welcome back to Hogwarts, Your Royal Highness.’</p>
