    <p>    The attic was thick with a layer of dust. Otherwise, it was perfectly clean. However, Henrietta was completely done with it. "I'm just saying, anyone who let's any room in their house get this filthy, has issues", she complained, tossing an old teddy bear away. <br/>
    "It's an attic. There supposed to be dirty", said Jaqueline, rolling her eyes. <br/>
    "Mine isn't" <br/>
    "That's because it's your sister's bedroom" <br/>
    "Still, there isn't a mound of dust on everything" <br/>
     "I wouldn't say there's a mound, but there's definitely a layer", cut in James. He flipped through the stack of papers in front of him. They weren't looking for anything in particular, they just needed something to do until Mrs. Millers bridge party was over. "Alright, this one's heavy", called Nicole. She plopped down next to Jaqueline, and the other two scouched around them. Coughing, she opened the lid of the box. Inside lay 7 old thick books. "Ooo", commented James in awe. Henrietta picked up one and flipped through it. "Hey, it's the Half-blood Prince!", she noticed, "And, this one's Chanber of Secrets. There all Harry Potter books!" They all picked up one by one, flipping through to see for themselves. <br/>
    "Their handwritten, and I think it's word for word", commented Jaqueline <br/>
    "Well, there's only one way to find out", smirked Nicole. She picked up Philosopher's Stone. They pushed the box aside and circled around her. She flipped to the first page, and began reading, "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number 4, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very-", she was cut short by a wind that blew through the room. <br/>
    "Ok...", thought James out loud. The wind became stronger and wilder, so they jumped to their feet and clung together. <br/>
   "What's happening?", asked Jaqueline  <br/>
   "Don't know, dont care. Run!", shouted Nicole. They raced to the door. But, the wind picked them off their feet. They flew around the room, flipping and turning around. The room became pitch black, and they could no longer see. Moments passed like this, before they each landed hard. Nicole sat upward groaning. Everything was blurry, so she knew her glasses had fallen off. Then, there was a shrill screech, "Up, girl, up. We need breakfast going"</p>
