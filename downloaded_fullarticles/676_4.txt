    <p>Draco sat alone in the compartment car on the Hogwarts Express. He was returning to school so he could complete classes he needed for N.E.W.T exams, required results for any ministry job. Most of the students in Slytherin house were not returning. Pansy Parkinson’s and Theodore Nott’s parents chose to home school their children. Blaize Zabini transferred to Durmstrang, something Draco’s father had threatened on several occasions. He was not sure where Millicent Bulstrode was. Had she died in the war? A lot of people had. And it was no surprise Crabbe and Goyle had not returned. After two years, they had still not managed to produce a single O.W.L. The year might be a little more lonely, but Draco found himself looking forward to return to Hogwarts, his home away from home.</p><p>His summer had not been a vacation. He, his father and his mother had stood trial for their part in the Dark Lord’s war. The Dark Lord had fallen for the final time while attempting to lay siege of Hogwarts, and the Death Eaters left behind were the ones who answered for the crimes. The Malfoys were the only supporters of the Dark Lord who had gone willingly. It had been terrifying to walk out in restraints, not knowing his fate. His own trial had been surprisingly easy though Draco still felt nauseous thinking about it. In the end his father had pleaded guilty in return for a lighter sentence for Draco and his mother, which equated to no time in Azkaban. Even without the dementors as guards, the Wizarding Prison was the worst place in the world, and Draco was glad to avoid it. His mother had promised to keep in touch with the progress on his father’s ongoing trial. The ministry would most likely accept his release in exchange for turning evidence over on their fellow Death Eaters.</p><p>The train rolled into Hogsmeade. Draco disembarked with the other students. Ahead he saw a familiar mop of black hair before the bespeckled man pulled himself into a carriage and disappeared. Potter. The boy who lived. The chosen one after all. The main witness in his case. It was excruciating to see him, but it would not keep him away from Hogwarts. It was a big school, and he knew of a few hidden corridors and secret passages he could use if he needed to avoid Potter. Even so, the pressure just beneath the surface threatened to boil over. Draco pulled himself into a carriage so hard, he nearly launched himself out the other side.</p><p>Classes began and his homework piled high. The workload did nothing to help Draco ignore jeers from students who were all too ready to remind Draco of his Death Eater status. At one point in time he might have deserved it, but he was no longer a Death Eater and wanted the whole thing behind him. It made him angry, furious even, to have people throw it in his face. He lashed out at younger students who were too slow and cursed Peeves whenever he got the chance. He had put a pretty good full-body bind on a Hufflepuff who was pointing at him and whispering behind her hand, and the bat bogey hex he put on a fifth year who asked if a smudge of ink on his chin was a new dark mark had landed the boy in the hospital wing for a week. </p><p>The teachers were no better. McGonagall made no bones about keeping an eye on him. As she had pointed out in his first week, as headmistress it was her job to keep watch over all of her students, and if she was more concerned about him, it was only because he had been so close to the Dark Lord. Draco was affronted, as if he might turn to the dark arts. His interests lay in archaic magic. The likes of Nicholas Flammel were the wizards Draco admired. As it were, he often caught Sprout peering at him out of the corner of her eye during Herbology, and Flitwick fell over during class more than usual in his presence. As for his head of house, Slughorn had not extended an invitation for one of his parties to him, despite being a top student. Draco suspected they were only held for war heroes. Then when his anger built and the pressure threatened to overwhelm him, Draco threw himself into his classes all the more.</p><p>It was nearing Halloween before Draco began to regain his confidence. He was in the library working on a particularly nasty assignment from the new transfiguration professor, a wisp of a witch by the name of Fatima Furiosa. He was hitting his stride on explaining the complexities of gaseous transfiguration when Potter entered the library and sat with his league of followers at a nearby table. As he watched them share notes and go over the texts, he felt the resentment build. But when he imagined putting Potter under the Cruciatus Curse, the tortured writhing body in his mind’s eye transformed into his father.</p><p>Lucius had gotten off Scot free.  Draco had gotten the news from his mother in the morning post. He now realized, instead of feeling relieved, he felt cheated. He loved his father, but his mother had suffered, he had suffered, for his father’s choices. True, the Malfoy’s were a proud family of Slytherines and their blood was pure, but they were not a family of torturers and murderers, not until his father perceived a threat to their way of life and put his faith in the wrong man. As Draco numbered his father’s transgressions, he recalled his meeting with Dumbledore at the highest tower, and he began to face his own mistakes. Letting Greyback into the school, spitting slurs towards muggle-born witches and wizards, and for what? His father who was so misguided? Well, not anymore. Dumbledore had said it was never too late to be a good person, and now he would work towards those ends.  Draco would make amends. The first thing he would do was write his mother back.</p><p>His mother’s reply came with a Halloween package. Along with the assortment of homemade treats and tricks from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, it had come with a brown paper package. Draco put it in his bag without opening it. He had a full day ahead, but he would have to find the time to do what he had set out for himself. He might lose his nerve if he put it off. Even then, it was evening before he found his chance.</p><p>Potter, Weasley and Granger were in the Great Hall for a late dinner and were finishing when Draco approached. He hoped Potter would notice him, but it was Weasley who saw him first.</p><p>“What do you want?” Weasley asked.</p><p>Draco took a deep calming breath. “May I sit?”</p><p>The politeness in Malfoy’s voice had stunned them into nodding their assent. Draco sat before they could come to their senses and tell him to bugger off.</p><p>“I’ve come to apologize,” Draco said. He spoke to all three but looked at Granger. “I’ve held some atrocious views, and they were, at their heart, bigotry and hate. I went out of my way to make sure you felt you were not worth as much as a pureblood witch, and I used unacceptable language. I’m sorry. As a way to begin to set things right, I’d like to join S.P.E.W.” Weasley sputtered on his pumpkin juice and Potter sat a little straighter. As for Granger, she was watching Draco with discerning eyes. Her lips remained pressed together, but Draco thought it was better that he say everything in one go. “And I brought you some Honeydukes candy. I think you like cauldron cakes and sugar quills?” He handed a bulging bag over to Hermione which she took, now with a furrow in her brow. “And,” Draco went on, “I sent home for this.” He handed over the brown paper package. Granger began to open it with trepidation. “It’s an original notebook of Newt Scarmander’s with all of his notations and sketches. It predates his work for Fantastic Beasts, but some people think that makes it worth more.”</p><p>Granger gasped, and Draco waited. She studied him for a moment before speaking. “You can never quit S.P.E.W or whatever form it takes. Ever. You’ll be dead before it’s over.”</p><p>“I can handle that,” said Draco.</p><p>“And a book like this,” Granger held the soft leather bound book of scattered pages with firm reverence, “is my Christmas present every year.”</p><p>“Deal,” said Draco trying not to smile at this victory and already thinking of the book he would send for in less than two months time. He turned to Weasley. “I’ve always treated you poorly for your family. Maybe it was borne of jealousy. Certainly it was an attempt to be more like my father, but I’ve realized it was wrong, no matter the reason. I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Great,” said Ron. “Where’s my candy and personalized present.”</p><p>Draco could not help his annoyance. “I was an arsehole to you, yeah, but I was prejudiced towards her. There’s a difference, but I can find some way to make you feel special, if you like.” Draco’s hand twitched for his wand, then thought better of it and left Ron to sputter. He turned to Potter.</p><p>Suddenly Draco felt at a loss for words. He had spent the past two weeks preparing for this moment, but he came up empty when the time was ripe. There was too much between them, too much to say and more to make amends for. But it was Potter who broke the silence.</p><p>“It’s a start. Come on, you can finish apologizing later. Stay and eat something. You look like you could use it.” </p><p>Was it Draco’s imagination or was a smile playing on Potter’s lips? Draco ignored the warm feeling in his chest. He was suddenly ravenous. The roast beef and roasted potatoes were better than anything he had ever had at Malfoy Manor. While he ate, he listened to the golden trio return to their conversation about Hagrid’s latest dangerous pet and could not help but ask about the dragon he had watched hatch from a window in their first year. The conversation flowed from there, much more easily now they were not at odds. Granger dragged Draco into a conversation about S.P.E.W, and neither Potter nor Weasley offered to rescue him. They seemed to think it was amusing. The Great Hall emptied around them. Soon Granger left saying she had a letter to write to George. Weasley left a while after with a huge yawn.</p><p>A stiff silence fell over Draco and Potter. Draco desperately wanted to break it but was not sure how. He had worked up the nerve to begin his apologies anew, but Potter began speaking at the same time.</p><p>“Go on. What were you saying?” Draco asked.</p><p>“I asked,” said Potter, “why the change of heart? It’s good to see.”</p><p>Draco shrugged. “I guess I outgrew my father and his beliefs. I had to be a Death Eater first, which ended up being far more than I had bargained for. They were dangerous, to say the least. Why are you so accepting?”</p><p>It was Potter’s turn to shrug. “You’re a lot like Snape in those ways. If he can redeem himself, so can you. It’d be my fault if I didn’t give you the same chance he was given.”</p><p>Draco appreciated Potter’s candor but he did not say so. Instead he said, “I got a new wand. Since you took my last one.” There was no heat in his words but he raised a brow at Potter. “May be even better than my old one. Might perform some good magic for me.”</p><p>Potter chuckled but it was brief. “I imagine this past year or so hasn’t been the greatest for you. Having Voldemort in your home couldn’t have been easy.”</p><p>Somehow getting empathy from Potter, the man Voldemort had sought to murder not once but seven times, allowed Draco to open up in a way he had not before. Not only was he sharing specific stories of terror under the Dark Lord but also how he was feeling in those moments. What was more, Potter reciprocated. It must have surprised Potter as much as it had him, but it did not stop them from speaking deeper truths than they had to anyone else. The discovered their opposing perspectives had more commonalities than either realized. Their conversation moved from horror stories about the Dark Lord onto shared experiences years past (“Madame Malkin’s was the first place I saw you, but I didn’t know who you were until the day on the train.” “We’ve had a number of duels. I’d like to win one once.” “Walking into the Great Hall after everybody else with a bloody nose was the best thing ever to happen for my image.”) On and on until something outside caught Potter’s eye. It was dawn. They had talked all night without realizing it. A little embarrassed at how overcome they were, the two stood and parted in the entrance hall, Potter for the Gryffindor tower and Draco for the dungeons holding the Slytherin’s common room.</p><p>Draco felt incredibly light hearted as he crawled into bed. He had far too much energy to fall asleep. He reached for his cock thinking the release would guide him off to sleep. Draco masturbated furiously, fighting for release. Just before he came green almond shaped eyes flitted before his vision.</p>
