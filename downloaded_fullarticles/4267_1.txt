    <p>"Albus Potter"</p>
<p>Al walks calmly up to the stool and sits looking only at his cousin and his new friend before the hat is placed on his head and immediately he hears its voice.</p>
<p>"Another Weasley-Potter child, well I know exactly where to put you Gryff-"</p>
<p>"Wait!" Albus interrupts.</p>
<p>"Wait? Why would I wait child? It's so obvious where you belong."</p>
<p>"So you’re judging where I belong based solely on who my parents are and where they were sorted? What sense does that make? I’m my own person. I’m not my mother or my father. You need to sort me as me besides I don't want to be in Gryffindor."</p>
<p>"And why ever not might I ask?"</p>
<p>"I want to be in Slytherin."</p>
<p>"What? Why in Merlin's name would a Weasley or Potter want to be in Slytherin? Have plans to be a great wizard do you?"</p>
<p>"No, um, sir.”</p>
<p>“And yet you’re asking to be placed in a house other than the one almost everyone in your family has ever been in. That’s quite brave and shows you would be a good Gryffindor.”</p>
<p>“I understand that but you see you already sorted Scorpius Malfoy into Slytherin and he has no one else. On the train on the way here he was all alone until I sat with him. We spent the whole ride talking, getting to know each other. I like him and no one will talk to him. He's sitting at that table completely alone. And that's just not right."</p>
<p>"Ah but with loyalty and a sense of fair play like that perhaps I thought wrong at first it seems you should actually be in Huff-"</p>
<p>"Wait!" Al nearly yelled out loud this time.</p>
<p>"What now child?"</p>
<p>"Placing me in Hufflepuff would only defeat the purpose of my wanting to be in Slytherin with Scorpius so he isn't alone, so that he has a friend. Don't you see he would still be alone?"</p>
<p>"Hmm such logical thinking, very wise. You really are a remarkable boy. I think again I would have made the wrong choice. It seems you belong in Raven-"</p>
<p>"WAIT!" Albus really did yell out loud this time. He could begin to hear voices from around him but couldn't be bothered to take the time to be embarrassed as he knew where he wanted to be and refused to let the Hat sort him anywhere else. "Why do you insist on using one or two characteristics or qualities to define which house I go to? I can be all of those things no matter what house I'm in. Dad said you let him pick his house, you let him choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. He also said the last time he heard your song you talked about not liking the fact that you have to sort us, worrying that the sorting was leading to danger. I know Dad defeated Voldemort and it seems the world is safe again but you never know and why not take into account where a person wants to be. Put a person where they think they belong. Anyway, I want to be in Slytherin and I'll sit here all night until you place me there."<br/>"Merlin save me," the Hat muttered, "Fine have it your way. Slytherin!"</p>
<p>Albus removed the hat to see a room filled with confused faces but the shy smile on the face of the small blond boy sitting at the end of the Slytherin table made it all worth it.</p>
