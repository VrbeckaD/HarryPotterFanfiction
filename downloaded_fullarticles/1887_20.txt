    <p>For as long as I can remember this house has always been my home. But what price has that home come with, the weight of ghosts I never wished to linger with. True as an orphan you can rarely have a say in where you are sent but why in hell was I sent here of all places. Great aunt Jaqi…how in hell could she be my great aunt? A few memories still popped up now and again from when I was younger, her laugh, smile and the games of hide and seek we would play. Finally I am eighteen and somehow in all those years not  wrinkle or grey hair in sight appeared on this supposed great aunt of mine. Out in the middle of nowhere this massive home sits in a vast patch of green surrounded by dessert, a supposed oasis many drifters should assume to find as a pleasant sight after their wandering yet none stop here. Even they can tell at a distance to stay away, such an idyllic place surely can’t be safe in such a harsh climate.</p><p>Room by room I pace through the end of her early morning rounds as mountain ranger leaving me alone in this empty abode. No matter where I go I can feel it, eyes on me, shadows dart away, distant scurrying and the random shifting items that once seemed so magical as a child adding to her mystique now only compounds my urge to flee. A few years now I’ve been saving up and I have just barely enough to get away. There really isn’t a set location yet, just anywhere but here. Outside an engine dies and a deep sigh escapes from my lips, tentatively, in a glance at the mirror along the wall to avoid looking into the room on my right at the sound of claws tapping along the ground at my approach, my hands rose to shift the dark crimson curls away from my face freeing the sight of my emerald eyes. In a dart out my tongue wet my lips as I wound my hair back up into a sloppy bun secured with the hair tie on my wrist distracting me just long enough for the creature to hide in the cabinet behind the door.</p><p>Turning away from the mirror the shifting of my reflection into the face of a small wrinkled face as the glass door hidden there eased open freeing a ladder for another younger version of her to scurry up into the hiding place happened with my back to it on my path to the kitchen. The sounds of the truck door closing and the shouldering of a rifle and boot steps through the dirt path to the back door followed by the shifting of the wood steps in an eager trot from the steps to the door leading into the kitchen. In the doorway again my eyes fell on her and I leaned against the frame feeling the shifting of my t shirt and jeans in crossing my arms. Simple worn jeans with a tan button down shirt tucked into them was secured by a worn belt bearing a silver badge and a handgun holster on the raven haired purple eyed supposed great aunt who looks more like my sister than someone supposedly well past her sixties by her father’s guess when I was a child.</p><p>Sighing as she fanned her collar underneath her long ponytail flowing across her back Jaqi smiled at me after leaving her rifle on the rack along the wall. “Humid out today.”</p><p>I nodded and asked, “Any sign of the crew to fix the train station?”</p><p>She shook her head, “No, that flood took out the eastern path and they’re still clearing it. Few weeks still possibly, something about angry badgers.” At my sigh she chuckled and turned to grab a bottle of juice from the fridge she sat at the table to enjoy, “Don’t be so eager to be off on your own.” The cap broke free at her turn and she tipped the bottle back against her lips for a sip.</p><p>After a scoff I mumbled turning back to my room, “What would you care.”</p><p>Behind me I paused as she called out, “Is it that absurd of an idea that I care about your happiness?”</p><p>Back in the doorway my hand planted on the frame stating as my free hand waved at my side emphasizing my words, “You’ve lived here your whole life, what would you know about anywhere else?”</p><p>A scoff and a giggle came from her as she capped the bottle again, “Just who told you that?” At my brow rising she continued, “I have no idea where you got that idea, I’ve been all over the globe, in fact you used to love my stories of my adventures. I don’t know how hard you hit your head in that tree climbing fumble of yours, since then you don’t seem to know me at all Em.” In her path pat me when she rose to her feet easing the chair back in place and walked through to her study passing me with a kiss on my cheek. </p><p>To her back I cry out, “My name is Mal!” Again she nods raising the bottle confirming she heard me as she enters her study, in a stomping path I charge back up to my room calling out as I did, “What my mother was thinking naming me Emery I have no clue!” Hard as I could I slammed my door and rushed to the bed whispering out as my fingers eased over the locket holding my father’s picture remembering his nickname for me, “Mallory.” Through a tear rolling down my cheek clutching the locket in my fist I rolled over and reached for my journal to once again start spilling yet another idea for my life in the world only to end up sketching the same set of brothers onto the bare page yet again. No matter what these men were on my mind, in my dreams, the weight of this house only lessened with thoughts of them.</p><p>Oh the dreams I had of them, from the simplest of glances at a distant to the most heated of situations leaving you tangled between the amorous pair seeing to your every desire. But no matter where you looked in this town of two hundred and fifty they could not be found, and jaqi wasn’t any help either telling you to hang a bell in a tree to call them to you. Her and her superstitions clearly didn’t find her a husband of her own. Honestly you weren’t even related, she merely fostered one of your relatives when thy were little, who is now long since dead, only compounding the worrying topic of her appearance. A cult or coven seemed to be the main assumption in town but as she watched the mountain passes all on her own and rarely came to town or bothered others at all she and her mysteries were tolerated.</p><p>Through to dinner she laid there aimlessly daydreaming about the pair she hoped to find out in the great unknown. “Dinner.” Another sigh later up and down to the kitchen I went again to claim my seat and halfway listen to the latest story of her rounds through the night. Halfway down the stairs a flash of lightning broke through another tangling daydream bringing the storm that had suddenly rolled in to my attention then soon disappeared at the metal shutters sealing over the windows upstairs through candles being lit at the table before they closed over the downstairs windows as well. Silently I slipped back into my thoughts until a knock sounded on the front door between bickering voices on the other side of it.</p><p>…</p><p>“This won’t do…” In a circle Radagast turned in his hut after yet another unsuccessful search for his Cousin and Sauruman to aid in bringing about the order Yavanna had sent to him in a dream. “Were are you Gandalf? I cannot do this alone…” In another pacing circle he passed by his bookshelf only to pause at his hedgehog squeaking atop an old worn book. A grin eased onto his face, “Of course! I’ll call out for another Wizard! Surely one will answer the call!”</p><p>The book was eased open after shouldering the hedgehog, resting in his palms the book flipped to the right page and he read through the instructions, “Right, right, one garlic clove, a pebble and an unbound soul.” He snapped the book shut and left it on the table and exited his hut, “Easy enough.”</p><p>Atop his sleigh he scanned the distance until he spotted a pair of brothers, both packed in their youthful travel to test themselves by Dwarvish tradition they ventured from the Iron Hills hoping to make it to Rohan, not far from it at the edges of Fangorn. A short conversation the naïve pair, both conveniently linked to the same One they had yet to find, agreed to joining him on his mission. Carefully they settled into his sled and he raced off into the swelling storm growing in front of them only tightening their grips on one another’s arms. Completely soaked to the bone the pair stared up confused at the lone house in the vast nothingness after passing through a swirling jumble of colorful clouds.</p><p>On his feet Kili mumbled, “I think we’re lost.”</p><p>Radagast chuckled and moved across the lawn with a chuckle, “Not at all.” His voice lowered to a mumble, “Please help me…”</p><p>Fili nudged Kili, whispering, “Let’s just see who lives here.” He chuckled, “Why are you so cautious? This isn’t like you.”</p><p>Kili nudged him back, “You’re just hoping they’ll feed us.”</p><p>Fili chuckled, “You know me too well.”</p><p>Confidently he knocked on the door as the brothers climbed onto the porch and stopped behind him peering at the door. Through the opened door instantly the young trio locked their eyes on one another and Mal led the boys inside to guide them inside to change out of their wet clothes while Jaqi eyed Radagast in his reluctance to enter just yet.</p><p>Wetting his lips he said, “Miss,”</p><p>“Jaqi.”</p><p>He nodded, “Miss Jaqi, I am Radagast the Brown. Now I have traveled quite a distance to find you. I have a favor to ask.” With a nod she stepped back and he joined her through to the dining room where he set out a map, “Now, my Cousin Gandalf was sent this task and now he has gone missing and the head of our order has as well. This job must be carried out and I cannot abandon my post for long so I am in need of reinforcements.”</p><p>Behind him Mal, who had reluctantly left the boys to change alone asked in the doorway, “What sort of reinforcements could you need in a get up like that?”</p><p>Jaqi, “Em!”</p><p>Mal’s brows furrowed and she barked back, “Mal!”</p><p>Radagast held his gaze on Jaqi he continued, “Now, Smaug has been resting for sixty years and now there are those wishing to march in hopes of finding him dead. What I require is someone to convince the Sons of Durin to return home once again.”</p><p>Mal’s brow rose and she crossed her arms leaning on the door frame, “And why would you come here?”</p><p>Radagast, “Because a Wizard must complete this task. That mountain must not fall into darkened hands.”</p><p>Another scoff came from Mal, “Somebody clearly has been hitting the sauce, look, no Wizards here old man.”</p><p>Jaqi, “Mal! Go upstairs if you’re going to behave like that!”</p><p>Mal’s arm flailed out as she replied, “He clearly-..”</p><p>Jaqi, “Knows more than you understand.” Mal’s brows furrowed only to drop at the guys peering over her shoulder through the doorway at the map on the table.</p><p>Fili grinned moving closer, “Erebor!” Kili moved behind him as Mal muttered, “Not you too. Why do they have to be crazy?”</p><p>Kili, “Uncle never lets us see his map but we snuck a glance once couple decades back.”</p><p>Mal rolled her eyes crossing her arms as Fili asked, “What’s this about Sons of Durin?”</p><p>Radagast, “Miss Jaqi here, if she would consent to aiding me would guide a Son of Durin to reclaim Erebor.”</p><p>Mal looked to Jaqi, “You’re not really considering this?!”</p><p>Jaqi raised a brow, “And if I am?”</p><p>Mal, “You can’t be serious, he’s clearly out of his mind! Wandering out in that storm from who knows where on a sled pulled by some very odd looking rabbits!”</p><p>Radagast, “Rastabell Rabbits, fastest of their kind.”</p><p>Mal waved her hand at him, “I rest my case.”</p><p>Jaqi caught Radagast’s eyes saying, “That’s all you need?”</p><p>He nodded and replied, “If you would be so kind, though I am afraid we will have to leave by midnight before the portal closes.”</p><p>She nodded and Mal said, “I think it’s time you left. Wizards and portals…”</p><p>Jaqi locked her eyes on Mal, “This is my home Mal, you don’t have to go it doesn’t sound like it should take long.”</p><p>Radagast, “Oh, my apologies, I forgot to mention, the portal, I can only open it for you once.”</p><p>Jaqi nodded and lowered her gaze as Mal dropped her arms, “Oh really, now we’re supposed to just race off to the unknown to follow a treasure map?! Honestly Jaqi!”</p><p>Jaqi, “I know you don’t understand. There s a lot I haven’t told you..”</p><p>Mal shouted, “I don’t care! But fine, this is your home! You just let whoever you want through the door no matter how crazy they are! You want to go off chasing treasure maps then go right ahead! I won’t be sticking around very long anyways! Just till that train comes back into town and then I’m gone!”</p><p>Kili turned with a worried expression, “You’re not coming with us?”</p><p>Mal scoffed, “I am not going anywhere with him!”</p><p>The brothers held a silent conference then nodded in agreement, saying together, “We’re staying with you then.”</p><p>Unwilling to send them away before she could find out why she had been dreaming of them for so long. Her eyes shifted back to Jaqi saying, “Go then. You won’t find me here when you come crawling back from whatever foolish trap he leaves you in.”</p><p>Jaqi, “Why are you acting like this? Like you won’t care at all when I’m gone.”</p><p>Mal, “What would I have to care about? A few scattered memories from when I was little? What could possibly make me want to stay with you in this haunted house? For years I’ve been saving up to get away and soon enough I’ll have my chance.”</p><p>Jaqi nodded, “That easy?”</p><p>Mal, “Oh like you’ll care at all. You don’t know anything about me at all. We’re practically strangers! Just go already! Just go!”</p><p>Jaqi drew in a breath and walked around the table easing her hand along the back of her belt wrapping two fingers around the nub at the end of a hidden wand she eased out of an inconspicuous holster, “You want to be alone, fine. See how you like it.”</p><p>A flick of her arm brought the wand into Mal’s vision making her brows furrow. “What the-?”</p><p>Steadily in her mind Jaqi uttered the charm she had used for centuries to keep muggles away from her home, “Obliviate.” Instantly she could feel a deep stab in her chest at the memories of her in Mal’s life fading away while the house pulsed around her shifting and contorting as her belongings and the house elves inside were now housed in a miniature version of her house she tucked inside her pack, leaving just Mal’s belongings as she eased her jacket on an arm at a time asking the boys, “You’re certain you wish to stay here?”</p><p>After another conference they both nodded replying, “Yes.”</p><p>She nodded again shouldering her pack as well as her rifle and drew her handgun out from its draw to add to the holster on her hip then locked eyes with Radagast saying, “We should get going then.” Waving her wand for another table setting that was filled with food and juice as the trio aimlessly took their seats after you wiped the conversation from their minds, leaving just the memory of them knocking on the door in the middle of a storm.</p><p>On the other side of the locked front door Jaqi followed Radagast to his sled after having missed his leaving a pebble on the coffee table for the trio seeing the pain in Jaqi’s eyes when she holstered her wand again. “I like your rabbits.”</p><p>With a chuckle he eyed their body language in sniffing her and said, “They like you as well.” She forced a smile and took one last glance at the now unprotected house and settled on the sled as Radagast gave the signal triggering their race away back through the portal in the storm. All through the meal stolen glances and hinted flirtations lasted through to clearing the table and guiding the pair to the spare room where Mal stated, “It’s not much. I don’t get many guests, so, there’s only one bed…”</p><p>The brothers shrugged and Kili said, “No worries. We’ve shared worse.”</p><p>With a wink Fili said, “See you at breakfast, then we’ll gladly help with any work around here.”</p><p>Kili nodded grinning as well saying his own goodnight as Mal moved to her bedroom down the hall with a giggle under her breath eager to see what the next day would hold.</p><p> </p>
