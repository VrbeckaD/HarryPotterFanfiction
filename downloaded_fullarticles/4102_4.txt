  <u> <strong> Chapter 1</strong> </u>
</p><p align="justify">   In the room of requirement three boys are cuddled in a coach, lost in thought. It's been one and a half year since they started this particular three way relationship. One and a half year since they discovered the prejudice of their friends and families about people like them. One and a half year since they started to lie every day to try to have a little time together, to be alone a moment.</p><p align="justify">   All started during his first year. Their family help him to find the 9 ¾ platform for the Hogwarts express. And they were there to welcome him with open arms in the gryffindor house. He quickly became their little brother best friend but, when he entered, very much by accident, the quidditch team it was to them that he turn to, for advice and reassurance. After that first macth, as soon as he was in the changing room, they hugged him nearly to death, a family trait, split between the joy of the win because of the relief and the problems with his broom. During the rest of the year they stayed to his side as friends, not at close as Ron and Hermione were but close ones. At the end of the year he though to ask them for help to stop Snape but they were in detention with Filtch for like usual another prank.</p><p align="justify">   During the summer, when they came with Ron to break him out he was extremely relieved and realized that he had miss them terribly. Then came the stress of the closed platform and the flight in the car. He arrived at Hogwarts terrified and had been welcomed with disappointment, anger and overall relief of those who worried over his absence like the twins and Hermione. He noted that they seem more scared than anything. He wondered why but this concern was quickly overshadowed by the event of the year. The incompetent and overly slimy Professor Lockhart and later the dual exposing him as a parselmouth worried him more. As the whole school avoided him, declaring him the Heir of Slytherin and the responsible of the petrified student the twins stood by his side with Ron and Hermione. They later let him sleep with them when Hermione was found petrified and  nightmares were hindering his sleep. It was after that night that they realized that they perhaps were not feeling only friendship for their little brother best friend. Then come the end of the year, the kidnapping of Ginny in the chamber of secret, the quest of Harry and Ron to save her with this time a professor. It should have been enough ? But not Harry had to fight a Basilisk and a piece of soul of Voldemort, alone once again. He ended wounded and terrorized once again his friends.</p><p align="justify">   And then it was summer, isolation, Dursley, and Aunt Marge. Third year beginning was different, he had a killer after him but this was sadly normal for him, what changed was his feeling for his twins, he knew it was certainly not friendly it was more and it raised questions. Was he gay ? Was it okay to be gay ? How does a three way relationship work ? And one with two brothers ? And the most important of all did they return his feelings ? It was confused about himself that he entered Hogwarts for his third year. And despite everything they were there for him, they gave him the marauders map a way to go Hogsmeade and also a connection to his father. They also comfort him when he found out that Sirius Black was his godfather and that he betrayed his parents.. They let him cry in their arms until he didn't have any tears left. With the terrors of the dementors and the nightmares they created he took to sleeping in their bed as it seen to be the only way for him to sleep more than a two hour a night. Slowly all three of them became closer and closer. Another change came to disturb this year. The 1st of April the twins were to be 16 years old, their mother made them came home apparently because of the risk of a family inheritance that come at the 16th birthday of every twins of Prewett line. When they came back they were different, more serious, more mature as if something important had happened. You could actually see them study and it was a traumatic change for their gryffindor year mates. The twins still were close to their little lion. The year despite Malfoy, the hippogriff and the dementor was a calm one. It couldn't stay that way and the end of the year bought his usual adventure. He, Hermione and Ron confronted Sirius Black and Professor Lupin and discovered the truth. And the later save him from the dementor kiss. After all this He decided one thing he will live to the fullest because he will never know, when death could come. So, as soon as he left the hospital wing he went to the twins and he confessed his feelings. This became the best day of his life as they return his feeling. They decided at least for a little time to keep it to themselves.</p><p align="justify">   Summer bought some of the usual and some unexpected. When Harry was brought to the Burrow he quickly learn the homophobia of his best friend Hermione and the discomfort about this of the Weasley family (perhaps except Bill, Charly and of course the twins). It sadly comfort the tree in their idea that they have to keep their relationship secret from everyone. And it was so hard. At Hogwarts the Triwizard Tournament was held and Harry had to confront the three schools alone as his name came out of the cup. It was a torture for the twins to see him suffer and not be able to do anything to help. They were with him in the shadow but as soon as the light shone he was alone, so alone. They helped him prepare  for the tasks and they arrange for the Yule ball to go with friends to keep the illusion even if they would have wanted to go together. They were later relieved when Harry's hostage for the second task turned out to be Ron proving that their secret was safe. The worst part was the third task when Harry disappeared with the cup both twins fell in a state of panic that only stop at his return. It was  at a point where Jordan Lee, their friend, had to restrain them to go after Harry. When he came back terrified, wounded and with the body of Cedric announcing the return of Voldemort, they rushed to his side. He was first confronted by the false Alastor Moody before been taken once more to the hospital wing where the three of them reunited.</p><p>   And then the cycle of the Summer continue once more with its own variation, dementors and a trial this time. Hogwarts for this 5th year seems to be more a nightmare than a home. He was seen as a liar and an attention seeker, was constantly watch by the new defense against the dark arts teacher. And the weight of the constant lies about his relationship with his twins started to be a little to much.</p><p>   So here they are hidden in the room of requirement, hidden from the world, from the worries. For a few hours nothing exist but the them. Tired beyond everything from his summer and the constant rumors and watching Harry is nesting in the arms of Fred and George. In a moment of weakness that he only let show with his twins beside him, he wish for people that can understand him, for a family. He forget is where he is in the room of requirement that if it can grant the wish of those within. So, suddenly on the wall opposite of the three boys, a door appear. Curious they decide to see where it lead. Behind there is stairs in the dark, leading to what seems to be the donjons of Hogwarts. They go down for what feel like minutes before arriving to a corridor with old and mostly broken metal doors of what could be cells. The last one is in a surprisingly good state and locked. It is strange, the three boys looked to each other to make sure that they all agree to continue. A nod and Harry unlock the door, Fred and George are behind him, their wand in the hand ready to neutralize a possible assailant. Harry open the door and in the cell are two men shackle to the wall.</p>
