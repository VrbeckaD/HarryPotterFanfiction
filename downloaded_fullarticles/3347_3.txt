    <p>Learning how to live, chapter 1</p><p>--The world of Harry Potter with all its wonderful characters belongs to JK Rowling. --</p><p>***</p><p>Summer after fifth year was a disaster.</p><p>A year before, Harry would have said, life at Privet Drive couldn’t get any worse. But he had been wrong. There was always a different sort of awful. And while he did get letters from his friends and they even told him some of what was going on, other things were a whole lot worse.</p><p>Ever since Sirius’ death, he didn’t feel like himself anymore. There was this black hole inside of him, swallowing all emotions, all he ever wanted, everything that made him, well, <em>him</em>.</p><p>In the beginning, he had been angry. Angry at Dumbledore for not telling him about the prophecy, angry at Snape and his useless Occlumency lessons, angry at Bellatrix. But during the grey days in his room at the Dursleys, with no one to shout at and no outlet for his feelings, the anger faded into the background of his mind. It grew, until it was this big black hole, and now it was eating away at him. Some days, he thought, he could actually <em>feel</em> how it chewed pieces out of his soul, his mind, his magic. Other days, he felt nothing but empty.</p><p>The Dursleys ignored him mostly – at least after the first week. His uncle had been waiting for him at the station and had not been happy about the order-members threatening him.</p><p>At first, Harry had thought his uncle had been too shocked to react and would be afraid enough to let him live in peace for one summer. Then, the whole drive home, Vernon had been muttering about freaks and what an ungrateful boy he was. Harry had started to realize he was in trouble, so he freed Hedwig as soon, as they arrived. Which he was glad for, since all his things got locked up in his old cupboard.</p><p>Then his uncle held what he called a <em>Family Meeting</em> in the dining room. It consisted of Vernon and Petunia shouting at him for terrorizing Dudley last summer, being a lazy and ungrateful brat, looking like a criminal with his horrible hair and associating with other freaks. At least they didn’t blame him for the weather. Yet.</p><p>Dudley meanwhile didn’t seem any different (his expression was still absurdly stupid, and his midsection had somehow managed to get even more enormous) he was ignoring everyone, watching TV and eating ice-cream.</p><p>Harry tried to explain about the Dementors, which didn’t do him any good, rather the opposite. Petunia decided they couldn’t risk the neighbours seeing him doing freaky stuff and he got locked up in his room.</p><p>In the beginning, they at least remembered to shove a bottle of water through the claptrap every once in a while, and even gave him some bread or soup.</p><p>But after Harry slept more or less through the first two days, his exhaustion vanished, and the nightmares started up again. They always ended with Sirius falling through the veil and Harry shouting his name. His uncle was <em>not</em> impressed being woken up at 4 AM. Most nights ended with Harry being covered with spittle of his shouting uncle and a promise of getting no food for the next few days.</p><p>And while all of this wouldn’t have been anything new, the Dursleys somehow managed to forget to tell him, that they would visit aunt Marge for a few days. Only when they didn’t return home that evening and no one was there to let him go to the bathroom did Harry realize, how very much he was imprisoned.</p><p>He had never felt more humiliated in his life, when he had to use an empty water bottle and a bucket because he couldn’t go to the loo. He couldn’t even empty them out of his window, since Vernon had made sure to nail it shut. The smell in his room was horrible. It got even worse, when after two days with no water, he started to fear, he would have to drink his own fluids if he didn’t want to die of thirst. It was way too warm, the stale air and the lack of water and food made him seriously consider the possibility of him dying. His mind was brought back to the time he lived in the cupboard, locked up with the walls coming closer until he felt unable to move or breathe.</p><p>But then, thank merlin, the Dursleys came back.</p><p>He couldn’t remember ever feeling so grateful for hearing the squeaking of the front door and their loud voices. Usually, he would have been scared about getting some weird punishment for something he didn’t even do. But he couldn’t muster any energy for being scared, even as his aunt screeched about the smell and his uncle dragged him to the bathroom and threw him into the shower.</p><p>Well, he survived.</p><p>After this first horrible week, Harry decided to try and please his aunt and uncle. Or at least not to irritate them any more than he already did by simply existing.</p><p>He did all the chores without muttering a word, tried to be polite and stayed out of their ways as much as possible. During the nights, he’d use an old alarm clock of Dudley to wake himself every thirty minutes. He had soon figured out that, like this, he wouldn’t wake up screaming from nightmares.</p><p>It worked, at least somewhat. The Dursleys left him alone, except to tell him about his chores. Even Dudley couldn’t find much enjoyment in taunting him now, that this didn’t get any reaction out of him.</p><p>Harry felt proud of himself for achieving something like a truce with his relatives. Maybe it still wasn’t <em>nice </em>– as if Privet Drive could <em>ever</em> be nice – but at least he felt he behaved more like an adult. And he knew he could take it. Next summer he would turn seventeen and he would be able to leave and never look back.</p><p>At the same time, Harry felt as if all the anger he was supposed to feel was fed to the black hole inside of him. When he was really tired or hungry, he started seeing shadows out of the corners of his eyes. While he suspected, he was simply seeing things because he was exhausted, he couldn’t help but start feeling a bit paranoid.</p><p>It didn’t feel like Voldemort was sending him visions. His scar didn’t hurt, and he never blacked out. It felt more like accidental magic, or maybe like his magic was changing. He didn’t know if such a thing was possible, but it sure felt like it. As much as he tried to ignore it, it didn’t seem to get any better.</p><p>But it wasn’t like he could do anything. And he definitely didn’t want to write his friends about it, he could just imagine what they would say. While Hermine would pester him about telling Dumbledore, Ron would write something like <em>Boah mate, sounds weird. Maybe you just need to sleep more?</em> Which wouldn’t help at all (Besides, it was always a gamble, if Vernon would let the owls deliver the letters – he didn’t want to risk him refusing Harry any contact by making an owl wait for a reply).</p><p>And somehow Harry couldn’t help but feel just a little bit gleeful about not telling Dumbledore. He knew this wasn’t very mature of him. But he was so fed up with people knowing more about him than he himself did. And Dumbledore seemed so very sure, that he was some weird figurehead of the light and that love was his strongest weapon. Well, after Sirius’ death, Harry was certain that this couldn’t be true. He didn’t feel good or pure or <em>light</em> at all.</p><p>He liked to imagine what would happen, if he turned into a dark wizard. He could just picture how people would look at him. Maybe then they would realize that he wasn’t just a chess piece to shove around. That he didn’t want to be a perfect Gryffindor Golden-Boy. He was just a fifteen-year-old teenager – wasn’t he supposed to be able to depend on adults?</p><p>And yet he also knew, that he wasn’t a regular teenager and had never been one. Everything that had happened, had forced him to grow up in a different way than his peers. All he wanted, was for things to be over so he could finally start to live for real. Right now, he didn’t have the time or energy for all the stuff other guys his age seemed to be thinking about. And not just because of the prophecy. No matter how much he didn’t want to be a figurehead of the light, it would be up to him to battel Voldemort in the end; simply because everyone expected it of him. Not doing so, would end up with people losing hope and Voldemort winning – and no matter how much he wanted to prove everyone wrong, this was something he couldn’t allow to happen.</p><p>***</p><p>Two weeks after Harrys birthday, Dumbledore showed up in his bedroom, wearing a monstrosity of a purple suit and told him, he would spend the rest of the holidays with his friends. Then he called Kreacher and made sure, Harry truly did inherit everything from Sirius. And Harry in turn gave the Order permission to continue using Grimmauld Place as their headquarters.</p><p>Because, really, he couldn’t truly say he wanted the house to himself now, could he? Even if he did get really angry; because they should have told him before and they didn’t have any right to assume he would be fine sharing the things Sirius had left him.</p><p>But that was just for a short moment. Then the anger vanished, and he felt– well, nothing really. And there wasn’t any other option than agreeing with Dumbledore. It was, after all, the adult thing to do.</p><p>Dumbledore escorted Harry to Grimmauld Place. He told Harry again, how very sorry he was about Sirius and everything else that had happened, what a wonderful boy he, Harry, was and that he needed to be strong, that a war always demanded sacrifices. Harry smiled and said that he would be fine.</p><p>***</p><p>When Dumbledore had finally left, Harry took a deep breath and leaned his head against the wall. He had expected to be happy to be back in the magical world. But all he felt was tired. He knew everyone else was in the kitchen since it was already past six when dinner was usually served. It would be full of people and light and warmth. He had the vague wish to sneak up into his room and avoid everyone.</p><p>He shook his head and balled his hands into fists until his fingernails dug into his skin. He <em>was</em> fine. He’d had his break; weeks of self-pity and depression. Now he would pull himself together and be Harry Potter again.</p><p>He rummaged around in his trunk until he found his wand and stuffed it into a pocket of his baggy jeans. Then he shoved the heavy thing against the wall, so people could still pass through, and made his way to the kitchen. He would take his things upstairs after dinner, when he hopefully wouldn’t feel so tired and empty anymore.</p><p>The door to the kitchen was ajar and he could hear people arguing. Ron and Ginny were protesting against something and Mrs Weasley shouting hysterically to be heard over their voices.</p><p>“–YOUR MOTHER AND YOU WILL DO AS YOU ARE TOLD, RONALD WEASLY!”</p><p>“IT WASN’T HIS BLOODY FAULT!”, shouted Ron right back and Harry could all too well imagine how read his head must be right now.</p><p>He didn’t have to wonder for long who they were talking about when Mrs Weasley screeched: “YOU COULD HAVE DIED! YOU WON’T BE GOING ON ANY MORE ADVENTURES, NO MATTER WHO IS IN TROUBLE! THERE IS A REASON WHY THE ORDER IS FOR ADULTS!”</p><p>Harry felt the blood drain from his face. Were they talking about what happened at the Ministry? Did they think it was his fault? That would certainty explain why he hadn’t gotten the usual food package from Mrs Weasley. He leaned his head against the wall again and closed his eyes. The thought of sneaking upstairs before anyone saw him was suddenly much more appealing.</p><p>“Mum, we are at war”, said a different voice, way calmer than the others and Harry guessed it belonged to Bill. “These are dangerous times no matter what you do. You can’t protect them from everything. It’s better they learn to defend themselves than not.”</p><p> “Even Dumbledore– “, began Ginny, but Molly snapped “THAT’S ENOUGH! I don’t care what Albus bloody Dumbledore– “</p><p>“<em>Molly</em>!”, chided Arthur and Harry had never heard his voice so grave.</p><p>There was a tense silence and for a moment Harry feared, they had realized he was standing right outside. He had an image in his mind of what Vernon would have done were he caught listening in on a conversation and he tensed up. But no one came to get him and there was no rebuke or slap on his head. Right. He wasn’t at Privet Drive anymore.</p><p>“You will listen to me or you’re not going back to Hogwarts at all.” It seemed like Mrs Weasley had spoken her final word and no one answered.</p><p>The clanking and rattling of dishes and cutlery and bowls filled the silence. Dinner smelled delicious and Harry knew he should eat, but he couldn’t bring himself to enter the kitchen. How was he supposed to behave like everything was fine, when he felt as if everything– No. That wasn’t right. He wasn’t really feeling anything at all.</p><p>And Mrs Weasley was right. It was, at least partially, his fault what had happened in the Department of Mysteries.</p><p>He didn’t feel hungry anymore.</p><p>The shadows seemed to creep towards him and he closed his eyes. He needed to get out of here. As quietly as possible he went to grab his trunk and heaved it upstairs to the room he usually shared with Ron. He would use the same bed as last Christmas, or at least he assumed so, since there were only Rons things in here.</p><p>What if Mrs Weasley wouldn’t want him to sleep in the same room as her son anymore? But he couldn’t really imagine that; she was probably only insisting Ron and Ginny wouldn’t accompany Harry on any more of his stupid adventures. And that was better anyway. He didn’t want anything happening to them and things had gotten way too dangerous since Voldemort was back.</p><p>Not in the mood to unpack, he lay down on the bed and stared at the ceiling. It was made of wood and had probably been painted black a long time ago. Now it was more of a dark grey and in the corner above his head were some neon-yellow splatters of one of the twin’s experiments.</p><p>He sighed. It’s not like he ever liked Grimmauld Place. The house was just too dark and creepy and unfriendly for any normal human being – except maybe Bellatrix or Snape. But now it seemed somehow dead.</p><p>At least he would be able to use the bathroom here whenever he wanted.</p><p>Maybe it just seemed so glum because he knew Sirius would never again bounce through the door to drag him out to rummage through all the curious things in the cellar or grumble about the portrait of his mother or sing Christmas songs in horrible wrong tunes or take him to his room to show him pictures of his parents. He wouldn’t do anything again. Ever.</p><p>Sirius was dead. <em>Dead.</em></p><p>Harry didn’t feel like this had really gotten through to him.</p><p>Or maybe it had. But he thought he should feel different. Shouldn’t he still be crying? Sure, at first, he had been angry and then depressed. And he had cried, at least some. But it had happened not even three months ago – wasn’t he supposed to still be grieving? He didn’t feel anything when he thought about Sirius now. Just some vague pain, more like a dull ache.</p><p>Well, there wasn’t really anyone he could ask. Maybe Remus, but then again Harry hadn’t heard from him except for the short note he had gotten right after Sirius’ death. And he didn’t think Ron or Hermine would understand.</p><p>“Sirius is dead”, he told the ceiling.</p><p>Nothing happened. Not even the black shadows crept towards him.</p><p>“It was my fault.” Still nothing. He was still tired and exhausted and empty and cold and–</p><p>He sat bolt upright when he remembered Phineas’ Portrait. It wouldn’t do for the cranky former Headmaster to report to Dumbledore how Harry Potter was losing his mind and talking to himself. His heart beating rapidly, he stared at the black canvas. Only when the portrait remained empty for the next minute and the ceiling didn’t come down on him, did Harry start to calm down.</p><p>He really would have to remember that stupid thing. It probably wouldn’t work to cover it with something or put it someplace else since Phineas would just tell Dumbledore. And Harry didn’t want the Headmaster to start questioning what Harry was up to.</p><p>Not that he was actually up to anything.</p><p>He just needed time. Alone. Things would work out, they always did. Maybe he would be able to use Regulus’ old room when he needed some time alone? They hadn’t cleaned it during Harrys last stay and he remembered it to be full of dust and creepy old furniture. No one would look for him in there; if anything, they would expect him to be in Sirius’ room.</p><p>Harry somehow hade a vague feeling of shame and guilt when he imagined himself hiding while people were looking for him. But it seemed more of a shadow of what he would have felt last year than what he actually felt. He had changed. Last summer he would have confided in his friends and found comfort in their company. Now it made him nauseous just thinking about pretending to be the person he was last year.</p><p>Maybe he should talk to someone and things would go back to normal. It couldn’t be so bad, could it? It had been the same every year up until now; he would return from Privet Drive and had to slip back into his Harry-Potter-persona.</p><p>And deep down he knew his friends wouldn’t want him to be alone. They would help him if he asked and they would try their best to understand him. But then again, it wasn’t like they could do anything to make things better – and he really wasn’t in the mood to let them distract him from his thoughts. He didn’t want to be distracted at all, rather the opposite. He wanted to feel sad or angry or <em>anything </em>really. Better than this emptiness.</p><p>And besides, he wasn’t a teenager anymore. Being already sixteen, surely, he was entitled to some amount of privacy? He’d always handled stuff like this by himself – why should he start to change that?</p><p>When he heard the others leave the kitchen and make their way upstairs he lay down again and turned on his side to face the wall. He would just feign sleep and talk to everyone tomorrow.</p><p>His plan was ruined just a few moments later when the door burst open and flew against the wall with a loud BANG. Harry startled so bad there was no way he could pretend to be asleep. The portrait of Sirius mother started screeching and he took a deep breath to calm himself.</p><p>“HARRY!”</p><p>He barely sat upright before Hermiones arms were wrapped around him, nearly suffocating him.</p><p>“Hi ‘Mione”, he mumbled through her bushy hair and managed to grin back at Ron, who was standing near the door and beaming at him.</p><p>“Hi mate – did you just arrive? We were told Dumbledore would drop you off here right before dinner.” Ron seemed to have grown again and had to avoid bumping his head against the chandelier as he made his way over to his own bed.</p><p>“Yeah, I just got here.” Harry felt guilty about lying but decided it would be better this way. “’thought I would put my stuff in here before coming down – less chance of Tonks stumbling over it.”</p><p>He and Ron shared another grin and Harry knew things would be easy with his best friend.</p><p>“Oh Harry, you look awful!” Hermione exclaimed when she pulled back to look him over with a worried frown on her forehead.</p><p>He managed to get away from her hands which had still held on to his shoulders and tried his best to plaster a mock-hurt pout on his face. “Well thank you! Always nice to hear.”</p><p>Her smile didn’t quite reach her eyes and she looked as if she wanted to grab him again. “Seriously, Harry – what happened to you?”</p><p>Two loud CKRACKS saved him from answering, when the twins plopped down on his bed on either side of him.</p><p>“That’s our Hermione– “</p><p>“–always serious– “</p><p>“–and charming– “</p><p>“–telling little Harrykins right what he wants to hear!”</p><p>“Oh, shut up you two.” Hermione rolled her eyes and sat down beside Ron. To Harry, she continued in a whisper so loud everyone could hear it, “dropping out of school really didn’t do them any good – they’re annoying the daylights out of everyone here.”</p><p>“Ah, we feel hurt our dear Hermione!”, exclaimed Fred or George (Harry still couldn’t tell them apart) in a tragic voice. “But you understand us– “</p><p>“–our soulmate in crime, Harry Potter the Benevolent– “</p><p>“–oh, great sponsor of mischief– “</p><p>“–oh wonder– “</p><p>Harry gave one of the twins a kick with his foot and threw the other one a pointed glare. Ron still didn’t know what he had done with the money he’d won from the tournament and he wanted it to stay that way. “Oh, I understand alright. What are you guys doing now anyway? Are you still working on your products?”</p><p>“They have a shop in Diagon”, explained a voice from the door and Harry nearly goggled when he saw Bill standing in the doorway. His hair was still long, and he looked– well Harry wasn’t sure how exactly, but he had to fight the blush that was rising to his cheeks. “You should see it – they are really successful with their business. Mum’s going crazy about it.”</p><p>“Yeah, we have to go to the shop when we go get our things in Diagon!”, agreed Ron enthusiastically. But then Ginny stormed through into the room, shoving Bill inside in the process and slammed the door behind her.</p><p>She was fuming and glaring daggers which even made the twins hunch their shoulders. “We’re not going to Diagon <em>at all.</em> Mums gone crazy! I can’t take it anymore, she– “</p><p>“What? What are you talking about? We have to get our school books and everything!” Ron looked like someone had just told him Christmas would be cancelled this year. And it definitely wasn’t because of the books.</p><p>Just when Ginny wanted to continue her rambling, Bill held up a hand and then started to cast silencing spells. At Harrys questioning look he threw him a nervous smile. “Better this way, believe me. If she catches us talking about the war again we will never hear the end of it.”</p><p>Bill moved over and sat down on Harrys school trunk when another, deafening CRACK let the walls tremble. This time, everyone startled, and that was about the last Harry saw before everything went black.</p><p>“What the hell?”, Ron howled, while Bill shouted at the same time, “Damn! Fred, George, when will you learn to put your blasted experiments on stasis!”</p><p>The twins started to laugh, then there was the dull THUMP of someone toppling to the floor, followed by shattering glass and a panicked hiss.</p><p>Ginny shrieked, and Hermione howled in pain, “Ow! Crookshanks!”</p><p>Meanwhile Harry pressed his back against the wall and couldn’t move. Some part of him knew he was being silly, but he was scared stiff and couldn’t breathe. Everything was black, and he couldn’t see, it was too dark, and he couldn’t fucking <em>see </em>anything, and the air was too dry and dusty, and he couldn’t <em>breathe</em>.</p><p>Harry hit the back of his head against the wall and forced himself to calm down. No one else seemed to panic, so things had to be fine. And he was fine, too. He was at Grimmauld Place and stuff like this was supposed to be <em>normal.</em> Damn it, he needed to get a grip on himself.</p><p>“Just one moment, ladies and gentlemen–</p><p>“–may we present– “</p><p>“–the Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder!”</p><p>“Neutralized by a pinch of powdered Mooncrystal!”</p><p>Something sizzled through the air and the lights went back on. The smell of varnish remover hung heavy in the air with an underlying note of sulphur.</p><p>The twins were only ones who had gotten away unscathed. Ron was blinking rapidly and rubbing at bloodshot eyes, Bill lay sprawled on the floor, the shards of a mug beside him and Ginny was hanging on to Crookshanks and tried to untangle his claws from where they were stuck in Hermiones skirt.</p><p> “Hold still, Ronnikins.” Fred pointed his wand at Ron and muttered a cleaning charm.</p><p>Meanwhile George shook a vial filled with light-blue powder which seemed to emit a faint sizzling sound whenever it glittered. “Doxy-wing-powder is rather nasty stuff. But dead useful.”</p><p>They were grinning over both ears and staring expectantly at everyone, but Ron was the only one who asked, voice full of envy, “Can I get some? That would come in really handy if we had to run from Filch or Snape. Or Malfoy and his crew – imagine their faces!”</p><p>“Sure, little brother– “</p><p>“five Sickles for a hunk of Instant Darkness Powder. The Mooncrystal is not for sale, yet – you can’t imagine the trouble we went through to collect it!”</p><p>“What? Can’t you give me a discount?”</p><p>“And why would we do that?”</p><p>“I’m your brother!”</p><p>“Right – so eight Sickles for the hunk.”</p><p>Meanwhile Hermione was still trying to get free of Crookshanks claws, Bill was cleaning up the shards and Ginny grumbling something about the timing of pranks.</p><p>Harry closed his eyes and tried to relax. His breathing was way too fast, and he was sure his hands would tremble, where he to try and do something.</p><p>He needed to calm down.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Things really couldn’t go on like this. He felt like he was losing it and he just knew, if he were to open his eyes, he would be able to see the black shadows creeping closer.</p><p>Weren’t things supposed to be better now that he was back?</p><p>And they were. They really were. He had his friends around him and the room was full of bickering and laughter and joy and so very <em>different</em> from his nightmares. Or his life at the Dursleys.</p><p>He tried to imagine how Petunia would react to the Instant Darkness Powder. The picture didn’t quite manage to make him smile, but at least it was a good distraction.</p><p>“Harry?” Hermione sounded cautious, as if he were a wild animal. The room had gone quiet, he realized, and he snapped his eyes open. “Are you... Maybe you should eat something?”</p><p>He wanted to snarl, but he managed a strained smile instead. “I’m fine, Hermione, <em>really.</em> Let off, will you?”</p><p>She nodded and sent him a look which made clear she wasn’t convinced and would simply wait until they were alone.</p><p>Harry wanted to hit something.</p><p>“Sooo.... where were we?”, asked Ron and cleared his throat. “Ginny, you wanted to tell us why mum decided we wouldn’t go to Diagon Alley after all?”</p><p>Ginny hesitated only for a second, before she started ranting again. At least she did it without screeching this time. “Tonks just came in to report. There has been another raid today, they destroyed Florean Fortescues shop and Mum thinks it’s way too dangerous for us to go there. As if we were little kids! And she thinks the Death Eaters are just waiting for Harry to show up. She doesn’t trust the Aurors the ministry would send along, says those people are just hoping for a fight so they can arrest someone. Now she wants to owl order everything this year. Since Madam Malkins has this new offer of home visits, she doesn’t see any reason to go to Diagon.”</p><p>“Did anyone...?” Hermione was pale and didn’t finish her question, but she didn’t need to.</p><p>“Die?” Ginny shook her head. “No. Florean and his family had been out while it happened. Thank merlin for that.”</p><p>The twins looked at each other and nodded, their faces unusually grim. “Well kiddos, seems like we’ll have to take our leave.”</p><p>“What?”, Ron squawked and then cleared his throat. He was unusually green around his nose. “You’re not seriously saying you’re going to the shop now, right?”</p><p>Harry wanted to agree with him but shut his mouth when he saw George grin a Snape-worthy grin. “Don’t worry. Our shop is layered with traps against intruders – if they are stupid enough to enter, there will not be much left of them so scrap off of the floor. And we have to see if we can help the other shopkeepers.”</p><p>“If worse comes to worst, we still have emergency-Portkeys”, added Fred.</p><p>They said quick goodbyes and left. Bill decided to go downstairs to ask the other adults for more details and Ginny went to her own room, mumbling about a letter she had to answer, leaving Harry, Ron and Hermione to themselves. Since they weren’t allowed to do magic, they couldn’t ward the door again and hat to speak in hushed tones. But the easy atmosphere was gone anyway. It felt as if the war was already on their doorstep.</p><p>“How bad is it really?”, Harry asked, trying to catch his friends’ eyes.</p><p>“I’m so sorry, Harry, but–” Hermione gulped and looked as if she had to brace herself. “But Professor Dumbledore made us promise to not write anything important. They think our owls are being intercepted.”</p><p>“Oh.” He felt bad seeing how apprehensive Hermione was and realized he must have been quite the prat last year, screaming at them as if it was their fault. And yet, he couldn’t help but still feel a bit betrayed, even if he thought he should know better by now. “Don’t worry, guys, I... I don’t like it, but I <em>do</em> get it... I just don’t understand why Dumbledore insists on me being at Privet Drive for so long where I can do absolutely nothing”, he added and tried to sound not too venomous.</p><p>She shook her head. “I know Harry, and sometimes I wonder, too. But it’s probably for the best; you would just worry and still not be able to do anything. And he must have his reasons.”</p><p>“Like Mum has her reasons to forbid us entering the Order?” Ron had a scowl on his face. “We’re not kids anymore. And this is our war, too.”</p><p>“But she’s worried about you!”, Hermione exclaimed. “Of course, she doesn’t want her kids being put into danger!”</p><p>Harry decided to intercept their bickering while he still could. “So: you wanted to tell me what happened while I was away?”</p><p>The two glared at each other before Ron turned to him. “That’s kind of the problem. No one really knows what You Know Who is up to – well, except taking over Britain. But no one heard anything of him. The Ministry and the Order have their hands full with all the raids, but those are just carried out by low-level Death Eaters. And they don’t have any useful information.”</p><p>“Professor Dumbledore suspects You Know Who is trying to recruit more forces”, added Hermione. “So, the Order sent out messengers to the Werewolves and Giants. But they don’t think it will help much since the Ministry doesn’t want to change the laws for half-humans.”</p><p>That didn’t sound good. Harry remembered Dumbledore telling Fudge to remove the Dementors from Azkaban. “But surely they know that whatever promises Voldemort makes are just lies?”</p><p>“They are considered Dark Creatures for a reason, mate. They <em>want</em> a war because they enjoy fighting and–”, Ron started explaining, before Hermione interrupted him.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter as long as people look down on them and don’t give them any rights.” She threw Ron a haughty look. “They are angry at the wizarding world – they don’t care much about what he promises them, as long as they can get their revenge.”</p><p>“It’s not that simple, Hermione – this may be true for the half-bloods, but not for other creatures”, Ron corrected her annoyed. Harry realized that his friend had actually done some growing up over the summer. “Take the Dementors for example: they will just follow whoever promises them the most souls. So, the Ministry would have to lock them up somehow. But that would require people guarding them with Patronus’ – and the Ministry simply doesn’t have enough Aurors for that.”</p><p>“Well, crap.” The idea of a battle against Death Eaters was bad enough. But Giants and Werewolves and Dementors and who-knew-what-else would be ten times worse. “So, Voldemort really is planning for an all-out war. And we probably won’t stand a chance like this.”</p><p>The others didn’t agree out loud, but their looks spook volumes.</p><p>“Dumbledore has some kind of plan”, Ron started, when Hermione cleared her throat pointedly. “What? He will figure it out anyway.”</p><p>“What will I figure out?”, Harry asked.</p><p>“It shouldn’t be up to him”, she said to no one in particular, looking sad. “But you’re probably right.”</p><p>Ron leaned towards him, staring intently. “Dumbledore is travelling most of the time – we think he’s looking for something. And we overheard the Order talking. It has something do with you. They think it’s something that will help you defeat You-Know-Who.”</p><p>So much for normality. It seemed time to tell the two about the prophecy<em>. </em>Harry took a deep breath and braced himself for the explosion that was sure to follow.</p><p>***</p><p>Later that night, Harry lay on his bed and stared up at the ceiling, unable to sleep.</p><p>He’d told his friends about the prophecy and they had promised not to tell anyone. <em>It could have gone worse</em>, he mused. Hermione had looked at him with pitying eyes and Ron had had an unhealthy greenish colour to his face by the time he’d finished recounting what had happened in Dumbledore’s office. When they tried to promise him their help, he had explained them that it wouldn’t be possible. He had argued that, since the prophecy was about him and Voldemort, it had to be him – and that he would have to do things alone.</p><p>The lie had come more easily to him than he would have thought. Mrs Weasleys words had still rung in his head, together with the knowledge of the raids and the upcoming war. And it wasn’t like he didn’t understand what Mrs Weasley meant. He did somehow always end up right in the middle of the worst kind of trouble (he could easily make a list of people who would agree with that – a <em>long</em> list). And things were bound to get even worse with the prophecy. It truly would be safer for everyone if they stayed away from him.</p><p>Yet he still felt betrayed, somehow. He was probably being childish; it wasn’t as if they’d decided to exclude him from the Weasley family or anything like that. Was it? And was he even part of them to begin with? He knew Ron always said so; but then again, people said a lot of things to make other people feel better.</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>Ron must have heard him. There was the sound of rustling sheets and then he whispered, “Harry? Are you still awake?”</p><p>“Yeah?” It was no use pretending to be asleep. Ron would just ask again and again until he would be awake even if he had been asleep.</p><p>“You know...” There was a pause, as if Ron wasn’t sure how to say whatever he wanted to say. <em>That</em> was unusual. “You know we’re there for you, right? I mean, no matter what Mum says, we’re still going to be with you, whatever happens.”</p><p>Harry cleared his throat. It was strange to have a conversation like this with Ron of all people and he wasn’t sure if he was comfortable about it. “She’s right, you know. Things have gotten way more dangerous. And I don’t want anything to happen to any of you.”</p><p>There was a silence so long, he started to wonder if Ron was angry and ignoring him or had fallen asleep.</p><p>Then Ron sat upright, and Harry could feel his intense stare, even if he could only see his outline in the dark. “I know how dangerous things are now with You Know Who back and all. And Hermione and Ginny know that too. But we will still stand with you. And before you try to stop us: this isn’t really your choice to make.”</p><p>Harry wanted to snort and tell him, that <em>they</em> had never faced Voldemort, just Death Eaters, and that it wasn’t them who had a loony prophecy hanging over their heads. But he couldn’t, because Ron was right. It wasn’t his choice. And he really needed his friends. “I... Thanks.”</p><p>“Good”, Ron nodded and lay back down. “I would hate to get left behind.”</p><p>Neither of them said anything after that and soon after, Rons snores started to fill the room. Harry stayed awake for a bit longer, but for once, he didn’t even think about the shadows.</p><p>***</p><p>Thanks for reading and please tell me what you think :)</p>
