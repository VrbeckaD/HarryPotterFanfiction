    <p>Everyone was in the Great Hall. They had gone through the sorting and gained new members in each house. They also had a new DADA teacher that Harry felt was familiar to him. He was hoping that this year was peaceful instead of life threatening like the previous years.  He wouldn't have thought that this year was going to change everything.  A loud pop was then heard that made everyone jump in fright. Griphook was standing in front of the podium staring hatefully at Dumbledore.</p><p>"Is there something I can help you with Goblin?" asked Dumbledore.</p><p>"I'm here to take care of some business and wish to ask that Lord Harrison Sorin Salazar Lupin-Potter-Black-Prince to come with me." Griphook replied with a sneer.</p><p>   Everyone started whispering about how he was able to apparate into Hogwarts. If everyone were paying attention and looking at the professors they would have seen the confused looks on their new DADA teacher and Snape’s face and the look of rage and horror on the Headmasters, but instead they were gossiping about who the person that the Goblin was talking about.</p><p> Suddenly Dumbledore jumped to his feet with his wand pointed at Griphook. With a demand on the tip of his tongue he stopped when he looked fully into the Goblins eyes.  Griphook looked at the Headmaster with almost a daring look. Already knowing how he would act and hoping that he would try and interfere, just so he can punish the Headmaster for what he had done.  Before Dumbledore and Griphook could start cursing each other Harry stood up and walked to the Goblin.</p><p>"You must have the wrong name Griphook.  It’s Harry James Potter." Spoke Harry</p><p>"How do you know that I was asking for you, Young Lord?"  Replied Griphoook</p><p>"I....I don't know." replied Harry with a confused look at first. "But my gut was telling me that you were talking about me."</p><p>"You would be correct, Young Lord." Griphook said with a smirk directed at Dumbledore.</p><p>"Why do you keep calling me that?" Asked Harry</p><p>"Call you what, Young Lord?' replied Griphook with a smile that freaked everyone in the Great Hall.</p><p>"That. The Young Lord thing." Said Harry</p><p>"It’s because that is what you are." said Griphook</p><p>"I demand you to stop." Demanded Dumbledore before Harry could reply back.</p><p>"You will demand nothing of me." said Griphook calmly.</p><p>Before Dumbledore or anyone else could do or say anything. Griphook grabbed Harrys hand and apparated out of Hogwarts. When the feeling of being squeezed through a tube faded Harry realized that he was in the lobby of Gringotts. Griphook dragged Harry through the lobby and a door in the back without saying anything.  Harry wanted to ask questions but figured that he'll get them wherever Griphook was taking him.</p><p>They stopped in front of a door that Griphook unlocked and pushed Harry through.  When the door closed behind them Griphook automatically went to sit behind his desk staring at the chair across from it. When Harry complied and sat down Griphook started taking out a few things.</p><p>"Griphook what's going on?" Asked Harry</p><p>"We have found some shocking news about you, Young Lord." Griphook replied</p><p>"What news?" Questioned Harry</p><p>"We found out that you’re not who everyone believes you are." said Griphook looking at Harry waiting for some sort of reaction.</p><p>"That’s impossible. I am Harry James Potter." Harry yelled</p><p>"We'll find out soon enough. All you have to do if you want to make sure that you're just Harry James Potter is to take an inheritance test." Griphook Said</p><p>"And what will this inheritance test do?" Harry asked</p><p>"All it will do is show us who you are, who your parents are, and what Lordships you will someday inherit." Griphook informed</p><p>"What do I have to do?" asked Harry</p><p>"All you have to do is prick your finger with this knife and let three drops of blood drop onto this paper." informed Griphook as he hands Harry a silver knife and pointed to the paper in front of them.</p><p>Harry picked up the knife and pricked his middle finger.  He let the blood swell up before letting three drops drop onto the paper.  When the amount reached the paper the cut healed and they both got blinded by a flash of light. Before Harry could see what was on the paper Griphook snatched it up and proceeded to read.</p><p>"Well Young Lord it seems I was right." Griphook replied smugly</p><p>"What does it say?" Demanded Harry</p><p>"Your name is not Harry James Potter and your Mother is definitely not Lily Serah Potter nee Evans." Griphook hedged</p><p>"Griphook stop trying to deflect the question and tell me." angered Harry "And what do you mean that my mom isn't Lily?"</p><p>"Well Young Lord why don't you read for yourself." replied Griphook as he hands Harry the paper.</p>
