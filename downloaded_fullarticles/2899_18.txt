</p><p align="center">Tea Time</p><p align="center">Chapter 1</p><p align="center">by Sapphire Snowflake</p><p align="center">-*-</p><p align="justify">It happened when he least expected it. He didn’t even know when it started or how. All he knew was that the moment Hermione Granger walked into their shared office at the Department of Mysteries on the 21<sup>st</sup> of August of that year with two cups of hot beverage, he felt his heart beat faster than it normally would.</p><p align="justify"> “Black tea with two teaspoons of milk. As thanks for covering for me and doing my work while I’m on vacation.” Hermione said as she placed the cup of tea on his desk with a pleasant smile on her face. For some bizarre reason, his stomach somersaulted, and he felt his cheeks warm up. He only nodded in reply, not trusting his voice at the moment and reached for the cup. <em>It was still warm to touch</em>. <em>Perfect temperature – not too hot, and not too cold, </em>he mused. Hermione quirked her eyebrow at his lack of response but did not comment further on it and returned to her desk. His eyes followed her.</p><p align="justify">He was totally confused by his reaction. At first, he thought that he had indigestion from his breakfast. But then that was already a few hours ago. <em>Maybe it’s because I haven’t seen her in weeks, </em>he mused to himself. <em>Or perhaps I’m just too hungry to think straight.</em> He looked up at the clock and noted that it was already half past noon. He compiled the parchments he’d been working on and stood up to go to lunch. “Granger, aren’t you going to lunch?”</p><p align="justify">“Oh, I just got back from lunch actually. Have a good lunch.”</p><p align="justify"><em>Why is she so nice today?</em> He felt disconcerted at all the smiles she’d been giving him.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>(This is how it ends.)</em>
</p><p align="center">-*-</p><p align="justify">A few days after, Draco found himself in an uncomfortable position during the morning rush at the Ministry’s lifts. The lift was slowly being stuffed by Ministry workers with Hermione Granger’s back getting pushed closer to his front.</p><p align="justify">To say that it was just an <em>uncomfortable </em>situation would be an understatement in Draco’s opinion. Their distance – or lack thereof – was slowly making him go mad as Hermione’s vanilla perfume permeated his nose. <em>She smelled bloody good. </em> </p><p align="justify"><em>Good enough to eat, </em>his mind traitorously added. <em>Fuck. Behave!</em> He scrunched his eyes in agony as he willed another part of him to stay put.</p><p align="justify">“Sorry, Malfoy. We’re almost there.” He heard her say. <em>I’m almost there too,</em> he thought in annoyance. "I hope you’re not suffocating from my hair,” she added jokingly.</p><p align="justify">“It’s fine,” he muttered back. She shifted to make herself more comfortable in the cramped lift and Draco’s hands shot up to her arms and held her in place. “That’s not helping Granger. Just… don’t move. Your nest of a hair is blocking my face.” He added the last part in a sneer to hide his real reason for getting uncomfortable. </p><p align="justify">“Oh sorry.”</p><p align="justify">He couldn’t get out of the lift fast enough when it chimed the seventh floor.</p><p align="center">-*-</p><p align="justify">He was currently ordering his morning tea at the coffee shop a few blocks from the Ministry when someone poked his shoulder.</p><p align="justify">“Good morning.” Hermione beamed at him which he returned with a deep frown.</p><p align="justify">“What are you doing here?” He said exasperatedly. In the three years that they’ve been working together in the Department of Mysteries, never had he seen her go to the coffee shop. He decided that someone up there was messing with his head. Just a weekend ago, he ran into her while jogging at a Muggle park. She was wearing a plain green shirt and black yoga pants that fit snugly on her, leaving a lot of ammunition for Draco’s mind to fantasize. Three days after that, he ran into her inside the apothecary. He never ran into her outside of the Ministry ever since they graduated from Hogwarts.</p><p align="justify">She was <em>everywhere</em>, and it was slowly driving him crazy. The song that was currently playing inside the coffee shop didn’t help things at all.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>(Why do stars fall down from the sky every time you walk by? Just like me, they long to be, close to you.)</em>
</p><p align="justify">“Buying tea,” she replied.</p><p align="justify">“You never buy tea here.”</p><p align="justify">She frowned. “What are you insinuating? And for your information, I go here regularly. I’ve even seen you a handful of times.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m not insinuating anything. I just – I’ve never seen a strand of your hair in the three years I’ve been going here.”</p><p align="justify">“Maybe you just never noticed me,” she shrugged. He didn’t look convinced. “If you don’t want to be seen with me here then you could leave now,” Hermione added coldly after seeing his grimace.</p><p align="justify">“No. Sorry. I – I haven’t had my tea yet, and it’s making me grumpy,” he appeased. “Walk with me to the Ministry?”</p><p align="justify">She sighed, “Okay. Let me get my tea and some scones.”</p><p align="center">-*-</p><p align="justify">
  <em>Maybe you just never noticed me.</em>
</p><p align="justify">Her words reverberated in his mind that night as he lay on his bed. He was trying desperately to sleep but the image of her pear-shaped face, her body in those tight-fitting yoga bottoms keep on popping up whenever he attempted to close his eyes. <em>Why now? I’ve been working and sharing office with her for three years. What changed?</em></p><p align="justify">It was bizarre to say the least. He looked back to the past weeks and then realized that she wasn’t really in the Department of Mysteries last month because she was on vacation. And the unfamiliar butterflies in his stomach and his heated cheeks started the day she returned from said vacation.</p><p align="justify">She was always there, sharing the office with him, working with him or arguing with him. She just became a regular part of his life. Maybe that’s why he never looked closely at her before nor noticed any feelings he might be having until she was gone. And when she came back, and he heard her voice after so long, dare he say that he missed it? That he missed her?</p><p align="justify">He decided to find out tomorrow.</p><p align="center">-*-</p><p align="justify">“Granger.”</p><p align="justify">“Yes?”</p><p align="justify">“Go to dinner with me.”</p><p align="justify">“Are you asking me or imposing on me?” Hermione’s eyes glittered in amusement.</p><p align="justify">Draco grimaced. “Will you go out to dinner with me? Please?”</p><p align="justify">“Are you this… charming to your other conquests?”</p><p align="justify">“I hope that’s not sarcasm I’m hearing.” He pouted, and she laughed at him. “And what made you think you’re a conquest?”</p><p align="justify">“Well, you’re quite a lady’s man, or so I’ve heard?” She raised her eyebrow at him.</p><p align="justify">He scoffed. “I’ve been working longer hours than you. And that’s a record in itself. When am I supposed to fit the time to shag witches in my schedule? Besides, you’d hex me to the moon and back if I mess with you.”</p><p align="justify">“Too right.”</p><p align="justify">“So?”</p><p align="justify">“So, what?”</p><p align="justify">“Are you going to dinner with me?” He uncharacteristically shifted on his feet. She was dragging this on too long for his liking.</p><p align="justify">“Are you asking me on a date?”</p><p align="justify">“Are you really the brightest witch of our age?”</p><p align="justify">“Touché. And uhm, no. Sorry.”</p><p align="justify">“Why not?” He wasn’t the least bit surprised with her response. They’ve been co-workers and office mates for so long, but their relationship was purely professional. True enough there were moments wherein they interacted almost as if they were friends; however, she didn’t seem repulsed with him at all or so he thought.</p><p align="justify">“I just can’t. I’m sorry.”</p><p align="justify">“You won’t even ask why I asked you out? You’re that uninterested in me?”</p><p align="justify">She gave him a sheepish smile. “To be fair, I haven’t really thought of going out with anyone.” She made a big show of looking at her wristwatch. “Oops, would you look at the time. Gotta go to Grimmauld’s for dinner. Bye Malfoy.”</p><p align="justify">He stared at the green flames that engulfed her and sighed.</p><p align="center">-*-</p><p align="justify">Giving up had never been in Draco’s vocabulary. Malfoys were known to be very persistent, and he was used to getting what he wanted. Seeing as Hermione did not outright reject him, he just needed to show how likeable he could be. Besides, it was only one date. He just needed to ascertain certain feelings he might be having towards her.</p><p align="justify">He placed a cup of jasmine tea on her desk a week after.<em> So I won’t seem too annoying</em>, he reasoned to himself.</p><p align="justify">Hermione looked up from the parchment she was scribbling on. “Yes?”</p><p align="justify">“For you. In return for the cup of tea the other day.”</p><p align="justify">She looked suspiciously at him. “I hope this isn’t some follow up on what happened last week.”</p><p align="justify"><em>Tch. She’s too smart for her own good.</em> He flicked her forehead and gave her a charming smile in reply. “Just accept it, Granger. I did not spike it with anything, I promise you.” He took a sip to show her that it was safe to drink and then handed it to her. Hermione accepted it, but she was still wary as she took a sip. “How did you know my favorite tea?”</p><p align="justify">“Let’s just say I’m pretty observant.” He turned and walked towards the door. Just as he was about to exit, he called out, “Thanks for the indirect kiss.” He winked at her.</p><p align="justify">Hermione gaped in surprise.</p><p align="center">-*-</p><p align="justify">His not-so-subtle attempts at flirting and wooing her continued for the rest of the week. At first it was just simple intimations: a hand at the small of her back as they exited the lifts on Tuesday, a cup of peppermint tea late Wednesday night when they stayed after office hours due to a very sensitive cursed object, his thumb swiping crumbs of the sandwich they ate during a working lunch on Thursday as he gave her a small smile before turning back to his own meal, and a warm green wool scarf he wrapped around her neck yesterday when she forgot to bring hers.</p><p align="justify">It was Saturday today – supposedly a non-working day – and there was a bouquet of red flowers on her desk at the Department of Ministries. She looked around but not one soul was on sight. “How did he even know I’d be here?” She wondered aloud before scoffing at herself. <em>But of course, you’ve been working with him for three years already. He’s probably known for a while just how much of a workaholic I am.</em></p><p align="justify">She closed her eyes as she took a whiff of the wonderful flowers Draco Malfoy sent her.</p><p align="center">-*-</p><p align="justify">He thrust a bouquet of flowers in her face when she opened the door to their office early Monday morning. Last Saturday, she decided to put to a stop to whatever it was he was doing. She did not even try to read the note attached to the flowers he sent.</p><p align="justify">“For you.” Draco’s voice quivered a bit. He felt a bit unnerved at her grimace “I thought you like lilies,” Draco added upon seeing her reaction.</p><p align="justify">“Well… yes. They’re my favorite.”</p><p align="justify">He frowned when she didn’t look pleased. Lowering his hand with a sigh, he ran his hand through his hair and asked, “Is it because I’m the one giving them to you?”</p><p align="justify">“No. I – Draco, it’s… Why are you doing this?”</p><p align="justify">He glowered at her question denoting how stupid he thought the question was. “What? Giving you flowers? Asking you on dates?”</p><p align="justify">Hermione replied after a beat, “Yes.”</p><p align="justify">“Why do you think?” She did not reply. “Do I have to spell it out to you? I like you. But you should already know that seeing as how persistent I am with courting you.”</p><p align="justify">“I’m just not ready to go into any relationships right now.”</p><p align="justify">“With me? Or in general?”</p><p align="justify">“In general.”</p><p align="justify">Draco sighed, “I see. Will you still accept the flowers? It’ll be a waste to throw them.”</p><p align="justify">She bit her lip and hesitated, “I suppose… Thank you. They’re gorgeous.”</p><p align="justify"> There was a pause before he asked, “We’re friends now though Granger?”</p><p align="justify">She scrunched her eyebrows in confusion. “We’ve been working together for years. I did consider you as a friend even before this.”</p><p align="justify">“Brilliant!” He beamed at her.</p><p align="justify">His change in demeanor was causing her whiplash. “Wait, what is?”</p><p align="justify">He gave her a charming smile. “Being friends is just a few steps away from being lovers.”</p><p align="justify">“Malfoy… I told you. I wanted to focus on my career first.” She gave him a disapproving glare.</p><p align="justify">“I’ll wait then.”</p><p align="justify">“You might be waiting a long time.”</p><p align="justify">“You’re worth it.”</p><p align="center">-*-</p><p align="justify">She wasn’t downright beautiful like the Greengrass sisters. Her beauty was subtler, the type that you would only be able to see after taking a second look. He was on his sixth look now and he was slowly being drawn in with no way out.</p><p align="justify">He started to wonder if he should pull out now. What if she didn’t really see him as dating material at all and was just too polite to turn him down outright? Is it still worth it to pursue her only to be let down in the end?</p><p align="justify"> “Malfoy?”</p><p align="justify">He wasn’t in love – it was too soon for that. However, he’s now one hundred per cent sure that he was attracted to her. For some reason, he could now see the gold flecks in her eyes more clearly. His eyes drifted to her hair, and he suppressed the urge to run his fingers through the wild tresses that usually bugged him before. It looked wild and sexy and he had the urge to pull it as he –</p><p align="justify">“Malfoy! Are you even listening to me?”</p><p align="justify">He blinked a few times. “Sorry, what was it again?”</p><p align="justify">“I asked if you have the cipher for the Rosetta Stone.”</p><p align="justify">His eyes flew to her pursed lips. “Uhh huh.”</p><p align="justify">“Are you okay?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, sorry. I have a lot on my mind. Here it is.” He was in deep trouble. If only Hermione would cave in, everything will be alright. <em>I need to up my game, </em>he thought.</p><p align="center">-*-</p><p align="justify">He threw a surprise birthday dinner for her with all her friends. They were in the middle of a project and that meant long hours into the morning working and having no time for a birthday party. Draco watched Hermione trudge through their work and sprint her way over dozens of books.</p><p align="justify">“Do you want some tea or coffee?” Draco asked nonchalantly.</p><p align="justify">“Oh, uh, tea would be great. Thank you.”</p><p align="justify">Draco stood up and went to the Ministry’s cafeteria. Over the years, he had formed a professional relationship with Harry. He was all too happy to give his best friend a birthday surprise, but not after thoroughly interrogating Draco as to what his intentions were towards Hermione.</p><p align="justify">They had gathered most of her other friends there, as well as some of the Unspeakables working alongside Draco and Hermione. “Do you really think she’ll go down here?” Harry asked him as he settled himself behind one of the counters inside.</p><p align="justify">“Worst case scenario, she thinks I skived off work, but I’ve never done that before. More than likely, she’ll think someone intercepted me down there with evil intentions and she’ll decide to investigate.” Draco rationalized confidently. Deep inside though, he couldn’t help but question whether Hermione cared about him enough to do just that.</p><p align="justify">“Someone’s coming! Turn all the lights off, quick!” Ginny gasped. Everyone went back to their hiding positions. A few minutes later, they heard Hermione call out, “Hello? Draco, where are you?” As soon as she turned on the lights, they screamed, “Surprise!”</p><p align="justify">She stood in the cafeteria’s entrance with a dumbfounded look on her face. She looked around and could feel herself tear up. “Oh my god. You guys.”</p><p align="justify">Harry and Ron came up to her with a cake as everyone around started singing her a happy birthday.</p><p align="justify">“We know you’re a workaholic who would try to move her birthday to the weekends. We decided to bring it to you instead,” Ron proudly stated as he motioned for her to blow out the candles. She grinned at everyone. “You guys didn’t have to. Thank you.”</p><p align="justify">Later on, when all the cake was gone, Harry whispered to her, “It was all Malfoy’s idea, you know.” He gave her a teasing grin as he nudged her and subtly pointed at Draco. Her eyes drifted to him, and he met her gaze and mouthed a <em>Happy birthday </em>to her and gave a smile.</p><p align="justify">Her stomach fluttered both from warm fuzzy feelings and dread.</p><p align="justify">
  <em>(This is how they start.)</em>
</p><p align="center">-*-</p><p align="justify">“Draco?”</p><p align="justify">“Hmm…” The sound of a quill scratching across the parchment stopped as he looked at Hermione from her desk a few feet away from his.</p><p align="justify">She tapped her fingers on her desk. After heaving a sigh, she uttered, “You need to stop.”</p><p align="justify">“Stop what?” He feigned ignorance and returned to writing his report.</p><p align="justify">“Don’t… don’t wait for me anymore. I won’t be entering any relationship anytime until my next lifetime.”</p><p align="justify">His jaw tightened as his quill skidded to a stop. He tapped his quill a few times before asking in a tight voice, “Is it me?”</p><p align="justify">“…No.”</p><p align="justify">A few minutes passed as Draco tried to reign in the sudden bubbling anger inside him to no avail. He hated being lied to. Glaring at her, he spat, “Just tell the fucking truth Granger. If you don’t want me, just say so. Give me some bloody closure so I can move on from being a bleeding Hufflepuff where you’re concerned.”</p><p align="justify">She winced. “It’s really not your fault. It’s… I’ll be gone soon.”</p><p align="justify">“Where are you going?”</p><p align="justify">Breathing deeply, she mumbled, “The Veil.”</p><p align="justify">A few seconds ticked by. “I don’t get it. The Veil is just next door.”</p><p align="justify">Deciding that being blunt is the best approach, she blurted out, “I’m dying Draco.”</p><p align="justify">“…Nice one Granger. You almost had me there.”</p><p align="justify">She gave him a pained smile. “If only it was a joke.”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t understand.”</p><p align="justify">She exhaled loudly and braced herself. “When I first got here, I came into contact with a cursed object. I was… arrogant to say the least. I thought I could remove the curse as long as I researched enough. I made a miscalculation and… well… all the previous owners vanished in thin air after a few years.”</p><p align="justify">“You’re saying that…”</p><p align="justify">“Yes, I was cursed. And one day, I’ll also cease to exist. So you should stop whatever it is you are doing. There’s no future with me.”</p><p align="center">-*-</p><p align="justify">He was staring at the fire crackling in the fireplace with a glass of firewhiskey in his hand when her mother entered his study and primly seated herself at the other end of the settee. She summoned the decanter of elvish wine and poured some for herself. A few minutes passed before she spoke, “Is everything alright Draco?”</p><p align="justify">“I’m quite well, Mother. You?”</p><p align="justify">“Mmmm… I couldn’t help but notice how restless you are lately.”</p><p align="justify">“Me? I’m perfectly fine. I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p align="justify">“I’ve raised you, Draco. I know when you’re fine or not. You couldn’t lie to me even if you tried.”</p><p align="justify">He finished his firewhisky in one swig. “I feel like I’m at a crossroad, when in fact I’m pretty decided on what to do. I –”</p><p align="justify">“You wanted to go the other way,” his mother interjected.</p><p align="justify">He nodded before pouring himself more firewhisky. “If… If you know something’s pointless. If you know it would not go anywhere, would you still pursue it?”</p><p align="justify">“It depends,” she said delicately. “Is it worth it?”</p><p align="justify">
  <em>(Hermione was laughing with Harry as he nudged her to his direction. Her cheeks stained red as she met his eyes and responded back with a Thank you to him as she put some of her curls behind her ear.)</em>
</p><p align="justify">He opened his eyes and looked at his mother. “Yes."</p><p align="justify">Narcissa gently said, “My dragon, you don’t have to worry about what I would think. It wouldn’t matter to me what blood runs through her veins as long as your happy.”</p><p align="justify">He was surprised at his mother’s intuition. Whatever gave the impression that it was about a woman? Deciding not to dwell on that, he replied, “No, Mother. It’s… It’s not just about that.”</p><p align="justify">“What’s stopping you then?”</p><p align="justify">“Mother, it won’t last. Whatever it is between us won’t last. I would probably get my heart broken if I decided to pursue her.”</p><p align="justify">“Does she not like you?”</p><p align="justify">“It’s – ” he debated on whether to tell his mother about the whole situation or not and decided on the former. “She’s... leaving Britain. In the future.”</p><p align="justify">“I see.” She swished the wine in her glass before putting it down. Reaching out for her son’s hand, she said sincerely, “Draco, as your mother, I honestly would not like for you to pursue her. I don’t want you to get hurt in any form.” She looked straight into his troubled eyes. “But you’re already in love with her, are you not?”</p>
