    <p>They were dragging her across the floor, her feet limply scraping behind her.  She feebly tried to lift her head, but a sharp pain shot through her, so she let it fall on her chest again. A murmur was coming from all around her. The air was damp and smelled like mold.</p><p>They threw her on the ground when they stopped, and she hit her head on the stones. A small whimper escaped her lips, before she pressed them shut. Slowly, she managed to get her hands beneath her and lift herself up, just a little. She raised her head, ignoring the pain throbbing in her temples, and looked at Him for the first time.</p><p>Voldemort was even worse looking in person, than Hermione could ever picture from Harry’s description, but no words were able to portray the malice and evil coming from his eyes. The red snake-like pupils reminded her of Crookshanks for a second; that thought was gone the very next. He never had this lust for pain in his eyes. Hermione could not suppress a shiver that ran down her spine. </p><p>“Well, if it isn’t our favorite mudblood.” His voice was raspy, yet it had almost a silky quality to it, like a cloth draped over the sharpest razor, trying to hide its deadliness. </p><p>“I will never give Harry to you,” Hermione spat out, proud that her voice didn’t waiver. There was a small chance she would die before they managed to break her; she doubted they would let her. </p><p>Voldemort only let out a small laugh. It felt wrong, crawling up her back.</p><p>“I don’t want you to give me young mister Potter,” he drawled, managing to surprise her. His next words, however, stopped her heart once again. “No, my little creature, I have other plans for you.”</p><p>She felt her palms get sweaty, the hair on her arms stood up. She frantically looked around herself, searching for something. What it was, she didn’t know.<br/>
Maybe a way out of a situation with no escape.</p><p>“Miss Granger deserves some attention, I believe.” Voldemort’s voice made her look at him sharply. One corner of his mouth was raised. Somehow, this scared Hermione more than his words. </p><p>There was a movement all around her and in the next moment she was surrounded by tall dark figures, with wolfish smiles and a sadistic gleam in their eyes. The small hope some of them might have some mercy died at the sight. The first one to raise his wand stared right into her eyes. When he almost lovingly said the incantation, she searched his gaze for anything human. As the bones in her arms shattered and the pain hit her, she didn’t turn away. He didn’t move a muscle.</p><p>It didn’t take long before she started screaming. </p><p>#####</p><p>She came to her senses in pain. First, she felt cold stones digging into her back, next a loud sound of dripping water sent a spike through her brain. And as if that had been the dam that broke, her entire body screamed with agony. She moaned and tried to curl into herself, only to choke out a broken yell, when the shattered bones in her arms moved and she felt them poke her muscles, and the cuts on her legs opened and lazily gushed out blood. The burning stripes winded across her torso made her breathing shallow and labored. She tried to stay as still as she could and looked around to assess her surroundings. Without moving her head, she couldn’t really see much, only the stone walls and a barely visible ceiling.</p><p>Every part of her hurt, but she managed to slightly turn her head without aggravating her injuries further and spotted a pitcher near her on the floor. For a moment she contemplated her options, but her rational mind won over the need to avoid any pain caused by moving. She knew she needed water, if only because of the blood loss that made her feel weak. The trickles of blood running down her legs were a cause for concern, but her entire body was one big wound, so maybe everything was a cause for concern. A soft sigh left her lips, when she realized her arms were useless to her and she would have to find a way to get up, crawl over to the jug and drink some of the water without using them. </p><p>Hermione was by no means a coward, but she found herself stalling, not wanting to move and bring about the pain she knew was going to come. After a few more moments, she steeled herself and started to raise herself up from the floor. Almost immediately she gasped as wounds on her back she didn’t know about stretched and send new waves of pain flooding her system. She fell back on the ground and tears welled up in her eyes. This would be even harder than she had predicted. </p><p>Hermione always had strong will. This was evident from her early childhood and throughout her school career. Back in muggle school, it chased away every potential friend and even at Hogwarts, where she finally found true friends, it secluded her from most of her peers. Now though, it would probably be the thing that would keep her alive. So, Hermione didn’t let the determination slip from her as she slowly rolled over to her side, quiet sobs leaving her lips at the burning pain, and she pulled her legs under herself, before gradually lifting her upper body. She felt blood dripping from her back and thigs, soaking up in her tattered clothes.</p><p> Her arms were the biggest concern, though. She could even see the fragments of her bones moving beneath her skin, despite her careful efforts not to upset them. But she didn’t have her wand and even though she had tried some wandless magic, she could barely do an Accio, and complex spells such as those to repair or at least align the bones in her arms? Required complicated hand gestures to properly channel the magic. She was in no state to perform any sort of a spell. Having concluded, that there was nothing she could do about her arms, she turned her focus to the water sitting next to her. The fact that it could very well be poisoned crossed her mind, but she was acutely aware of the dizziness that was starting to take over her head, caused by the blood loss, so she had little in the matter of a choice. Either she would risk it and perhaps die of poisoning, or she didn’t even take a sip and surely die of dehydration and her injuries. She refused the possibility that the water may contain anything that would cause her more agony. </p><p>“Get it the fuck together, Granger,” she whispered through clenched teeth. Slightly groaning, she leaned forward, supporting herself with her knees beneath her and lowered her head to the pitcher. She was careful not to touch her arms on the floor, gingerly holding them as still as possible. </p><p>The first sip was like heaven. The second made her close her eyes in faint bliss. After a few more sips, she forced herself to stop. She didn’t know how long this pitcher would have to last for. It would be foolish to drink it all now and then thirst later. Feeling slightly better, Hermione made her way on her knees to one of the walls on her side. Slowly and with a lot of muttered curses, now that she completely stopped caring if anyone was listening, she laid on the floor, her arms gently placed next to her. Putting them there involved more swearing.  </p><p>She couldn’t completely relax, not with the pain constantly pumping through her body, knowing she was held by an insane wizard who wished to eliminate all her kind. But all her injuries took a tool on her and Hermione was exhausted. So, she closed her eyes and soon fell into restless sleep. </p><p>###</p><p>When Hermione woke up again, she was only slightly refreshed. She moved her hands without thinking, wanting to rub her arms in the chill of her cell. Instantly she cringed and forcefully stilled her movement, expecting terrible pain. She was understandably confused and scared when all she felt was an ache- unpleasant one- but no longer agonizing. </p><p>Did they do something to her while she was sleeping? Or did she sleep longer than she thought? That notion was quickly dismissed. The bones would have healed wrong, had they healed on their own. But as she examined her arms, it seemed that they were properly aligned and in late stage of healing. She should avoid using them, but perhaps her arms wouldn’t be mangled and useless in the end. </p><p>Hermione snorted at the thought. The only end she would see here would be her death or maybe complete madness brought by her torturers.</p><p>Still wondering which option would come sooner, she slowly rose up on her knees, taking notes of every injury. From what she could see beneath her ruined t-shirt, the wells on her torso were a bit closed and the cuts on her legs no longer bled. Her breathing was also easier. However, she noticed that apart from her arms, most of her wounds were only closed in a way several days of rest would cause. It didn’t sit right with her. Why heal her arms and not the rest? What were they trying to accomplish? </p><p>Swallowing with a difficulty, she turned her head towards the pitcher, still innocently sitting in the middle of the room. The water she had left there before was still there and Hermione felt her thirst. She crawled towards it and drank deeply. A nagging voice in her head told her not to waste the water, to save some for later, but her parched throat and deep exhaustion pushed the voice to the back of her mind. Only when she felt her stomach protest the sudden fullness did she stop. </p><p>With a sigh, she returned to her wall, leaning against it. She hissed when the cold stones scraped against the wounds on her back, but soon even that pain turned into only one of the numerous aches in her body. </p><p>Eyes trained on the wooden doors leading to her cell, Hermione settled to wait for her tormentors to return. </p><p>####</p><p>After a several more hours, Hermione snapped awake. Nobody came in for a long time, so Hermione managed to doze off. Upon waking up, she checked her injures again. Her arms barely hurt anymore and the bigger cuts on her legs seemed to be a bit more healed than before. Hermione knew that it required extreme skill to be able to heal somebody without seeing them and she didn’t think any Death Eaters would bother with her. Brain working at a renewed speed, she came to the only possible conclusion; there was some sort of a healing potion in the water. She immediately rushed to the pitcher, only to find it refilled. She stopped in her tracks and just stared at it for a few moments. Would they poison her after healing her? She wouldn’t put it past them, really, but her hopeful side won the argument raging in her head and once Hermione decided something, she went through with it. So, she raised the pitcher from the floor, marveling at the painless feeling in her arms and drank deeply. Almost at once, after she washed down the foul taste in her mouth, she noticed the water now tasted different. Where before it had a tang of freshness, it was now just a regular water left outside.  </p><p>“There’s no more potion,” she whispered when the realization hit her. What did that mean for her? And why did they heal her in the first place?</p><p>She looked down to see how much water there was left. She drank barely a third of it, but who was she to say if they would refill it again, or how long before they did. She put it back down and returned to her spot by the wall. She curled up into herself, trying to keep in some additional warmth. The wounds on her back once again protested being pressed against the cold, harsh stones, but Hemione paid it no mind. Either they would come for her and kill her, or she would die right there in the cell, so what did some discomfort matter?</p><p> Some time passed after that. Hermione slept a few times, always restlessly and for short periods of time, as all her injuries didn’t really let her relax, as well as every other part of her predicament. When the need arose, she found a small hole in the far corner of her cell. Its purpose was very clear. </p><p>She always drank only small portions of the water, but without any food, her stomach soon started cramping. At first, it was unrecognizable from the pain of the welts across her chest, but quickly it became one of the things she just couldn’t ignore. She was also worried about infection getting into her open wounds; it turned out that rightly so.  </p><p>The first to get inflamed were the cuts on her back, probably from the way she often pressed them into the stone when she was alert. Next came the cuts on her side, the ones she slept on. Pretty soon at least half of her wounds was red and oozing. At the beginning, she tried to clean them with water, but since it didn’t seem to be helping, she soon stopped wasting what little water she had left. </p><p>It was obvious they weren’t trying to heal her anymore; for one, the water no longer had that peculiar taste as before. Secondly, she had read enough about healing to know that any sort of a healing potion would first attack the infection that was slowly taking apart her body.</p><p>Hemione was laying on her stomach, the one place where she had the least inflamed wounds and she was staring at the opposite wall. Her breathing was very slow due to her body losing the battle to live. She once thought her will would help her survive. Now she knew nothing would help her. They probably only healed her to prolong her suffering, so she wouldn’t die on them too quickly. She even lost her hope that maybe someone would come and save her. Maybe the Order or Dumbledore. Or Harry. She almost couldn’t remember what her best friend looked like. After a few feeble tries to recall, she gave up. </p><p>“I love you, Mum. I love you, Dad,” she whispered, her voice so weak it wasn’t even audible in the quiet of her cell. “I love you, Harry. I love you, Ron. I’m going to miss all of you.” The effort to talk took all the remaining energy from her and Hermione let her eyelids fall shut with a shuddering breath. </p><p>The door opened and two black figures stepped into the cell.</p>
