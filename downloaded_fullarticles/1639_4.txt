    <p>This side of paradise</p><p>
  <em> Doodsxd </em>
</p><p> </p><h1>Chapter one</h1><p>THE cold, humid Irish wind blew on her face and hair mercilessly. Her whole view was muddy green and grey -  from the sky to the stormy ocean to the dying leaves beneath her feet. There was little to do on a place such as this besides contemplation. Luckily, it was exactly what she needed.</p><p>“Tea is served, Miss.” Mrs. Miller informed her while wiping her reddened hands on her untinged apron. The bed and breakfast owner and her husband were quiet people, but kind, nonetheless. She nodded her head in acknowledgement; watched the older woman make her way back into the house.</p><p>Hermione didn't want to go on. It felt like the weather had taken pity on her and decided to compliment her inner landscape. It's felt comfortable. More than her own home had felt in the last six years.</p><p>“You look like someone in need of a break.” Mr. Miller’s sickly voice brought her back from her inner musings.</p><p>Hermione’s lips curled gently upwards. “Be honest. I look like someone in hiding.” She called on him.</p><p>The man’s laughter turned into coughing briefly. “Oh, yes. That too.” He shifted uncomfortably on his seat. She wished she could stop noticing things, but by then it was a lifelong habit from constantly being in danger. Perks of her choices, she pondered. “We don’t mean to pry.”</p><p>Hermione shook her head. “It’s fine. Curiosity is human nature.” not that she knew anything about that. Hermione abided by the rules, ditching them only for another, superior rule: loyalty.</p><p>Being curious implied being alive. She’d seen too much for that. For a woman in her thirties, she felt older than Flamel.</p><p> </p><p align="right">
  <em> “It seems like you’re not even here.” Ronald put his hair back with his hands in a frustrated gesture. He had being doing that a lot. She vaguely wondered if being frustrated with her was responsible for the growing bald spots on his forehead. “See? You’re not even listening. It’s like you shut yourself inside your head and I’ve been living alone for the past two years.” </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <em> “I’ve been busy.” They said if you say a word multiple times in a row it loses its meaning. Busy. Busy. Busy. Her life was busy, she had responsibilities, an ever growing list of things she had to get done so the British Wizarding World runs smoothly. That was her doing. Why couldn’t he understand that? </em>
</p><p align="right">
  <em> “no, Hermione, that’s the thing.” He almost laughs. “You don’t avoid me because you’re busy. You’re busy because you avoid me.” </em>
</p><p align="right"> </p><p>“Lady, you don’t need to tell him anything.” Mrs. Miller tells her, tray wobbly in her hands, settling down the slightly burned tea.</p><p>Hermione sat down and thanked the woman for the beverage.</p><p>“It’s fine.” She put her hair behind her ear. Another thing magic tamed for her. “It’s no big deal. Just working through some… marital problems, that’s all. needed a break.” She answered, unable to lie out of politeness.</p><p>She almost couldn’t recognize the face that looked back at her in the mirror, these days.</p><p>“Oh.” The woman, who probably never had those kinds of problem in her whole life, muttered. “We understand.”</p><p>They didn’t. “It’s fine.” She dismissed. It wasn’t. She couldn’t breathe again.</p><p>“You are a wonderful woman.” Green eyes sparkled at her. It was a shade unfamiliar to her lately. “I’m sure he’s going to see the wrong in his ways soon and you two are going to be together again, stronger than ever.”</p><p>She offered the woman a yellow smile and a sip of her tea.</p><p>She was a desert land. She had nothing else to give.</p><p> </p>
