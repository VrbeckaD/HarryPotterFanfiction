    <p>Flickering rays of sunlight come in through the blinds to his room. It must be early: six, seven at most. Albus lies quietly beside him, still asleep—no wonder really, considering they went to bed past two a.m. Scorp’s sheets cover his thighs. It’s not like it matters, not after last night. Scorp did get rather well acquainted with them, wrapped around his hips…</p><p>He’d spent over a year half-panicked Al might hate him, yet seeing Al standing at his door yesterday kind of sent all that to hell. Scorp tries, vainly, to pause the smile curling up his lips. He shouldn’t be anywhere near this pleased, but he is. It turns out Al doesn’t hate him, can’t hate him. Indeed, he’s still here. That <em>has</em> to count for something.</p><p>Scorp runs a hand up Albus’ back. And to think that a few hours ago, he would have gladly given half his fortune and more to be able to have this again: Albus, back with him. Lying next to Scorpius, Al’s skin is perfect gold against dark bedding, naked; nipples pink and erect, a tempting contrast to the sweet paleness of his own. It feels warm under his palm, more alive than anything he’s touched. Scorp almost wants to lick it, taste it to make sure that this is Al here, not someone else. But then Albus shivers a little. His eyelids flutter.</p><p>He’s awake.</p><p>“Hey,” Al says. His eyes shine green, as bright as ever.</p><p>“Hey,” Scorp says too, brushing Al’s fringe out of his face. He’s lost, he’s so freaking lost he can’t even see north anymore. All he sees here is Albus. He kisses him lightly on the cheek; doesn’t know what’s good, what’s not. It’s been such a long time since they’ve done any of this. It’s all new to him, or at least relatively new. Al gasps, however, when Scorp’s mouth moves down to his neck, and that’s encouraging. Encouraging enough that the next kiss is longer, far more intent—lips on lips, slow and careful, shy and tender, like leaving innocence behind. Scorpius catches himself thinking, <em>It</em><em>’s not like either of us can have much left of that anyway</em>.</p><p>Then, the door bangs open and Al gasps again. Only this time, it’s not the good kind, rather the panicked kind. Scorpius doesn’t even get to turn around. A hand closes on his hair, pulling hard. The blunt point of a wand digs into one of his shoulders.</p><p>He tries to free himself, to reach for his wand.</p><p>But it’s too late. It’s too far. The room goes black around him, ceases to exist. There’s only darkness, unending darkness. Darkness and Al’s green eyes in it, staring right into his heart.</p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>He’s tied to a chair when he wakes up. One side of his head hurts quite a lot—bruised, he’s guessing. Either that or they cleaned up prettily, what with the amount of blood vessels carry up there. Head injuries bleed a great deal, that much he remembers reading back when the world was a nice place still worth living in. Pretty different from what it is these days.</p><p>“Al?”</p><p>No sound. No motion, no…</p><p>Absolutely nothing.</p><p>His chair clatters horribly as Scorp tries to turn it, his own breathing coming out quite heavy. It’s hard to move when his legs are tied to it. Behind his back, something zips his wrists together. It’s made of a soft material and feels warm against his skin. Plastic, rather than metal. He’s still in his pyjama bottoms, which sadly means his wand is not on him. There’s a blurry shape behind him though, too close to tell who it is. Scorp’s guess is it might be Al, only he seems to be dressed now, and that’s a bit odd, isn’t it? He certainly wasn’t, back upstairs.</p><p>“That bloke you fried earlier with your spell…” a woman’s voice comes through the door, spewing tears and murder.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” a man says. “I… Look, he came out of nowhere! His wand was pointed at—” There’s a loud thud out there. A slap, a punch, <em>something</em>.</p><p>“He was my friend, you twat!” the woman screams.</p><p>It sounds like they’re fighting. That may be good for him and Al—at least it should buy them some time. If their luck holds, perhaps it’ll be enough to free themselves and walk out of here.</p><p>“Albus?!” he tries again. There’s a groaned answer this time, definitely in Albus’ voice. If one forgets last night, it’s been longer than a year since Scorp last heard his voice. Admittedly he’s forgotten much—all he had left were his own memories—yet the exact ring of Al’s tone is still etched into them, like a firebrand snatched from glowing coal. “Al, are you all right?”</p><p>“I think so…”</p><p>“What do you think they want?”</p><p>“How… should I… know?” Al pants, clearly struggling with his bonds. “This is <em>your </em>house, not mine.”</p><p>Scorp can almost taste Al’s resentment in his words. He hasn’t mentioned it, Al hasn’t either, but they used to live together. They don’t anymore. And Al… honestly, if this is anything to go by, Al doesn’t seem too pleased about it. Scorp is nearly stumbling on the edge of an apology, ready to say something, anything that might wear this down. But then the door opens fully. Three people come in, all wearing masks.</p><p>“You can call me Mr Fox,” one of them grunts. Scorpius chokes down a nervous laugh. It’s fitting, oddly enough, since that’s what his mask is: the head of a fox.</p><p>“What do you want?” It turns out asking isn’t exactly the best of choices. All Scorpius gets from it is a sock to the jaw, from the nice lady standing with them. The nice lady who’s actually not too nice, but rather coarse. He’s thinking she might have been the one who dragged him downstairs—no wonder all his limbs ache! Nearly as much as they did when Al’s brother broke his arm back in second year, and Madam Pomfrey made him swallow a whole bowl of Skele-Gro.</p><p>“Speak only when spoken to,” Mr Fox spits. Scorpius spits, too: blood at his feet. Orders, as if he’s here to follow them. In his own house.</p><p>“I can’t find anything worth taking here,” the third one says, the one with the mouse-shaped mask. He sounds far younger than the other two, barely a kid.</p><p>“There’s no need to rush. We’ll ask him later, but let’s eat first,” says the woman. “This bloke has a fucking kitchen-garden, can you believe that?”</p><p>“We shouldn’t linger here too long,” the fox-faced one says. “Who knows if—”</p><p>“Oh, come on! We haven’t eaten properly in days…”</p><p>“Besides—” the woman pulls Scorp’s head back painfully, her hand tearing hard on his hair, “—it’s not like this one here can go anywhere.”</p><p>Grinning up at her is easy, only now it holds a daring edge of ill-will. Whatever it is they’re doing here, Scorp will make sure they pay for it. Gladly and dearly.</p><p>“Okay. Alright,” Mr Fox finally says after quite a bit of thinking. “You go first, I’ll be there in five.”</p><p>The metal door to Scorp’s lab clanks closed behind their backs. Mr Fox is still here, watching Al. His hand, Scorp guesses by the angle, must be touching Albus’ neck, caressing it or…</p><p>It can’t be strangling him. Al is too quiet; Fox’s muscles look far too lax for strength to be present in whatever he’s doing. He must be doing <em>something </em>though, there’s no doubt. An odd possessiveness wakes up inside Scorpius, one he wasn’t even aware of having. It rather stuns him when he hears himself grumbling, “You touch him, I’ll make sure to tear you apart before you get to leave this place.”</p><p>Fox’s hand drops. Scorp can’t help being glad, a small cheer of triumph building up inside him. He’s partly ashamed Al saw that too, but one can’t have it all.</p><p>“Tell me where you keep them,” Mr Fox asks.</p><p>“Where I keep what?” Scorp drawls. “You might need to be a bit more specific here. I have no clue what you’re looking for.”</p><p>“You know what I’m looking for. I’m warning you, you hold back on me—” Fox pulls Al’s chair in front of him. Of course he does, because that’s what keeps happening whenever Scorp lets his feelings out. Bloody hell, he should have learnt that much by now! As it turns out, he hasn’t. Not at all. “—you’ll get to watch me have some fun with your mate here.”</p><p>Al raises his head. He looks minutely at Scorp. His chin is held high, but fear glints cold in his eyes.</p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“Who are they?”</p><p>Scorp shrugs slowly. “I’ve no clue. They must have followed you last night.”</p><p>“No one followed me, Scorp. I made sure.”</p><p>“No one else <em>knew </em>I was here.” Al showed up late last night. Early this morning, these mysterious people decided they might as well drop by. Scorpius is many, many things, but last time he checked, ‘a total dunce’ was nowhere on that list. He highly doubts it’s included now. Plus, it’s not like it’s <em>too </em>hard to connect the dots here. “You were the only one who knew.”</p><p>“What? Hey, I didn’t plan to… You left me a riddle, for Salazar’s sake!” For a moment there, Al’s face sways between anger and confusion. Morosely enough, he seems to settle on the one Scorpius likes less. He could have dealt with confusion, it’s far easier than anger. “A bloody <em>riddle</em>. I didn’t get sorted into Ravenclaw, you did!”</p><p>There’s a wistful pull in Scorp’s stomach. Al’s words sound bitter, furious. Furious at him, and Merlin knows he deserves it greatly.</p><p>“Do you even know how long it took me to figure out what any of it meant?”</p><p>“Shhh,” Scorp hisses. He’s trying to drag his chair near the table. There’s a pocket knife in one of the drawers there—shame he can’t <em>Accio </em>it as he has no wand. Al’s hollering though, it will just make them come back faster.</p><p>“Months! It took me months to figure it out, and way more than months to figure out <em>how</em> to place any of those numbers so they made sense!”</p><p>“Yell a bit louder, will you?” Scorp drawls. It’s not his fault it comes out sarcastic, more his father’s fault, and perhaps where he grew up. He nods towards the door. “I don’t think they’ve quite heard you yet.”</p><p>“I came here for you,” Al grouses, albeit quietly now. “You gave me your coordinates, and I came. Isn’t that enough? What more do I have to do to earn your—”</p><p>“I know you did.”</p><p>“You’re not even grateful!”</p><p>“I am, I really am. Look, I’m sorry,” Scorp mumbles, and he is. He truly is. It’s not like he spews apologies here and there just to seem kinder. He’s just nervous, nervous as a long-tailed Kneazle standing in a room full of rocking chairs. But it’s not Al who’s making him jumpy—though he’ll grant he’s rather nervous <em>over</em> Al, over what might happen to him if they come back and Scorpius is still stuck to this flipping chair. Admitting that much, however, won’t help them get out of here sooner. “It’s not your fault, all right?” Of course it is, he should have checked better. It just won’t do any good to make Al feel more guilty than he already does and, honestly, he’s looking rather sheepish. “I know that.”</p><p>“What are you doing? Why are you—”</p><p>“They must have had you under surveillance, back then,” Scorp mutters. He’s almost managed to get the drawer open, perhaps if he leans a bit more against the table. He’s got to be careful here: if he falls, there’s no way up. “I should have known, should have thought of that before…”</p><p>“What?” Al’s brows furrow. “Wait, what did you… Who was watching me?”</p><p>Scorpius sighs. Groans. Strains against the table. “Bollocks,” he snaps, to nothing and no one in particular, except perhaps at himself since he’s failing miserably here. He presses the knife between drawer and table, trying to get it to stand straight. It keeps bending to one side, slipping, the silly thing…</p><p>“Salazar, what on Earth are you doing back there?” Al asks, panic obvious in his voice. “You’re going to get us both killed!”</p><p>“I’m trying to”—he swings up and down as much as the ropes let him. Which, admittedly, is not a great deal—“cut my handcuffs.” Merlin, he’s so done with this.</p><p>At last, the sharp edge of the blade cuts cleanly through the plastic, miraculously leaving his hands untouched. After freeing himself, Scorpius picks them from the ground. “Flex-cuffs. I knew it.”</p><p>“Be careful,” Al says when he approaches him. “I don’t want—”</p><p>“I <em>am </em>being careful,” Scorp breaks in. It’s not like he wants to cut off Al’s hands. At least Al should know that much. Especially after last night. “Stay put, we don’t have much time.”</p><p>“Time?” Al’s head tilts to one side. “Time for what exactly? What are you planning to—”</p><p>“Those fellows out there, it’s not my cash they’re after.”</p><p>“What?” Al’s grip on his wrist tightens to the point where pain makes a sudden appearance.</p><p> “I was working on something when I left. Something quite—” Scorpius eyes shift to one side, “—relevant.”</p><p>“What were you working on?”</p><p>“Albus.” Scorpius kneels in front of him. “Listen to me, please.” He’s trying to sound calm here, though he’s not even remotely close to calm himself. He just wants Al to stop jumping up walls out of nerves, and right now Al’s looking rather close to it. “There’s three of them out there”—three that Scorp has seen so far, but there could be more. More he hasn’t seen. Best not to tell Al that, he seems frightened enough as it is—“and they’ve got wands. We need to get out of here. All right?”</p><p>Al’s hand loses strength. He finally lets go of Scorp’s arm. Scorp can see him swallow, think. But then Al gives him a slight nod. “Fine,” Al mumbles. “How?”</p><p>Scorp runs both hands over Al’s shoulders, smiling up at him. He pulls him down, close for a kiss. Al’s lips open obediently under his, at least until Al wrinkles his nose and pulls away.</p><p>“Ugh, you taste like blood,” he mutters.</p><p>Scorp can’t hold back the shaky laughter escaping his mouth. “You don’t say,” he quips, what with the slap he got before.</p><p>Still, he can’t help feel outrageously relieved. This is Al, perfectly back in shape. They’re finally past the fear, now action comes and that’s good. Great, even. It’s not that Scorpius is fantastic at it—he’s great at reading books, building up on theories and crafting new spells, at being productive and keeping to-do lists he follows endlessly and, obviously, at being ridiculously fond of Al and rarely letting it show. And if he’s completely honest here, he’s been missing that last bit a lot. Almost as much as he’s been missing Al.</p><p>Sadly though, none of those things are involved in getting out of this room. But at least he handles action better than this whole ‘woe feelings’ bit: he’s crap at that, he’s always been and he knows it. The worst part is he’s pretty sure Al knows it too.</p><p>They used to date after all.</p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Scorp peers furtively through the minuscule slot between door and wall. There’s one of them outside, still wearing a mask. After some time though, watching and watching wears him out. He takes a few steps towards Al then; it’s not like the bloke out there seems to be going anywhere, anytime soon. Pointing at the corpse lying between them, he asks, “Do you know him?”</p><p>Al turns the carcass over with a shove of his foot, takes a slight peek and grimaces. No wonder, he’s burnt all over. “No,” comes Al’s answer. “Should I?”</p><p><em>Maybe</em>, Scorp thinks. <em>You were there too</em>. “I think he’s one of the Aurors that tried to arrest me.”</p><p>Al doesn’t answer. Just looks at him weirdly and wanders off, glancing at the massive stacks of books Scorp has piled all over his laboratory. “Quite a bit of reading you’ve been doing…”</p><p>With a tiny shrug, Scorp says, “I’ve had plenty of time.” Plenty of time to keep his mind busy, plenty of time to blame himself. Plenty of time to try and locate Al, and plenty of time to fail and keep failing.</p><p>At least Al is here now. That’s nice, isn’t it? He made it all the way here, all by himself. Quite sad he also got followers along the way. Scorpius gazes back at him. One of Al’s hands is reaching out to touch—oh, dear. “Don’t! Stop!”</p><p>Al pauses, arm up in the air. He looks back at Scorp wearing that face, the one he always makes when he knows he’s done something wrong. Merlin, as if it were <em>needed </em>at this point, when Scorp’s shame is burning his insides. Already making him regret it came out as an order when it was just… a plea. A plea for caution he completely, absolutely, utterly messed up. “Just…” He pauses, chewing on his lip. To be honest, his social skills have never been what one would call amazingly good, but after a whole year spent alone… Well, it’s not exactly unexpected they’ve taken a large step backwards, is it? “Just try not to touch that.”</p><p>“All right.” Al pulls his hand back. “How come?”</p><p>“It’s rigged with curses. I reckon that’s how he—” Scorp nods towards the corpse, “—got killed.”</p><p>These are all suppositions, obviously: it’s not like he’s ever seen this happening before. Sadly, he suspects his conjectures are accurate in this particular situation, given the position of the remains and… where they’re lying. There’s a brief moment of discomfort when he notices one of the dead body’s hands is gone. Missing. Likely the one he lifted to touch his experiment. Perhaps Scorp did go a bit overboard with the curses. Well. At least they worked? The dead bloke there seems really rather… belly up, brown bread. Come to a sticky end. One would say food for worms. And Scorp is—indirectly, but still—the one who did him in.</p><p>It’s a bit shocking, all in all. He shudders. A first is a first. No one’s ever tried to touch any of his experiments before—but then again, no one at the Department of Mysteries would even dare to, and it’s not like anyone else has managed to find him since he ran away. He’s good at that, at being invisible. He has been doing it all his life, even when he was just a child.</p><p>His father warned him once, the day before he took the Hogwarts Express. “They all know who you are. They all know what I’ve done. They won’t be kind to you, keep that in mind.” Scorp listened as usual, as always. His father had been right then, but then was a long time ago. Back then, his father stood on a brightly lit pillar. He’s been off that pillar for a while. Pretty much since he became Minister.</p><p>Scorp blinks away from his thoughts, staring at the polished wooden base of his experiment up there. “Just don’t touch it,” he tells Al, again.</p><p>Al stares up at it too, unblinking and unmoving. Eventually he asks, “What is it?”</p><p>“It’s nothing, really. Just an experiment I was working on, back when…” He catches himself scratching his stubble, not quite voluntarily. Looks at Al for a couple of seconds. <em>Back when I screwed things up with you</em>. It’s quite a marvel he somehow managed to bite that last bit down before it came out. “It’s sort of a Time-Turner.”</p><p>Al’s eyebrows rise. “Doesn’t even look like the one dad showed me in his memories. I thought they were much smaller.”</p><p>“Yes, well.” Likely because it’s not a Time-Turner. It’s just an experiment, and one gone wrong at that. “I think that may be what they’re after, the blokes out there.”</p><p>“I doubt it.” Al scoffs. “They’re just starving, like everyone else out there.” He points towards the wall, towards the world outside of Scorpius’ comfy hut in the middle of nowhere. “So unless this thing here can marvellously make food out of nothing, I doubt they’d be even remotely—”</p><p>“I’m quite sure that is what they’re here for,” Scorpius interrupts, firmly, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. “The Ministry must have sent them.”</p><p>“So this thing here… Is this what you stole from them?”</p><p>“I didn’t steal it, Al! I <em>created</em> it! Built it from scratch,” Scorp snaps. “I used to work for them, remember?”</p><p>“As if I could forget.” Al frowns a bit. “Well?”
</p><p>“Well, what?”</p><p>“What’s it supposed to do, this… bunch of irons?”</p><p>“Nothing. I already told you.” Scorp tries a shrug; it comes out as awkward as they get. He’s not particularly proud of his failures, and that thing up there is largely one of them. “It was supposed to be a Time-Turner, only not for one person. They wanted it to be able to carry”—armies, he’s pretty sure of that from what he overheard his father’s assistants saying. He’s always been a good listener. Sometimes, even too good—“er, large groups of people. I said I’d work on it but… Look, as far as I know, it’s just a bunch of spells mixed together doing nothing at all.”</p><p>Al looks his way, brows knitted. “I don’t get it, why take it then? Why take something that doesn’t even work?” Al doesn’t exactly ask ‘And more than that, why fill it with curses strong enough to blast a man’s hand off his body?’, yet Scorp has no doubt it’s going through his head. It’s definitely going through his own mind, to say the least.</p><p>“I don’t know.” He’s not even sure himself. He’s not even sure there was ever a good reason for it: he took it and that’s that. Perhaps he thought they might figure out what he did wrong or something. It was over a year ago, he’d been angry and resentful and overall extremely sceptical over everything he got to hear back at the Ministry. It seemed they were preparing for something big—and indeed, they were. “I took all my work for them, even the scrolls. I even took all my planning, perhaps because I got to see more harm than good coming out of it, long term…”</p><p>“And that, ladies and gentlemen,” Al breaks in, “is Scorpius being Scorpius. Ethics first, knowledge second, and anything else way behind on the race,” a praise mocking enough for Scorpius to retort, “Well, you can’t say I was <em>wrong</em>, can you?”</p><p>“I’m quite amazed you didn’t end up in Gryffindor. Oh, hang on a second, that’s right. They ask for courage there too, don’t they? And you,” Al says, “have never had any of that.”</p><p>As if he has that much himself, the massive plonker. Silence stretches between them. Scorpius turns around, walking back towards the door. There’s no one there now. If he can get out and grab his wand, perhaps…</p><p>“What are you planning to do?” asks Al, now standing beside him.</p><p>Scorp looks at him, biting his lip thoughtfully. Al’s face slowly turns into a sulk.</p><p>“No. Don’t,” Al warns. “Whatever you’re thinking, don’t do it. It’s never good when you…”</p><p>Scorp shakes his head. No courage, Al said. Well, he’s going to show him some. “Lock the door behind me, would you?” Scorpius can be brave. In fact, he’s being brave now. “It has the same password as the one on my safe at home.”</p><p>“No.” Al grabs his arm, pulling him back. “Scorp, don’t go out there, please. I’m begging you.”</p><p>“It’s reinforced against curses and spells. It will take them quite a while to break it down. Don’t worry, you’ll be perfectly fine in here.” At least for a short while. It’s quite a shame the walls are blocked against magic, quite a shame Scorpius obviously forwent making an alternative exit to the lab. Then again, if he had and they’d found it, they’d just have locked them somewhere else, so…</p><p>“You don’t get it, do you? They’ll kill you if they see you out of here,” Al pleas. It’s sweet of him, it’s nice. So nice indeed that Scorp decides to throw his scruples to the wind.</p><p>He kisses Al, lazy and tentative. At least he deserves this much, regardless of what he’s done in the past, regardless of Al’s mocking attempts at his lack of bravery for leaving him behind. Al doesn’t know the full details. He doesn’t know there was no time to come up with a plan, that Scorp had under five minutes to get out of the Ministry after setting off the alarm. Besides, this might be the last time he gets to do this. To kiss Al.</p><p>Pressure comes back just right when Scorp opens his mouth, just like it did last night: soft pressure on his tongue. Merlin, he’s missed this so, so much. He rests a hand on Al’s chest, slowly moving it up to his jaw.</p><p>Scorp leaves it there when he pulls back, gently caressing Al’s skin. Al seems contemplative, a little withdrawn.</p><p>“I shouldn’t have left you that riddle, Al.”</p><p>“What?” Al blinks. Then his eyes rest on Scorp’s, brows furrowed upwards. “Don’t say that, I’m glad you left something.”</p><p>“No, it was…” Stupid. “I just… thought I might miss you. I <em>did</em> miss you, you know?” He rests his forehead against Al’s, sighing. This could be the last time, and as a goodbye it’s not even a good one. Yet Scorpius pushes himself on, “It was a mistake, <em>my </em>mistake. I should have left nothing, no good has come of it after all.”</p><p>“It <em>has</em>!” Al looks at him like he’s crazy, like he’s out of his mind. But then again, Al knows nothing. “I’m here! I couldn’t have found you without…”</p><p>Scorpius looks into his eyes. <em>Yes, you</em><em>’re here, but you might not be here for too long</em>. Then, he gazes at the door. It’s really for the best if Al comes out alive, it’s not like it matters if Scorp doesn’t. No one counts on Scorpius, not anymore. He’s dead to them—or worse, one of Father’s lackeys, given that his dear dad never released the news. Too much of a shame to admit even his own son betrayed him, he reckons.</p><p>Al though, Al has friends. He still has a family who cares about him.</p><p>“Stay here,” Scorp whispers. The sad part here is Al did count on him. Al actually <em>cared</em> about him, for some absurdly idiotic reason pulled out of some bizarre corner of his mind. And Scorpius still left him behind like the muppet he is, the muppet he’s always been. He’s spent so many months regretting that, trying to find Al and failing, again and again. “And use the locking password when I’m gone. You remember it, don’t you?”</p><p>“That’s a silly question. Of course I remember it.” Scorp has to grant him that. The day they started dating. What can he say, he’s sentimental about some things, Al being obviously one of them. It’s such a shame they being together again only lasted a few hours…</p><p>Still, it made Scorp happy. It made him pleased. Though perhaps it doesn’t have to be over yet, not if he manages to do things right this time. He hears Al’s voice behind him as he leaves. “Don’t go, please. Stay here with me.” There’s a certain degree of despair in it.</p><p>Still, he’s not going to give Al more reasons to hate him. He’s going to do things right this time.</p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Scorpius watches them, crouching behind one of the desks in his kitchen. Sadly, it’s as far as he can get. The stairs are across the room, going out through the other door. If only he could cross it without his intruders seeing him, he might be able to go up to his bedroom and fetch his wand. They’ve all got working eyes though, and it’s not like Scorp can make himself invisible out of the blue. Al’s father used to have a cloak that did that, but then again—he can’t stop a grimace from covering his face—he’s been long dead. Scorp’s father took care of him, and he took care of him far before senior Potter could even raise a movement against Britain’s new magic jurisdiction.</p><p>The intruders must have gone through his house. They’re listening to the news programme, so they must have managed to find his wireless. Voices come and go, that thing’s been broken for ages. Scorpius has never been too bothered by it to try to fix it. <em>What for</em>, he wonders, <em>when it</em><em>’s far better to pretend the whole world has gone to hell</em>.</p><p>“Many wizards in the UK celebrate the government’s reunification,” says the newscaster before her voice flutters into nothing; a woman clearly paid by his father to read that particular scroll. Father used to tell him, “Money makes the world go ’round.” Scorpius has to grant him that at least that much he’s proven. More than, even.</p><p>“… treaty has been signed to start a war against all opponents of the new regime,” the wireless announces a while later. Not that Scorpius paying it much attention, he’s far more interested in watching his intruders: their masks are off now.</p><p>… <em>magical division destroyed by a Muggle missile</em>…</p><p>Upon hearing that one of his intruders—the young one with the mouse mask—happens to snort. “Sure, a Muggle missile…”</p><p>When he turns around to watch him, Scorpius barely stops himself from recoiling. He knows him. He’s seen him before, four years ago… Scamander, wasn’t he? A few years below him and Al at Hogwarts. He had a twin, too. Scorpius could never tell them apart: they were identical copies of each other, those two, the one large difference between them being the colours shining on their ties. That, and that the Hufflepuff one never managed to get the knot tied right. Seeing it messed up every day kept making Scorpius itch inside, perfect things not quite as perfect as they should be.</p><p>“Merlin’s sake, don’t listen to her. It’s all lies. As if anything the Ministry of Magic says has the slightest bit of truth to it.” It must be Fox the one who answers, mostly by the clothes on him. “You keep listening to their propaganda and one day you’ll fall for it, just you wait.” He points at the audio broadcaster. Scorpius squints, paying attention. He can hear people in the background, all of them screaming his father’s motto. A demonstration, maybe? “Listen to them! They all bought his barmy lies. How’s <em>that</em> for our dodgy new Minister, huh?”</p><p>The woman scoffs. “Know thy enemy, pal. Know thy enemy.” Scorpius has no clue who she is, but her hair is as red as the one the Granger-Weasley brat had. He never liked her much. For some odd reason, he’s not much liking this one either—and perhaps his reason here might be related to the massive punch she gave him when he was tied up back in the lab.</p><p>“Yeah, well, it’s not like—”</p><p>Fox breaks in then, “You cut that into <em>five</em> pieces?”</p><p>The other bloke—Lorcan, Lysander, whatever he’s called—nods.</p><p>“There’s only <em>three </em>of us now, you prat,” Fox chides, slapping the back of Scamander’s head. “The other two got killed, knock a bell that?”</p><p>Scorpius cranes his neck in concentration. So there’s only three of them now, no more, and they all happen to be standing in this room. None of them is watching him; none of them is watching Al. Rather dreadful at this whole ‘intruding’ thing, aren’t they? Then, he notices Scamander, leaving his wand on the table, likely to be able to grab Scorp’s piece of pie with both hands. Scorp can’t help rolling his eyes—Merlin, he must be the Hufflepuff one, who else would leave his wand on the nearest table just to be able to grasp his food better? But then it dawns on him: the wand is in reach. One of Scorpius’ eyebrows rises. Just a couple of steps, and it’s his. Could he get there before they…</p><p>Scorpius launches for it. Crashes against the table on his way there, but somehow, he manages to grab the wand before it falls to the floor. “<em>Protego</em>!” he yells. “<em>Petrificus Total</em>—”</p><p>Something thuds against his head. The room trembles—no, it’s not the room, it’s him. Is he… falling? The whole kitchen tilts to one side. His head crashes painfully against the ground.</p><p>
  <em>… do not listen to the mad words of a wise woman…</em>
</p><p>For a mere second, Scorpius almost feels like chuckling at himself. He must be mad, too. Acting too quickly, disregarding even the consequences of his own actions, thinking he could kill the three of them far before any of them reacted.</p><p>The world trembles yet again when his skull hits the floor. He must have moved the wireless, it seems to be repeating the same sentence over and over.</p><p><em>… mad words</em>…<em> listen to the mad words</em>…</p><p>He turns his head to look up. The woman is frowning down at him. Metal clatters as she picks up one of his frying pans.</p><p>
  <em>… the eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down, again and again…</em>
</p><p>The woman lifts the pan.</p><p>
  <em>… and along with it, you are too…</em>
</p><p>Watching the pan sway down towards his head, before the ear-splitting crash he foresees rattling his bones and brain in equal measure, the last thought crossing Scorp’s mind is,<em> You failed him. You failed him, yet again</em>. Because failing Al is all he’s ever managed. Failing at things he promised, failing at keeping him safe.</p>
