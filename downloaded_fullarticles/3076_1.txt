    <p><em>Nurmengard</em> <em>Castle</em>, <em>Austria</em></p><p>Credence had never seen the alps before. They were magnificent, higher than any buildings in New York, their tops sprinkled with snow like sugar dusting, and the sky above them an endless expanse of blue. The space around him looked so open and free that some of the tension in his shoulders uncoiled. Nagini would’ve liked it here.</p><p>It wasn’t a happy path of thought to follow, so Credence stopped himself and looked down at his little bird instead. He’d be happy here, all the space in the world available to him, once his little wings were strong enough to carry him.</p><p>“Credence.”</p><p>Credence kept his gaze on the horizon. Grindelwald made any room feel smaller, like the man’s presence expanded and filled the spaces available to him.</p><p>“You’ve done the right thing, Credence. You’ve been forced to live in the shadows for too long.”</p><p>Having grown up with Mary Lou Barebone, Credence knew all about manipulation, and telling people what they wanted to hear in order to win them over. Grindelwald thought he had Credence, that he was spinning his trap around him, when in reality Credence was only here to take what he needed. Wizarding society had ostracised him, but Grindelwald gave him a wand. Society had treated him as a nobody from nowhere, but Grindelwald gave him a name.</p><p>He would’ve been a fool not to take it, and if Grindelwald took his acceptance for loyalty, well. That wasn’t Credence’s concern. Too long he’d followed others and been loyal to anyone but himself. He was done with that, especially now that magic was thrumming through him like the warmth he’d always craved.</p><p>“There’s something else, Credence.” Grindelwald was watching him with the smile of benevolent father, and it made the hairs on Credence’s neck stand up, because he’d thought he’d seen that smile before, though he couldn’t say where.</p><p>“Or rather, someone else.” Grindelwald’s smile widened, making his odd eye shine even brighter. “An old acquaintance of yours. Victoria, kindly bring him in.”</p><p>Credence’s grip on his wand tightened. He had no acquaintances, but even if this turned out to be a trap, he wasn’t afraid. He’d survived whatever the world had thrown at him since his birth, and he was powerful now. There was nothing and nobody Credence was ever going to fear again.</p><p>With his wand held tightly, he watched as the doors opened and a man stumbled inside. His clothes looked new and expensive, and yet they hung on his frame like rags on a scarecrow, like they’d only been put on him for effect. His long and unkempt hair fell in greasy strands over his ducked face, and his limbs trembled, like his muscles barely held enough strength to keep him upright.</p><p>Credence was about to tell Grindelwald that he’d never seen this man in his life, when the man lifted his head. His face was gaunt and lined by hunger and pain, but his eyes. His eyes were the same, dark and beautiful, once one looked away from the severely set brows above them.</p><p>Percival Graves starred at him, and Credence felt as if a bucket of cold water had been emptied over him. His teeth ground together as he remembered whispered words and broken promises, and the pain of betrayal. He could feel himself losing control, and he didn’t care, because Percival Graves deserved what he had coming and more.</p><p>But then Graves blinked and his vacant eyes lit up with recognition. He looked at Credence like he’d looked at him before, back when Credence had still thought this man was going to be his salvation. There was the same wonder in his face that had been there whenever Credence had dared to reach out, as if him taking Graves’ hand was something other than a street urchin dirtying a rich man’s skin.</p><p>“Credence.” His voice was rough from disuse, and he spoke Credence’s name with a breathlessness that should be reserved for prayers. Credence felt paralysed, rooted to the spot and incapable of action. He didn’t know what to feel, anger and bewilderment and a misguided shred of hope struggling to come out on top.</p><p>“I thought you would enjoy this gift. You were at his mercy long enough. It is high time the tables were turned, don’t you think?” Grindelwald put a hand on Credence’s shoulder and gave it a squeeze, as if they were friends. As if he’d given Credence something magnificent, instead of something that ripped Credence up on the inside. “Mister Graves here is entirely at your disposal, Credence.”</p><p>“I don’t want him.”</p><p>Grindelwald’s smile sharpened. “Then kill him.”</p><p>And wasn’t that the difference between them summed up neatly, right there? Grindelwald thought that Credence was like him, when he was anything but. Maybe the obscurus was, but Credence knew now that he shouldn’t be reduced to the darkness residing inside of him. Nagini had thought him that. And maybe the obscurus wanted to kill Graves, clawing and scratching with greed, but Credence? Credence would find no pleasure in killing the man, especially in the state he was in.</p><p>As he watched Graves’ eyes flicker between him and Grindelwald, Credence tasted bile in his mouth because this was wrong. Once upon a time Percival Graves had been his knight in shining armor, a man so impossibly put together and kind that for a while there Credence was sure he’d dreamed him up. Graves had always been self-assured and imposing, but the broadness of his shoulders had somehow become smaller, his posture hunched and trembling. The fear and insecurity Credence knew from the mirror now looked back at him through Graves’ eyes.</p><p>“He was attempting to run from his crimes when we picked him up.” Grindelwald’s tone was regretful, but Credence recognised it for the bait it was. Did the man truly think him this stupid? Credence was naive and unversed in a lot of the ways of the world, but he wasn’t stupid, and he’d learned a great deal in the past year.</p><p>“Thank you for your gift,” Credence said, keeping his tone neutral. For a second, Grindelwald’s hand tightened on his shoulder before it relaxed, enough giveaway of his annoyance that Credence knew he’d made the right choice.</p><p>“I’ll take him to my rooms.”</p><p>Grindelwald barely managed to hide his displeasure, and Credence almost smiled at the irony of how quickly he’d managed to disappoint his self-appointed father-figure.</p><p>Grindelwald recovered quickly enough, his unthreatening smile back in place. “Certainly, anything you want. I shall see you at dinner tonight.”</p><p>Credence nodded, though he had no inclination to still be here tonight; not if it could be helped. He’d miss the view, but he wasn’t going to let himself be put away in cage of glass to do another man’s bidding.</p><p>For the briefest of moments Credence allowed himself to look Graves in the eyes as he walked past him and left the room, trusting him to follow.</p><p>***</p><p>Credence had been given a suit of rooms fit for a prince; the reception alone would’ve fit most of the Barebone house. Only Credence had never strived for material goods, so he had little appreciation for it. He looked out the high windows at the scattering of pine trees on the mountains and centred himself the way Nagini had taught him, before turning around.</p><p>Graves stood by the door, though not poised to run, and his eyes were fixed on Credence like he was afraid he’d disappear into thin air if he looked away. The seconds ticked by as the looked at each other, the room between them more like an abyss, stretching deep and wide.</p><p>“Credence-“</p><p>“I trusted you!” And there it was, the anger bubbling to the surface and threatening to spill over. Credence took a deep breath and exhaled until his lungs felt flat. “I trusted you.”</p><p>“Credence, I never...I...” Graves’ hand came up to his throat and he was struggling to breathe, like the words he wanted to speak were choking him. Behind Credence, the phoenix gave a little chirp of distress that made Credence pull up short. Something wasn’t right.</p><p>He watched as Graves took a few laboured breaths, before the obstruction in his throat seemed to ease.</p><p>“Can you not talk to me?”</p><p>Graves swallowed before giving Credence a weary smile that looked painful on his pale, cracked lips. “I can talk to you.”</p><p>The words came out normal this time. So, Graves could talk to him only his throat had closed up when he’d tried to...oh.</p><p>“Can you not talk to me about what happened?”</p><p>Graves remained silent this time, as if he couldn’t even move his head for a yes or no.</p><p>“It’s a spell, isn’t it?”</p><p>Graves gave a slow nod, and Credence wanted to lash out in frustration. Why was nothing in his life ever easy? All he ever wanted were answers, and he had to fight so damn hard to get them.</p><p>“Can I break it?”</p><p>Graves’ eyes flickered to the wand in Credence’s hand. He licked his lips, before squaring his shoulders and looking back up. “If anyone can, I’d think it’d be you.”</p><p>“And if it goes wrong?” All Credence had ever done with his magic was destroy, he wasn’t sure how capable he’d be in anything else.</p><p>“Credence.” Graves’ smile was so weary it made the pit of Credence’s stomach squirm uncomfortable. “I’ve got nothing left to lose. Let’s try it.”</p><p>Credence swallowed as some of his initial bravado disappeared.</p><p>“The incantation is-“ Graves broke off into violent coughing, and Credence’s shoulders sunk. He couldn’t tell him, and Credence didn’t know anything about spells and how to use them.</p><p>There was a flapping next to his ear and the phoenix landed on Credence’s shoulder.</p><p>“Just...just try it. Think of what you want to achieve, what you want your magic to accomplish. I...I trust you...Credence.” Graves was still wheezing, but there was determination in his eyes. He trusted Credence enough to expose himself to whatever magic Credence was going to throw at him, and Credence thought that a man who’d betrayed him wouldn’t do that.</p><p>The phoenix nipped his ear, as if in encouragement. “Are you going to help me?” Credence whispered, and the bird chirped in reply.</p><p>His throat felt rather dry all of a sudden and Credence swallowed, before squaring his shoulders and widening the stance of his legs, as if that would help. If ever there’d been a time to be brave it was now, and if he wanted answers, he needed to do this.</p><p>Raising his wand like he’d seen the others do it, he pointed it at Graves, who stood unflinching and gave Credence an encouraging nod.</p><p>He took another breath, in and out, clearing his mind of all the thoughts rushing and cluttering through it. All he wanted now was for Graves to be able to speak freely again, to be free of whatever spell had been put on him.</p><p>Credence felt the wand in his hand starting to vibrate, the handle growing hot. He tightened his grip and closed his eyes, not leaving room for any thoughts in his mind but the constant mantra of <em>I want to lift the spell on Graves, I want him able to speak. I want to lift the spell on Graves, I want him able to speak.</em></p><p>It felt like there was a storm brewing in the room, a rushing filling Credence’s ears as his body tingled and warmth flooded through him. Across the room, Graves groaned and went to his knees.</p><p>“Don’t...stop.”</p><p>Credence’s hand was slick with sweat. He imagined his magic to wrap around Graves light a blanket, light and brilliant, not dark and sticky as it had been, breaking open whatever other magic had been put on him.</p><p>The wand felt like a natural extension of his body now, channelling his magic into something less wild, and for the first time in his life, Credence wasn’t afraid to let go. He could feel the magic leaving him, travelling across the room, and he knew, with unwavering certainty, that it would succeed.</p><p>The humming in his ears swelled to almost deafening levels before it fell away, leaving the room eerily silent. Credence blinked his eyes open slowly and found Graves still on his knees, his lips red with blood but his eyes bright.</p><p>“Did...did it work?”</p><p>Graves cleared his throat and shook his wrists. Two silver bands fell to the floor with a clank, each neatly cut in half. Credence starred at them, shuddering because it felt like he could see the darkness crawling around them, and raised his gaze again to find Graves smiling at him, his eyes full of something that Credence was hesitant to call ‘pride’.</p><p>The smile fell away within a second, as hasty footsteps sounded outside the room.</p><p>“He knows what you’ve done.” The panic in Graves’ voice sent a cold shiver up Credence’s spine.</p><p>“We need to leave.” Graves looked around like a fox cornered by the hunt. “I’m...I don’t think I can apparate us. And there...surely there are wards,” he mumbled to himself, raking a hand through his dirty hair.</p><p>On Credence’s shoulder, the phoenix gave a patient chirp.</p><p>“Come here.” Credence held his hand out to Graves, who stopped his frantic mumbling to give Credence a startled look. The door gave a groan as someone tried to break it open.</p><p>“Come here!”</p><p>This time, Graves obeyed and limped forward, grabbing Credence’s hand. For a second they stood like that, hands clutched and eyes locked. Then there was the beating of wings and the feeling of something hooking behind Credence’s navel, and the world around them became fuzzy and disappeared.</p>
