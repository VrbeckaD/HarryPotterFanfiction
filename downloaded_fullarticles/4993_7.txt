    <p>When Harry Potter was three years old, he taught himself to read from a cookbook that he 'borrowed' from Aunt Petunia. He taught himself to write with his finger and dust from his cupboard, and often read his cookbook to fall asleep. By the time Harry was 6, he had devoured every book in the junior section of his school's library. When Harry turned 8, he had read every single book in the school library, including the index, and the report card he got that year gave him glowing remarks - not that anyone cared. One time, when Harry visited Mrs. Figg, aside from being swarmed from a mass of cute &amp; cuddly cats, he managed a 300 page book in two hours. The next time Harry came over, she had baked him a cake with an eagle on it as frosting. Harry was shocked at this kind offering, and thanked her precisely 13 times.</p>

<p>On the 28th of July, 1991, Harry received a letter. It was written in parchment, Harry noted, and had a red seal embossed on the back. Harry quickly shoved it into his back pocket, knowing that if Uncle Vernon were to see it, it would be confiscated immediately. He decided to open it at Mrs. Figg's house, as he was being sent there while Dudley and Peirs were off to buy their Smeltings clothes. <em>Thank God,</em> Harry thought, as he took the short trip to Wisteria Walk. Arabella, as Harry was invited to call her, opened the door as soon as the first knock hit the door. "Harry! So good to see you!" Harry and Arabella exchanged a hug, before Harry walked inside. It smelt pleasantly of freshly-baked biscuits and cats, a smell which some would find distasteful, but one which Harry adored. As he sit down, chatting away with Mrs. Figg and petting one of her cats, he heard a crinkling of parchment. Harry remembered about the letter, and quickly took it out. Mrs. Figg looked at the seal letter and smiled. "I got this today, which I thought was weird, because 1. I don't get letters, 2. It said my address was 'The Cupboard Under The Stairs,'  and 3. It came on a Sunday, and you know what uncle Vernon says, "No post on Sundays," chanted Arabella and Harry in unison.  "Open the letter," smiled Mrs. Figg, and Harry did.</p>

  <p align="left">Harry gaped. "So, you got your Hogwarts letter then, Harry?" asked Arabella, with a knowing look in her eye. Harry gaped further. "H-W-What? Hold on. Magic is real? You know about magic? How do I know magic is real?" Arabella walked over to her fireplace, and took out some green powder. "Hogwarts, headmaster's office," Arabella stated clearly, and stepped into the fireplace, which started glowing green. Arabella vanished in a plume of fire. "Okay, that answers that question." Harry read the enclosed list of books.</p>

  <p align="left"><em>MORE BOOKS,</em> Harry's mind screamed. He smiled, as an old, white-bearded man stepped out of the fireplace. "Harry," the man said, his eyes twinkling wildly. "So nice to see you again." "Again?" Harry asked, his head spinning wildly.</p>
