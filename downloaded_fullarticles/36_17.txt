  <span>       Harry usually tried to remain calm but this was a situation that definitely called for panic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What?" was the only word the startled boy could get his mouth to form. He gripped his hair with his empty hand and tugged a handful of it stressfully. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Hm?" his freckled best friend asked through a mouthful of breakfast sausages. He stretched his head over to try and read the paper while sloppily wiping at his mouth on the sleeve of his robes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>         Harry handed Ron the newspaper that Hedwig had dropped on his plate mere moments ago. He got impossibly more pale as he realized what his friend was gaping like a fish over. The headlines were usually crazy tabloids about Harry and his newest vampire slaying adventure or the secret to his soft skin, but today... today's headline was </span>
  <em>
    <span>very</span>
  </em>
  <span> different.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What do they mean he's the new minister?! They vote on that, don't they? They couldn't have </span>
  <em>
    <span>actually</span>
  </em>
  <span> voted him in, right Harry?!" Ron's voice began to tremble with fear as a concerned Hermione sat down beside him in her usual spot with furrowed brows. At this point, the rest of the Great Hall was beginning to stress over their own papers or over the panicked expressions that ran across the staff table, the only exception, of course, being Dumbledore, who was curiously absent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I-I gotta go see the headmaster," Harry stumbled over his words and his feet alike as he rushed to exit the Hall and go try for answers from the neon orange robe-wearing wizard. He ran the entire way to the stone gargoyle, not bothering to care the few times he hit the corner of the wall when turning down different corridors.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Lemon drops!" Harry shouted, out of breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The stone stairs had barely finished forming when Harry began sprinting up them as if his life depended on it. For all he knew, it might have. He threw the office door open, not giving a thought to knocking. He rushed in and stood in front of the eerily calm headmaster who was sipping on tea at his desk. After about a solid thirty seconds of stuttering over his words and utterly failing to catch his breath. Dumbledore reached next to his bowl of liquorice snaps to grab a small bottle containing a silvery blue potion and gestured for Harry to take it. Assuming he knew what a calming potion looked like at this point, Harry downed it in one gulp without question. Instantly, the draught's calming effect washed over the boy's mind. He took a few deep breaths in preparation to express his worry to Dumbledore, but he was cut off by the door opening again and the teachers marching into the office. Angry and concerned faces spanned around the room. Professor McGonagall spoke first.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Albus, how did this happen? I know you have seats on the board. Did you know about this?" The transfiguration professor asked in a demanding tone. Her mouth was pinched in a tight line with worry set in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Everything will be explained shortly," he said with a twinkle in his eyes and a wink to the reader.</span>
