    <p>The corridors and rooms fell silent as he strode past them, the sound of his fine leather boots reverberating against the marble floor. Everyone knew he had to be avoided when he walked in like this as his demeanour might seem cool but the aura emanating from his person told his insides were boiling with untamed fury. Sometimes a poor intern, still new to the system, had the misfortune and the stupidity to block his way to ask him something. All employees would then scurry off in the depths of the Ministry to escape the burning hexes and acid remarks thrown at the unlucky bureaucrat.</p><p>But here, the offices were mostly empty as it was lunchtime and the remaining staffs were too concerned about the new legislation to try to stop him.</p><p>He continued his path through the State machinery before reaching the Head office and knocking at the most important door of the whole building. He was one of the few privileged person that had direct access to the Minister's office.</p><p>"Come in" answered a bored voice.</p><p>Tywin Lannister, current Minister of Magic, was sitting at his desk presumably working and seemed not all pleased to have one of his advisors disturb him.</p><p>"What do you want Littlefinger?"</p><p>Petyr Baelish also called Littlefinger as a recurring joke in the wizarding world wanted many things. He wanted wealth, power, to kick Tywin's ass and the more he thought about it, the more he wanted to kick every Lannister's and other purebloods families' asses but right now Petyr Baelish wanted explanations for the letter currently in his right hand.</p><p>"Sir, it seems there has been a mistake. As you can see, I've just received a letter from the Ministry informing me of a new legislation I haven't been notified of and implying I had to contribute to it. You know I will always be at the Ministry's service but imposing me some poor girl will only be a burden to my work."</p><p>"You know it is not just some poor girl." Tywin sighed in annoyance. "There is nothing to understand here, Baelish. If we want the law to be accepted we need to show people no one is exempted. As you know the Department of Mysteries unfortunately discovered that the intermarriage between the Pureblood lines causes more and more stillbirths, squibs and barren children.</p><p>Therefore to prevent the wizarding world to die, the Department of Magical Enforcement Law decided to put a Marriage Law into place instructing pureblood wizards still single to marry within the next two months with the Muggle-born or Halfblood assigned to them. There was no reason why you should have been informed of it. Your role is to tell us what's going on at Hogwarts and make sure Dumbledore obeys. You are stepping out of what is expected of you, Baelish.</p><p>"And she isn't a girl anymore. She is of age." stated the too well known sweet voice of Cersei Lannister behind him. "It is common knowledge that you once found interest in a similar beauty. Consider this a gift for your distinguished service."</p><p>Petyr knew it wasn't at all to please him that her name was on the little piece of paper in the letter but to further the punishment on her family that she was given to a Muggle-born old enough to be her father, her former teacher and with a common past with her mother.</p><p>God, he hated this Pureblood philosophy deciding he was less then the old families members, less than a man because he had to create alone a path for himself in the wizarding world. And there were all laughing at him now for falling into their trick and forever shaming his future wife's family.</p><p>"Now if there isn't anything else, get out. We have work to do here." intervened Tywin putting the meeting to an end.</p><p>With that, Baelish made a quick curtsy before leaving the room with his heart beating a thousand times too quickly.</p><p>If he was honest with himself, it came as a good surprise -No, more than just a good one- he was positively thrilled by the idea to make her his wife, to call her one day Mrs Baelish.</p><p>What infuriated him is that he wasn't sure he could keep his control around her and feared he would fall again in the foolishness that made him almost die once.</p><p>He looked at the letter again where his name was distinctly written next to the Ministry's stamp. Opening it, he decided to ignore the administrative formalities to focus on the name that had been assigned to him.</p><p>Sealed forever in the paper in black cursive was the one that would have her fate linked to his</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Sansa Stark</em>
</p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>"3…2…1</p><p> </p><p>HAPPY BIRTHDAAAAAAY TO YOOUUU" singed the crowd cheering as the candles were blown.</p><p>Photos were taken and gifts exchanged in a joyful atmosphere with the promise of memories kept for the future. Old friends would stay the whole evening plotting in a dark part of the room to find the best way to bring the charming man sitting next to the buffet to notice them. Massive grins appeared on everyone faces as they received a part of the hugest chocolate cake they'd ever seen.</p><p>To a careless viewer, the place seemed full of young people enjoying themselves but with close inspection, there was one thing out of place. Or more someone.</p><p>Sipping on her drink- a random cocktail- the girl was nonchalantly sitting on a sofa and observing the scene before her with distant eyes. It was for sure a good thing she could come to her friend's birthday but her mind was telling her something was amiss. No one here knew what she truly was and she didn't mind that truly -quite the contrary: it was refreshing not having to use her magic and having to do things the muggle way.</p><p>Yes, she should be happy but she was waiting for more: a sign that might tell her what purpose she would give to her life.</p><p>Freshly graduated from Hogwarts, Sansa Stark had decided to enrol in a muggle university to learn more about things that wasn't taught in the magical school such as political science.</p><p>So far she had been delighted by the new knowledge and the change of scenery but she hadn't found yet what she wanted to do in the future.</p><p>As her thoughts went on, someone in the crowd screamed. A silver wolf was floating in the room in her direction before disappearing with those words "Letter… Quick". Sansa sighed at the view of her cousin's Patronus, having now to lie about it in front of a group of muggles after having explained during more than half an hour to Jon how to use a phone and instructed him to text her if anything was to happen.</p><p>"There is nothing to be scared of, guys. My cousin is a sound and lights engineer and he likes testing new things so since I am here, he wanted to impress y'all with his new tricks. I'm going to talk to him." explained Sansa finding it the best lie she could come up with. People seemed to accept it and soon the party went on.</p><p>Sansa left the house after this and Apparated as soon as she found herself alone. She found her cousin in the living room of the small apartment she shared with him in Dublin.</p><p>Sansa came round the sofa and faced him with a disapproving look, still cross with him for not having used his new knowledge about phones. Jon was positively livid but she discovered quickly that it wasn't for her reprimand.</p><p>In his hand were two similar letters, one bearing his name and the other hers. A feeling of dread began creeping into her.</p><p>"The Ministry seems to have decided to pass a new legislation, Sansa. Here, read." He gave her her letter before looking at his with utter disgust.</p><p> </p><p align="center"><em>Miss Sansa Stark<em>, you are made by the present officially aware of the new Marriage Law</em></em>.</p><p align="center">
  <em>As according to this new legislation, you have two months after receiving this letter to marry the wizard that has been chosen for you. Afterwards you will have exactly 48 hours to complete the wizard marriage rituals.</em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>You will find attached here the name of your fiancée. <em>Please receive our congratulations for your upcoming wedding. </em></em>
</p><p align="center"><em>Dolores Umbridge</em>, <em>Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement </em></p><p> </p><p>"Is it even legal to do that?" hissed Sansa, her blood boiling as she read the note.</p><p>"It seems it is now." answered Jon visibly occupied at balling and unballing his fists in an attempt to temper the anger tensing his body.</p><p>"There have no RIGHT to decide this for us! " he finally yelled. Stepping closer, he grabbed Sansa's shoulders and turned her so he could meet her eyes.</p><p>"Sansa… We can escape this together. I've never told you before but… I've come to get attached to you as I learned to discover you during our time here in Dublin. I daresay I love you Sansa, as you're the only woman I would want to spend the rest of my life with. I don't care about the girl on this paper who is supposed to become my wife. I only care about you." Jon became flustered as he continued more shyly "We can go tomorrow to the Ministry and marry before they try to stop us."</p><p>Sansa stood staring at him flabbergasted. Did he think she would go into marriage to escape one? And she never thought he would have grown this kind of feelings as she only ever saw in him a member of her family, not a potential lover.</p><p>It broke her heart to see Jon's devastated face when she told him their union could never be but it was the right thing to do in the end. It wasn't just about her and Jon but also about the girl he had to marry and the man that was now hers.</p><p>Sansa decided that if she couldn't bear the idea to be married to the man chosen by the Ministry, she would simply run and disappear into the muggle world until the law would be removed.</p><p>Her next destination was Winterfell. The northern castle made of stone and ice always had a comforting effect on her, even after her parents died. Her brother Robb was now the Lord of Winterfell and she knew that he would protect her no matter what she decided to do.</p><p>Settling on her bed, Sansa kept staring at the folded little piece of paper in her hand, as she didn't find the courage yet to open it. <em>Go on, Sansa, it isn't that hard. You can do it.</em></p><p>She took a deep breath and closed her eyes before unfolding carefully the time bomb that was the paper.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, she released a breath she hadn't noticed she was holding. Before her eyes was the most unexpected name:</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Petyr Baelish</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>***</p><p>That night she dreamed about the man with green-grey eyes that never really smiled when his mouth did. She relived the years under his tutelage as Defence against Dark Arts Professor. He had been the first not to suffer of the jinx on the position and had remained her DADA teacher until she graduated.</p><p>Now that she thought about it, strange things had occurred that she had at the time dismissed as simple reassurance but that now made her think there was more to it.</p><p>In third year for example, as they were working to fight their greatest fears with boggarts, she had suddenly been incapable of performing the Riddikulus charm and watched her parents' assassin, Ramsay Bolton, coated in their blood and still holding the knife he had killed them with come close to her with an overjoyed smile.</p><p>Seeing her panic, Professor Baelish had expelled the boggart before dismissing the class and before she snap back to reality, he had flung his arms around her and held her tight against him, comforting her with sweet words and caressing her hair. She remembered how much she had cried that day in his warm embrace smelling of mint and how she had clutched at his soft tunic. He had called her <em>sweetling</em> for the first time that day. She had been positively embarrassed afterwards but he had quickly reassured her by telling her he knew what she was going through and hoping he had been of any support.</p><p>The psychopath wizard had killed them with his father as they were all dining. Since he was only a bastard, Ramsay had never seemed much of a threat but he had developed an unhealthy attraction to blood. He came in that night with his hand and his favourite hunting knife. Stunning everyone, he Cruciated them and laughed when he saw their bodies shake in pain and fear. Afterwards he took the knife and savagely killed them.</p><p>When asked why he murdered them Ramsay smiled and said it was for the fun of doing it. Sansa hoped he suffered enough for what he had done in his high-security cell in Azkaban at the hand of the Dementors though it would never bring her parents back.</p><p>She didn't cry her parents anymore but it still hurt to know she would never see them again, that she'll never see her mother's smile or hear her father's laugh again. There were living photos of course, yet it never felt the same.</p><p>Petyr Baelish had helped her that day more than he knew. She had needed support and not what she usually received, pity, and he had provided her some.</p><p>She drifted off replaying her times with Professor Baelish</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p>
  <em>"Students, please gather in the middle of the room, thank you" </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The last of the fifth year students had finished entering the room and they all found themselves facing their DADA Professor also being the Head of the Slytherin. Sansa found herself in the front row with next to another Slytherin and a Gryffindor but her attention was only focused on the words coming out of her Professor's mouth. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>"As you see, today's lesson is a bit special since we will practice a new spell: the Patronus Charm. I want you now to find a happy memory and focus on the joy it brings you. Once you are sure of it, I want you to distinctly say the incantation: Expecto Patronum. Let me show you." </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Retrieving his finely shaped dark oak wand, Professor Baelish took a large breath before reciting for all to hear: "Expecto Patronum"<br/> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>The silence of the room broke as a silver mockingbird emanated from his wand before flying up to the ceiling. Everyone in the room wanted to know what their Patronus would look like even though some from old families like Sansa's were hoping their Patronus to be similar to their family sigil. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sansa chose a spot in the room with sufficient space and closed her eyes trying to concentrate on one of the happy days at Winterfell. She missed the castle and the cold landscapes she called home. She pictured clearly the day they had celebrated the arrival of her letter for Hogwarts.</em>
</p><p>
  <em> Her parents had been so proud of her and they had spent the day at Diagon Alley buying her the supplies for the upcoming school year. All the way back home, Sansa had asked what was in the big box her father was holding and the only indications she received were her parents' conspirators-like smiles. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>When she could finally open the box, she discovered they had bought her an adorable puppy she learned was a direwolf, sigil of House Stark. She had spent the rest of the evening playing with Lady, as she called her wolf, and eating lemon cakes with her family. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Yes, she could feel that she was ready now and with a smile on her face, she whispered the spell. As expected, a silver direwolf escaped from her wand before running around in the room. Following the wolf's movement, her eyes met his and the rest seemed to disappear. He looked proud of her, his usual smirk almost growing into a genuine smile. He looked up at her Patronus again and then frowned.<br/> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Looking up then, Sansa stood frozen as she watched her wolf playing around with his mockingbird. She blushed when she saw that the bird had nuzzled up against the wolf's fur and was affectionately nipping at it. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>When she met Professor Baelish's eyes again, he seemed angered and bothered by her attention as he abruptly turned his back to her to help a student.<br/> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Back up the ceiling, the mockingbird was gone. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>***</p><p> </p><p>Sansa felt very nervous and hadn't stop pulling on her dress the whole evening wanting most of all to make good impression.</p><p>Two days ago, a beautiful white owl had knocked on the window of her bedroom at Winterfell with in its claws a letter from Professor Baelish. She immediately recognised his elegant writing she had so many times seen on her essays or on the board, yet it felt special since it was meant specifically for her now.</p><p>The letter was concise, asking her if she agreed meeting him in Muggle London to speak about their situation.</p><p>So now here she was, on her way to a café near Hyde Park to meet up with her future husband she knew since she was eleven years old and who was incidentally her teacher and Head of House. God, the whole thing felt ridiculous said this way.</p><p>She spotted him at the terrace, giving his back to her and she stopped when she realised what it meant. She could still run and build a future somewhere else. She could still escape what the Ministry had decided for her. Yet, what if it was what she had been waiting for? A purpose given to her life that might replace the unsettling feeling of emptiness she lived with for years now?</p><p>It took a lot of her but she decided to use some of Gryffindor's bravery to come closer to the table and speak.</p><p>"Hello sir" she said shyly.</p><p>He looked up at her with surprised eyes before sending her one of his rare smiles.</p><p>"I never thought you'd actually come Miss Stark."</p><p>"Yet I am standing in front of you, sir. And please, call me Sansa. "Miss Stark" feels awkward seeing the circumstances."</p><p>He chuckled and Sansa thought she could become intoxicated with his deep laugh.</p><p>"You're right Sansa but then you must call me Petyr."</p><p>"Very well. Petyr." She tasted his name and decided she liked the way it fell on her tongue as much as hearing him say her name with his peculiar accent she always found enticing.</p><p>"So, Petyr, why didn't you think I would come?"</p><p>"It is as if you were asking me why a woman as intelligent as yourself would embarrass herself with an arranged marriage when she can have the whole world at her feet." His eyes she could easily drown herself in were holding a mysterious glint that seemed to penetrate her mind and body.</p><p>"But the world isn't worth it if we can't share it with someone." She almost said with the <em>ones we love</em> but she restrained herself.</p><p>"How could you know for sure you want this someone to be me?"</p><p>Was it now a look of melancholy passing on his face? He seemed lost in thoughts and suddenly she understood. Her mother! That was it. She remember hearing one day about his story with her mother, how he had fought in hope she would choose him and almost died of it.</p><p>There was a profound sense of loneliness in his question, as if he thought nobody could actually care about him.</p><p>Sansa decided to be bold for once and took his hand in hers. Flustered at her own action, she looked down but having his hand in hers felt better than the few physical contacts she had had during the last weeks. It felt as right as the day he had hugged her in the deserted classroom.</p><p>Sansa wanted to be sincere. "I don't know if I'll ever love you but I've always admired your knowledge and respected you as a competent teacher and head of house. You were there for me countless of times so I'll do anything I can to repay you for your help. I trust you Petyr."</p><p>She hadn't noticed but she had begun caressing his hand, tracing the path of his veins with her fingertips. She suddenly dropped his hand and made eye contact.</p><p>Now his stare was intense as if he wanted to be sure she was telling the truth.</p><p>"I should tell you not to trust me but I would never harm you. I hope you know it."</p><p>"I do."</p>
