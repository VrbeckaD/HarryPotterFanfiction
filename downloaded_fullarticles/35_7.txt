    <p>
  <span>A fire crackled in the grate while Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat, attempting to make plans for Ron and Hermione’s upcoming nuptials.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, Ron, we are not having orange and blue as our wedding colors! Those are Cannon colors and you know it! I was thinking of a nice mulberry, and maybe navy?” Hermione said, trying and failing to take Ron’s attention away from the quidditch game being broadcast over the wireless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry, when are you going to get married?” Ron asked out of the blue. “I haven’t seen you with any birds since you and Ginny broke up. And, Hermione and I both know that you’re seeing someone! Fess up, Potter!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sound like Draco,” Harry mumbled, but he was interrupted by an owl tapping at the window. Hermione opened it and the owl flew straight to Harry, sticking it’s leg out and clicking it’s beak impatiently. Harry grabbed the parchment from the owls leg and it gave a feeble hoot of thanks before flying back through the open window.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who’s sending you mail at this hour?” Ron sputtered, still reeling from Harry calling Draco by his first name.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know…” Harry murmured, opening the letter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It read:</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Harry-</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I’m pregnant.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>-DM</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck. I have to go, good luck with the colors!” By the time Ron and Hermione had fully processed the whole scene, Harry was out the door. The letter was still on the table.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ron, don’t you dare pick that letter up!” Hermione yelped, but it was too late.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Holy shite, Harry’s knocked up a girl!” Ron gasped. Hermione wheeled around, grabbing the letter from his hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ron. Ron, look at the signature,” she whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s only an initial. Just says DM. Wonder who that could be.” Ron said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ron. DM. I should’ve known. I mean he’s been so distant recently, and just now, calling Draco by his first name…” Hermione continued.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. No way” Ron mumbled, realising what she meant. “But… Can men even get pregnant? Is Harry even into guys? Holy shite!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh my God. Harry’s having a baby. With Draco Malfoy.” Hermione concluded.</span>
