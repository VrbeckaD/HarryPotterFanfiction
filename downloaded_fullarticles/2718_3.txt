</p><p>“I can’t do it. You’ll have to,” she whispered through tears as she held out her hand to him.</p><p>He took her hand in his. Clasping it between his two and looked down.</p><p>--<br/> Earlier that day</p><p>Rain pounded on the windows and gusts of wind blew tree branches alongside the room making long scratching noises from the outside. It was getting later in the day and Lily rummaged through her closet pulling out sweaters and pants.</p><p>“I picked up the IDs. They took longer this morning than I was expecting since you didn’t want them spelled. They’re in my purse or do you want yours now?” She asked. She had a green dress in her hands and she debated whether or not she should take it.</p><p>“I can’t go with you,” James spoke quietly from the bed as he watched Lily pack. She placed the dress back on the closet rod and picked James’ navy cardigan. She removed it from its hanger, folded it and walked to the bed where she placed it neatly in her suitcase next to her Hogwarts scarf.</p><p>Lily turned towards him slowly, “What do you mean?”</p><p>He looked up at her. His eyes fierce. “Lily, I can’t go with you.”</p><p>Lily shook her head as she took in his meaning, shocked. “You can’t be serious.”</p><p>James rose from the bed and caught her hands in his. Grasping them tightly. “Lily.”</p><p>Tears leaked from her eyes as she shut them fiercely shaking her head back and forth. “You want us to separate.”</p><p>James looked down and caressed her hands with his own and then slowly brought them up to her face crossing her neck until they moved back and forth across her cheeks. She opened her eyes as she pressed her cheek into his hand. “Lily, I can’t leave them and…” he trailed off.</p><p>She nodded. “You’re worried they can’t do it without you.”</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and rested his head against hers. “I don’t know that but I can’t risk them failing. There’s too much at stake. I have to stay to fight.” Choking on the words that were too bitter to speak. Words he was too terrified to speak lest they become real.</p><p>“You could…” Lily began but then stopped. The tears fell hard now and she couldn’t see through them. James ran his fingers along her cheeks brushing them away as they fell. He kissed her forehead softly.</p><p>She nodded her head fiercely. She sniffed several times as she regained control and wiped her fingers across her cheeks. “Okay, then this is what we’ll do. We’ll separate,” she spoke softly and nodded. “I can still get everyone together over the next few days and I can say goodbye. We can explain.”</p><p>James began shaking his head quickly. “No.”</p><p>“No?” Lily asked unsure of what he meant.</p><p>“No goodbyes. If I’m not going with you then we need to do this as quickly as possible. I want you far away before anyone knows anything. I want you to finish packing,” he paused before finishing, “and then leave immediately.”</p><p>He went to the suitcase and pulled the Hogwarts scarf out. Lily’s eyes went to it and she saw him run his fingers through it. “You can’t take this,” he whispered, “there can’t be any traces.”</p><p>“Leave immediately? You mean now? Tonight?” Tears welled in her eyes as the realization sank in further and she started to shake her head. Her throat was thick and she wanted to say more but the reality of the situation and what James wanted was catching up with her. She would be separated from him. This would be the last moments they shared for who knew how long or perhaps even for…she didn’t finish the thought. She couldn’t. She swallowed deeply.</p><p>James returned by her side and brushed her tears away and kissed her cheeks. He grasped her arms strongly. “This has to work. So, we have to move quickly. I can’t risk anything happening to you so you have to leave as soon as possible. We can’t risk it, Lily.” James buried his face in her neck and she smoothed his hair down, running her fingers through it while she wept.</p><p>They stayed that way with their arms wrapped tightly around one another, rocking back and forth and kissing slowly.</p><p>--</p><p>“I can’t do it. You’ll have to,” she whispered through tears as she held out her hand to him.</p><p>He took her hand in his. Clasping it between his two and looked down. “It’s only a ring, Lily. We’re still married even if you aren’t wearing it,” he whispered as he took the ring in his two fingers and slid the gold band from her finger. Then he reached around his own neck unclasping the chain that hung there and placed the band through it before re-clasping it and letting it fall to his chest.</p><p>Lily’s hand went immediately to it as she rested her hand over her ring and his heart, together as one.</p><p>“Will you take me to the station?</p><p>James shook his head. “No, I shouldn’t know anything…” he trailed off as he picked up her suitcase and opened the door before setting it down again and turning towards her. “I love you.” He grabbed her and kissed her hard. “We’ll be together again. I promise.”</p><p>Promises meant little now during these times but she appreciated it and found herself clinging to it. She rested her hand on his cheek as they both closed their eyes. “I love you too.”<br/> --</p><p>
  <em>James, I only left you hours ago but I feel sick. Even though I’m taking breaths and my feet move me forward, my heart doesn’t feel like it’s beating. I want to return, I want to say that we’re making a mistake but I know that we’re not. Thank you for being strong. Thank you for being able to make this decision. I know I couldn’t. I know how difficult it was for you to stay behind, how difficult it was for you to watch me walk away.</em>
</p><p>Lily closed the journal as she heard the announcement for her plane. She stood and collected her bag. Unsure of when she would return she lingered by the window a moment, watching as heavy rain fell on the dark night before turning and taking her first steps in a long journey, away from England.</p>
