    <p>Hermione stared at the same page for over an hour.  The holidays were always so hard, and with December just a few days away and the Advent Celebrations starting Friday, that was all she could think about.  She was sitting in her living room curled up on the couch, a cup of tea in one hand and a book in the other.  Her mind kept drifting to Ginny’s invitation for the first advent celebration this coming weekend.  She loved her friends, but the holiday season just wasn't the same without her parents.  And when Ron left to pursue other options, she felt even more alone.  It had been eight months since she found out about his extracurricular activities.  Ginny had assured her that Ron was in France for the holidays and wouldn’t be home.  The knock on the door shook her out of her thoughts.</p><p>Hermione pulled her housecoat tight as the draft caught her when she stood up.  Slowly she walked to the door and opened it.</p><p>“Ok, put the book up, get dressed, we are going out,” Ginny stated firmly as she pushed her way in the door.</p><p>“Gin, seriously, it is a work night.” Hermione shut the door and followed Ginny into her room.</p><p>“Call in sick, you are the boss.  Besides you need to get out of the house before you become an old cat lady.”  Tabby meowed behind Ginny right on cue. Harry had given Tabby to Hermione after Crookshanks died.  Tabby was a solid black kitten with one white paw. She was exactly what Hermione needed at the time.  </p><p>“Nothing wrong with me liking cats or staying home to read.” Hermione pouted as she sat on the edge of her bed watching as Ginny went through her closet.</p><p>“Liking them, no, there isn't a thing wrong with that, but only having cats in your life is not ok.  I will protect you from yourself.  Now get dressed, or I will apparate us the way you are currently dressed.” Ginny smiled politely and then started looking for shoes to match the simple red dress she had picked out.</p><p>Hermione looked down at her sleep pants, camisole, and housecoat, sighing loudly in protest, she picked up the dress and headed to the bathroom.  The frock was a simple satin, off the shoulder sweetheart dress that fell just above Hermione’s knees.  She hadn’t worn or even seen this dress in months.  Hermione never had much need for dresses like this anymore.  She looked at herself in the mirror and did a quick spin.  She loved the way the dress made her feel young.</p><p>As she twirled, she giggled to herself but quickly stopped as a tear ran down her face.  She couldn't do this. She didn’t know how to be carefree, to throw caution to the wind.  As the years passed, she seemed to lose more and more of that.  The war had affected everyone, but she seemed to be stuck.  She had no family, and when she lost Ron, she felt worthless.  Hermione had always been confident and in charge, but Ron’s leaving her shook her to the core.  Sure she was hit on all the time, but she always felt like it was a joke, that she was a joke.</p><p>Ginny walked in and grabbed Hermione’s face.  “You are beautiful, smart, strong, funny, and a force to be reckoned with.  My brother was and still is a dunce.  He was never good enough for you.  He always made you dim your light so he could feel brighter.  Not anymore.  You will shine bright and find a man who will love you for it and make you even brighter.” Ginny wiped the tear from Hermione’s face and with a flick of her wand Hermione’s hair was in big curls, and light makeup enhanced her features.  </p><p>Hermione just nodded, afraid if she spoke the emotions would get the better of her.  She slipped the black heels on and grabbed her handbag.</p><p>Ginny smiled, grabbed her hand and apparated them in an alley just a couple of blocks from The Crosse Keys in London.  It was a muggle pub located in an old bank.  Hermione and her friends had found it years ago.  It helped that muggles had no idea who they were.  It allowed the group to just be young adults.</p><p>As Ginny opened the door that music filled the air.  There was a quiet rustle to the sound.  It was pleasantly crowded, not too many people, but also not too quiet.  Ginny waved at Harry who was sitting at a back table.  Hermione put on a smile and headed to the bar.  A scotch neat was calling her name.</p><p>After receiving her drink, she made her way through the crowd to the table her friends were occupying.  She hugged Harry, gave a short nod to Neville, Hannah, and Theo, who were sitting against the wall.  Then she hugged Daphne before she sat down next to Draco.  The odd group had started spending more time together after their 8th year at Hogwarts.  Old rivalries had been put aside, more so now that Ron had gone his own way.  Ron always had a hard time letting go of the past and moving on.  </p><p>“So glad you could grace us with your presence, Granger.” Draco’s drawl was strong.  There was no malice, only light teasing in his tone.  “I mean I’m sure as the head of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures you are incredibly busy this time of year.”  His silver eyes twinkled as he teased her.</p><p>“Yes, Malfoy, I must be ever vigilant with all those posh pureblood parties.  I wouldn’t want a house-elf to be overworked or mistreated.”  Hermione laughed lightly.</p><p>There had been a shift in the way Draco picked on her after she left Ron.  She sometimes caught him staring at her or finding reasons to talk to her while at work.  He was Harry’s partner in the Auror department.  The two wizards worked well together and had become quite close.  Ron was always jealous of the friendship that had developed between the men.  Ron could never understand how Harry and Hermione had just forgotten all the things the Slytherins had put them through.</p><p>“Are you two finished flirting yet?  I mean bloody hell get a room already.” Ginny laughed, “I mean damn Malfoy you have practically undressed her with your eyes and she has only been here five minutes.”</p><p>Daphne hid her smile behind her glass of chardonnay. “Ginny, don’t tell them. Let them figure it out on their own.  It is quite entertaining to watch Hermione be clueless about something.”</p><p>Theo leaned over and kissed Daphne. “You are so right, darling.  It is amusing watching our Draco flounder with a woman.”</p><p>“Ha Ha,” Draco threw a napkin at Theo.</p><p>Hermione blushed and coughed on the sip of her scotch.  She wasn’t flirting with Malfoy, and he certainly wasn’t flirting with her.  That wasn't even possible.  He could never see her that way.  She was a muggle-born.  Sure he had changed, and he didn’t hate her, but he could never completely let go and fall for her.  Hermione kept finding herself stealing glances of Draco.  He had relaxed.  His smile and laugh made her heart skip a beat.  He was kind, smart, funny, and sexy as hell.  When did she start to think like that?  Draco had never been on her radar.</p><p>It was getting late, and Hermione really needed to get some sleep.  The lack of sleep or the alcohol was doing something to her brain. </p><p>Getting up and grabbing her jacket and handbag she waved. “I really need to get home and get some sleep.  I do have a report due tomorrow to this Auror about some laws regarding centaurs.”  She smiled at Draco.</p><p>“Man, those Aurors are slave drivers,” Draco laughed. He had used his current case as an excuse to see her often. “Can I escort your home?  My father would turn over in his grave if he knew I forgot my manners and let a beautiful lady walk home alone.”</p><p>“I’m perfectly fine walking alone, but if you must.” She held out her arm indicating that he take the lead.</p><p>“Be good,” Harry smiled.</p><p> Ginny slapped his arm. “Don’t tell her that.  She is always good.  Hermione, be as bad as you want to be.”</p><p>Hermione just shook her head and walked out behind Draco.  She followed him to the alley.</p><p>“My lady,” Draco held out his arm so he could apparate them to her flat.  Hermione took his arm, and with a pop, they were gone.</p><p>Hermione went to open her door and turned to say good night. </p><p>Draco interrupted her, “Tell me you are coming to the Advent celebrations.  It will be extremely boring without you there to pick on.”</p><p>“I don’t know.” Hermione blushed a little. “I’m not sure I can handle the crowd.” She lookedK at her feet afraid to look him in the eyes.</p><p>“Look at me.” He lifted her chin with his finger tips.  Her eyes damp with unshed tears and the flush of embarrassment on her cheeks. “Don’t let that wanker ruin the rest of your life.  He made a stupid decision, and he will regret it for the rest of his.  Please come.”</p><p>She couldn’t speak for fear that she wouldn’t be able to contain the emotions that were welling inside.</p><p>“Just consider it,” Draco spoke once more, squeezed her hand, turned and apparated.</p><p>Hermione stepped into her flat and closed the door.  She leaned her back against the door, slid down it and started to cry.</p><p> </p>
