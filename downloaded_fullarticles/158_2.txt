    <p>Chapter 1: Before the Beginning</p><p>May 7th 1945</p><p>Charlus Potter was tired. Very, very tired. Tired of war, tired of bloodshed, and most of all tired of those who seek glory and fame through others’ accomplishments. He had led his squadron alongside his brother in all but blood, Arcturus Black deep into Grindelwald’s last line of defense. </p><p>Though Charlus was a Potter and firmly rooted in the Light, this was War and everyone knew it. Both Magical and Mundane felt the repercussions from the Second World War and the Rise of Grindelwald. While Adolf Hitler was sprouting off his ideas for a perfect society led by an Aryan Race, Gellert Grindelwald had many of the same ideals his Muggle counterpart had. He believed it was his birthright to rule over the Mundane world and establish a society where witches and wizards were known to Muggles and these Muggles would be far inferior to Magicals.</p><p> This is what Charlus was fighting against. The so called, ‘Greater Good’ which called for the mass extermination or subservience of Muggles around the world. </p><p>Charlus and Arcturus burst into the heavily fortified building that was holding the reminder of Grindelwald’s army. Like a synchronized dance, Charlus and Arcturus fought through soldiers with their advanced knowledge in Battle Magic taken directly from the Potter and Black libraries. Arcturus’ spells were borderline dark, causing Grindelwald’s soldiers to fall like puppets who’s strings were cut, while Charlus focused mainly on defense. Charlus blocked a killing curse headed for Arcturus by conjuring a marble slate, then transfigured the shards of marble into spears and banished them to the enemy. </p><p>A great explosion rocked the room as an outer wall exploded into the occupied room and the Devil himself stood among the dust and debris. With his men dead, dying or otherwise incapacitated, Gellert Grindelwald stepped up to face the remaining fighters of the Light. The tip of his relatively long wand glowing a sickly green. </p><p>With a distinct advantage, the remaining of Charlus’ forces began casting at the man who had caused so much death and destruction in Magical Europe. ‘It’s like fighting a God,’ Charlus thought to himself as Grindelwald almost effortlessly began taken down his fighters with Dark curses. The first man to fall was hit with a black curse that, on impact, began eating at the skin causing the man to fall while shrieking in pain. The man had no skin left on his body before he even hit the floor. </p><p>In no time, it was only Charlus and Arcturus left fighting the fiercest Dark Lord since Herpo the Foul of Ancient Greece. The Dark Lord sent an overpowered banishing charm at the both of them sending them flying backwards in the air. As they hit the floor hard, Charlus saw two spells coming from Grindelwald’s wand toward the both of them. Though disoriented Charlus was able to transfigure a nearby table into a large bear that attempted to jump in front of the curses. The yellow/orange curse intended for Charlus was intercepted but the bear was not fast enough to get in fron of the purple spell that hit Arcturus in the chest. </p><p>Charlus was so occupied with getting him aid that he did not see the distinguishing scarlet of the Disarming charm that hit him and knocked his wand to the other side of the room.</p><p>“And so ends Lords Potter and Black. Tell me, how does it feel knowing that without its fiercest fighters, the Light is at its end?” Grindelwald said with malice dripping from his tongue. He had barely moved from his side of the room. “Without you, there will be no one to stop m,” Grindelwald continued.</p><p>“You can kill us now Grindelwald, but you cannot kill the hope that remains,” Charlus declared defiantly. Not looking away from the Dark Lord as he held his dying friend in his arms.</p><p>“You are all fools!” Grindelwald yelled. “Wizards and witches should not be hiding from filthy Muggles. No, we should be ruling over them. We have powers they could never even dream of! They are worthless and do not deserve to lick the sum from our boots.”</p><p>“You’re wrong Grindelwald,” Charlus spat. “But I fear it is too late for you to see reason.”</p><p>“Reason...” Grindelwald drawled sarcastically. “You could have been great Potter, had you joined the right side.”</p><p>With that, Grindelwald raised the Elder Wand and said two of most horrifying words in the Wizarding World.</p><p>“AVADA KEDAVRA,” Spat the Dark Lord. The almost emerald green light flew from the 15”, thestral hair wand towards Charlus Potter. Charlus closed his eyes accepting his fate with his long time friend. </p><p>The green curse never hit Charlus however as a great marble slab appeared just before the two fallen wizards. Both Charlus and Grindelwald looked around searching for the savior when he stepped into the room through a massive hole in the wall caused by erratic spellfire.</p><p>Albus Dumbledore stepped into the light to face his former friend and lover for the last time.</p><p>“Albus, how good of you to join us,” Grindelwald said with false cheeriness. “Why don’t you walk away and let me finish these two blood traitors. We both know you cannot fight me.”</p><p>“Alas, that is where you are wrong Gellert,” Dumbledore replied calmly. “I have recently managed to dispel the Blood Pact we made all those years ago.” </p><p>At these words Charlus looked up with surprise and confusion etched upon his face while Grindelwald paled considerably at his enemy’s words. </p><p>“It matters not Albus,” Gellert declared. “I hold the Deathstick! The wand we searched for all those years ago. You cannot hope to defeat me. I will shape this world into the one we dreamed of so many years ago and despite all the power you hold, I will succeed. I MUST succeed. For the Greater Good,” he finished confidently, raising his wand up in preparation for the fight of his life. </p><p>Albus looked at his former friend with sadness and regret. No matter how hard he looked, the young man he once loved no longe showed through his heterochromatic eyes. But he could not give up on Gellert. He knew there was a chance that he would be able to be brought back from the Dark path he had been set on for so many years.</p><p>“Gellert please do not do this,” Albus pleaded, holding his hands out to in front of him. “Please drop this foolish quest and come back to the Light.”</p><p>The only response Dumbledore received was the light of spellfire that came his way from the Dark Lord. And thus one of the most spectacular duels of all time began. </p><p>Spells rang out around the room in an impressive display of magic that no one had ever seen before. Spells of a questionable nature came flying from the Elder Wand of the Dark Lord Gellert Grindelwald and clashed with the 13” Ebony wand of Albus Dumbledore. </p><p>—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————</p><p>Charlus looked on in awe at the two sorcerers battling with all of their hearts. He had pulled the dying form of his friend out of the way to avoid being hit by a stray spell. He had retrieved his wand and was running it over Arcturus’ prone body with diagnostic charms. Though he was a soldier and not a healer, he still had battlefield healing as a part of his arsenal. The results of the diagnostic charm were not positive however. He sighed in defeat as tears started to pool in his eyes. As the tears started to fall he heard a rasping breath being taken and felt a hand roughly grab the the front of his battle robes.</p><p>“Charlus...please...” Arcturus called out in a hoarse voice that shattered the General’s heart. “I need...I need you to.. to promise me.”</p><p>“Arcturus my brother please stop, please save your strength,” Charlus begged. “I am going to get you out of here.”</p><p>Arcturus half chuckled, half coughed. Blood started running from his nose and mouth. “We both know... I won’t make it brother. I need you to make this pact with me.” Though he was struggling to speak, Charlus could see determination and hope through the pain displayed on Arcturus’ face.</p><p>“What do you need from me?” Charlus asked, watching his powerful and strong friend in such a state was painful for him to see.</p><p>“A blood pact. A blood pact to secure our families,” Arcturus choked out just before a coughing fit struck his body causing blood to fly from his mouth. “A pact to each other that Magic itself will aid us in.</p><p>“Please...please swear to me that the Potters will look out for those of Black blood in need of aid, and I will do the same. Promise me that should a time come,” Arcturus paused as another violent coughing fit racked his body. “Should the time come, the Noble and... Most Ancient House of Potter... will help those in need from the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black,” Arcturus begged Charlus as tears of blood began to pour down the injured man’s face. Charlus looked at him with affection and loyalty in his eyes and nodded slowly, drawing his wand.</p><p>“I Charlus Hadrian Potter, Lord of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Potter, do hereby swear this oath of friendship and family to the House of Black. Whenever a Black is in need, a Potter shall be at their side. Should a Black go to War, a Potter shall be by their side. On my magic and my life, so I swear, so mote it be.” A flash of white light flashed from the tip of his wand, signifying the acceptance of the magical oath.</p><p>Arcturus looked to Charlus in sadness and determination, blood still pouring from eyes, nose, mouth and ears. “Charlus help me raise my wand,” he requested softly as his life force was flowing steadily from his body. The slow moving organ-liquefying curse had almost run its course. Charlus, tears flowing heavier than ever, obeyed his friend’s last request.</p><p>“I Arcturus Orion Black, Lord of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, do hereby wear this oath of friendship and family to the House of Potter. Whenever,” Arcturus stopped to cough as his eyes began to glaze over and the liveliness left them, leaving a haunted look. “Whenever a Potter is in need, a Black shall be at their side. Should a Potter go to War, a Black shall be by their side. On my m-magic and my l-life, so I swear, so mote it b-b-be,” he finished, gasping out the last sentence with extreme difficulty. A white light flashed from his wand and a golden light formed and bound the two families together for eternity. As the golden light diminished, Arcturus’ hand went limp. The last of his life force leaving his body leaving him dead in the arms of his brother in all but blood. An inhumane howl left the throat of Charlus Potter as he felt the life leave his best friend.</p><p>—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————</p><p>Albus Dumbledore was tired. The duel between Gellert and himself had taken a lot of his magic as he had to fend of attack after attack. Blood flowed from multiple wounds, courtesy of a few cutting curses, and his left shoulder was shattered from a bone-breaker. As he looked up from his cover at his adversary, he saw Gellert sporting a few wounds himself. His last two fingers on his non-dominant hand were in the ground and a nasty burn covered his chest. However, he was only breathing heavily as opposed to Albus’ exhaustion. The power of the Elder Wand allowing his magic to flow easier with more power than other wands allow. The air between them was filled with dust from the damage of the room they had started, where Charlus Potter sat sobbing holding the body of Arcturus Black. </p><p>Albus was just thinking over his next plan of action when an overpowered piercing hex struck the transfigured stone he was hiding behind and caught him in his right collarbone. A cry of pain escaped his mouth as he dropped his wand and fell forward. Gellert dispelled his cover and slowly walked toward him. Like a predator stalking his prey. </p><p>“It doesn’t have to be like this Albus,” Gellert said gently. “Please my old friend. Join my side and together we can change the world to suit our needs. We can accomplish all those goals we had as young men. We can find the other two Hallows and become the Masters of Death. I have you beaten Albus, but I do not want to see you die. Please my love, join me and together we can bring her back.” </p><p>Albus looked up at him sharply at those words and looked into his eyes. He saw no deceit in the blue and brown eyes he grew up with. Only sincerity and, dare he hope, love? Albus would lie if he said he was not tempted, so tempted in fact the he probably would have accepted his Love’s proposition had he not seen the glowing aura of Charlus Potter standing out of Gellert’s line of sight. The anger and hate emanated from his eyes as he sent a cutting curse in his rage filled state. The curse struck Gellert in the upper back leaving a deep gash going from one shoulder to the other. </p><p>Gellert cried out and turned his attention to the young man behind him. And sent spell after spell at the returning combatant. Albus crawled away from the fight in search of his lost wand while Gellert and Charlus fought each other like possessed men. Unfortunately for Charlus, Gellert was among the greatest duelists the world had ever seen and was exceptionally more powerful than the young Lord Potter. Gellert sent a spell chain consisting of a cutter, shield breaker, followed up by a bone-breaker that caught Charlus in the chest and shattered his sternum. Breathing heavily in uneven gasps, Charlus crawled away from the Dark Lord as he raised his wand to finish the Lord Potter. What he did not see however was Albus finding his wand and sending his own spell chain at Gellert. </p><p>Having made his choice, influenced by the fight that had just occurred, Albus sent three overpowered spells at the unsuspecting Dark Lord. A disarming charm ripped the Elder Wand from his grasp as four thick ropes bound him tightly. Lastly a bone-breaker aimed true connected with Gellert’s legs shattering his knees and rendering him defeated. Albus walked over to Charlus and after a quick diagnostic charm, mended the bones in his chest and put him to sleep with a sleeping charm. </p><p>He looked over to the downed Dark Lord sadly and spoke, “Why did you have to go about it that way Gellert? Why did you leave me all those years ago when I needed you? I needed comfort and you left me.” Albus looked at him with tears in his eyes and continued, “Why did you have to kill all those innocents? It could have all been different had you stayed with me.”</p><p>Albus bent down and picked up the Elder Wand and felt the power flow through his veins. He sent red sparks through the collapsed ceiling into the night sky to signal the Allies that they had won and looked down at the wand in his hand. At that moment he had an epiphany. A wand with this much power has a chance to be corrupted as Gellert had. He decided at that moment that he could not bear to use this wand as the power of it would undoubtedly corrupt him. The legend of the Elder wand says as much. </p><p>After the leaders of the International Confederation of Wizards had taken Grindelwald and any other captured soldiers into custody, the wounded were healed and went on their way with medals distinguishing their service. The very next day after his Magical counterpart was defeated in battled, Adolf Hitler, Dictator of Germany surrendered and went into hiding, thus ending the Second World War. Albus Dumbledore was celebrated as the hero of the Wizarding World and declared the Leader of the Light. No one knew of the involvement of Charlus Potter and Arcturus Black in the final fight, and no one involved said anything otherwise.</p><p>—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————</p><p>Two weeks later, a recovered Albus Dumbledore strolled down the streets of Diagon Alley with one goal in mind. As he reached his destination he opened the shop door and walked in seeing the familiar shelves filled its long, thin boxes. </p><p>“Albus Dumbledore, 13” ebony with a core of unicorn hair,” a voice said from behind him. “If I remember correctly this wand is very well suited for Transfiguration.”</p><p>“Ah Gervaise, how wonderful to see you again,” Dumbledore said. The middle aged man stepped from the shadows into Albus’ line of sight and greeted him with a handshake. Albus was brought back to when he first visited the store on his eleventh birthday to buy his trusted wand. He looked around the store in a state of nostalgia when he noticed a young man of about thirty-five organizing the shelves. “And who might this be?” He asked.</p><p>“Albus I would like to introduce you to my son, Garrick,” Gervaise Ollivander replied in a voice filled with pride. “Garrick this is Professor Albus Dumbledore, Tranfiguration professor and Deputy Headmaster at Hogwarts. I believe you graduated just a few years before Albus took up his role as professor.” Garrick shook the man of the Defeater of Grindelwald in not a little awe. On seeing this Albus chuckled merrily.</p><p>“My dear boy please call me Albus, I am merely a man who practiced his hardest to become the best wizard he could be,” Albus said to the awed young man to put him at ease, his eyes twinkling madly.</p><p>Gervaise decided to save his son from embarrassment and shoes this moment to speak up, “Albus what can I do for you? You do not need a new wand do you?” He asked a little disapprovingly, as if a broken wand was an insult to him.</p><p>“Alas, no Gervaise I am afraid I must ask a rather large favor from you is there someplace we can speak in private?” Albus asked.</p><p>“Of course the workshop in the back will do just fine,” Gervaise responded with a raised eyebrow. “However I must insist Garrick come along and attend our meeting. After all, he will be taking over this shop in mere years.”</p><p>Albus looked from Gervaise to Garrick considering this request. It would not do to alienate the wandmaker by disregarding his wishes. Any other wandmaker would not agree to his demands.</p><p>“Very well,” Albus stated. </p><p>In the workshop Albus told the story of his defeat of Grindelwald and how he had come into possession of the Wand of Destiny, the Deathstick, the Elder Wand. Gervaise and Garrick looked at the wand in awe and waited for Albus to ask his favor.</p><p>“So please, I ask of you to hold onto this wand,” Albus pleaded. “Keep it safe, keep it a secret. At this point in time I am the Master of the Elder Wand so it would most likely not work better than a wand suited for someone else. I choose to keep this wand secret because as it corrupted Grindelwald, it could very well corrupt me. As a result if I ever come looking for it you must deny me. I cannot be trusted with this power.”</p><p>After what seemed like hours but was really only a few moments, Gervaise responded, “ Aye you are probably right Albus. We will hold this wand safely and keep it a secret until the end of our days. What would happen in this wand were to be particularly suited to an eleven year old purchasing a wand?” He asked curiously.</p><p>Albus looked at him apprehensively and said not a little condescendingly, “I doubt very much that this wand would choose a witch or wizard before they start their Magical Education.”</p><p>Anger and irritation flowed through the Ollivanders but with their developed Occlumency shields, they were both able to effectively hide their reactions easily. </p><p>“Very well Dumbledore, we will do as you ask,” Gervaise said as Garrick nodded his agreement. Albus did not catch the change of using his last name and stood up to leave. </p><p>“Thank you Gervaise, I hope you enjoy your day. Garrick it was a pleasure to meet you,” Albus started cordially as he shook their hands and departed the store, not realizing of course that fifty years from that day the Elder Wand would be in the hands of one of the most powerful wizard to ever live.</p>
