    <p>Narcissa Black always had the strangest feeling that her fate was already woven for her: she was merely following the string wherever it wanted to take her. She was sixteen, however, when she realized -- during the summer after her 6th year of Hogwarts -- how little influence she truly had over the path of her own life.</p>
<p>She'd tell herself, and everyone else, years later that she was not forced into anything, but she never denied that she was coerced, lied to, threatened, and otherwise convinced. Life was a bitch sometimes, but it was even more of a bitch when you were a pureblood aristocratic witch from one of the oldest families, as well as one of three daughters of parents who were really hoping their final child would be a male. No such luck was had by the Master and Mistress of the noble House of Black, and Narcissa knew, as she was simultaneously their youngest, prettiest, and easiest to marry off, that she was going to have to pay for it.</p>
<p>Her penance came in the form of a handsome yet terrifying blonde wizard from Durmstrang who was both three years older and a hell of a lot less innocent than she was -- she could tell by the predatory gleam in his cold blue eyes -- by the name of Lucius Malfoy. Her parents saw him as yet another tie to the Dark Lord -- as if her sister Bellatrix’s vehemence for the cause wasn't enough -- as well as a way to distance themselves from the other, more scandalous, branch of the family, which was headed by her father's brother and tarnished by the betrayal of her cousin Sirius and the idiocy and failure of her cousin Regulus. And, of course, his extensive family fortune was quite a motivation to welcome him to the family.</p>
<p>Of course, Narcissa knew that she would be the one to carry the burden, as her sisters were not truly fit for the job: Bella had already been promised to Rodolphus Lestrange since the day she was born, in order to solidify the ties between the previously feuding families, and the second oldest sister, Andromeda, was not exactly a point of pride to Narcissa’s strict and proper parents. ‘Dromeda had never shown an appreciation for etiquette or pureblood customs: especially arranged marriages.</p>
<p>However, despite the fact that Narcissa could practically see the path her life would take illuminated in the darkness, she still dared to hope for the best on that first evening when one Lucius Malfoy and his parents were invited over for a formal dinner. She was soon to discover that this hope was entirely unfounded and naive.</p>
