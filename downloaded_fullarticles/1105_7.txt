    <p class="">
  <span>“…and that’s why I think the Cannons will actually have a chance against the Arrows.” Charlie Weasley looked up from his mug of tea, which he had been stirring while talking, only to find his youngest brother wearing a glazed look on his face. He followed Ron’s gaze and smirked.</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>Hermione Granger stood across the room with Ginny and his mum, chatting away happily. He had to agree that she was pretty with her brown, curly hair. From what he had heard about her, she was also highly intelligent and cared about all sorts of creatures. All in all, a witch after his own heart. That is if she wasn’t seven years his junior, and he wasn’t head over heels in love with someone else. But nobody needed to know about that just yet.</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>In any case, Ron looked like a proper love-struck fool and there was plenty of fun to be had with that bit of information.</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“Ron?” he prompted. When he still didn't respond, Charlie waved a hand in front of his brother’s face. Ron jumped, his face and ears burning bright red.  He swatted Charlie’s hand away.</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“What’d you do that for?”</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>Charlie snorted. He picked up his mug and nonchalantly pointed it at Hermione before he took a sip and fixed Ron with an amused stare. Before Ron could say anything, he said quietly, “Don’t even deny it. Does she know how far gone you are?”</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>Ron’s shoulders slumped and he shook his head. “I’m trying,” he mumbled. “But it’s never the right time, and I haven’t gotten her alone, and then mum-”</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“What have you tried?” Charlie asked, interrupting as he leaned back in his chair. He might not be the smoothest talker himself, but he did think he knew how to win over a witch's heart. Ron mumbled a response he couldn’t understand.</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“Say that again in English?”</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“Fred 'n’ George gave me this book and… and I tried some… things.” He nervously glanced at Hermione.</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“Things?” Charlie raised an eyebrow. “From a book the <em>twins</em> gave you?” He chuckled and shook his head.</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“I know what you’re thinking but this isn’t them taking the piss, for once.” Ron looked defiant even in his mortified state of having been caught staring at Hermione.</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“So, what kind of <em>things</em>?”</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>Ron shuffled in his seat. “Pull out her chair, open doors for her… those kinds of things.”</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>Charlie nodded approvingly. “That’s a good start. Did you compliment her? Tell her she looks nice? That her hair’s lovely with those tousled curls?” he asked as he looked over at the three chatting women. Ron sat up straighter and fixed Charlie with a hard stare.</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“You really think so?” he responded in a somewhat colder tone.</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“Yeah, I think so. Why—?” </span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“Don’t.”</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“What?” Charlie thought he must have missed something. He really did think that complimenting worked wonders. </span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“I don’t want you to look at her like that,” Ron replied. Charlie chuckled. <em>Oh!</em></span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“Don’t worry Ronnikins. Keep your jealousy for another time when it’s justified. I’m not interested in her that way.” Ron visibly relaxed but kept a close eye on his older brother anyway.</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span> “Seriously though, Ron. She is a pretty girl and intelligent to boot. If you don’t make a proper move soon, somebody else sure will.”</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“I’m working on it.” </span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“Working on what?” Hermione asked just as she slid into the seat next to Ron. Ron startled.</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“He’s working on his technique,” Charlie answered for him. He couldn’t help but grin behind his almost empty mug. Ron fixed him with yet another stare while his blush deepened even more.</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span> “Technique of what? Maybe I can help?” she asked.</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“Quidditch,” Ron croaked and watched almost happily when Hermione blushed slightly as his hand brushed her arm in his haste to grab his own tea mug.</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span> “Oh. Okay.”</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span> “Do you like Quidditch, curly?” Charlie asked her. Both Ron and Hermione stared at him. “Sorry,” he laughed. “I’ll leave you two to it then shall I?” Charlie got up. “Best of luck Ron.” He winked at Hermione and left.</span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“Best of luck?” </span>
</p>
<p class="">
  <span>“Yeah,” Ron said, more to himself than her. “Reckon I need it.”</span>
