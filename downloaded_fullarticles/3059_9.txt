    <p>Hermione walked into the bar, not paying much attention to anyone or anything. Her day had gone from a mildly irritable to a shit storm in less than three hours and had managed to stay that way the entire rest of the day. All she wanted now was to forget the past 12 hours in a bottle of red wine and a crowd of people who didn't know her as the female member of the golden trio. The more people she could surround herself with, the more she would be able to distract herself into not thinking. And this bar seemed like just the place. </p><p>After opening a tab and thanking the bartender for his generous pour, she found herself at a table in the back of the bar, shielded from view by most and able to watch and listen to the steady drone of conversation around her. She thought it strange that, on a Friday night, there wasn't any sort of horrible dance music playing. As if on cue, the lights dim and a drummer, bassist, and guitar player walk out to the makeshift stage at the opposite end of the bar. </p><p><em>'Great, just what I need.' </em>she thought. <em>'A sub-par cover band playing pop songs out of tune for the drunken revelers to relieve their glory days. Just add this to the rest of my day.' </em> </p><p>She would stay until she finished her wine. It would be a waste to leave it mostly full; it really was a good red.</p><p> </p><p>____________________________</p><p> </p><p><em><strong>"Ooohhm"</strong></em>  the first notes rang out into the bar. </p><p>Severus smirked to himself, hearing the crowds roar cease immediately. This was his favorite part. Let the intrigue grow before stepping out. He wanted all eyes on him. </p><p><strong><em>"Ooohhm"</em><em> </em></strong>as the second drop hit, he strode out, tambourine in hand. His eyes cut a sharp, severe picture, but that didn't mean he couldn't be playful.</p><p>Eyes cast downward, he attempted a slight smile. Soon he would reveal his gaze. He grabbed the microphone stand as the crowd clapped and cheered. Either the audience was pleasantly polite or there were a few in the crowd that had heard them play before. Stepping back, his tambourine kept pace with the drummer, flirting with the audience before raising his gaze and opening his mouth.</p><p>----</p><p>Hermione was stunned. This wasn't a shitty pop cover. This was actual, decent, music. She could feel the emotion through the bass at her feet. She could see the atmosphere of the notes as if she were in a dream. Her inner thoughts quieted as she sat, her undivided attention on the singer taking the stage. His stride matched the rhythm of the opening notes. </p><p>----</p><p>His first vocalizations rang out in the room. </p><p><strong><em> We are kneeling at the river's edge and tempting </em></strong> <em></em><br/>
<em><strong>All the steps to follow closer right behind</strong></em><br/>
<em><strong>Is it only when you feel a part is empty</strong></em><br/>
<em><strong>That it’s gnawing at the corners of your mind</strong></em></p><p>----</p><p>Hermione was unable to move. She would recognize that voice anywhere; the sultry notes, the deep grovel. Surely she must be mistaken. </p><p>----</p><p>He sang as if it were a story he was telling; maybe that's because it was. It almost sounded self deprecating.</p><p><strong><em>I will ask you for mercy</em></strong><br/>
<br/>
He smirked; it was. </p><p><em> <strong>I will come to you blind</strong> </em> <em></em><br/>
<strong><em>What you’ll see is the worst me</em></strong><br/>
<strong> <em>Not the last of my kind</em></strong></p><p>His songs never failed to transport him back in time. On his knees, sobbing, at the mercy of Dumbledore. Explaining his treachery, then later grieving the loss of Lily. </p><p>Lily. This next part was his imagination playing out her side.</p><p> </p><p><strong><em> Ooh </em> </strong><em></em><br/>
<em><strong>In the muddy water we’re falling</strong></em><br/>
<em><strong>Ooh</strong></em><br/>
<em><strong>In the muddy water we’re crawling</strong></em></p><p><em> <strong>Holds me down</strong> </em> <strong> </strong><em></em><br/>
<em><strong>Hold me now</strong></em><br/>
<em><strong>Sold me out</strong></em><br/>
<em><strong>In the muddy waters we’re falling</strong></em>  <strong> </strong></p><p>Keep it moving, Severus. </p><p>----</p><p>The story was mesmerizing. The pain, the loathing, the hurt, all coming from a few simple words. It continued.</p><p><strong><em>It is not clear why we choose the fire pathway</em></strong><br/>
<strong>Where we end is not the way that we had planned</strong><br/>
<strong>All the spirits gather 'round like it's our last day</strong><br/>
<strong>To get across you know we’ll have to raise the sand</strong></p><p>It took until the second bridge for Hermione to try to put context to the story. What was he pulling on when he wrote it? It sounded an awful lot like the memory Snape had given Harry as he lay, dying, in the Shrieking Shack. Somehow a memory didn't evoke nearly as much knowledge as the subtle caress of words coming out of his mouth or the blatant pleading leaving his throat. </p><p>----</p><p>Putting feeling in now, Severus let the chorus wash through him, accepting his actions, embracing the fact that he was never good enough for pure, sweet Lily. He looked up through the crowd, scanning for reactions. One face stuck out in the dim light and almost made him falter. Granger. He looked away, willing her not to have noticed his gaze. The next part would be difficult.</p><p>----</p><p>Not for the first time that night, she was thankful she was in the back of the bar. It felt as if she were intruding on something private. She hadn't moved the entire song. </p><p><em> <strong>Ooh</strong> </em> <em></em><br/>
<strong><em>Don’t fail me now</em></strong><br/>
<strong> <em>Put your arms around me and pull me out</em></strong><br/>
<strong> <em>Ooh</em></strong><br/>
<strong> <em>I know I’m found</em></strong><br/>
<strong> <em>With your arms around me, oh save me now</em></strong></p><p>She gasped. She shouldn't be here. Her vision was flooded with those pivotal moments in the Shrieking Shack, after Harry had ended the battle. She had gone back for him, unwilling to let him lay and rot. Leaning down over his body, she felt heat still radiating. She checked his pulse. It was weak, but still beating. With pure adrenaline and magic she didn't even know she possessed, she managed to take him to the hospital wing and make enough of a racket that Poppy had to prioritize stabilizing him. The only thing that allowed him to survive was the antivenom he had apparently downed after being summoned by Voldemort. She blinked rapidly. He had wanted to live, and they had almost left him there to die, anyway. </p><p>Did he know she was the one who went back for him? </p><p>----</p><p>He couldn't look at that entire side of the room as his last lyrics rang out. This part was for her. Did she know? He hoped she didn't.<em> He hoped she did. </em></p><p>The rest of his set would be entertaining, to say the least. He was going to have fun. Immersing himself fully into the music, the final chorus rang out. The song finished with redemption. Who didn't love a happy ending?</p><p> </p>
