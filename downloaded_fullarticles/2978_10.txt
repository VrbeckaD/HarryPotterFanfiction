          <div class="userstuff"><p>‘Will you stop blinding me, Potter?’</p><p>‘I’m trying to find an exit… Ah! There’s one here.’</p><p>‘I doubt a <em>kneazle</em> could fit through it.’</p><p> </p><p>‘What are you doing now? Trying to give me an epileptic fit?’</p><p>‘It’s Morse code, Malfoy. So we can be rescued.’</p><p>‘Who the fuck knows that code?’</p><p>‘Everyone! Well… Muggles do.’</p><p>‘You are aware that no Muggles will be strolling anywhere near the Forest?’</p><p>‘Muggleborns might.’</p><p>‘We’re trapped underground, Potter. Who do you think goes spelunking at night?’</p><p>‘<em>You</em> did.’</p><p>‘<em>I </em>was looking for the entrance to the mythical Slytherin’s Cupboard. <em>You</em> are the idiot who followed me.’</p><p> </p><p>‘How long has it been since you sent that Patronus?’</p><p>‘Ten minutes? McG will be here any moment. Don’t scoff.’</p><p> </p><p>‘Will you let the light go out, for fuck’s sake? It’s too bright.’</p><p>‘Jealous you can’t cast a Lumos this strong, Malfoy?’</p><p>‘Shut up.’</p><p> </p><p>‘I don’t like caves.’</p><p>‘No one does, Potter.’</p><p>‘Trolls do. Dwarves do. Hermits—’</p><p><em>‘Please</em>, shut up.’</p><p> </p><p>‘It’s weird being in the dark with you. Let’s play a game.’</p><p>‘What kind of game?’</p><p>‘You don’t have to sound so suspicious, Malfoy. I think of someone we both know and you ask me questions to which I can only reply yes or no. You’ll have to guess who I’m thinking of.’</p><p>‘It’s a stupid game.’</p><p> </p><p>‘Fine, Potter, let’s play it.’</p><p>‘Ask me.’</p><p>‘Are they Gryffindor?’</p><p>‘Yes.’</p><p>‘Are they male?’</p><p>‘Yes.’</p><p>‘Are they an idiot?’</p><p>‘What kind of question is that?’</p><p>‘Is it Ron Weasley?’</p><p>‘I’m not playing anymore.’</p><p> </p><p>‘It’s my turn now, Potter.’</p><p>‘Are they Slytherin?’</p><p>‘No.’</p><p>‘Are they Hufflepuff?’</p><p>‘Of course not!’</p><p> </p><p>‘I can’t believe you consider <em>Adalene Archambault</em> to be “someone we both know”!’</p><p>‘She was a remarkable Swiss witch, who lived in the 17th century and pioneered the use of Legilimency in Psychealing. Just because <em>you</em> don’t know her… Shit, what was that?’</p><p>‘A rescue team?’</p><p>‘Potter, do you remember who you said lives in caves?’</p><p>‘You’re squeezing my hand too hard, Malfoy.’</p><p>‘Sorry.’</p><p>‘You can hold it. If, er, you want. Just don’t stop my blood circulation. Fuck, it’s breaking through!’</p><p>‘That’s not my hand, Potter.’</p><p>‘Sorry, I didn’t—’</p><p>‘...I, er, don’t mind if—’</p><p>‘…You don’t? You mean—’</p><p>‘Are you blushing?’</p><p>‘No!’</p><p>‘You <em>are</em>, Potter. Let’s survive the troll and you can touch whatever you want later.’</p><p>‘...Really?’</p><p>‘Stop sounding so smug and fucking save us.’</p><p> </p><p>‘<em>Disgusting</em>. Did you have to stick the wand up its nose?’</p><p>‘Can I get my reward?’</p><p>‘What reward? <em>Oh</em>.’</p><p> </p><p>‘I guess being in a cave isn’t too bad.’</p><p>‘Shut up and kiss me again, Potter.’ </p></div>
