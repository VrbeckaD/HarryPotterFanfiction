    <p dir="ltr">Where’s he meant to go? Fair enough that his mother is busy at the Ministry, but she didn’t even bother to give them directions. ‘Somewhere around platforms 9 and 10’ is hardly helpful. <em>Honestly</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Asriel hurries after his (Muggle) father, who has continued walking without him. Maybe they should look for someone to help. Just as he comes to his conclusion, he notices someone with an owl and a suitcase just like his. She’s probably going to Hogwarts-why not ask her where to go?</p><p dir="ltr">He drags his father towards the girl and taps her on the shoulder gingerly. She turns around sharply, and stares at him.</p><p dir="ltr">”Yes? What do you want?” she says.</p><p dir="ltr">”Um, well...” he begins.</p><p dir="ltr">”Just get on with it.”</p><p dir="ltr">“I w-was wondering, um, if you knew where Platform 9 3/4 was...”</p><p dir="ltr">The man next to her interrupts. “Of course she does. Marisa, do you want to show this boy the barrier?”</p><p dir="ltr">Marisa scowls, but leads him to the barrier anyway. With a malicious grin, she shoves him into the wall, and-</p><p dir="ltr">He is hit by a wall of noise. This an entirely different world-a world of wonders, a world of <em>magic</em>. Asriel gasps, and tries to comprehend what he is seeing. It’s the Hogwarts Express. His father and the family from earlier appear behind him, but he barely notices, too absorbed by the wonders of the station. It’s far better than he’d ever imagined.</p><p dir="ltr">”Are you a Muggle-born, or just really dumb?” the girl from earlier asks.</p><p dir="ltr">”That’s a little rude, Marisa. Not everyone’s as incredibly intelligent as we are,” says the boy she is with. “I’m Theodore, by the way. Theodore Nott. Nice to meet you.”</p><p dir="ltr">Asriel grins. This boy seems cool. “I’m Asriel, I’m a half-blood. My dad’s a Muggle and I’ve never been here before, so I got kind of lost.”</p><p dir="ltr">”Fair enough. We should probably get on the train, it’ll be off soon.”</p><p dir="ltr">Asriel hugs his father goodbye, and Theo and Marisa wave off their guardian.</p><p dir="ltr">”That’s my father, in case you’re completely oblivious,” mutters Marisa.</p><p dir="ltr">”Goodbye, Marisa,” her father replies. “I’m so sorry you had to meet Theo and my daughter. They can be <em>very </em>obnoxious at times.”</p><p dir="ltr">Asriel gets on the train before anyone else tries to insult him.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p>
