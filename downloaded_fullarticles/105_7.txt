    <p>The ache between her legs throbbed, and with a shiver of disgust, she felt the sticky remains of his release dribble down into her tattered knickers, wetting them even more. Squirming on her chair, she knew she looked as uncomfortable as she felt. </p><p>Ron reached out a large, unsteady hand, patting her back, his eyes expressing an odd mix of hurt, powerlessness and rage. </p><p>“Gods,” Harry groaned, running his hands through his messy hair. “It’s all my fault, and you … you shouldn’t have had to <em> do </em>that. Sink so low … all because of me.” </p><p>It had seemed like a great idea at the time. Risky, yes, but brilliant even, if their plan had succeeded. <em> But it hadn’t. </em></p><p> </p><p>Xxxx</p><p> </p><p>Apparating into a clearing, she could hear the revel from a distance. People were shouting and laughing, there were drums and pipes melding into an oddly rousing, but discordant melody, and sometimes abrupt screams. The flickering lights from bonfires lit up the darkness under the great trees. </p><p>For a moment, she stood still, almost chanting to herself: <em> I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. </em>Taking a deep breath, she secured her Glamour firmly, before walking towards the revel. </p><p> </p><p>Xxxx</p><p>The plan had been deceptively simple, yet dangerous. While in the Forest of Dean, Hermione and the boys had overheard a couple of snatchers talking about the Dark Lord’s Spring Equinox Revel. </p><p>“S’ going to be so good,” a large man groaned, licking his fingers free from chicken fat. The group of four men were sitting around a small fire, roasting chickens. </p><p><em> It was the smell of cooking that had drawn the trio to the camp. At this point, they were almost starving, and Hermione knew, her mouth wasn’t the only one watering by the thought of those chickens. To set her teeth into the tender meat, tearing at that crisp skin, feeling the juices run over her chin…. </em>If these people had been Muggles, they would have been Stunned and Obliviated, before mysteriously waking up, discovering that they missed their food. As it was, it was too dangerous to attempt stealing food from the snatchers. Instead, they listened. </p><p>“I hear the Lord is setting up a real treat tomorrow,” another man mumbled, before he showed his ugly, yellow teeth in a lecherous grin. “Spring, y’ know. Fertility, and all that shit. Plenty of fresh, young girls, right in the middle of the old Avebury ring, up in Wiltshire by the Malfoys’ place.” </p><p>“Aye. S’ going to be sooo darned good,” the first man repeated dreamily, a dirty hand palming his crotch.  </p><p>“That Bellatrix chit is in trouble, though, and won’t be serving his Lordship, or so I’ve heard. Dolohov told me after we made our report. She blabbered yesterday about hiding summat special for his Lordship in her Gringotts vault, and when he found out she was talking, then he Crucio’d almost the life out of her,” a third one chuckled. </p><p>A fourth man grunted. “Never liked her. Nasty bitch, she is, can’t see what the Lord sees in her. Why he’d have a fucking psycho like her hiding something important is beyond me, not to mention sticking his dick in her.” </p><p>“Wouldn’t mind having a go, if the Lord allows it,” the first one mumbled. </p><p>But Harry, Ron and Hermione had heard enough. Scurrying silently away to their own camp, they almost couldn’t wait to discuss the intel. </p><p>“It has to be a Horcrux,” Harry said with shining eyes. “It’s a lead, don’t you see?” </p><p>“It has to be,” Ron said, a broad smile on his face. “All we need to do is to get to Bellatrix Lestrange, get her Gringotts key and get the Horcrux out.”  </p><p>“Yes!” Harry smacked his fist into his palm, before pumping his fist into the air two times. “We’ll go to that revel, catch Bellatrix Lestrange and get the Horcrux!” </p><p>“Umm,” Hermione said, an exasperated sigh falling from her lips. “We can’t just waltz into You-Know-Who’s revel and kidnap Bellatrix. He’ll know you’re there, Harry!” </p><p>
  <em> Sometimes, she wondered if their recklessness bordered on stupidity. Putting themselves in danger like that, right in the lap of You-Know-Who. Chances were, Voldemort would catch them before long.  </em>
</p><p>“The Invisibility Cloak.“ Ron nodded sagely to himself, before continuing: “He’ll never see us.” </p><p>“Absolutely,” Harry beamed. “So good, to finally do something!” </p><p>“I hate to be the voice of reason,” she said, trying to curb the acidity in her voice, “but honestly, do you think You-Know-Who won’t notice you being in the vicinity, Harry? You can’t go.” </p><p>“What?” Harry blinked, before he grimaced. “Fuck, you’re right as always, Hermione. He’ll know through that damned bond.” He stared despondently at the ground for a short while, before he lifted his head. “You two could do it, though,” he said, but the uncertainty in his eyes was telling. </p><p>
  <em> Harry didn’t want to put his friends in danger, and no matter how much they had been through together, he always carried that insecurity that they wouldn’t be there for him. That they’d leave him if everything became too much.  </em>
</p><p>Hermione felt a small catch in her heart, thinking of the small boy who had grown up in neglect by the Dursleys, but she said brusquely: “I’ll do it. Alone. You heard those snatchers: There’s going to be plenty of young witches no one knows at the revel. I can hide in the throng, while Ron will stick out more. Also, I can manage a little Occlumency, enough that my mind doesn’t stick out in the crowd, while none of you have the faintest clue.” </p><p>“It’ll be dangerous,” Ron said, a worried crease between his eyebrows. “What if someone catches you, not <em> you, </em> I mean, but what if someone tries to… you know…” his voice trailed off, and his face blushed into distinct crimson.  </p><p> </p><p>Xxxx</p><p>Well, here she was, about to enter Voldemort’s Spring Revel, disguised as a rather unremarkable, dark-haired girl. She definitely didn’t want to attract any attention to herself, so plain Jane it was: On an undercover mission to steal Bellatrix Lestrange’s access key to that Gringotts’ vault. </p><p>As she drew closer, the sounds grew louder. The buzz of voices talking, bursts of laughter, and also clinking of bottles and glasses. Obviously, people were drinking, gearing up for what they would do later. <em> Fornicating. Shagging. Fucking with abandon, to celebrate the spring, harnessing the powers of the Equinox for magical growth and strength.  </em></p><p>Hermione had only a vague idea of what this ritual entailed, having not had any particular interest in old, quaint Pure-blood traditions. Right now, she wished she had had the opportunity to research the ritual better before landing herself in the middle of it, but being on the run, all possible libraries were out of the question. </p><p><em> Really, she had no wish at all to see Death Eaters going at it with each other. What if she saw someone like… Professor Snape? Draco? Or Merlin forbid, Crabbe or Goyle? </em>Hermione felt bile rising in her throat at that thought, and she shuddered. </p><p>The smell of bonfires filled her nostrils, and the scent of roasted pork wafted through the thinning trees. Hermione’s stomach growled loudly, and she decided: <em> eat first, then do your task.  </em></p><p>Entering the enormous clearing, she was shocked to see there were literally <em> hundreds </em> of witches and wizards present. Maybe even a thousand. <em> She had no idea, Voldemort had that many supporters.  </em></p><p>The field had one very large, central bonfire, with several smaller fires scattered around it. People were milling around, talking and laughing, drinking and eating, while some were already embracing each other, lips locked in thorough snogging. Her cheeks burned at the thought of what she’d see later on. After all, the main purpose of this gathering would traditionally be … sex. <em> Sex to reap the power of spring, to enhance one’s magic, and that was the extent of her knowledge. </em>Feeling a bit prudish, she couldn’t help thinking that it was ...wrong … to have casual sex in public with strangers. Apparently, it was considered normal among Pure-bloods, though she knew, many Pure-blooded girls saved themselves for marriage.  </p><p>Squaring her shoulders, she sauntered up to one of the numerous smaller fires, her face haughty and arrogant like she belonged here among the Death Eaters and their cronies. <em> She would have to act like them, like she was a spoiled, little Pure-blood brat . A witch who weren’t interested in the main entertainment for the evening. A witch who waited for a husband.  </em></p><p>“Hey,” a burly, middle-aged wizard said with a leer, nudging her arm. “You look nice.” He smelt of beer and spirits, and his eyes were already glazed. </p><p>Shrugging, she said disinterestedly, though her heart was hammering in her chest: “Not now. I’m hungry.” </p><p>“After, then?” he said hopefully, and she turned on the spot, staring him up and down, before she sniffed disdainfully. </p><p>“No. Or rather: <em> Never </em>, with someone like you.”</p><p>“Oh,” he said, looking slightly hurt at the insult. “It was a friendly question, no need to get so snippy, Miss.” </p><p>She sniffed, but then her stomach growled again. With almost shaking hands, she helped herself to a large piece of roast. <em> It felt wonderful, and she almost moaned at the taste, the rich food filling her stomach so deliciously. </em>Vaguely, she recalled there was something about accepting food from the host’s fires in the ritual, but she couldn’t care less. Voldemort himself could have spoon-fed her, if only she could continue eating. </p><p>Lost in the sensations of the food, she closed her eyes for a few moments, just chewing the savoury goodness, feeling her stomach finally, finally put that awful, hungry emptiness to rest. When she opened her eyes again, feeling almost drunk with the pleasure of being full, she saw to her shock, Severus Snape staring straight at her. </p><p>Gasping, she felt her heart start to hammer again. The tall, dark-haired wizard looked angry and worried at the same time, mouthing silently at her: “GET AWAY!” </p><p>With a small squeak, she almost nodded, but then, there was a busty young redhead sliding her arms around his waist, pulling him into a deep embrace, before dragging his head down into a passionate kiss. Hermione turned away quickly, ducking through the crowd. </p><p>
  <em> That was close. But why had he warned her, instead of raising the alarm? How had he recognized her - was it her magical signature? Well, she supposed, that young witch would keep him occupied for a while. Her mouth turned down at the corners by the thought, but she shook it off. Teachers shouldn’t do those things in her book, but she supposed, she couldn’t blame him. He wasn’t a real teacher anyway, he was first and foremost a Death Eater.  </em>
</p><p>Strolling through the crowd, she looked everywhere for wild dark hair and a cackling laughter. There was plenty of laughter, but she couldn’t see the telltale hair signifying Bellatrix. </p><p>Close by, a man had pushed down the robes of a witch, suckling her nipple, hands clawing at her round breasts. The witch moaned, hips bucking, but an older wizard admonished them: “Wait, be a little patient. The Lord will begin the ritual. You’ll take your turn later.” </p><p>With a sinking feeling, she realized: The Lestrange woman would be close to Voldemort, fallen from grace or no. Slowly, she slinked towards the great bonfire, where there was a wooden daise erected in an open space. </p><p>Voldemort was sprawled on his throne, <em> a dreadful thing made of human bones, if she wasn’t mistaken, </em>black robes hanging off his tall, thin frame. The pale, snake-like face was turned down towards his feet, like he was listening to the witch kneeling in front of him. </p><p>It was Bellatrix, and she was obviously begging him for something. As Hermione hesitantly drew closer, she could hear her voice: “Please, Master, I’ll be good, I’ll do anything you want, my life is yours to do with as you please. Please, forgive me for my drunken lapse. I’ll never tell anyone again…” </p><p>“Stop it, Bella,” the monster drawled, a fist closing in the woman’s wild hair, bending her head back, her neck at a precarious angle, like it would snap any moment. “You did the unthinkable, you betrayed my trust with your failure. Now, make sure you never do so again, and we’ll discuss the safety of my belongings later. You have not earned the privilege to be with me this night. Go away, give yourself to a youngster, someone of no importance, someone with no power to speak of. Or maybe even your husband - I don’t care.” </p><p>The witch sobbed, but she crawled backwards as he let her hair go, before rising. With head bowed, she retreated slowly, and Hermione readied herself to stalk the woman. <em> Grab her, Stun her, get the keys…  </em></p><p>“You!” the monster on the throne suddenly barked, and with a sinking feeling, Hermione realized he was pointing at herself. <em> Oh gods, no, her Occlumency shields were strong enough to blend into a crowd, but she’d never best the Dark Lord if he invaded her mind purposefully.  </em></p><p>But, she couldn’t run, that would lead to a certain death. <em> Visions of running, of Voldemort yelling “Avada Kedavra” after her, green light flashing and then … nothing … tore through her mind. </em>She’d have to pretend, to take the chance that she’d manage to keep her cover. </p><p>On shaking legs, she moved forward, sinking down on her knees in front of the red-eyed wizard. </p><p>“My Lord,” she said from almost bloodless lips, feeling as if all her blood had drained from her head, while simultaneously, there was a rushing sound in her ears. <em> She felt dizzy, almost like she was about to faint, almost like there was a thousand buzzing voices in her head, every voice she had ever heard talking all at once.  </em></p><p>Voldemort cocked his head as he looked at her, tapping his lips, while the slits on his face, where his nose should have been, vibrated. </p><p>“Curious,” he muttered. “Curious indeed.” A small, wicked smirk slipped across his face. “You, my dear, are a remarkably powerful witch. Cunning and bravery in a very curious blend. Yes…” </p><p>Not understanding, she stared at him, avoiding to meet his red gaze, locking her eyes on the black fabric flowing over his broad frame. <em> He was very thin, but powerfully built, with broad shoulders. His hands were pale, like his face, with long fingers, the skin oddly mottled. Power radiated off him, like his magic was too much for his body, escaping his frame in slow, undulating waves, tendrils reaching for her, slithering around her body like a snake, leaving her unclean, filthy and despoiled.  </em></p><p>Swallowing, she sat completely still, as the most evil man in Britain studied her carefully. </p><p>Coming to a conclusion, he nodded to himself. “I’ll bestow the honour on <em> you,” </em> he said decisively. Rising, he stretched out a hand to her. Heart in her throat, she felt like she should have been blabbering in fear, and hesitantly, confused, she took his hand. Even when she stood, he towered over her, his presence a suffocating, pulsing power, smothering her very being. </p><p>Blinking, she had no idea what he was talking about, and his smirk widened. “You will be my consort for the evening. We’ll start the show, so to speak.” </p><p>
  <em> No. No. No. This wasn’t happening. She had misunderstood, somehow.  This was a mistake. Surely, he didn’t mean to…  </em>
</p><p>There was a sudden rush of magic from him, though he didn’t use his wand, nor did he say anything. When he opened his mouth to speak, his voice rang out over the whole field. </p><p>“Friends, we are about to celebrate the power of spring, to enhance our power, to ensure our strength. You have partaken of the meal, and now, I will initiate our revel with this young witch. Gather round the altar, join me in the chant to raise our power.” </p><p>Hermione felt nauseous. <em> There was no escape. A thousand Death Eaters would watch, as her virginity was taken by Voldemort himself. It seemed like a terrible nightmare, like a dream gone so wrong, descending into hellish visions.   </em></p><p>The bonfire flickered, and Voldemort led her to a stone altar close to the fire. A small hiss went through the air, and all her clothes parted neatly in the middle, falling off her shoulders and hips, pooling down by her feet. </p><p>Blinking, she slowly registered that she was naked, her clothes ruined, in front of hundreds of people. Someone in the crowd wolf-whistled, and a sudden, furious blush rose in her cheeks. </p><p>“Behold, our maiden sacrifice!” Voldemort’s voice was a satisfied purr, and dread crept up her spine. <em> Maiden sacrifice? She fervently hoped, there was nothing more to it than her virginity, as if that wasn’t bad enough. Again, she wished she had spent more time studying ancient, Pure-blood customs and rituals. Would she be killed afterwards? Did her virginity make a difference? </em><em>And how did he know she was a virgin? </em></p><p>Gooseflesh erupted, partly from fear and partly from the cold March air, and her nipples hardened in the chill, standing out like pink, little points. The wizard in front of her licked his lips, giving her breasts an appraising glance, before he reached out, hefting one in his palm, like he was weighing it. His hand was cold, surprisingly calloused, like he was using his hands for manual labour, possibly brewing. A small squeak fell from her lips, and he chuckled slowly, lasciviously.  </p><p>The crowd mumbled, moving closer in rustling sighs. </p><p>“Down on your knees, girl,” he said, and a moan of anticipation went through the crowd. Feeling as she would burst with panic, she sank down on her knees, her legs meeting the cold, hard-trampled earth below. </p><p>Voldemort took a step forward, parted his robes, and there it was. <em> A very large, erect cock, pale and thick, the head a weeping, angry red, pointing straight at her.  </em></p><p>“Open up,” he said, grabbing her chin, and she barely had time to take in the situation, before her mouth was filled with him. She briefly noticed his taste - <em> salty, a little musky, but definitely clean, thank the gods for small mercies - </em>before she choked, as he thrust himself into the back of her throat with a groan. </p><p>“Yes, that’s good, girl,” he grunted, cock retreating, before he shoved himself back in. “Use your tongue, stroke me, and I’ll reward you later, girl. Get me nice and wet before I take you, if you know your own good.” </p><p>The crowd snickered, as their Lord thrust in and out of her mouth. From the corner of her eye, she could see people grinding against each other, fondling breasts, hips, cocks and arses. But most of her vision was filled by him, pale skin framed by black robes, and the squelching sound of his cock moving in her mouth was loud in her ears.  Tears were falling down her face, and occasionally, she gagged on him. While it was unpleasant for her, the effect seemed to be the opposite on him, as her gagging made him groan deeply with pleasure. </p><p>Hermione tried to focus on something else. <em> This was happening, and she just had to endure it, but this wasn’t important, it wasn’t something she could change, this wasn’t about her. The important thing was to get out alive, preferably with Bellatrix’ key. This was just a … minor setback in the long run, though it certainly didn’t feel that way right now. She had to keep her perspective. She had to survive.  </em></p><p>After what felt like a long time, though it had maybe lasted only minutes, he withdrew, fisting his long cock with one hand. </p><p>“Get ready for your deflowering, little virgin witch,” he said lazily, his eyes hooded with lust. </p><p>Slowly, she stood, legs shaking, and he backed her into the altar, lifting her to perch on the edge. </p><p>The stone was cold underneath her thighs, uneven edges digging into her soft skin, but she was more concerned with the man parting her legs roughly, hands cold and harsh as they gripped her flesh. </p><p>He began chanting: “<em>Vernum Potentia, Creatio Fortum, Virgo Sacrificio," </em>and the crowd took up the chant, the hundreds of different voices mingling, some high and sing-song, some deep growls. Around her, magic was gathering, like it was sizzling in the air, growing to an impossible pressure around her, like a bubble about to burst, her heart hammering with the pulse of it. There was a building crescendo inside her, her body affected by the magic washing over her, and she panted, almost bucking under the pressure, feeling as if her body was taken over by magic itself, like her mind, will and body had been set aside. </p><p>In front of her, the angry red head of his cock seemed to swell, twitching slightly, and just as she thought she’d have to scream to alleviate the drumming pulse of magic inside her - outside her - everywhere - the magic <em> was </em>her, he surged forward, quickly positioning himself between her legs, and with a sharp thrust, he was inside her. </p><p>The pain was piercing, sudden and hard, and she whimpered in shock as the crowd cheered. The magic changed from unbelievable pressure to slowly rolling waves, large swells moving lazily across the deep, building up as they crashed against the rocks, but her mind was screaming. <em> Voldemort was inside her, in a way she’d never imagined, tearing her apart, taking something from her that she’d never thought he’d ever want from someone like her.  </em></p><p>He felt impossibly big inside her, like she was split apart, moving with rough thrusts, hands gripping her hips bruisingly hard. The tall wizard looming over her, back hunched as he thrust between her hips, and she could see the broad expanse of his pale, hard chest between his parted robes. Those red eyes were closed, his mouth slack with want, hips rocking his cock deeper inside her. </p><p>Slowly, she came to realize that it didn’t hurt anymore. The ritual magic was taking over her body, making her compliant, short of breath, panting even, as her insides clenched around the large cock filling her up. </p><p>“That’s it, girl, feel the spring power,” the man above her snarled, moving faster, pumping into her as the big thing inside her twitched, causing a frisson of pleasure deep inside her belly. “Let the ritual control you, share your magic, increase the strength, help me grow my power, little witch, give in, surrender to the ritual.” His eyes were now open, staring intently at her, and his magic pushed and prodded at her, forcibly demanding entrance to her own, just like his cock had speared her body.  </p><p>“No,” she mumbled weakly, staring up into the swirling red in his eyes, “no.” </p><p>But the magic was overwhelming her, taking control, like she was dragged into a raging stream, and he smirked at her, eyes glittering wickedly, hands moving her body in time with his brutal thrusts, slamming her up and down his long cock. Involuntarily, a moan escaped her, and he groaned, thin lips stretching out in his face like he was straining with effort, eyes flashing with red-hot flames. </p><p>Something was building inside her, and unwilling, she felt a strong tingling in her sex, her nipples suddenly hard and aching for touch. “Please,” she gasped, but she didn’t know what she begged for. <em> For him to stop, for him to touch her, for him to cease, for him to fuck her harder…? She didn’t know.  </em></p><p>His head moved down like a snake about to strike, mouth clamping around her nipple, and she gasped, arching her back to present her breasts to him. His tongue swirled around her hard little bud, her belly clenched around the big cock invading her, claiming her. As another moan escaped her lips, she knew she had lost, and he had won. </p><p>His victory grin was terrifying to behold, but she was too far gone, her sex trembling around him, her breath coming in pants and mewling little cries. <em> It didn’t matter, that the man taking her was the most evil wizard ever, it was so good, nothing mattered except his big cock and her slick, tight hold around him, the pleasure being much too overwhelming, growing inside her, swelling up into immensity, rushing towards an earth-shattering completion.  </em></p><p>When he snaked one hand down to touch her clit, rubbing her firmly with a cold, long finger, stroking her hard, aching little nub, she crested, coming on Lord Voldemort’s cock, gasping, convulsing as her orgasm roared through her, the magic sharpening to an impossible brightness, like it was alive, like she was flying, like she’d live forever on this wave of power. Voldemort grunted, eyes widening, and then he roared out his release too, cock jerking hard inside her, sending spurts of hot come into her, coating her insides, as he shook above her, his chest heaving with the effort. </p><p>For a brief moment, all was quiet, and then the crowd shouted: “To the glory of the Dark Lord! To our Lord! Power!” </p><p>For a moment, he held still, before pulling his still twitching cock out of her. Sticky cream slithered out of her abused sex, and she stared up at him, appalled and shocked at her own fall. <em> How could she sink so low? Orgasming on her enemy’s cock?  </em></p><p>With a smirk, he whispered into her ear: ”Nice Glamour, Miss Granger. Give my regards to Potter. I’ll leave you with this memory of a truly successful Equinox ritual, in all respects. You might want to read up on the … aftereffects. As worthy an adversary as you are, little witch, even you cannot help being affected by this.” </p><p> </p><p>Xxxx</p><p>She had stumbled away, shocked to her core, gathering her tattered clothing around her. On her way back, she had seen a devastated, crying Bellatrix Lestrange on all fours, a young, pimpled wizard pounding into her from behind, and callously, recklessly - <em> after all, what more could go wrong on such a night? </em> - Hermione had nicked the woman’s clothing, finding a golden Gringotts key in a pocket. <em> They would have to hurry, before Bellatrix noticed it was gone. Before Voldemort took action, removing his Horcrux. He surely would, having read her mind, knowing who she was. But this, her sacrifice, couldn’t be for naught. They had to get to the Horcrux before he did.  </em></p><p>Now, she had told everything to her friends. She felt emotionless, detached, like she was an empty shell, but still, her friends’ worry, concern and sorrow made a small impact on the hollowness inside her, making it feel … less desolate.  </p><p>“So, now I need to find out what he meant,” she said monotonously, not looking them in the eyes, her hands clutching hard, twisting, on top of her thighs.  “Those aftereffects. Did I help him, in some way? Will something happen to me? The ritual is supposed to strengthen power,isn’t it? But whose? His or mine, or both? Will it tie me to him in some way?” </p><p>“Umm,” Ron said, looking like he wanted to be miles away. “Umm, both of you will get an increased strength. But if this was a truly successful ritual… Oh, Hermione, then you are tied to him, sort of. Because if it was successful, like he said, then… oh gods, you’ll be pregnant.” </p>
