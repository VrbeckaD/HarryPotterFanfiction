    <p>Severus Snape, the resident ‘Bat of Hogwarts’, surveyed the students trickling into his class with unrestrained contempt. He’d never been a fan of children and yet here he was, going into his sixteenth year as a Professor at the wizarding school. Except this year would be different. This year he was no longer Severus Snape, Potions Master; he was Severus Snape, Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor.</p>
<p>He was just about to slam the class door and begin his instruction when Luna Lovegood darted past him.</p>
<p>“Sorry professor,” she said in her dreamy, far off voice. “Wrackspurts stole my parchments. I had to borrow some,” she explained as she found her seat.</p>
<p>Snape sneered at the girl. “As fascinating as that is Miss Lovegood, you’re still late. Five points from Ravenclaw!” he growled. Luna nodded her head and stared serenely at him, accepting her punishment without complaint.</p>
<p>Luna Lovegood was, without question, the oddest and most resilient student Snape had ever taught. Even during her first year, when all the others in her class shrank away from his wrath, Luna stared at him unfazed. She was never outright disrespectful, although there were plenty of times she refused to make the potions he’d assigned. There was a list of reasons why she would refuse – the potion had no practical value, it had bad energy, she knew a potion that was more effective. Snape learned early on that no amount of intimidation worked on Luna’s unflappable nature. Halfway through that first year, he’d even given up assigning her detentions and resorted to ignoring Luna completely. Oddly enough, despite her refusal to brew potions and the dreamy look about her, Luna’s written homework was always impeccable. He was forced to give her full marks on just about everything she turned in as it was thoroughly researched, well written, and always had a tidy presentation without the slightest ink blot or stain marring her parchments. Yes, Miss Lovegood was an anomaly, but Snape put it out of his mind and turned his attention to teaching his first Defense Against the Dark Arts class.</p>
<p>At the end of the lesson, Luna hung back. She had a nasty habit of trying to converse with him. Snape had hoped that this year would change things, but alas, she seemed as determined as ever.</p>
<p>“How was your summer professor?” she asked.</p>
<p>Snape heaved a resigned sigh. “Miss Lovegood, every year you ask me how my summer was and every year I tell you it is none of your concern. Why do you insist on carrying on this pointless tradition?”</p>
<p>Luna smiled vaguely at him. “Perhaps one day you’ll give me a different answer. Daddy and I went to Sweden this summer.”</p>
<p>“How nice,” Snape replied through clenched teeth. Losing his temper with Luna Lovegood would do no good. He knew from experience.</p>
<p>“Oh! I’ve brought you something,” she said, rummaging around in her bag.</p>
<p>“I don’t accept gifts from students,” Snape reminded her. The sharp tone of his voice did nothing to deter the young witch. She set a small box on his desk.</p>
<p>“Don’t be ridiculous. I brought something for all the professors. Although, I wasn’t sure exactly what you’d like. You’re very hard to read you know. I think it’s because of all the brooding.”</p>
<p>Snape felt his frustration rise. “I do not brood,” he snapped.</p>
<p>Luna cocked her head at him, regarding him with those sparkling blue eyes. “Hmmm… if you say so. I’ll see you next class professor. Have a good day.” And with a wave, she was off.</p>
<p>Snape eyed the pale blue box warily. One never knew what could pop out of a Lovegood gift. Drumming his fingers on the top of his desk, he debated opening it or tossing it straight in the trash. Students didn’t usually get him gifts. More often than not, boxes left for him were filled with pranks. Finally, he plucked the box from his desk and pulled it open. It was filled with a dozen wriggling Swiss Chocolate Snakes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That night Snape made his way to the Astronomy Tower. It was almost midnight and the long corridors were deserted. He relished these moments when the castle was still and quiet and he could think without distraction. Generally, he preferred the solitude of his dungeon chambers but occasionally he felt stifled in the small space. After an exhausting summer of Order of the Phoenix meetings at 12 Grimmuald Place and maintaining his cover as a Death Eater in the presence of the Dark Lord, he felt the need for some fresh air and peace.</p>
<p>The Astronomy Tower was the highest point of the Hogwarts castle. Classes were held at midnight four nights a week and Snape knew it would be empty tonight as it was the first day of the term. The crisp September air hit him as he stepped onto the viewing platform, every star in the sky visible and a full moon beaming down on him. Looking over Hogwarts, the only place he’d ever truly felt at home, always managed to clear the doubt and cobwebs from his mind.</p>
<p>He’d been standing in the moonlight and the silence for a few moments when a shuffling sound to his right caught his attention. He immediately withdrew his wand and took a step toward the noise. Luna Lovegood came shuffling around the corner of the platform, half crawling along the edge of the tower. “Good evening professor,” she said. She seemed completely unconcerned that he was pointing his wand at her.</p>
<p>“It’s past curfew Miss Lovegood. Pray tell, what are you doing out of Ravenclaw tower?” he snapped.</p>
<p>Luna stood up, unfazed by his tone. Her eyes met his and she smiled, “Looking for moonfrogs, of course.”</p>
<p><em>Of course</em>, Snape thought wryly. He had no idea what a moonfrog was and he had no intention of asking. He wasn’t going to ask why they’d be on the Astronomy Tower either.</p>
<p>“They’re the most active during the full moon,” Luna went on apparently mistaking the look of disbelief on his face for interest. “Did you come up here to hear the song?”</p>
<p>Snape frowned down at the little wisp of a girl. Now what was she on about? Snape knew that asking her a question would only frustrate him further but he couldn’t help himself. “What song?” he hissed through clenched teeth. “I came up here for peace and quiet and solitude.”</p>
<p>Luna raised a delicate eyebrow. “I doubt you’ll find much quiet up here. Can’t you hear the stars singing?” she asked, stepping closer to him.</p>
<p>Snape gazed at her bright, earnest face now completely bathed in moonlight. He seemed to see her for the first time. She was petite and delicate with wide, innocent blue eyes and an ethereal glow about her. The glow seemed amplified by the moonlight and Snape found himself wondering if she didn’t have a touch of Veela in her background somewhere. Her pink lips were full and slightly parted as she stared up at him.</p>
<p><em>What does she taste like?</em> He wondered idly. It was the strangest thing to think but there was something hypnotic about her dreamy gaze.</p>
<p>Suddenly Snape remembered himself. “Return to Ravenclaw tower at once Miss Lovegood! And…”</p>
<p>“Fifteen points from Ravenclaw and two Saturday’s detention!” Luna interrupted, imitating his silken voice.</p>
<p>He growled, closing the space between them and staring down his nose at the witch. “Careful little eaglet,” he warned. “Do not presume to know what I’m going to say.”</p>
<p>Luna stared back at him, one of the only students who could stand looking him in the eye. “But isn’t that what you were going to say? I’ve noticed a pattern with your punishments.”</p>
<p>Snape ground his teeth. “That is entirely beside the point!”</p>
<p>Luna smiled serenely. “Very well, what were you going to say professor?” There was no sarcasm or disrespect in her voice just pure curiosity.</p>
<p>Snape faltered. In truth, that had been exactly what he was going to say and it unnerved him that Luna knew his punishments so well. “I was simply going to tell you not to let me catch you out after curfew again,” he lied, realizing again that punishing Luna would do no good.</p>
<p>Her smile brightened. “Thank you, professor. I’ll try to resist the pull of the moon song,” she replied, gliding toward the exit of the tower.</p>
<p>He frowned at her retreating back. “I thought you said it was the stars singing?” he called.</p>
<p>“It’s a duet,” she answered over her shoulder and then she was gone.</p>
<p>Snape was very unsettled by his encounters with Luna that day and found himself mulling them over long after he’d returned to the dungeons. It concerned him that the girl had never been afraid of him and now seemed capable of predicting his thoughts. Snape mentally scolded himself for putting so much thought into the Lovegood girl. This year would be tedious enough with the Dark Lord ramping up his attacks on muggles and wizards alike, his Order of the Phoenix double life, shadowing Draco Malfoy in an effort to uphold the Blood Oath made with Narcissa, and teaching. Not to mention that promise to Dumbledore… but he wouldn’t think about that now.</p>
<p>Heaving an annoyed sigh, Snape extinguished the flames of his chamber and drifted to sleep.</p>
