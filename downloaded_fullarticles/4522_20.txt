    <p>Voldemort was bored. He was seated on his large throne in the extravagant ballroom of Riddle Manor, in the town of Little Hangleton. Long, sharp nails scraped over a bald head as he listened to his Outer Circle Death Eaters prattle on and on about their latest <em>accomplishments</em>. As if they could even be called that. So far they hadn't told him anything he didn't already know, or hadn't already guessed on his own.</p>
<p>Useless, all of them.</p>
<p>Suppressing yet another yawn, the Dark Lord absently stroked Nagini's head-the snake napping on his lap (no doubt also bored), wishing for some sort of distraction just so he didn't have to listen to this nonsense anymore. ...Perhaps he ought to throw out a Crucio or two, just to stave off his boredom.</p>
<p>Fortunately for his Death Eaters, Voldemort hadn't even had the chance to raise his wand before there was a sharp knock on the closed doors to the room.</p>
<p>"Enter," he called out, silently thanking Salazar for the more than welcome distraction. He would even take <em>Wormtail</em> over this, and <em>that</em> was <em>really</em> saying something, because he could barely stand the presence of that filthy rat.</p>
<p>The large wooden doors swung open on their own, revealing one of his Inner Circle Death Eaters. Severus Snape, his precious spy, approached his throne, ignoring everyone else as he bowed somewhat cautiously. Watching this, Voldemort wondered what he was doing here. Because of his position, Severus didn't normally come to him unless called, and even that didn't happen every time, depending on what old Dumbledore wanted.</p>
<p>"I apologize for disturbing you, my Lord," Severus said in greeting, straightening up, "but I have managed to...accomplish the task you last set for me, and you wished for me to inform you of its completion immediately."</p>
<p>If that wasn't such good news, Voldemort would have at least chuckled at Severus' use of the word 'accomplish', especially as he had been inwardly mocking the other Death Eaters for it just a moment before. But it was obvious to all that his interest had been caught, judging by how he had straightened up in his throne almost instantly.</p>
<p>"Severus, remain," he ordered, "the rest of you are dismissed." He waited impatiently for the Outer Circle to leave.</p>
<p>The moment the doors closed behind the final Death Eater, Severus removed his mask, becoming more relaxed as he did so, and Voldemort dropped his glamour.</p>
<p>In the place of the pale snake-faced male, sat a much younger (and far more attractive) man. He had a head of silky black hair, was still fairly pale, but had nicely chiselled features. His eyes were still red though. He looked like the very personification of a young aristocrat. Oh, how he had missed his old appearance of Tom, as much as he disliked the name (which was why he preferred 'Marvolo' now).</p>
<p>"You have managed it, Severus?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, my Lord. The old man has finally given me Potter's address. Four Privet Drive of Little Whinging, Surrey."</p>
<p>Marvolo's eyes flashed in satisfaction. "And the wards?"</p>
<p>"As you used Potter's blood in the resurrection ceremony, you can easily get past the Blood Wards," Severus said. "However, you must go in without the intention of harming him. If not, the other wards, the ones placed by Dumbledore, will most likely detect you and have you expelled from the property, notifying him as well."</p>
<p>"Will I be able to use my magic?"</p>
<p>"As long as you do not use dark magic, no one will be the wiser."</p>
<p>Marvolo smirked, feeling more than a little pleased. "Good work, Severus. Now, who will be on guard tonight?"</p>
<p>Severus inclined his head at the praise, but frowned at the question. "No one, my Lord. Dumbledore has forbidden the Order from resuming the guard. We are not sure why."</p>
<p>Red eyes widened. "The boy is always unguarded?"</p>
<p>"No," said Severus. "There are some who did not listen to Dumbledore. They watch over Potter when they can-which truly is not often enough, and the old man is unaware of this, as far as I know."</p>
<p>Now a frown appeared on Marvolo's face as well. "Which members are these that are defying the Light's leader?"</p>
<p>"The oldest two Weasley boys, along with those twins, and the Wolf. However, the oldest two Weasley children both work out of the country and can never stay for long, the twins are spending quite a bit of time in Diagon Alley with the shop they are planning on opening soon, and the Wolf is constantly being sent on pointless missions for recruiting the werewolves."</p>
<p>Marvolo was definitely surprised by this. He'd never pictured any of those people going against Albus Dumbledore's orders, but he masked that surprise immediately. "Why them?" he said, beginning to stroke Nagini once more when she stirred in his lap.</p>
<p>"Because it seems that, at the moment, they are the only ones who seem to care for the boy, and vice versa. No one is in contact with him though. He had the twins watch his owl for the summer for some reason or another."</p>
<p>"...Explain."</p>
<p>"Yes, my Lord." Severus fell into thought for a moment, recalling what he had heard and been told, before continuing. "It seems that the rest of the Order has forgotten about Black. He only just passed, but they behave as if he never existed in the first place. The only time he is spoken of is when Dumbledore himself brings it up. No one else seems to care that Potter will be mourning him, not to mention the fact he ended up possessed by you, which, no offence meant, my Lord, likely was not a very pleasant experience."</p>
<p>The Dark Lord nodded once and waved his hand absently, signalling that Severus was not about to be punished for his bold words. "I see." He sighed softly. "What of the boy's friends? The youngest Weasley boy and the Granger girl?"</p>
<p>Severus frowned once more, looking almost disconcerted. "I am not sure. They are not in contact with Potter at all. In fact, the two youngest Weasleys seem to be upset with him. Perhaps they had an argument when they last saw one another. Last I heard, Granger is still with her parents in the Muggle world, and is likely unaware of what has been happening here."</p>
<p>Marvolo ran long fingers through his hair, suddenly feeling a twinge of fear that did not belong to him at all, along with anger, sadness, and a touch of resignation. But he barely had the chance to identify these foreign emotions before they vanished abruptly, leaving him with his own satisfaction. "Very well. I will be going to the boy tonight. Make sure no guard is placed, just in case."</p>
<p>"Of course, my Lord." Seeing the dismissal, Severus bowed, replaced his mask, and departed, leaving Marvolo alone with his still sleeping snake.</p>
<p>Falling into thought, Marvolo tried to figure out what to do. He knew the boy's address now, which was all fine and well, but he could not enter with the objective of killing Potter off. It was the fault of Dumbledore's blasted wards, he knew. He would have to get Potter out of his home and bring him to the manor before he dealt with him.</p>
<p>Of course, he didn't <em>have</em> to bring Potter to the manor-killing him anywhere other than that Muggle house would be fine, but there was a chance he would have to rush in that case, and he really didn't want to have to do that. That was another reason he didn't just want to kill Potter in the Muggle house either. He wanted to savour the moment.</p>
<p>Perhaps his intention could be recon, then.</p>
<p>Yes, if he were going with reconnaissance in mind, it meant he wasn't intent on harming anyone. Surely the wards would allow him in without notifying anyone if that was the intention he had?</p>
<p>Pleased with that plan, Marvolo smirked and got to work...</p>
