    <p> </p><p> </p><p>The whole school was buzzing with excitement, as first days do. It has been nearly fourteen years since Tom had left this school, and the sight of the Great Hall - magnificient as always - made him slightly nostalgic. As he watched the small heads of first years gawking and chattering as they came closer to where the Sorting Hat was, he had to remember the day he first saw Hogwarts and the Great Hall. Compared to the dull, dreadful orphanage, Hogwarts was what magic was to Tom. Beautiful, astounding, and never disappointing.</p><p> </p><p>Tom knew better than to drown himself in sentiments.</p><p> </p><p>The reason he was here was not to marvel at the grandiose of the ancient, magical castle of Hogwarts. He was here to recruit, and gain support for his political career.</p><p> </p><p>When all the first years arrived at the end of the aisle, waiting to be sorted by the Hat, Tom started to carefully observe each and every one of them. Albeit young, if only they came from the right families, they would be useful for Tom. Them being young was, honestly, more of a bonus. It was always easier to impress, the younger they were.</p><p> </p><p>Among all the last names Mcgonagall had called out, two stood out in Tom's mind. Lestrange and Bones. Lestrange was the girl who were quite "unwell," as they would say at the Ministry. Probably due to their massive inbreeding, Tom thought internally, which never left Tom's mouth in actual words, of course. Lestrange was a well-respected family. Inbreeding or not.</p><p> </p><p>And there was a Bones among the members of the Wizengamot.</p><p> </p><p>The young Bones girl looked terrified, and her red hair made her flushed face look even redder. The Sorting Hat took no more than a few seconds to declare her Hufflepuff.</p><p> </p><p>Useless.</p><p> </p><p>The only noticeable first year was the Lestrange girl, then, who was sitting proudly at her Slytherin table.</p><p> </p><p>As the last sorting finished and everyone eventually ceased clapping and welcoming, Dumbledore stood up and clinked his glass. The magnifying charm made the clinking sound utterly loud and clear, and everyone immediately paid attention. Dumbledore smiled.</p><p> </p><p>"Welcme, welcome, everyone. Another day of a new year begins, and I have the highest expectations for every one of you. Details will be explained by our Deputy Headmistress, Minerva Mcgongall."</p><p> </p><p>He signed to Mcgonagall, standing beside him. Mcgonagall gave everyone a curt nod.</p><p> </p><p>"There are only two things to be in order. First, the forbidden forest is off limits, to everyone who cherish their life."</p><p> </p><p>Typical Dumbledore, mentioning forbidden forest and death without any warnings. He could see the confused faces of several first years. They wouldn't know just how... dangerous, Hogwarts actually was.</p><p> </p><p>"Second, there are new professors here at Hogwarts. Mr. Riddle, would you stand up for a while?"</p><p> </p><p>Dumbledore said, as he tilted his face slightly to see Tom. Tom plasted on the charming smile over which everyone except Dumbledore just swoons, and stood up. He could see half of the school already charmed by his exterior. It was one good thing that was given from his muggle father.</p><p> </p><p>"Everyone, I will be your Transfiguration professor from now on. I look forward to meeting you all," announced Tom, voice loud and clear with the magnifying spell.</p><p> </p><p>"Thank you, Mr. Riddle. And I have to say this - he is one of the brightest students Hogwarts has ever had. I expect nothing less than excellence from his teachings, and so should you," said Dumbledore. Tom knew it was Tom's time to sit down. Both Tom and Dumbledore knew that the latter's flattering words meant nothing.</p><p> </p><p>"Now, we have Mr. Potter. Mr. Potter?" Dumbledore looked around, searching for someone at the professor's aisle. A Potter? Tom knew of the Potter family. They were famous for their wealth which they accumulated from hair products, funnily enough because they have the most untameable hair, and many different innovative medicines they invented throughout generations. Their ancestry was mostly pure-blooded, and the Head Auror was also a Potter.</p><p> </p><p>It seemed like his plans for recruitment had some promise, after all.</p><p> </p><p>"-Ah, yes, Professor. Sorry I'm late, sir," came the voice behind Tom. Tom turned his face to look back.</p><p> </p><p>A boy was there, slightly wet from presumably, rain. His hair was raven black, and it was all over the place. Tom suspected its messiness was not just beause of the rain. Pale, porcelain skin had a tinge of redness in his cheeks, probably because he had been running. He was wearing a dark green robe and it was glaringly obvious that fashion was not his strongest suit.</p><p> </p><p>And the eyes. Sweet Salazar. Green, big eyes with long eyelashes behind a round pair of spectacles.</p><p>Strikingly beautiful.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, out of nowhere and to Tom's alarming bewilderment, Tom felt a strong pull of arousal. What would that face look like, with his dick in his mouth? So innocent and child-like, he would turn his beautiful eyes on Tom, cheeks flushed, with one or two tears streaming down his face out of embarassment and arousal. Tom swore under his breath.</p><p> </p><p>It was not like himself to have such a strong, immediate attraction. Sex was always a means to get what he wanted, and nothing more.</p><p> </p><p>It probably didn't help that the boy was dripping water and panting with a flushed face, almost right next to Tom. Behind Tom was the back door to the Great Hall, which was the door only faculty could use. The Potter boy must have come through that door just now.</p><p> </p><p>Tom gritted his teeth as he realised that Dumbledore was regarding Tom's side with interest. Could Dumbledore see this?</p><p> </p><p>"It is quite alright, Mr. Potter. Would you introduce yourself, once you take your breath?" said Dumbledore.</p><p> </p><p>"Of course, sir. Hi, everyone - my name's Harry Potter. I'll be teaching you Defense Against the Dark Arts."</p><p> </p><p>So the boy's name was Harry. Tom reminded himself what he knew and heard of the Potters. James Potter was the Head Auror, and he had a young son who was also an Auror. Tom didn't manage to have much interaction with the Aurors Office just because he was not <em>allowed</em> to. But he still had his ways to gather information. Important information.</p><p> </p><p>Harry could be James Potter's son. But then, it meant that the boy was a former Auror - but he didn't look like he fit within the harshness and the brutality the Aurors were required to experience almost daily. He looked - a bit too innocent and carefree for such intense work.</p><p> </p><p>And. He was the new professor for the Defense Against the Dark Arts.</p><p> </p><p>Interesting.</p><p> </p><p>Tom initially wanted the DADA professorship, and he knew that the place had been vacant for several years. There was no better place for Tom to study the Dark Arts without gathering much suspicion, and he could use his place as his recruitments as well, of course. That place would have allowed Tom to observe the students' magical talent regarding the Dark Arts in such a convenient manner.</p><p> </p><p>But Dumbledore had rejected him, consistently for the last five years. Furious, Tom was going to curse the place so that nobody could hold that blasted position for more than a year. But as he applied for the last time before cursing it forever, the conversation went a little bit differently. Unlike the usual rejection - I do not think you are experienced enough for the profession, Tom - Dumbledore had said that he had already hired someone else for the place. Tom was enraged, of course, and was about to stand up and curse right away when Dumbledore gave him an alternative. The place for Transfiguration.</p><p> </p><p>Ever since Mcgonagall became the Deputy, she had too much work on her hands, and he thought it would be better if she could concentrate on her Deputy matters and they hire a new professor for Transfiguration. Hence, he was asking Tom.</p><p> </p><p>Tom was a bit perplexed. He knew Dumbledore kept rejecting him because the old man somehow saw through Tom's intention on being a Hogwarts professor. But why, then, the Transfiguration professorship? Why not reject him altogether, like he's been doing for the past five years? Dumbledore was planning something, for sure. Nonetheless, since being a professor itself was helpful enough for Tom's plans, he had accepted the place. Whatever Dumbledore was planning, Tom could outsmart him.</p><p> </p><p>And this boy, who couldn't possibly be any more than twenty-five, <em>this</em> was who Dumbledore thought as suitable for the Defense Against the Dark Arts. Instead of Tom himself.</p><p> </p><p>Tom could see Harry Potter moving, to find his seat to be right next to Tom's own. Tom couldn't help himself and stole a glance at him once more. He knew he was lusting after the young boy, out of nowhere.</p><p> </p><p>Well, whatever the reason for his unexpected desire was, it wasn't important. What mattered was that, Tom knew that he wanted to fuck the young professor very badly, and he knew just exactly what to do in order to make the other person beg at Tom's knees to fuck him. Tom was attractive, <em>and</em> he was the master of manipulation. What could go wrong?</p><p> </p><p>Easy.</p><p> </p><p>The Potter family being powerful enough to be useful for Tom's plans was just a bonus.</p><p> </p><p>Tom was going to make this young boy fall in love with him, and use that to both take his body and his political power. Plans started devising by itself, in Tom's head.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>* * *</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry sat in his seat, quickly casting himself several cleaning and drying charms. He couldn't believe that he looked like a wet dog when he first said his hellos to his soon-to-be students. This was all Sirius' fault, who insisted on him and Harry going on a final adventure before officially retiring from being an Auror. Not only Sirius made Harry wet from rain, but also he made sure that Harry came in late, breathing heavily like a bloody fugitive.</p><p> </p><p>At least the welcoming feast was wonderful, as always.</p><p> </p><p>"Hello."</p><p> </p><p>Deep, velvet voice came from his right side. Harry looked, and was surprised to see a striking man. More beautiful than anyone he's ever met, even. And considering Harry had Sirius as his godfather, it was saying something.</p><p> </p><p>"Um, hi," answered Harry. He didn't know Hogwarts started having professors who were good-looking and young. All of them in Harry's years were old and quite frankly, didn't really put much effort into their looks.</p><p> </p><p>"My name is Tom Riddle. You are Harry Potter, right?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, right. Nice to meet you, Tom," said Harry, taking out a hand. Tom looked a bit startled for some reason, but the expression was soon erased from his face as if it were never there. He took Harry's hands, and they were a bit cold.</p><p> </p><p>"My pleasure as well." Tom smiled, and it made him look even more debonair.</p><p> </p><p>"Mind my curiosity, but why were you wet?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry had to grin at this. "Ah, Sirius, my godfather, wanted to go on a little trip with me to the Albanian forest. Before I formally became a professor and all that. And it rained a bit in the forest, so..."</p><p> </p><p>"Sirius, as in, Sirius Black?"</p><p> </p><p>"Yes, do you know him?"</p><p> </p><p>"Not personally, but of course I've heard of him." Tom noticed Harry's grin faltering a bit. He must know the notorious name Sirius Black had made for himself. One needn't be his godson to be aware of it.</p><p> </p><p>"My previous occupation was at the Ministry," said Tom. "It's not really much of a surprise that I've heard of the legitimate Black heir."</p><p> </p><p>"You haven't heard of his disinheriting, then," answered Harry, putting food on his plate. "Which isn't a secret or anything."</p><p> </p><p>"I did manage to catch the news. However, I also know that disinheritance does not work against ancient blood magic. As far as the bloodline's concerned, Sirius Black is the one who will be bequeathed with the Black name."</p><p> </p><p>"Huh, well." Harry thinks he'd heard of something like that as well, from Hermione or someone else. "I never really put much thought to that, though. Ancient blood magic... that's not much of an importance when Sirius is forever banned from his own childhood home and the Black Vault."</p><p> </p><p>"Perfectly understandable."</p><p> </p><p>Harry glanced at Tom's face. His statuesque face betrayed no emotion; just placidness. A comfortable silence of cutting and eating their food followed, before Tom asked:</p><p> </p><p>"So I take it that you are James Potter's son?"</p><p> </p><p>"Er, right. And I take it," said Harry, mimicking Tom's way of speaking, "that you know this because you worked at the Ministry and heard of my father?"</p><p> </p><p>Tom smirked, realising the play of words in an instant. "You are correct."</p><p> </p><p>Harry grinned back.</p><p> </p><p>"I really shouldn't mention the amount of work your father and your godfather puts on the shoulders of the lowly workers such as myself."</p><p> </p><p>"And yet you did," said Harry.</p><p> </p><p>"I did," said Tom. "Surely you must know of it as well. You worked for your father after all, have you not?"</p><p> </p><p>"I have, and I know."</p><p> </p><p>Both of them shared an amused look.</p><p> </p><p>Harry was surprised that he was getting along well with Tom. Tom looked several years senior Harry's age, and Harry was sure he must have made a bad impression, coming in late all wet. But it seemed like the man didn't have such a bad first impression on Harry, for whatever reason.</p><p> </p><p>Then, Harry remembered.</p><p> </p><p>"I know you!" Harry exclaimed, suddenly.</p><p> </p><p>Tom raised an eyebrow. letting Harry explain himself.</p><p> </p><p>"You're the Slytherin genius, aren't you?"</p><p> </p><p>Ah. That. Tom tried to look modest when he answered, "I didn't know my moniker remained even after my graduation."</p><p> </p><p>"It did, but I didn't, well, I attended Hogwarts with you."</p><p> </p><p>"You did?" Tom was genuinely surprised. Although he wasn't interested much in others, he would've noticed someone with such bright green eyes.</p><p> </p><p>More so because he was sure his sexual taste hasn't changed.</p><p> </p><p>"I did, well, you were already a sixth year when I was a first year, and you were Slytherin and I was a Gryffindor, so I guess it's not too surprising that we haven't crossed paths."</p><p> </p><p>It's possible, surely. Tom did not care much of the younger ones, mostly because they were of no use, and also he never really paid much to the Gryffindors. Hot-headed, sentimental bunch, they were.</p><p> </p><p>The way Harry presented himself - complete disregard to his appearances, including his hair and clothes and the old spectacles - and the sparkle in his eyes, showing a stupidly strong will and determination, surely did fit the image of a typical Grryfindor.</p><p> </p><p>"I've heard of you when I was in my second year, actually," said Harry, mouth full of food.</p><p> </p><p>Tom despised the lack of manner, usually. Now, he wanted to put something else in that mouth.</p><p> </p><p>He closed his eyes and banished the image promptly.</p><p> </p><p>Harry went on, having no idea of what just went through Tom's mind.</p><p> </p><p>"I never saw your face, but I've heard a great deal about you. They said something about you inventing spells and charms, and you doing something with your wand what nobody has ever seen before. Not even Dumbledore."</p><p> </p><p>Tom smiled.</p><p> </p><p>"You are not wrong."</p><p> </p><p>"Arrogant as well, I see," said Harry.</p><p> </p><p>Tom, slightly surprised, looked up at Harry's face. Harry was smirking. Well, if this was what Harry like, then Tom wouldn't play the humble card anymore.</p><p> </p><p>"It's not exactly something I can control. It's just a natural talent," said Tom, emphasizing the last 't'. "I'm so good at <em>everything</em>."</p><p> </p><p>Harry laughed, a bit loud this time that others could hear. Tom didn't mind, surprisingly.</p><p> </p><p>"You must've also lied when you said you were a lowly worker. Someone like you aren't bound to a lower position. Which department were you in? Surely you must have worked at the DMLE, haven't you?"</p><p> </p><p>"I'm afraid not. I was indeed a lowly worker, mind you. The Ministry would not make me anyone of importance simply because of my upbringing."</p><p> </p><p>"Your upbringing?" Harry asked, curious. "What do you mean?"</p><p> </p><p>"Hogwarts is a place where the family name is of lesser significance, compared to anywhere else in Magical Britain," said Tom. "You mustn't have known too well about this, seeing that you are a Potter with a Black guarding your back. But as a nobody, I have faced quite a lot of discrimination and downright rejection just because of my family name, which is a muggle's name."</p><p> </p><p>Harry knew of the existing prejudice, of course, but surely, they would have seen through it because of Tom's genius, haven't they? Not many could compete against Dumbledore's reputation as a wizard, and as far as Harry knew, Tom has been the only one ever.</p><p> </p><p>"Not only was Riddle a muggle's name, but I don't have a single living relative in Britain as well, which played heavily against my promotion."</p><p> </p><p>"But someone like you- they have Dumbledore as their Chief Warlock, and they constantly ask Dumbledore to take up an office at the DMLE. The things I've heard about you... I just presumed that they'd suck up their stuck-up ideals in the face of someone like you just like they did with Dumbledore."</p><p> </p><p>Tom took a moment before answering, trying to appear resigned and unjustly defeated. He knew this was his chance to make the young Potter's sympathy be with him.</p><p> </p><p>"I will not deny myself in an attempt of modesty," said Tom. "I have to say my prowess is something that deserves much more. However," Tom made sure he saw Harry in his eyes when he said the following words. "Dumbledore has <em>friends </em>everywhere. I do not."</p><p> </p><p>Harry was, actually, spot on with his assessment, except that he kept insisting that Tom was 'almost as good as' Dumbledore. Tom was better than the old man, he was sure of it. If only there was a chance for Tom to prove it...! When the chance arrives, he wouldn't hesitate even for a second to burn the headmaster down to the ground.</p><p> </p><p>The part where Harry was precisely right was how the Wizengamot and many others in power has accepted Dumbledore as one deserving the power, yet denied Tom of any. Both were half-bloods, both came from a family lacking of significant political power and history, and both were exceptional with their magic to a level that no ordinary wizard could even dream of. Yet, one of them was in, and the other was banished.</p><p> </p><p>Why?</p><p> </p><p>Those in power supported Dumbledore because almost all of them and their children went to Hogwarts.</p><p> </p><p>Hogwarts was, as Tom told Harry just moments ago, a special place where the prejudice of the magical society was diminished in the face of pure magical talent. School was, by definition, a place where magical precision and ability was the main focus, after all.</p><p> </p><p>It is of this very part that Dumbledore took advantage. He consistently denied the Ministry's request for him to take office, even the request for him to be the Minister for Magic - not because he was humble and modest and 'didn't believe himself with power', as the sneaky bastard would say as an excuse every single time, but because he knew that school was where people like him could impress others the most, and henceforth, influence them to be in favour of him.</p><p> </p><p>Even the most conservative members of the Wizengamot or their precious offsprings have witnessed Dumbledore's prowess first-hand at Hogwarts. And it did influence them, and the extent they could hold their prejudiced thoughts against his family status.</p><p> </p><p>Realising this was what made Tom apply to Hogwarts.</p><p>What interest could he ever have in teaching the crowd of incompetent, hormonal teeanagers, other than what Tom could gain from their impressionable minds?</p><p> </p><p>"Oh," said Harry, clearly distressed. Tom could practically see what Harry was thinking.</p><p> </p><p>"Don't be too upset on my behalf, Harry, although I appreciate the sentiment."</p><p> </p><p><em>Do</em> get upset, Harry, and be my tool. Do think of this as a noble cause, and not as something for my personal ambition.</p><p> </p><p>"But it's so unfair, isn't it?"</p><p> </p><p>"I've accepted my place in Hogwarts as a professor." said Tom. He then dropped his eyes, feigning resignation.</p><p> </p><p>"No fucking way you have."</p><p> </p><p>Tom snorted. The young professor needed to watch his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>... maybe for reasons other than disrespectful choices of words, his treacherous mind added.</p><p> </p><p>"There has to be something that can be done. You're meant for something great."</p><p> </p><p>Tom sighed, and shrugged. He made sure his posture screamed that of the victim of injustice. That would make Harry - and good thing that he was a hot-headed Gryffindor - even more sympathetic towards Tom.</p><p> </p><p>After a few seconds of silence he took to emphasize his agony at the current situation, Tom knew it was time to change the subject.</p><p> </p><p>"So, Harry, tell me, what was being an Auror like?"</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the conversation went as smooth as it could be, very much to Tom's satisfaction.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>* * *</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The feast was over, and as the students left as well as their noise, the Great Hall became silent with only the faculty left. This was something Tom had never experienced before, and it was quite refreshing. The whole Hall empty with the promise to be empty for the rest of the night.</p><p> </p><p>Mcgonagall faced the professor's aisle, standing at the podium.</p><p> </p><p>"The new professors will be introduced to their rooms by myself and - Professor Malfoy."</p><p> </p><p>A Malfoy. A man with an unmistakable white-blond hair at the end of the table nodded.</p><p>He was someone Tom had to pay attention to, considering the Malfoy name.</p><p> </p><p>"Professor Riddle, follow me. Professor Malfoy, Professor Potter will be taking the room next to you. Show him to his room, would you, professor?"</p><p> </p><p>"Sure, Minerva," answered Malfoy. He glanced over to where Harry was.</p><p> </p><p>Tom hasn't seen a Malfoy in his Hogwarts years, and unlike he had missed Harry, he sure must have noticed a Malfoy if they'd attended Hogwarts with Tom since Malfoys was known to be Slytherins. The professor looked like he was about Tom's age - then this professor must have attended school overseas. Thinking of the connections the Malfoys had with the French - maybe Beauxbatons, then. Accent was something easily fixed if one had a strict teacher.</p><p> </p><p>"Professor Flitwick is on patrol duty tonight, as informed before."</p><p> </p><p>The short Charms professor nodded his big half-goblin head. He was Tom's Charms professor as well, back in his school days. People like Flitwick were meant for schools - a half-creature with the absence of amibition and a talent just over-average enough to match it. Tom politely smiled at Mcgonagall as he thought this to himself in disdain.</p><p> </p><p>"Professor Riddle, follow me. Other professors, good night," said Mcgonagall. As Tom stood up, he turned to face Harry.</p><p> </p><p>"It was nice meeting you, Harry. I had a pleasant evening," said Tom. Other than the evening going exactly as how Tom wanted it to be, it was indeed comfortable, as if they already knew each other before.</p><p> </p><p>"Me too, Tom. Good night," said Harry, smiling. The beautiful green eyes showed Harry's honesty in his words at its clearest.</p><p> </p><p>"Good night," said Tom, instead of I<em> want to fuck you on this table until you remember of nothing but my name, </em>which was what he wanted to say.</p><p> </p><p>The raw, immediate sexual desire was a bit disconcerting. It was something that hasn't happened ever before, not to Tom.</p><p> </p><p>All the more reasons to have this Potter heir on his side.</p><p> </p><p>Tom took his gaze from Harry's face, and finally followed Mcgonagall to his room.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>* * *</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry watched the back of the man who has to be Professor Malfoy. The man, who looked slightly annoyed for some reason Harry didn't have a clue of, curtly nodded at Harry and gestured at him to follow. He then went ahead without a single word.</p><p> </p><p>Harry hurriedly scurried behind Malfoy down the familiar hallway.</p><p> </p><p>"Professor Malfoy," said Harry, "would you mind slowing down a bit?"</p><p> </p><p>The white-blond haired man stopped, and turned around. His eyes then raked through Harry's body, from top to bottom.</p><p> </p><p>"I see," said Malfoy.</p><p> </p><p>Harry knew when his short stature was being mocked. He was about to retort, but then remembered that he was a professor, and that he had to at least attempt to keep his manners. Hermione's voice of <em>try to think at least once before you snap at someone, Harry</em> rang in his ears.</p><p> </p><p>So instead of <em>Fuck off</em>, he said, "I didn't mean we should stand here all night."</p><p> </p><p>A look of amusment flicked through the rude git's pointy face.</p><p> </p><p>"Then, by all means," said Malfoy, before turning back around and walking off.</p><p> </p><p>Harry made sure his <em>not</em> short legs followed the tall prick as much as they could.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>* * *</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Harry Potter - Draco knew of him, of course, he was the half-blood son of James Potter, the current Head Auror. Such things were what filled the Malfoy dinner conversations: who had what kind of power because of what, and who had which connections with whom.</p><p> </p><p>Potters had a gread deal of influence over the Ministry via their wealth and their family members' previous (and current) high-profile Ministry positions. And as the only heir of said Potter family, Harry Potter could be someone of an extraordinary status in the magical society, only if he was not a half-blood.</p><p> </p><p>But he was.</p><p> </p><p>A <em>filthy</em> half-blood, his father would say.</p><p> </p><p>Draco gave Potter a curt nod once again in front of Potter's room before turning on his heels and walking away.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
