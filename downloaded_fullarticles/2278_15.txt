    <p>Draco walks over to Harry with a confused /and definitely not at all concerned/ expression on his face.<br/> "Potter?" He asks, his usually snarky tone softer than normal, and Harry jumps slightly. He didn't know Draco had entered their dorm room. Harry is sat on the edge of his bed near the foot, silent tears streaming down his face and he's staring at the wall opposite him. He's been like this for a while. It's one of those days where he can't stop feeling guilty about the people they lost during the war. At least he managed to hold in the tears until he got to his dorm rather than having a complete breakdown in the great hall during lunch.<br/> Harry debates whether he should continue his breakdown or tell Malfoy not to be a nosey prick and piss off. Draco watches Harry's expression change from guilt to looking torn before his expression goes back to looking guilty and sad.</p><p>"Potter?" Draco asks nervously. He's standing behind Harry and sees him sigh.<br/> "I'm gonna need you not to be a prat for once." He mumbles and Draco doesn't really know what to do so he just moves slightly closer to Harry's side.<br/> "I can try but I'm not making any promises." He says, his voice showing his nerves, and after a second Harry grabs Draco's arm and pulls him closer so that Draco is pressed against Harry's back whilst Harry just grips his arm tight. Draco's shocked at first. The only times they've ever made contact since being made roommates at the beginning of 8th year was when they were fighting, and they haven't said anything but insults to each other. Draco debates pulling himself away from Harry, calling him a name and taking the piss out of him for crying; but Draco knows all too well how much the war fucked him up, he can hear him crying at night when Harry thinks Draco's asleep or he hears him having nightmares or waking up with a gasp or a chocked sob when he has particularly bad dreams and Draco always wants to hug him until he's better. Now he has the chance. Draco gets the impression Harry doesn't have anyone to tell him it will be okay, he's always the supportive one, not the one being comforted, and Draco likes the idea of being that person for Harry. So instead of pulling away he just sits behind Harry, pulls them both down so he's spooning him and wraps his arms around him, burying his head into Harry's neck. He lets Harry cry like he obviously needs to and holds him tight.</p><p>"I've got you." Draco whispers into Harry's hair and Harry's hand slides down from his wrist to his hand and grips it desperately, as if he's worried if he loosens his grip Draco will leave.<br/> "I'm not going anywhere." Draco whispers reassuringly and Harry takes a deep breath before relaxing his grip slightly. Draco let's go of Harry's right hand and grabs his left so he's wrapped further around Harry, forming a human shield around him, and Harry's right hand grips Draco's forearm.</p><p>Draco let's Harry cry for a few minutes whilst whispering "I'm here" and "I've got you" soothingly.<br/> "Thank you Draco." Harry murmurs, curling further into Draco's chest and Draco grins because even though petty feuds are the least of anyone's worries the fact that Harry called him Draco made his heart beat speed up slightly.<br/> "I can manage not being a prat for a few minuets." Draco mutters trying to lighten the mood and Harry tries to breath out a laugh but his heart's not in it and he just sounds tired so Draco just pulls him closer.</p><p>Draco and Harry lie together quietly until dinner, just Draco occasionally whispering reassurance and Harry pulling Draco's arms impossibly further round him. When it's time for dinner Harry reluctantly let's go of Draco's hands and slowly sits up. Draco looks up at him and feels his heart flutter. Harry's hair is even messier than usual and he looks adorable despite his red puffy eyes. Harry's hair looks so soft and Draco wishes he could run his fingers through it, but he just shakes that thought away and gets up, smoothing down his hair and going down to the great hall.</p><p>Draco's eyes dart to Harry as he enters the hall, his hair is still a beautiful mess but his eyes are no longer red. He walks over to his friends at the Gryffindor table and sits in between Seamus and Hermione. He looks really confused and Draco wonders whether it's because of him.</p><p>Harry sighs as he sits down for dinner. He doesn't understand why Draco comforted him instead of taking the piss. He doesn't understand why it was as if Draco could read his mind, saying he wasn't going anywhere the moment Harry thought Draco would leave if he let go. And he really doesn't understand why he can sense Draco's eyes on him. He does, however, know exactly why all he wants to do is go back up to his dorm and lie in Draco's arms forever. He's been in love with the prat since he was 14, and the fact that Harry is 99% sure he's the only person alive to see a soft side of Draco makes him think that maybe Draco feels the same way, but there's no way he's going to get his hopes up.</p><p>"You okay, Harry?" Seamus asks quietly and Harry shrugs before shaking his head and resting it on Seamus' shoulder, sighing.<br/> "What's up?" Seamus asks, resting his head on top of Harry's. He knows why Harry's sad most of the time, but he asks anyway in case there's something else bothering him.<br/> "The usual." Harry mumbles, deciding not to mention Malfoy. At the thought of the blonde his eyes drift over to the slytherin table and immediately find the pale face he was seeking. Harry notices that Draco is looking straight at him and looks kind of annoyed and, is that Jealousy?<br/> "You need to stop feeling guilty, mate." Seamus says, wrapping his arm around Harry's shoulder. The boys never care about being close, probably because they're Gryffindors and don't care what other people think. Ron is always a bit weird about it but Seamus, Dean and Harry don't care.<br/> "I know. But I can't." Harry mutters, prodding the mash on his plate with his fork, not feeling hungry. He's found he never really feels hungry anymore and only really eats to stop Hermione from bugging him about eating. Harry forces down a few mouthfuls before going back to the 8th year common room with Seamus and Dean.</p><p>They sit in the common room for an hour or two, Seamus and Dean trying their hardest to cheer Harry up before Hermione decides a different approach would make Harry talk to her, which he does. They sit on Hermione's bed talking for an hour, about anything they can think of. Harry trusts Hermione and they always have secret conversations together, so he knows she won't tell anyone and she won't judge him. At around 11pm Harry decides he's exhausted and just wants to sleep. He bids Hermione a good night before going to his dorm.</p><p>Draco is already lying in his bed and whilst Harry changes into some tracksuit bottoms and takes off his shirt he's certain he can feel Draco's eyes on him. Harry looks at Draco, lying in his bed with no product in his hair so it looks fluffy and soft, his eyes staring directly at Harry's. Harry wants nothing more than to climb into Draco's bed with him, and figures you don't get unless you ask, but he's too nervous to ask, so he decides to be Gryffindor about it. He walks over to Draco's bed, Draco can tell he's nervous, and Harry climbs into the bed and lies with his back to Draco before biting his lip nervously whilst waiting for Draco's reaction. Draco can't help the small smile that appears on his face because Potter is so cute when he's nervous and he makes himself look so small even though he has great muscles and is 6 foot, so he just moves his right arm around Harry, wrapping the duvet around him as he does so, grabs his hand and pulls him into his chest, burying his face in his shoulder. Harry realises that Draco is the first person to comfort him like this, to just accept that he's not okay and hold him, to not try to fix him, but to just hold him so he doesn't break completely. It's such a weird realisation, and Harry has never felt so alone yet so connected with a person, and before he knows what's happening he's crying quietly.</p><p>Draco feels his heart break slightly, so he shuffles back on the bed, rolls Harry over so he's facing him, and pulls him into his chest, holding him tight again. Harry's face is buried into his neck and Draco can't help but thread his fingers through Harry's hair like he's so desperately wanted to do since he was 12. Harrys hands are clutching onto Draco's thin t-shirt for dear life and Draco frowns.</p><p>"I've got you." He whispers into Harry's ear softly and he feels goosebumps appear on Harry's skin.</p><p>From that night on Harry and Draco fall asleep curled together. They both preferred it when Harry was the big spoon, but some nights, like the first one, Harry needs to be the one being hugged; Sometimes he needs that security.</p><p>Nothing has changed between the two during the day, though. They still only call each other by their last name, they still make sarcastic comments and jokes and still outwardly 'hate' each other, but at night when they're alone in their dorm room, just the two of them, they're both so sweet and nice and supportive to each other and they're both so in love that it's a shame they won't tell each other.</p><p>Â </p>
