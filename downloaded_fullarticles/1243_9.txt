    <p>SUMMARY :  Harry and Roark receive their orders to report to Aquaria.</p><p> </p><p>He hit the entry buzzer and waited, lifting his hands to straighten his beige uniform shirt tucked into matching beige pants, and a dark brown leather jacket, a weapon's belt around his hips, the holster tied with a thin leather strap around his thigh  to anchor it into place.  He ran a hand through his dark, thick hair, slightly longer than what was considered to be regulation as it curled against his neck, and the collar of his jacket.</p><p>He even drew in several deep breaths, releasing them slowly in an attempt to calm his racing heart, but THAT was to be a lost cause as a deep, muffled voice called out, "Enter."</p><p>He stepped forward, the pressurized door sliding open at his approach with a hiss.  He entered the large, brightly lit office, his combat boots making no sound as he crossed the carpeted floor toward the large, dark oak desk that sat before a wall of floor to ceiling windows, a stunning view of Caprica Bay behind them.</p><p>He halted before the desk, saluting sharply to the three men.  One was sitting, the other two, hos eldest twin sons standing on either side of him, each leaning lightly against a corner of the desk.  The three men looked identical in black flight shirts tucked into black pants, and a scarlet jacket.  All three of them were dark haired, cut short, though the one seated had hair that was just slightly longer, interspersed with grey.  The seated man had eyes of a dark, forest green.  The elder of his twin sons also had eyes of forest green while the other had bright blue.</p><p>"Lt. Roark Peverell Potter reporting as ordered, Sir," he said, noticing two files on the immaculate desk, both open.  'One is probably mine,' he thought, but the other...The other he had an idea, but--A barely smothered chuckle sounded, drawing his attention back to the three, seeing an amused smile on the lips of the man on the left.</p><p>"Gabriel, behave," the seated man said in a slightly reproving tone, though he too was smiling.  "Relax, Roark.  Have a seat.  Dac, get Roark a cup of tea, please.  Have you had anything to eat today, Rory?"</p><p>He blinked, a questioning look in his eyes.  "I...don't understand," he said, looking from Admiral Roark, to Gabriel, then over to Dacian, who was now at the sideboard.  "Major Raphael ended our training session early to say that I had been ordered to report to you.  I thought it was official, so I came right away, and no sir," he went on quickly, seeing the dark brow raise.  "I had something about six hundred this morning, but nothing since.  I just haven't had time to eat."</p><p>"We made it an order because we needed for this to look as official as was possible."  Admiral Roark Durin, patriarch of the current Durin hoard said with a warm smile.  "Dac, call down to the Café and order him some lunch as well, will you son?  He has to be getting hungry by now."</p><p>Roark's stomach chose just that moment to let out a rather loud rumble, alerting all of them that he was, indeed getting very hungry.  All three Durin's chuckled, and Roark felt his face flush.  "Sorry, Sir," he said, though he didn't sound, or look a bit contrite.</p><p>"Of course, Dad," he said, "and don't be sorry, Rory.  Eating as early as you did, you were bound to be getting hungry soon, though I AM surprised that it wasn't sooner."</p><p>"So am I," came his murmured response.</p><p>"Just in case someone is watching our movements," Gabriel spoke up, picking up from where his father had left off moments ago.  "It is, however, far more personal.  Raph should have let you eat some lunch before your class with him."</p><p>"Best not to eat before classes with him," he told them with a slight chuckle, but then he sobered.  "Personal?" he asked, his head tilting slightly as he took a seat in one of the three chairs that sat before the desk, accepting the steaming mug and sipping from it immediately, his eyes slipping closed with a deep sigh of appreciation as Dacian next reached for the com pad.  "Thank you, Dacian.  If I didn't want it to get back to Harry, I'd tell you your tea was better than his, but I don't, so I won't."</p><p>Chuckles sounded from all three.  "You just did, but don't worry, we won't tell him you said so.  Now, Raph has informed us that you and Harry have received your orders to report to Aquaria in a few days."</p><p>He nodded.  "Yes, we have, but I would have thought that Kale would have told...you..." he saw them look at each other, then back at him.  "What's wrong?" he asked immediately.</p><p>"He didn't say anything to us," Gabriel said.</p><p>Surprise flared in his bright silver eyes.  "What?  That's...odd," he murmured, a frown beginning to curve his forehead.  "The last time I spoke to Logan and Kili, they said that Kale had asked that Harry and I be assigned to them.  They also said that they'd received a copy of the report on what had happened on Virgon.  Logan also said that after they'd read it, they'd all decided that we'd be able to help them with their current investigation."</p><p>"And so you could, Rory," Gabriel said with a smile, moving around the desk to take a seat in the chair beside him.  "What happened on Virgon was unprecedented, and most unexpected."</p><p>Roark gave a snort of derision.  "You THINK?"</p><p>All three men blinked at his slightly sarcastic tone.  "You did a good job there, Rory."  Dacian said, his tone holding a little worry, especially as he had never before heard that kind of tone from him before.  "Better than good, really.  I'm not sure anyone could have done what you and Harry ended up having to do.  You both took a bad situation that went worse on you, and turned it around."</p><p>"Well, of COURSE, we did," he snapped.  "What real choice did we have?" he asked of them with a shake of his head.  "After the entire team, including Colonel Bertrum had been murdered, the new team that they sent to replace them was nothing short of a joke.  Not one of them knew anything about the case when they arrived, therefore, non of them seemed to know what needed to be done next, let alone how to go about doing it."</p><p>"Which you and Harry found to be very odd."  Came the statement.</p><p>"Oh, for Kobol's SAKE, Gabriel!" he exclaimed, wanting to throw his hands up in exasperation were it not for the mug of tea he was slowly drinking from.  "OF COURSE it was ODD!  What kind of IDIOT sends a replacement team without telling them a GODS DAMNED THING about the case."</p><p>"He's been hanging around Severus to much, I think," came wryly, "he's channeling him."</p><p>"My husband is not that bad, Gabriel.  He's just--" twin incredulous looks from father and brother.  "Okay," he said with a sigh, "fine, he IS that bad--"</p><p>A smothered chuckle from Roark.  "The POINT is every one of them had been in the service a hell of a lot longer than either Harry and I, and every one of them was also higher ranked than either of us.  Even after they read our case files, not a single one of them could agree on what should, or what needed to be done.  I don't think we have ever been so disgusted in our lives."</p><p>"You were given command, even though Harry had been there longer, and was of higher rank, if only by a few sectars."  Admiral Roark spoke up.</p><p>"After I was offered the command, Harry and I sat down to discuss it between us.  Harry was the one to convince me I was truthfully the only one who COULD take the command.  But I should never have had too."</p><p>"No," Gabriel said quietly, blue eyes on his face.  "No, you shouldn't have, and Harry, I think, underestimates himself a little too much.  He could have taken command just as easily as you, and would have done just as well.  We'll need to work on that, I think," he said with a glance at his father and Dacian.  Both nodded.  "Regardless, there you were, straight out of the Academy, on your first assignment, no less.  You're right, Roark.  You both were.  They SHOULD have known what needed to be done, and did it.  Yet, they didn't.  Granted, you graduated at the top of your class, the top of your yahren group with the highest marks and practical scores recorded in Academy history, but that didn't mean you were ready to take on the responsibility being in command gave you, especially of such a volatile situation." </p><p>"No, I wasn't, but all the same..." he paused, gave them a wry grin, looking first to the Admiral, who was siting back in his chair, fingers forming a peak under his chin as he watched him with a speculative look, then over to Dacian, who was now sitting on the corner of his fathers desk, watching him with very nearly the same look.</p><p>"You and Harry really did do an excellent job there, Rory.  Better then any of us could have ever hoped for."  His tone held a great deal of pride.</p><p>Meeting Dacian's green eyes, Roark suddenly became aware of a very bad feeling forming in the pit of his stomach, and he couldn't help tensing in alarm.  "There's something wrong," he breathed, brow knitting in consternation, looking first at Roark to see a look now reflected in his eyes that he had never hoped to see.  "Oh, Kobol, something very bad has happened."</p><p>Roark looked over at Gabriel, who then turned his head to look at his twin, a dark brow arching as Dacian gave a nod, then back to his father.  The Admiral sat forward then, hands and arms coming to rest on his desk.  "The situation on Aquaria has, if possible, become even more volatile then it was on Virgon."  He spoke in a quiet voice.</p><p>"Of course, it has.  Tom Riddle has never been known to be very stable, nor a very reasonable man."</p><p>"No, that he has not," Gabriel said.</p><p>That was when Roark heard it.  Something in their voices...something...not good.  Looking at each of them in turn, he saw...read the look in their eyes, recognized it for what it was, and drew in a deep breath of dismay.  "Kale?" he breathed.  "Fili?  Kili?  Not LOGAN?"</p><p>A pause, then slowly, very quietly.  "No, Rory, not Logan, thank the Lords of Kobol.  Though the one it was wasn't much better."</p><p>"Kale, Roark.  It was Kale."</p><p>"Ah...hh damn," he breathed.  "How?"</p><p>"We don't know at this point.  Logan and Kili found him in his apartment when they went to report something they'd discovered.  They immediately called for medical, called Fili, then called us."</p><p>"Dear Kobol, they must be devastated.  Especially Logan," he murmured, lowering his eyes to his suddenly clenched hands.  "I know just how close you all are, and Admiral..." he raised his eyes to the man who was Kale's father.  "I am SO sorry."</p><p>"Thank you, Rory." Came his soft reply.  "They are, but so far they seem to be holding up alright."</p><p>"SEEM to be being the operative words here."</p><p>Dacian and their father nodded agreement to Gabriel's words.  "I'd like to get some of the family to them, of course," Roark told him, "but everyone's tied up on their assignments, and Gabe, Dacian, Raph, Schy and I can't leave here right now."</p><p>"What about Commander Thorin?"  he asked.  "Couldn't he go to them?"</p><p>They shook their heads in answer.  "He's like nothing better, of course," Roark said, "but he can't leave here anymore than we can.  Still too much to do to get the Academy ready for this yahrens graduating class."</p><p>"The only ones even CLOSE to being done with the cases they're working are Alexei, Desmond, Payton, Ethan, Jordan, Tyler, Sebastien and Robin.  The problem there however is that even WERE they free, with debriefings, giving their full reports on the cases they were working..." a pause, then, "it could take up to, if not more than a couple of sectons to clear them and get them to Aquaria."</p><p>"Rory, we need your help very badly.  Yours...and Harry's."</p><p>"Of course, Dac.  Anything.  All you need to do is ask."</p><p>"Don't be so quick to agree, Roark," came the chuckled response.  "What we are about to ask you and your brother to do, will put the two of you in even more danger than you were already going to be in."</p><p>"Gabriel, we're going up against Tom Riddle.  The very man who murdered our parents, who almost killed us when I was barely fifteen months old, and Harry was just over four.  We will also be going up against his top two Terminator's.  Just how much more dangerous can it get?"</p><p>A soft chuckle sounded.  "A very good point, and to answer you, trust us, it can get much more dangerous."</p><p>Roark looked over at the Admiral with an arched brow, saw the amusement reflected within his green eyes, as well as the worry.  "As true as that may be, we are Warriors, and as you warned us when we first joined, being a Colonial Warrior can never be termed as a safe job to do, what with the Cylons, space pirates, smugglers and everything else out there.  So, in answer to that, I ask...What is it you want us to do?"</p><p> </p><p>A/N  Okay, here we go.  The planned rewrite of A Rumor of Peace.  The basic story line has remained, but a great many changes has been made with additions, and a few subtractions that will hopefully make the story better, as I was never completely happy with it when I first posted it.</p><p>There are already more chapters to the rewrite as with the additions some of the chapters had to be broken up, like this one.  Already some changes were made to this one, that are not on the one posted to Wattpad, as I tend to change things at the drop of a hat.  </p><p>Please let me know what you think as I still have absolutely no idea what anyone who has read this thinks.  Leave a few words of review, be they good or bad.</p><p>Thanks for reading, and hope you enjoy the changes.</p><p>                                                                                       Sandy</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
