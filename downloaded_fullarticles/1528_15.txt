    <p>
  <span>Sirius seeks shelter on the shaded side of the courtyard and squints out at the tidy square of garden. The afternoon sun is hot and bright in the sky and the courtyard is even brighter for being made of white stone. In a better mood Sirius would be able to appreciate the clean white stone arranged with perfect geometry, but right now, he thinks it's blinding, stupid and foolish, too stark. The orange trees in the center are dusty and dry, leaves curled in on themselves as if they too are waiting for better times. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>These days, with Brother Marvolo holding Florence in an iron grip of chastity and penance, Sirius wonders if his chances of getting out of San Marco's are any better than those trees. </span>
  <span>Sirius' mother sent him here with every intention of jailing him and she's done a rather thorough job of it. Her promise of regular donations will insure the Church hangs on to Sirius; Mendicant or not, as long as there's money coming in, Sirius isn't getting out. Sirius could spit on the Pope himself and still be made to take vows.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The whole place is eerily quiet, not even the cicadas disturb quiet hours. Sirius tugs on the collar of his embroidered shirt, a garment never intended for sitting in midday heat. He should be inside, stripping down for a rest, slipping into bed to pass the few sleepy hours before dinner.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Across the courtyard, a man emerges from a shadowed archway and into the sharp shaft of light illuminating the arcade. His hair is probably a few shades darker, probably a rich brown ochre, but in this light the wispy tips of curls are lit up like the saints in ecstasy. His long slender neck is bent just so, golden curls on the nape, and the line of his nose would be such a playful, sweeping slope to trace with charcoal. Sirius' fingers twitch. The man keeps his hands clasped and Sirius longs to see if his fingers are as slender as his neck, if his knuckles are as distinct as his nose, longs for the time and tutelage and materials to draw those knuckles, fingertips pressed into flesh like the twisting statues Sirius saw in Rome.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This vision is abruptly interrupted by two men emerging from the same shadowed doorway, but these men seem to pull the shadows with them. Sirius knows these men. He's seen Brother Marvolo in the pulpit, working himself and everyone else into a fury, he's seen the back of his brown robes sweeping into his mother's receiving room. And with him, Brother Severus, whose ugly twisting scowl wouldn't be out of place on the left side of a Last Judgement painting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They march over to Sirius, their quick, clipped steps echoing in the empty courtyard; the walk of people hurrying for the sake of it. Brother Marvolo is exaggerating his stiff posture, performing the piety of his hair shirt for all to see, as if everyone didn’t already know of his fervent dedication to flagellation. Brother Severus, standing just behind as always, is barely concealing a smug expression; it’s the happiest Sirius has ever seen him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius shifts to lean back against a column, his legs splayed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Signore</span>
  </em>
  <span> Black,” Brother Marvolo says, in a deep and smooth voice that Sirius suspects is affected. “How very fortunate for your soul to have joined us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius snorts, crossing his arms. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Brother Marvolo’s lip twists and bares his teeth for a deeply unsettling moment before he schools the expression away and says smoothly, “I must be brief, I'm meeting with Archbishop Malfoy this afternoon. Brother Severus,” Brother Severus glares at Sirius, “will guide you through our way of life here and what is not permitted." Brother Marvolo pauses. "I’m sure it will be... an adjustment.” Brother Marvolo seems immensely pleased at depriving Sirius of all earthly pleasures. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius lifts his chin, refusing to be impressed by this sanctimonious snake. Brother Marvolo assesses him and says to Severus, "Make sure our new Brother feels </span>
  <em>
    <span>most</span>
  </em>
  <span> welcome." Marvolo turns, wincing slightly, and marches out of the courtyard, sandals clacking loudly like a self-important pony.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Brother Severus looks Sirius up and down with a sneering smile. “Ahh yes, the </span>
  <em>
    <span>apprentice</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” Brother Severus spits out the word like rancid oil.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>"Better an apprentice than a lackey." </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus' smile widens. "You'll want to be careful, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Signore</span>
  </em>
  <span>. I'm sure this a new concept for you, but here there are consequences for your actions."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Without another word, Severus turns heel and walks quickly down the arcade. Sirius directs a rude hand gesture and a muttered curse at Severus' back and gets up slowly, leisurely, following him at an impertinently sedate pace. By the time Severus is marching up a steep stone staircase, Sirius can feel the anger radiating off him and grins.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As Sirius climbs the stairs however, his grin fades with the budding of a quiet awe. He knows about the frescoes in this monastery; every painter knows them. With each step another sliver of Fra Angelico’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>Annunciation</span>
  </em>
  <span> is revealed, like the careful unbuttoning of a lover's shirt. With each step: the white columned arcade, the very tips of their halos, a glimpse of wings, unfurling, their hands drawing him in, the rich folds of lapis lazuli Sirius wants to press his face to.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the top step, he rests. An unexpected moment of calm. He looks with a deep welling appreciation upon the Angel Gabriel, Mother Mary, the charged space created by their loving gaze, the space they occupy and fill with light, the little bit of outside world, lush, cultivated and wild all at the same time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Severus’ steps have faded away and Sirius hears his own breathing, slow and easy as he looks at the painting: an unlocked opening upon a secret place, far away from this monastery, and Sirius, at the boundary line, invited to stand on the brink of this quiet, illuminated pocket. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It doesn't last. Severus rounds the corner, hissing admonishments that abruptly drag Sirius back down to this dusty world, filled with men who would walk right past this painting. His feet follow Severus but his eyes trace the graceful arches of the painting until they can't anymore.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At the doorway to Sirius’ cell, Severus shoves coarse brown cloth into his hands. </span>
  <span>"It is customary at San Marco's to begin one's postulancy with prayer and fasting. You are to remain here in silent contemplation until I collect you." Severus' smile tells him he's to be left here for longer than is "customary."</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sirius sits heavily on the small cot and looks at the small room he'll apparently be confined to. It’s a square room with a smooth arched ceiling, empty but for a simple bedside table, a pitcher of water, and a book of hours. It would be terrifyingly stark if not for a small blessing, a painted window: a Fra Angelico </span>
  <em>
    <span>Annunciation</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This rendering is smaller, less ornate, there's no gold gracing the wings of this Gabriel. There's no lush earthly world. Instead, the arched arcade of the painting extends to the edge, the same color stone as San Marco's, as if you could climb in. Mary kneels, looking young and slight and maybe even unsure. Sirius could almost pretend he's in the workshop, studying the astounding intimacy of it, copying the masters stroke for stroke... if not for the blemish of a monk draped in Dominican brown and white, peering in at the edge of the scene.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He collapses back onto the cot and closes his eyes; there's no charcoal anyway. </span>
