      <p>Do you like stories with implausible character relationships?  With paragraphs that go on for days?  How about stories with a lot of angst, melodrama, and song lyrics?

Then this fic is for you!</p><p>This was my absolute first fanfic.  It is BAD.  It is messy.  And yet...here we are.  I think I was in high school when I started this.  The series had not yet completed, we didn't know a good chunk of the story, and I was obsessed with songfic and Snape redemption arcs.  All everyone needed was love, right?  And a good dose of angst.  I was also pretty religious back then.</p><p>Did we know how the series was going to end?  HELL NO.

    <p>The day began rather normally for all those attending Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry and Ron were sitting down to breakfast with Hermione when a dishevelled lady entered the Great Hall. She glanced nervously around her, a child ducking at the base of her skirts as she worked her way along the outer walls of the hall, edging toward the head table.</p><p>Ron tapped Harry on the shoulder, "What do you suppose she is here for?"</p><p>Harry responded quickly, a bit under his breath, "I haven't any idea, have you ever seen her before?" Ron shook his head.</p><p>Hermione stood up, "I, for one, am going to find out.” Before either Harry or Ron could even attempt to stop their determined friend, she approached the lady.  The woman was continuously watching all the faces in the room as Hermione walked up to her.</p><p>The lady paused her anxious quest toward the front of the Great Hall while Hermione addressed her, "Ma'am, can I help you?"</p><p>The lady spoke in a calm, yet still anxious voice, "Where is Headmaster Dumbledore? It is imperative that I see him as soon as possible."</p><p>Hermione responded, "Up there, in the middle of the head table.  Might I ask what you are here for?"</p><p>The lady shook her head, "My dear girl, that is something that you may learn only in time," she continued toward the front of the Great Hall, the little girl trailing behind her. She ascended the stairs to the Head Table.</p><p>Harry watched the pair intently as Hermione returned to the table, "Who is she, Hermione? Did she say?" Hermione shook her head. The three friends continued to stare at the lady as she addressed the Headmaster. The conversation was brief and ended with the both of them leaving the Great Hall through a side door.</p><p>Later that day, Ron and Harry were working very quietly in Potions class when there came a timid knock on the door.</p><p>Professor Snape called sharply from his desk, "Enter." The door crept open and Albus Dumbledore entered first, followed by the young woman they had seen at breakfast, and the little girl who had accompanied her.</p><p>The Headmaster spoke, "Severus? May I intrude for a moment? There is someone here I would like you to meet."</p><p>Snape paused, "If you must."</p><p>Dumbledore smiled, "I knew you would be enthusiastic, Severus! This is Miss Annelise Marrion Schetzek- a newcomer to these parts, and here is her daughter, Miss Angelique Marie LeFay. They will be staying with us for the remainder of the year." Snape nodded his head curtly.</p><p>Annelise stepped up to him and extended her hand, "How do you do, Sir? 'Tis a pleasure to have the opportunity to make your acquaintance," she turned to the girl, "Angel dear, come up and shake hands with the good Professor." Snape was a bit taken aback by the warm attitude the young lady took with her introduction.</p><p>Angel was timid at first, but quickly gathered her courage, "Hello Professor, Sir. How are you on this fine November day?"</p><p>Professor Snape gave a sharp retort, "Well," and strode back to the front of the classroom. The newcomer and her escort left the room, but her sunny disposition's effects on the students remained for the rest of the class, despite all of Snape's efforts to make them miserable.</p><p>The rest of the day flew by for Harry as he, Ron and Hermione thought of all the various reasons why the mysterious lady had suddenly appeared at the school. Nearly every class they went to, she seemed to appear in, meeting all the professors and leaving a trail of happiness wherever she went.</p><p>At the end of classes, Ron made a suggestion, "Why don't we go and try to find this lady and ask her a few things? It could be quite interesting!"</p><p>Harry nodded enthusiastically, "Sure, we could find out who she is and why she's here!"</p><p>Hermione held back, "I think we should just let her tell us when she is ready. Usually mysterious strangers are here for a reason- like hiding from something..." The boys looked at Hermione as though she was a slight bit insane.</p><p>"Aren't you the least bit curious, Hermione? Come on, lets go Harry," Ron broke the silence. Harry and Ron headed from their last classroom and began to walk down the hall to satisfy their curiosity.</p><p>Hermione called after them, "Hey, wait for me!" and dashed off after them.</p><p>Harry, Hermione and Ron searched the castle high and low, but there searched proved fruitless. The lady that had been ever-present in their classes was no where to be found. By that time, the school was ready to assemble for dinner in the Great Hall. The three friends walked into the Hall and took their seats at the Gryffindor table. To their surprise, the young woman they had been tracking all day was sitting to the left of the Headmaster.</p><p>Dumbledore rose slowly and called for the attention of the students. His voice rang over Hermione's chatter and snapped Ron and Harry to the highest state of attention they had been at all day.</p><p>Hermione turned to face the Head Table just as the Headmaster began speaking, "My friends and students, as you have probably noticed, there has been a new face at our school today. My staff has already had the chance to meet her; now it is your turn. Everyone, allow me to introduce to you to Miss Annelise Marrion Schetzek, who will be teaching a Muggle Arts and Recreation class after regular school hours. We also have with us her daughter, Angelique Marie LeFay, who I believe is sitting at the Gryffindor table this evening. Please greet them with a warm welcome as you encounter them in the corridors. Anyone wishing to register for Miss Schetzek's class should leave a message for her posted on the message board outside the door of the first empty classroom when entering the first corridor of Floor four," he turned to Annelise, "Welcome," and then back to the students, "And let the feast begin!"</p><p>After dinner, Harry and Ron decided that they were going to try and talk to Miss Schetzek before she disappeared again. Hermione followed after them, just as curious as they were to find out why Miss Schetzek had appeared so suddenly at the school.</p><p>The three friends worked there way up to the Head Table and nearly ran into Hagrid, "Whoa there 'arry, where d'yeh think yer goin'?"</p><p>Harry paused for a second before dashing by, "We want to talk to Miss Schetzek!" Ron nodded in affirmation as Hermione and he attempted to catch up to a very purposeful Harry. They reached the Head Table as Annelise was lifting her child up to carry her on her hip.</p><p>They heard her speak, her soft, low voice filled with loving tones, "Angel dear, you are getting to old for this. You know, you are eight years old, I don't need to carry you anymore." For the first time, Harry noticed that she spoke with a softened American accent.</p><p>Angel responded to her mother with a smile, "Need to and want to mother are quite different things." Annelise smiled at her daughter.</p><p>Hermione turned to Harry, "We should go up there now- she isn't busy." Ron nodded at her suggestion. The three friends began there ascent up the stairs at the edge of the platform to finally speak with the newcomer, Miss Annelise Marrion Schetzek.</p><p>Harry led the way up the stairs, his head bent down watching the steps carefully as he ascended.</p><p>He turned toward where Annelise was standing, and nearly ran into Professor Snape, "Oh- sorry sir," Harry stammered, looking up at the less than pleased figure before him. Hermione and Ron came up beside Harry.</p><p>"What are you three doing up here? You know this platform is off limits to anyone but the instructors! Now, what do you want?" Professor Snape glared down on them.</p><p>Hermione spoke up, "We were hoping we would be able to speak with Miss Schetzek, sir."</p><p>Snape snapped back at her, "Well she's busy," and brushed past them as he went to the stairs to descent from the platform.</p><p>Annelise laughed lightly, her voice rising in its notes to a more musical level. Her tones were still fairly low, but graceful as she spoke to them.</p><p>She glanced in the direction Snape was heading. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had turned there back on her, and had begun to leave when she addressed them, "Oh don't worry dears, if this is 'off limits', then I'll come down there to you. If you are this eager to talk to me, then I can't just go and ignore you, can I?" Annelise looked at Angel, "You have to go down now- Mama's arms are getting tired," she let Angel hop down to the floor and walked over to the three friends, "I always have the time to meet new people.  Is Professor Snape always so sour, or did I just catch him on a bad day?"</p><p>Harry, Hermione, and Ron all looked at one another and Ron answered for them all, "That was actually pleasant for him." Annelise laughed.</p><p>Angel spoke up, "I'd hate to have encountered him for the first time on a bad day- he frightened me at first!" Harry noticed that the child spoke with a distinct Irish accent.</p><p>He began the questions, "Why does she have such an Irish accent, when you sound like and American? Not that that is a bad thing, mind you..."</p><p>Annelise let out a small laugh, "She is my adopted child- I knew someone would ask, either because of the accents, or because our names are nothing alike. What else would you like to know?"</p><p>Hermione piped up, "Why are you here?"</p><p>Annelise responded a bit hesitantly, "I can tell you part of that now, and part of that is a secret between Albus and myself. The part I can tell you is that I have wanted to fine tune my skills for some time- I never went to any wizard school- the same for Angel. The other part must remain a mystery."</p><p>Ron chimed in, "Well, all three of us will be in your class- when does it start?" Harry and Hermione gave him a look of surprise, and then nodded their consent.</p><p>"As soon as I gather myself together and get a lesson plan laid out. Give me a week."</p><p>Hermione stepped up to Annelise, "Well it was nice to talk to you; we have to get back to the dorms now."</p><p>She shook Hermione's hand, "Pleasure to meet you," she shook Ron and Harry's hands, "And I look forward for seeing you all in class! Be sure to sign the door!" The three friends turned to walk to their dorms and as they did heard Annelise remark to her daughter, "Lovely people here dear, eh?"</p><p>Angel responded, "Yes, I'm sure glad you're working here now Mums, last place you told me about  was unfriendly."</p><p>That night in the dorms the air was abuzz with students speculating where Miss Annelise Marrion Schetzek hailed from. Hermione, Harry, and Ron kept to themselves and were careful not to let any of their precious information out. The next day they rose early to sign the sheet on the empty classroom's door. To their surprise there was already a small crowd gathered to place names on the roster. Hermione slipped up to the front of the crowd to sign her name, along with Harry and Ron's on the sheet.</p><p>She came back to the boys with a smile on her face, "Well, there are quite a few names on that sheet already, hope she is good at controlling attention- Draco and his followers are already signed up."</p><p>Meanwhile in a moderately sized chamber in the dungeon, Annelise and Angel were attempting to unpack there precious few belongings. Annelise hung her hammock on the back wall with care, and Angel began to make her bed on a small enclosed observation platform above the door. Annelise set her sea chest below the hammock and her cedar clothes chest in the corner to the left of her bed concealed behind a red folding screen. There was a knock on the door to disturb the quiet of their unpacking.</p><p>Annelise opened the door a bit timidly, "Whose there? Oh, Professor Snape, sorry, do come in."</p><p>She opened the door wider to allow his entrance. "Thank you, but I was just checking to see why light was coming out from under the door. My classroom is the room one closer to the stairs from here. I trust there will be no untimely disturbances, Miss Schetzek?"</p><p>Annelise looked at Snape with a glint of amusement in her eye, "Do you honestly think that a refugee and her little Irish daughter can really cause that much trouble? And please, call me Anne."</p><p>Snape 'hmpf'ed under his breath, "Good day then?" "Wonderful wishes back to you," responded Anne. He left back to his classroom in a sullen silence. Anne couldn't help but be intrigued by this quiet man- she knew he was hiding something, but she had no concept of what it could be.</p><p>A week passed without event, and Harry was even more excited than before to join the company of the mysterious Miss Schetzek. The students were released from there last hour classes and a stampede of 29 students crowded to the once empty classroom.</p><p>The door of the room was enthusiastically opened by their new instructor who shouted above the din, "Take your seats, but be sure to be sitting by people who won't distract you- focus on your work is very important!" The clamour of the students died down a few minute later when Miss Schetzek took her place at the head of the classroom. The light from the windows on the side of the classroom opposite the door filled the room and glistened off Anne's tightly waved auburn hair, giving a halo effect around her head. A hush fell over the students. Draco raised his hand, "Yes, Mr. ... I'm sorry, I don't believe I know your name, I should probably take roll, shouldn't I?" Anne ran through roll exceptionally quickly, pronouncing all names clearly and correctly. She spoke, "So, Mr. Malfoy?" he nodded, "What were you wanting to say earlier? I'm sorry I interrupted your thoughts."</p><p>Draco spoke, "Well, I just wanted you to know that since my father is a very prominent figure in the wizard world, I would be careful about what you teach in this class." Crabbe and Goyle chuckled as he grinned slyly.</p><p>Anne responded coolly, "Do you warn all your teachers in this manner? For your information, intimidation does not work on me- I have been threatened enough in my day that I can take care of myself and never worry about what others think." Draco looked miffed.</p><p>Hermione beamed, "Miss Schetzek- have you ever encountered You-Know-Who?"</p><p>Anne laughed, "Please, call me Anne- there is no need for formality here. Yes dear, I have encountered the Dark Lord, and to tell you the truth I am not too fond of remembering the encounter. On a different note, shall we begin our class?" Many of the students nodded. "All right then, our first unit is going to be on the art of poetry. You can probably guess your first assignment- write a poem about yourself of about 10 lines or greater in length. It is due tomorrow. You have all this class hour to work on it. No late exceptions will be made. Have fun, be creative, and let yourself shine!" Anne smiled and sat down behind her mahogany desk. A new chapter in the 25 year old girl's life had begun...</p><p>The next day the students filed into Anne's classroom with a heavy silence. Anne noticed the change in her students from the day before as soon as they entered the bright classroom. She asked a general question as her students, "Why all the long faces, dears?" Harry and Draco raised there hands simultaneously. "Yes Harry, let us here what you have to say first, then we will hear Draco's version of the story."</p><p>Harry spoke up clearly, "In Professor Snape's class today we were supposed to be mixing a specific potion when Neville's experiment exploded."</p><p>Draco piped up, "It flew all over Professor Snape and it looked like he would explode next! Then he told Neville to leave the class." Harry flew a wicked glare at Draco.</p><p>Anne attempted to diffuse the situation, "Well, that would explain your glum looks- did he assign extra work tonight? I would assume that it was about an extra 30 pages?" The entire classroom nodded. She continued, "Well, I trust you all did your poems last night?" Half the class nodded, "For those of you who did, please pass them up." The rustle of papers sounded like the wind through the Dark Forest on a gentle Spring day. Anne collected all the poems in a neat little pile. "If any of you would like to share your poem, please feel free to volunteer!" No one raised their hands. Anne decided to progress on with the class. "Ok, well, let's continue on with our poetry unit-your next assignment will be to write a set of lyrics for a song of any appropriate topic. I hope that this assignment will be turned in with greater frequency than the last. Now, you have one day to complete this assignment." Anne sat down at her desk to begin grading Monday's assignments. The first one she read was Draco Malfoy's.</p><p>
  <strong> <u> </u> </strong>
</p><p align="center"><strong><em><u>My Life as a Rich Man's Son</u></em></strong><br/>
I sit and do nothing<br/>
When I am at home<br/>
We have servants for that<br/>
And I am often alone<br/>
I get what I want<br/>
I whine when I don't<br/>
But something is still missing<br/>
Can anyone tell me what?</p><p align="center">
  <em> </em>
</p><p>Anne wrote on the page in her emerald green pen, "Wonderful, I hope you find your inner peace before it is too late." She proceeded onto Harry Potter's poem.</p><p>
  <strong> <u> </u> </strong>
</p><p align="center"><strong><em><u>Home</u></em></strong><br/>
I have no home<br/>
Not like the rest<br/>
To school I roam<br/>
And pass the test<br/>
Of day to day life<br/>
But the only place I find solace<br/>
Is here<br/>
At school<br/>
With the only friends I have<br/>
My family<br/>
My teachers<br/>
The only claim to home<br/>
I have</p><p> </p><p>Anne smiled sadly and penned another comment, "I hope that I can become a member to your family, Harry- love from friends is a powerful healer." Hermione's poem followed right behind Harry's.</p><p>
  <strong> <u> </u> </strong>
</p><p align="center"><strong><em><u>Peace</u></em></strong><br/>
When shall I find it<br/>
Where shall I find it<br/>
How shall I find it<br/>
Why shall I find it<br/>
And can I find it soon<br/>
Or do I have to wait<br/>
Until the sun falls from the sky?</p><p> </p><p>Then Anne continued reading through the rest of the poems. As the class progressed, the remainder of Monday's assignments trickled in. Anne counted them down by a half of a grade, and continued to grade the papers. By the end of the class period all of the assignments were in, and the students were humming tunes to their songs to themselves. Anne smiled softly as she finished her work and looked up on her busy class.</p><p>An hour had quickly passed and Anne rose to speak to her students, "Everyone, the hour allotted for our class has expired. I will have to dismiss you now, and I hope that your record for punctual handing-in of your work will improve tomorrow. Thank you!  Have a wonderful evening!" The students began to gather their belongings and file out of the classroom. Anne was filled with a hope of a bright future at Hogwarts as all of her students left her class and went out to encounter tomorrow.</p><p>At dinner that night Anne was interested to find that the only seat remaining was beside the sullen potions master.</p><p>She approached with her best graces and tapped him gently on the shoulder, "Sir, is anyone sitting here?"</p><p>He quickly uttered, "No.”</p><p>Anne proceeded to ask, "May I?"</p><p>At this Snape uttered a short "Yes". She smiled softly and set herself gracefully in the chair. She waved to Angel among the mass of students and the day ended on a positive note.</p><p>Wednesday dawned with a vibrant set of colours that Anne gazed out on with awe. She had returned to her classroom to retrieve her papers from the night before, and the sky was visible from the huge windows of the room. She descended the stairs an hour later and passed by Professor Snape's classroom. As she did, she paused instinctively and glanced into the room. Snape was levitating a pile of books onto the top shelf of one of his high bookshelves. As he did, the pile began to topple. On a whim, he raised both arms to stop the pile from cascading down on top of him. The sleeves of his robes fell down as did the sleeves of his shirt below, revealing the Dark Mark on his arm. Anne gasped to herself and quickly passed by the door. Upon hearing her little gasp, he glanced at the door, then at his arm. He quickly shook his sleeve back over the Dark Mark and continued his work.</p><p>Anne walked back over to her room and found Angel sitting on the table doing potions work. Anne rubbed her left shoulder. It was all coming clear to her now. She'd heard of wizards returning from the Dark Arts hidden and covered by a shell hiding the past from both others and themselves. Anne began to understand the indecipherable Severus Snape.</p><p>That afternoon Anne's class was relatively uneventful. The homework flowed in and even a few students volunteered to sing their lyrics in front of the class. Anne was still contemplating what she had seen. Perhaps she and Snape were more similar than she had imagined.....</p><p>That evening at dinner, Anne once again sat at her place next to Professor Snape. She glanced over to the Gryffindor Table to see how her daughter was adjusting to her life at Hogwarts.</p><p>At the Gryffindor Table, Harry, Ron, and Hermione noticed Anne's young daughter sitting by herself among the first years.</p><p>Harry walked over to her, "Angelique?" she looked up at him shyly, "Do you want to come and sit with us? We would be happy to have you."</p><p>Angel beamed, "Oh, thank you- I think I'll take you up on that offer. And call me Angel- as Mums always says, 'No need for formality'!" Angel joined the three inseparable friends and began to chat with them as though she had known them from the beginning of time.</p><p>Hermione thought to herself, "This little girl is better company than most of Gryffindor House, younger or older."</p><p>Anne saw Angel joining Harry, Hermione, and Ron and remarked under her breath to herself, "Well, looks like we both are going to be all right here."</p><p>Snape turned to her, "Did you say something?"</p><p>Anne laughed lightly, "To myself, I just said that Angel and I seem to be all right here. She's happy, I'm happy- life is finally turning in a good direction!" Snape 'hmpf'ed' his acknowledgement and turned back to his meal. Anne smiled at his reaction and proceeded to remember all that she had seen earlier that day.</p><p>Thursday morning came all too soon. Anne dragged Angel out of bed and attempted to motivate her to get ready for classes. Anne got dressed in her long green velvet dress trimmed in gold braid around the neck, the hem, and the peaked sleeves. She took Angel up to breakfast and helped her to find her seat with Harry and his two friends. Anne herself was uninterested in breakfast and headed to her classroom to prepare for the day's work.</p><p>Anne walked quickly to her classroom. The morning sun shone brightly through the tall windows, creating a light and happy feeling in the room. She picked up her papers off her desk and noticed a small scrap of parchment lying on top of her notes.</p><p>
  <em>"Miss Schetzek- did you wish to ask me something the other day? ~Professor Snape"</em>
</p><p>Anne smiled. Later she would go and ask him about his opinion on specific students, just to have something to ask him. She contemplated asking him outright about the Dark Mark, however she decided against that.</p><p>Anne prepared all day for a slightly more hectic assignment that afternoon. She arranged the desks in a circle around the room. That afternoon the students filed enthusiastically into the room and attempted to find their seats. Laughingly they shuffled around and finally settled into a random arrangement, with Harry, Ron, and Hermione sitting in front of the windows, and Draco Malfoy and his 'gang' sitting across the room.</p><p>Anne took her place at the centre of the circle, "Ladies and Gentlemen, today we are doing something a little different today. Instead of working on a regular assignment, we will be setting up situations and poetically describing them and then describing them through prose. Who would like to go first? I need two people. Harry and Draco, you both raised your hands, why don't you both go first?" Anne smiled slyly. Draco and Harry both begrudgingly entered the centre of the room. Anne spoke, "Well, this should be interesting...," she drew a slip of paper from the copper cauldron on her desk, "'Two wizards are duelling- enact the duel and freeze on my mark.' Well, you two start acting." Harry and Draco both grabbed their wands from their desks. Draco began with the first spark, Harry countered it. Anne uneasily watched the two as they shot colourful sparks at one another. Then panic rose in her breast as Draco began to cast the leg-locking curse.</p><p>Harry dodged Draco's casting fairly easily, and countered with the full-body locking curse. Draco dodged and continued striking, Harry counterattacking. </p><p>Anne shouted, "Freeze!" Harry froze, but Draco continued the attack. Hermione and Ron tensed and grabbed their wands. Anne shouted above the ensuing din, "EVERYONE, SIT DOWN!" Harry headed to his seat, as did Draco. Anne's eyes flashed with anger, "Mr. Malfoy! What on this Earth, in Heaven, or in Hell, possessed you to even contemplate turning my classroom into a ring in which you express personal grudges?!!!! You will be receiving a notice for detention and 50 points from Slytherin. Mr. Potter, I understand you were defending yourself, however I will be taking 10 points from Gryffindor as well for some of the counterattacks you performed. Class will be dismissed for today. Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter, see me after class." The students began to file out of the classroom. Anne saw Draco attempting to slip out of the room, "Mr. Malfoy, if you leave this classroom even for one second you will be in detention for the rest of your short lived life!" Draco paused and returned to in front of the desk behind which Anne had retired. Anne glared at Draco, "You two displayed a primitive behaviour today, I expect better of 15 year olds. From the first years, perhaps I would expect this type of behaviour, but you, no. To keep your grade in this class from falling by 30 percentage points, you will be writing a page and a half essay on the <em>positive</em> qualities of one another. It is due tomorrow. Be glad I am not as strict as Professor Snape, or you would end up expelled. Mr. Malfoy, you will be notified as of the time you will serve your detention and where. You are dismissed."</p><p>The students all began to file into the Great Hall for dinner at the end of the day. Anne found Professor Snape at the entrance of the Great Hall watching the students file to their respective tables.</p><p>She approached him quietly, "Professor Snape?" he tilted his head toward Anne, his eyes leading the path. His face showed mild annoyance at her interruption of his silence. She continued, "I need your advice- Draco Malfoy attacked Harry Potter today during an activity in my class today. What detention do you recommend?"</p><p>Snape sighed, "If you like, I will consult Minerva and Albus and I will assign a proper detention for Mr. Malfoy."</p><p>Anne breathed a sigh of relief, "Thank you, I am quite relieved that you are willing to help." He nodded curtly, and Anne smiled as she left to talk to her daughter and to then take her seat at the Head Table.</p><p>The dawn broke that Friday as Anne was filing papers in her classroom. She glanced out the window out of instinct at the light in the sky and noticed that the crisp December wind was cutting through the courtyard carrying large, downy snowflakes on its icy tendrils. Anne smiled.</p><p>As she returned to her filing, she heard a light rapping on the door, "Yes? Enter if you will!" Her cheerful disposition welcomed Angel into the classroom. Angel came to Anne and climbed up into her lap. They shared a hug and Angel left the room to encounter her daily adventures in the classes at Hogwarts.</p><p>Anne continued her work and another tapping floated to her ears from the heavy door, "Enter!" Anne looked up and saw Dumbledore enter her classroom. She rose to greet him, "How can I be of service to you, Headmaster?" Anne asked. He smiled and began to tell her of his plans for her classroom observation for the upcoming week.</p><p>Anne watched her students file into the classroom that afternoon.</p><p>They sat down anxiously as she whistled to begin the class, "I have an announcement to make. Next week we will be graced by the presence of Professor Snape in this class. He will be observing my teaching upon the orders of Dumbledore. I hope that this will not make any of you uncomfortable, and I trust that you will behave in the same manner that you would if it were a normal week. I will be dismissing you in a few minutes to go and fetch your coats, scarves, and other winter clothing. I noticed it has snowed two feet today and is still snowing. This means we play. I will be taking attendance upon our arrival in the Entry Hall, and expect you all to be there in 15 minutes. Class temporarily dismissed."  The students excitedly leapt from their seats and vaulted to the door.  Anne smiled.</p><p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione raced as fast as was physically possible back to Gryffindor House. A teacher who was endorsing a snow day as a class was definitely an unusual occurrence and they wanted to make the most of their Golden Opportunity.</p><p>The class met in the Entry Hall with little event. Anne took roll and proceeded to instruct her class on the art of a snowball fight, "All right, here are a few rules: 1) no fist fights or other physical confrontations, this is supposed to be fun; 2) please do not put ice, rocks, or anything but snow in the snowballs, this is not supposed to injure anyone; 3) have fun, be merciful, and if I see any of you intentionally injuring any of your classmates, either physically or emotionally, I will see to it that you are punished to the full degree of whatever the worst I can think of happens to comprise of. Now, let the battle begin!” The students stampeded outside with a roaring cheer unsurpassed by anything Anne had ever heard.</p><p>Angel ran up to her, "Mum, can I join in?" Anne smiled and nodded as she pitched a snowball curve ball style at Draco.</p><p>Anne felt a snowball smack the back of her neck. She whirled around and heard Angel laughing at her. Anne gave Angel a mischievous grin. She pummelled Angel with a pair of snowballs and nearly knocked Angel off her feet. Angel retaliated and the battle began.</p><p>Meanwhile back near the school, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were hunting one another with cunning and stealth. Harry nailed Ron from behind, causing him to spin around and smack Harry with a snowball the size of a softball. The front door of the school opened. Ron couldn't see who opened it, but Hermione was on the other side of the doorway, so whoever it was, Ron thought, would just have to be careful. His snowball sailed through the air in a perfect arc, smacking the unsuspecting Professor Snape in the side of his face. Ron shirked back in fear as Snape turned slowly toward him as he wiped away the melting slush. Anne, having witnessed the event, began to laugh. Snape shot her a glance that could have frozen over Hell itself.</p><p>She spoke through her laughter, "Professor Snape, it won't hurt you, unless you're made of sugar, but I highly doubt that you're sugary sweet and will dissolve!"  She continued laughing as he turned quickly to the door and entered into the school.  Anne looked at Ron, "That probably wasn't the best thing to say to the man who is observing my class next week, eh?" Ron shook his head and nailed Hermione with a snowball having the beautiful arc that his original one had possessed.</p><p>Dinner that night was fairly silent as she sat next to Snape, hoping that he would forget her comment by Monday.</p><p>Anne awoke the next morning to Angel's voice, "Mum, wake up, you can't sleep any longer- it's nearly noon!"  Anne raised her eyelids to the light of the torches lighting her room.  Anne sat up and stretched her arms.  She grabbed her clothes and headed up to the showers to freshen up for her busy planning day.  Everything would have to be perfect for her observation next week.</p><p>After her shower, Anne walked to her classroom to collect her attendance book and her notebooks of class plans.  She returned to her chamber to find Angel lying on her stomach on the table.  She was pouring over her first year Potions work.  Anne had encouraged Angel to attend classes, despite the fact she would be required to retake them upon her official induction to Hogwarts.  It was good practice, and Angel also was able to meet other students. </p><p>Angel called her mother over to the table, "Mums, I am completely puzzled over this chart, what on Earth do all these symbols mean?  I can’t recall if we ever covered it, and the work is due on Monday.  Can you help?" </p><p>Anne shook her head, "Sorry hon, I don't get it either.  Ask Professor Snape- maybe he would be willing to help you."  Angel gave her mother a look that asked if she was insane, and that doubted if Snape would even consider helping her, both at the same time.  Anne shrugged her shoulders, "Asking never killed anyone Angel, and it's the only way to know if he'll help."  Anne ran a brush through her hair.  "Come on now dear, worry about this after lunch."</p><p>As the pair approached the Great Hall for lunch, Harry, Ron, and Hermione met up with Angel.  They walked off together to the Gryffindor table while Anne made her way to the Head Table. </p><p>Upon taking her seat, she turned to an already seated Professor Snape, "Professor, may I have a word with you?" he nodded curtly, "For starters, I'm sorry about my comment yesterday, during the snowball fight?  Forgive me?  I feel really badly about it," Snape looked at her and nodded his acceptance, "Secondly, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind helping Angel with her Potions work- she is quite frustrated and is a bit shy about asking you herself." </p><p>Snape responded after a moment's contemplation, "I would be willing to help this afternoon from about fouruntil just prior to Dinner, in my office."  Anne thanked Snape with genuine sincerity and waved to Angel who had been trying to catch her eye.</p><p>After lunch, Anne was waylaid by Minerva McGonagall.  She was slightly concerned because of Snape's report of the attack.  Anne was quick to assure her that Snape had accepted her apology and all was set to rights.</p><p>Angel meet Anne back at their quarters and Anne was quick to report her conversation with Snape.  Angel was slightly reluctant, however Anne was sure to assure her that it was a good measure of friendship to be extended, and she was to accept help graciously.</p><p>Four o’clock came and Angel stepped next door to the dungeon in which Snape taught.  She knocked on his office door and was invited to enter quickly.  Anne smiled softly and left the doorway to the classroom to pursue her planning for next week's classes.</p><p>Dinner time came, and Anne made her way to the Great Hall.  She was surprised that on her arrival neither Snape nor Angel were in their respective seats.  She took the opportunity to ask Dumbledore if she could have a moment of his time.  The history of Professor Snape lay heavy on her mind and she was determined to discover where he had been previous to his employment at Hogwarts.  She returned to her seat to see Professor Snape and Angel entering the Hall.  Angel skipped over to the Gryffindor Table, anxious to share her new knowledge with anyone who would listen.</p><p>After the meal, Anne approached the Headmaster and they stepped aside to talk.  She placed her question and awaited his reply. </p><p>Dumbledore smiled softly, "My dear Anne, that is something that only Severus is licensed to tell.  When and if he ever wished to disclose that information to you is completely up to him.  Do not press the matter, it would serve best to bide your time."  Anne thanked him for his advice and went to attempt to find Angel among the mass of students flowing out of the Great Hall.</p><p>Angel called out to Anne as she exited the Great Hall, "Mum, guess what?" </p><p>"Heaven knows, Angel, but wait and tell me until you're closer; the entire school doesn't need to hear."  Angel approached her mother. </p><p>She bounced up and down as she stood before Anne, "Mums, I just helped a whole load of first years with their homework, I am so happy, and you were right, Professor Snape was a huge lot of help.  Thanks Mums!" </p><p>Anne laughed, "Well dear, I guess you learned a few things today," Angel tipped her head inquisitively, "Number one, you learned what all those symbols meant, and now you can share your knowledge with everyone, including your old mum; number two, asking has never killed anyone to date, and it can sometimes prove beneficial." </p><p>Angel laughed, "Let's get ready for bed, I'm exhausted."  Anne nodded her head in agreement and the pair made their way to their dungeon apartment.</p><p>Sunday morning dawned earlier than Anne would have liked, and she groaned as her eyes adjusted to the light of the chamber.  Angel had lit the torches and was busy brushing out her wet hair in a corner.  Anne dragged herself out of her hammock and walked over to her clothing chest.  She pulled out her simple black dress and went up to shower and change.  Sunday promised to be a very relaxing day.</p><p>After Anne returned to her chamber, Angel began to inquire as to whether or not they were attending church that morning. </p><p>Anne sighed deeply, "Angel dear, I'm afraid that Hogwarts has no Sunday Services.  Would you like it if we held our own?"  Angel smiled and nodded.  Prior to finding Hogwarts, Anne and Angel had found refuge within the walls of many churches.  Angel was quite fond of spending Sunday mornings in the Services and, like Anne, had found them quite comforting after running all week.  Anne and Angel sat down. </p><p>Anne spoke, "Well dear, what all do you have in the way of praises this blesséd morn?"  Angel replied that she was glad to have found friends, a home, a school, and a much calmer existence.  Anne smiled.  She gave thanks for many of the same things, and in addition that they were no longer running and Angel was happy where they had ended up.  The pair ran through prayer requests, and then prayed together.  Anne asked for guidance and for continued protection from the evil from which they were escaping.  Then Angel went to Anne's old sea chest and pulled out a songbook.  Anne's voice penetrated the cool air of the lower levels of Hogwarts as a warm breeze cuts through the night in the Spring.  Angel joined her.</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="center"><em>Lord prepare me</em><br/>
<em>To be a sanctuary</em><br/>
<em>Pure and Holy</em><br/>
<em>Tried and True</em><br/>
<em>With Thanksgiving</em><br/>
<em>I'll be a living</em><br/>
<em>Sanctuary</em><br/>
<em>For You</em></p><p> </p><p>Professor Snape heard the harmonizing voices drift through the walls of his classroom as he organized his lesson plans for the coming week.  Listening to the pair sing with a joy and hope in their voices seemed odd to him- no one running from anything ever was happy, as far as he had seen.  These two were definitely different.  The songs continued.</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p align="center"><em>Be thou my vision</em><br/>

<em>In the triumph song of Life!</em></p><p> </p><p>As they concluded the last verse, Snape heard a joy and power in their voices increase.  The line containing 'victors in the midst of Strife' seemed especially potent, and if Snape had been one to hold those kinds of things as relevant, he may have held onto the notion that the little family felt that Hogwarts was the end of a long and hard journey.  Snape, however, being who he was, let the notion drop soon after his mind had conceived it.</p><p>Angel and Anne continued their Service with a favourite passage and a discussion of what it meant.  Both of them had been clinging to the hope that in Christ all things can be made anew and that a past filled with regrets could be erased and forgiven.</p><p>Angel loved to read the Resurrection story to her mother, reminding her that, "If Jesus can forgive his own killers, then He's going to do the same for you!" </p><p>Anne smiled and hugged Angel, "Well dear, why don't we finish with one last song?" </p><p>Angel nodded enthusiastically, "You pick, Mums!"  Anne opened the songbook and began to sing.</p><p>

<em>Beneath the cleansing flood</em></p><p>Snape paused as their singing grew stronger on their second time through the chorus.  The voices blended perfectly and seemed to be the sweetest thing he had heard in quite a long while.  He paused his work to listen as there voices trailed off on the last note, leaving the air ringing with song.  Snape rose from his desk and approached the door to his chamber.</p><p>Anne and Angel closed their Service with saying the Our Father.  As they said Amen, there came a knock at their door. </p><p>Anne stood from her seat at the table, "Enter, the door is unlocked."  She turned to Angel, "Angel dear, finish up your homework from Minerva, you got everything else done, if I am not mistaken?"  Angel nodded. </p><p>Anne turned her attention to her guest, "Professor Snape, what a pleasant surprise!  Can I help you?"  His eyes skirted the small, sparsely furnished room.  He cleared his throat.  "Professor?" Anne addressed him, "Is something wrong?" </p><p>He shook his head, "No, that music...was that coming from here?" </p><p>She smiled, "Yes, Angel and I were singing, were we disturbing you?" </p><p>He responded shortly, "No, as long as it only happens once in a while."</p><p>Anne laughed, "Only on Sunday mornings."</p><p>At lunch that day, Anne sat with Angel at the Gryffindor Table.  She was glad to hear Angel chatting excitedly to Hermione about their singing earlier in the morning.</p><p>Hermione gasped when Angel came to the part in her story where, "with a sharp rapping on the door, Professor Snape entered!"  Angel continued the tale, and Hermione was much relieved that Snape refrained from skinning either one of them.  She seemed as surprised as her little storyteller when she heard of Snape's reaction to their songs. </p><p>Anne finished her soup and walked over to them, "Angel, I'm going to speak to the Headmaster, I'll be right back."</p><p>Ron and Harry engaged in a game of Wizard's chess after finishing their meal.  Angel was captivated by the moving pieces and insisted that she get a chance to play the winner of Harry and Ron's game.  The boys looked sceptically at one another. </p><p>Angel noticed their glances and retorted, "I can beat Mum at Muggle chess, so I should do fairly well in Wizard's chess.  I like strategy games, they make my mind stronger." </p><p>Anne walked up behind Harry and whispered to him, "No mercy on Angel, she's sharp for and eight year old."</p><p>The rest of the day was spent playing in the snow with Angel and waging full scale snow war on Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  Angel had become slightly cocky after nearly winning to Ron in Wizard's chess, and Ron decided that pummelling her with snow was a friendly way to extend the competition.  Angel agreed to that after she had been smacked in the back with a snowball the size of a small cat.  She responded, of course, with a snowball pitched as a split finger fastball.  Ron never had a chance, waging snow war against a little Irish girl with an attitude and competitive spirit that only the Celts have.</p><p>Soaked and exhausted, the lively troupe retired from their game at sundown and readied themselves for dinner.  Anne and Angel walked in together, smiling and greeting everyone living or dead that they encountered.  Angel beamed her brightest smile at Draco as they passed the Slytherin Table. </p><p>He sneered at her, "Well look here, what do we have?  The little almost Wizard's chess champion, so you think you are better than those of us who have been here for five years, hey?"  Anne turned and watched the ensuing argument.  She had learned over her three years with Angel that the girl preferred to fight her own battles, and usually won them too.  Angel glared through him.  Draco continued his attack, "With that hair, one might think you were a Weasley, I bet you're the youngest, and they just couldn't afford to keep you..." he tried to touch Angel's hair, so she smacked his arm.  He glared at her, "On second thought, maybe you're just a common Mudblood." </p><p>Angel's pretty countenance burned with anger, her accent strengthening as she let her guard down and her defenceful defiance filter through her voice "If you ever call me Mudblood again, you <em>will </em>learn to regret the day you were born.  On my mother's side I am descended not only from Don Dorcha, the wizard of the evil darkness, but also from Lady Morrighan herself!  On my father's side I am a proud descendent of the sorceress Morgan LeFay, and also of the Celtic warrior Finn MacCumhail!  Never insult my blood, brought together by Queen Mab, the sorceress who cleared the path for Mordred, who caused Le Morte de Arthur.  To figure out how they are interwoven, ask me later, when the blood which you have insulted stops boiling."  Angel turned on her heels and returned to her mother.  Her tirade had attracted the attention of many other students who burst into cheers.  Angel had stood up to Draco Malfoy, an act that would not be forgotten.</p><p>Anne took her seat at the Head Table beside Professor Snape, the motherly pride in her swelling. </p><p>He turned to her, "Why are you so happy?" his dry tone asking what right she had to such joy. </p><p>Anne responded with her head held high, "My girl Angel just defended every ounce of her pure blood self against Malfoy and his attempt to bring her down.  As she once told me, 'No one back home ever dared insult a LeFay.'  She has revealed why."  Snape hmpf'ed at her reasoning and she shook her head.  Gazing off to the Gryffindor Table she saw students as old as seventh years applauding and congratulating the bold temper of little Angelique.</p><p>After the Great Hall cleared out, Anne remained there with Angel.  She enchanted the air to play soft music and the two began to practice ballet.  They gracefully leapt and turned across the floor with such ease that anyone who saw them would have believed them to have been faeries.  Coming back from the kitchen was Hermione.  She stopped at hearing the music floating from the Great Hall and curiously glanced into the large room.  She watched as Anne took the time to realign Angel's positioning on an arabesque. </p><p>Anne called to her, "Hermione!  Come on in, you can join us if you wish." </p><p>Hermione stepped into the Hall, "I'd love to join you, but I have never danced a step of ballet in my life." </p><p>Anne smiled, "Then let me teach you."</p><p>Hermione entered Gryffindor House late that night, under Anne's escort.  Anne explained to the house Prefect what they had been up to, and he let Hermione off to bed without any chastisement.</p><p>Anne woke eagerly at 6:00 Monday morning, and to her surprise, Angel had not yet awakened.  She was excited to have an observer in her class this week, even if it was the sullen Professor Snape.  She climbed into the little loft Angel slept in that was suspended six feet in the air just to the left of the entryway when facing into the room. </p><p>She shook Angel by the shoulders and Angel turned over to face the wall, "C'mon Ang', this is my big day, wake up and help me get ready!" </p><p>Angel groaned and sat up, "Fine, but you <em>have</em> to wear what I decide, deal?" </p><p>Anne laughed, "As long as it's decent."</p><p>Angel looked at Anne with a mischievous, but still half asleep eye, "Dang." </p><p>Anne jumped down from the loft and called to Angel, "If you come down we'll shake on it!"  Angel crawled to the edge of the loft and clamoured down the rope ladder. </p><p>She looked her mother in the eye, her red hair flying everywhere, "Deal." </p><p>Anne walked over to her clothing chest, "Remember, decent, I'm being observed today." </p><p>Angel dug into the chest, "So you want to look hot  so your critique will be spectacular. Got it." </p><p>Anne laughed, slightly surprised at Angel's suggestion, <em>"Angelique</em>!  Perhaps you forget who I am being critiqued by.  No I am not wearing the little red dress, or the green one with the twenty buttons and the strap."  Angel pulled out the two dresses Anne referred to and put them aside. </p><p>She pulled out a streamline midnight blue velvet dress with spaghetti straps, and a silver vine and leaf pattern running up one side, "Here Mum, wear this with your long butterfly sleeved robes- the ones that float around you and are open in the front- that will look lovely.  Maybe put your hair up too!" </p><p>Anne smiled, "The dress, yes, this hair, keep talking and you might convince me to do something with it."</p><p>Anne skipped lunch and went to the kitchen after the students and staff had returned to class.  She had latched the front of her robes closed with an antique silver scarab broach to prevent anyone from seeing her dress before her class assembled that afternoon.  Upon entering the kitchen she noticed all the house elves sitting down to their own lunches. </p><p>One of them got up, "How may Dobby help you?"  Anne laughed lightly, "Sit down, I can get my own lunch- you finish yours before worrying about me." </p><p>A house elf wearing a little blouse and a little skirt walked up to her, "Winky is done with her lunch; Winky will help!” </p><p>Anne gave in, "All right, can you help me make a tuna sandwich and a strawberry smoothie?" </p><p>Winky nodded enthusiastically, "Winky will be glad to help you make these things!"  Anne and Winky worked together and once Anne's lunch was done, she leaned up against the counter to eat with the house elves.  She talked with them for the greater part of an hour, suggesting various recipes for them to try.  They seemed most intrigued with the thought of making a pizza, so Anne copied the recipe for them out of her memory and gave it to her captivated audience. </p><p>Winky called after her as her left, "When Anne's Fat Tuesday comes, Anne will have to teach Winky and Winky's friends how to make Anne's paçzki's!"</p><p>As Anne made her way to her classroom, she ran into Harry, who was on an errand for his divinations teacher. </p><p>He stopped to talk to her, "Hey, Anne!  Be wary of divinations, that Professor will make up a past for you if she doesn't know one offhand- it's kind of weird."  Anne laughed, and assured Harry that nothing his divinations teacher made up could compare to the past that she already had.</p><p>Anne finally made it to her classroom and she began to make sure everything was set up just right for her first day of observation.  She was determined to get a favourable review, even if it was going to be like squeezing blood out of a stone.  As she arranged the papers on her desk into piles of things to hand back and things to hand out, Anne realized that she had left her planbook on her table in her chamber.  Anne made her way back to her room as quickly and quietly as possible, careful not to arouse any attention as she passed classrooms full of students.  She passed the Potions lab and heard Snape bellowing at someone who had apparently blown up their cauldron.  It would defiantly be an interesting class, if nothing else.</p><p>Anne sat on the edge of her desk awaiting the arrival of the tick of the clock on the hour.  She was more than ready for her class to start, and the wait began to eat at her nerves.  There came a knock at the door that nearly sent Anne through the roof. </p><p>As she attempted to lower her heart rate back down to an acceptable number she called out to her guest, "Enter dear, whoever you be!"  The door opened and Professor Snape entered the room.  He nodded to her, she to him, and took a seat at a large desk in the back left corner of the classroom.  The clock ticked over to the hour and Anne opened the door with her hand-magic to let her students flow in.</p><p>After she let her students settle down and chat for a brief moment, Anne stood up and whistled for their attention, "Well, now that you are all captivated by my whistle, which, by the way, has been known to fracture eardrums, we should get down to work- we have a whole lot of things to do today!  So, for starters, here are your papers from last week."  Anne asked Hermione to aid her in passing them back, and then continued to speak, "Today we are continuing our poetry unit with Limericks!  These fun little poems can be on any topic you choose, as long as I could read it to Angel and they follow the standard format.  I am passing out a sheet here that has both the criteria for this assignment, and the criteria for the next assignment.  An example of a limerick is also on the sheet.  You will be given about twenty minutes to work on limericks, and then I will talk to you about the poem of address.</p><p>The twenty minutes seemed to fly by without incident.  Anne was enthralled at how well her observation was going.  Hopefully the day would continue on in an error free manner and Anne prayed for a good review.  As she rose to begin instructing her class on the next poem, she heard a scuffle from the centre of the classroom.  Crabbe and Goyle were, as far as Anne could tell, stealing Neville Longbottom's work off his desk.  Neville was attempting to resolve the problem quietly, but all his efforts were in vain.  Anne walked down the aisle to see what exactly was occurring. </p><p>Goyle and Crabbe were turned around to Draco, who took the limericks and laughed, "You call this poetry, Longbottom?  My father knows people who write better than this in the Ministry!  Who are you trying to impress?"  At this point Anne stood in front of Goyle and Crabbe's desks. </p><p>She caught Malfoy's eye and spoke in a voice filled with quiet power, "Here, give those to me."  By this time, Neville was turning a bright shade of red.  She perused through the limericks, impressed by Neville's choice of words, and his light style.  She handed the works back to him with a smile, "Are these the final copies?" </p><p>Neville shook his head, "No- please, I don't mean to be a problem..." </p><p>Anne's smile filled with warmth beyond her usual kind countenance, "Neville, these are wonderful- don't over-revise them."  Neville glanced up at her in disbelief and wonder.  Anne walked back to the front of the room and turned to the class.  "Well, next up is your poem of address.  It will be due on Thursday, and may be to anyone, on any single topic.  The rest of the guidelines, as well as an example are on the handout I gave you earlier.</p><p>As Anne returned to her desk, she pondered what stunt Malfoy would attempt to pull next.  She thought that having Snape in the room would reduce the probability of these types of occurrences, but apparently she was mistaken.  The students worked quietly as the clock ticked over the time.  Anne breathed a sigh of relief as she watched the clock.  There were ten short minutes left of class.  Anne felt a calm sweep over her. She did not believe that anything bad could happen in merely ten minutes.</p><p>Harry heard the skritching of quills as the other students wrote furiously before the class ended.  Harry had begun drafting three poems to different people, and all three sat on his desktop, all competing for the honour of being chosen as Harry's poem.  One of them addressed his parents, one of them addressed his friends, and the last one addressed Voldemort.  Since Harry was indecisive, he decided to write all three poems to their endings, and then to see which one Anne thought he should turn in.</p><p>There came a knock on the door that made Anne jump. </p><p>She called to whoever her guest was, "Enter at your own risk!"  She laughed to herself.  Two figures entered, both dressed in black robes.  Anne recognized the man from her past life:  they were Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy.</p><p>Lucius spoke, "Miss Schetzek, may we speak to you for a moment, please?"  He was not unkind in his tone, and Anne swore that she saw recognition in his eyes.  She nodded.  The pair approached her desk and began questioning her about the goals of her class- were they honourable, did they set out a line dividing the Muggle world from the Wizardry world, had the plans been approved by the Headmaster, and so forth.  The Malfoys were known for their strong anti-Muggle sentiments, and Anne was sure that this was the reason they were questioning her so.  Lucius then began to ask Anne about Angel and her lofty bloodlines.  Anne confirmed Angel's history for the Malfoys, who seemed convinced that the class and its teacher were harmless.  They began to leave, Anne feeling relieved that the questioning was not unfriendly. </p><p>Draco's voice rose out of the body of students, "What, that's it?"  The Malfoy's paused as there son spoke. </p><p>Narcissa turned toward him, "What else were you expecting?" </p><p>He glared at Anne, "Well, why the sudden arrival?  Where did she come from?  Why is she here?  I bet all this teacher stuff is just a cover up.  Why else would she come here in the middle of the year?  I bet she's running from something..." Draco paused and turned toward Anne, "Or someone.....  I bet you are, aren't you?"  The question hung in the air like a dense fog enshrouding the classroom.  Anne was uneasy behind her desk- the colours drained from her already fair skin.  She turned her eyes toward Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy.  Narcissa regarded her with a concerned look. </p><p>Kindly she spoke, "Miss, are you running?" </p><p>Anne nodded her head and sighed, "Yes Ma'am, I did come here for shelter- it is hard to raise a child when one is running and living on the streets." </p><p>Draco spoke under his breath to Crabbe and Goyle, "Wonder who from....Goyle, Crabbe- are you thinking what I'm thinking?"  Crabbe and Goyle stared at Draco as though he had just asked them what the meaning of life was.  He gave them an exasperated glare and sighed, "You two just don't get it.  Who do you <em>think</em> she'd be running from?"  Lucius Malfoy stepped up beside Anne's desk.</p><p>He quietly spoke to her while looking her in the eyes, "From whom?"</p><p>Anne lowered her chin, "I would prefer not to say- it is a personal matter and I would like to keep it that way."  She raised her head once again, her eyes slightly saddened.  Despite the woeful look her eyes held, a soft smile still graced her lips.  She sighed deeply, as if she were trying to regain her centre of calm.  Draco's voice cut the silence in the room. </p><p>Lucius' head snapped to look at his son.  "I bet I can tell you who she is running from."  All eyes turned to Draco, he smirked and continued on, "Well, the only reason I see that she would be running was if her life was at stake.  Why though is she hesitant to tell us a name?  If it was someone who we would have never heard of, there would be no problem, right?"  Draco's friends nodded and murmured their agreement, "So logically it would be someone we have <em>all</em> heard of........I think she's running from You-Know-Who.......I think our Miss Schetzek is a former Death Eater."</p><p>A shocked silence hung in the air for a few agonizing seconds. </p><p>Narcissa Malfoy bent a concerned eye toward Anne, "Is it true?  Is that why you came here?"  Anne paused for a moment and sighed deeply.  She stood up from her desk and turned to the Malfoys, her left side facing the students.  She carefully unclasped her scarab broach holding her robes closed. The free cloth fluttered down to its natural position.  Anne gracefully let her robes fall from her shoulders to reveal her truth to the world.</p><p>Hermione sat stone still in her seat as Anne let her robes drift off her shoulders, <em>"It can't be true, this is all a misunderstanding- there is nothing there..."  </em>Hermione attempted to convince herself that her thoughts were the truth; in her stomach she felt a strange uneasiness.</p><p>Ron stared at the scene before him, shock echoing in his eyes.  He was not thinking anything; his mind was a blank slate.  His gut churned with the accusation that their beloved Miss Schetzek could have had a past so dark that only the Dark Lord could have tainted it so.</p><p>Harry felt an intense anger boiling in his veins.  The accusations were not true, could not be true, and had never been true.  He felt like hitting Draco and watching his face contort in pain at the strike.  Harry refused to believe that the sweet, motherly woman teaching his class could have ever had any connection to the murdering villain that had so ruthlessly slain his parents.</p><p>Anne's shoulders were bared to everyone intently studying her.  There on her left arm was a mark so hideous that many of the students averted their eyes upon its revelation.  The Dark Mark stood out in stark contrast to Anne's fair skin.  Draco laughed triumphantly. </p><p>The Malfoys turned and left the room quickly and Anne addressed her class, struggling to control the emotions seeping through her quivering voice, "I'm sorry that today culminated to this- you are dismissed for today, class <em>will</em> be meeting tomorrow, despite this unfortunate turn of events.  We will not let that which we cannot change alter our current course of action.  Thank you."  Anne drifted over to her desk and slowly sank into her chair, the inquisition of the class taking its toll on her already frazzled disposition.  The students began to murmur among themselves as they left the classroom, some of them glancing warily over their shoulders at Anne as they passed.  The door softly fell shut after the last student filed out of the room.  Anne sighed deeply and, with her arms lying crossed on the desk, let a small tear roll from the corner of her eye.  She laid her chin on her hands as more delicate tears gently fell down her face like a soft rain.  She stared at the air ahead of her, not seeing Professor Snape slowly rise to his feet at the back of the classroom.  He drifted to the front of the room towards Anne's desk, his footsteps barely audible in the silent classroom.  She felt his presence by the side of the desk.  He hesitated before heading to the door.</p><p>Snape thought to himself as he stood beside Anne's desk, <em>"Should I offer some sort of consolation?  If so, what?"</em>  He slowly raised his hand and softly laid it on her shoulder.  For a brief moment he let it rest there before letting it drift back down to his side and leaving the room.  Tomorrow was another day, perhaps the storm would have calmed by then.</p><p>Angel approached the Great Hall that evening with apprehension.  She had been hearing rumours that the Malfoys had spoken to her mother and in the course of the discussion her mother's past had somehow been revealed. </p><p>Angel realized she was already late for dinner as Harry and Ron ran by her.  "Angel, come on- we need to be in there before Dumbledore starts talking!" Ron said as he passed.  Angel snapped out of her thoughts and rejoined reality as she followed the boys into the Great Hall.</p><p>From the Head Table Snape could see three students scrambling to find their seats before the meal.  With greater investigation he observed that it was Harry, Ron, and Anne's daughter.  He pondered her name for a moment.  Failing to find it in his memory, he shook his head, clearing it of the thought.</p><p>Meanwhile Anne rose from her desk in her classroom and left the room.  Her papers were still spread across her desk, and they would be there tomorrow when her mind was clearer.  She slowly walked down to her chamber, changed into her night-dress, and laid down in her hammock to fall asleep.  Hopefully her dreams would be kind and let her forget the incidents of the day since past.</p><p>Tuesday morning came faster than Anne would have liked.  She woke up later than usual, noticing that Angel had already gone to her first class of the day.  She hoped in her deepest of hearts that Angel would not catch the repercussions of her past and its revelation.  She dragged herself out of bed and went to her clothes chest.  She pulled out her black velvet dress and slipped into it.  She brushed out her hair until its waves glistened in the torch light of the chamber.  Having missed breakfast, Anne decided to pay a visit to the kitchen.  She quickly walked to the kitchen, hoping not to run into anyone as she went.  She slipped through the door and into the kitchens.  The smell of fresh baked bread filled the room, its homely feel calming Anne's troubled spirit. </p><p>Winky ran over to Anne, "Winky has heard of Anne's unfortunate class yesterday.  Can Winky help Anne?"  Anne smiled.  The kindness of Winky's offer was reassuring to her as she seated herself next to the counter. </p><p>Dobby brought Anne a slice of warm bread, "Here, Dobby has always felt better when Dobby has new bread."  Anne's smile deepened.  A small crowd of house elves watched her eat.  They seemed to be waiting for something. </p><p>Anne finished the slice, "Wünderbar, absolutely wonderful......Thank you.  I am glad you're not afraid to help." </p><p>A short house elf with at little tuft of bright red hair sticking out on top of his head stepped forward, "Bob is never afraid to help, Bob knows that once Bob was free from a bad master, house elves thought Bob was bad too, but Bob is not bad, Bob is good!" </p><p>Anne's smile grew, "Well, I'm glad you all are so kind- I worry though that if the others at Hogwarts cannot see me so forgivingly that I may have to leave.  I really don't want to run again, but I don't want Angel to have to stay here if we are not loved........decisions, decisions...."  The house elves began to mutter between themselves. </p><p>Winky stepped forward, "Anne cannot leave!  If Anne has to stop teaching, Anne can come and help Winky, Dobby, Bob, and the other house elves in the kitchen!"  Anne thanked them considerably.  She then excused herself from their company, reassuring them that she would let them know what was happening as the days passed.  Anne left the kitchens with a renewed and determined hope, making her way to her classroom to set up.  She would not let anything stop her; Angel was not going to have to leave Hogwarts.</p><p>Anne opened the door to her classroom and stepped inside.  Her desk was scattered with papers left there from the day before.  She opened a cabinet under her desk and pulled out her antique crank start phonograph.  She set it on top of a coffee table set beside her desk.  Anne pulled out a box of cylinders to play on the machine.  She placed one of them on the spindle and cranked the phonograph to start it.  The silver notes of <em>She Moved Through the Fair</em> filled the room as Anne sorted through the clutter on her desk, preparing herself for the study of the Romantic era of poetry to take place in her classroom later that day.</p><p>Five minutes before the start of Anne's class, Severus Snape entered the room. </p><p>Anne gave a little jump, "Oh, Professor, sorry, I was in my own little world......"  He walked to his place at the back of the room as <em>Loch Lomond</em> drifted from the phonograph.  Five minutes seemed to be a small eternity until she let the students into the room.  She let the students chatter for a minute or so as they settled into their desks.  Anne began the class with no mention of the incidents of the previous day, "Welcome, today we will be beginning a study of the Romance poets, but first I need your Limericks.  Please remember that your Poems of Address are due on this upcoming Thursday."  She placed the stack of papers on her desk and introduced the new topic of study, "Today we will begin studying the Romance Era; can anyone tell me what the Romance Era is?" Hermione raised her hand, "Yes Hermione?" </p><p>"The Romance Period existed from the mid nineteenth century to the end of that same century.  The writers were concerned with the mechanization of Europe and wrote about the world around them with truth and grace.  It is one of the most influential literary periods and it saw the birth of the Novel." </p><p>Anne laughed lightly, "Hermione, you just saved me from having to explain anything about the era.  I hope you all were listening, because that information is important in understanding the Romantic poetry.  This term 'Romantic' has nothing to do with love, it is a different definition.  Keep that in mind also.  This section of the class will not operate like your standard poetry class, we will not analyse the poem for its structure; rather we will be looking at the poems for their deeper meaning and references.  Class discussion will be held, and all views will be discussed.  There is no wrong answer when finding the meaning of a work, as long as it is supported by the poem itself.  I do not want to hear anyone say that the poem 'Mary had a Little Lamb' is about death, or something completely unfounded, but please do not be afraid to mention an alternative interpretation.  Our first work is called <strong><em><u>Lullaby</u></em></strong> by William Blake.  I will read it aloud."  Anne carefully picked up a three ring binder from of her desk.  She gently ran her fingers over the cover, a wistful smile tracing over her face.  She opened it up to one of the last pages and began to read with deep emotion,</p><p> </p><p align="center"><strong><em><u>Lullaby</u></em></strong><br/>

<em>Hear it not, Heaven, thy Ministers have done it!</em></p><p> </p><p>Anne stopped reading and closed the book, letting a deep silence hang over the classroom.  She waited a moment, then asked, "So, does anyone have any idea what the poet was trying to tell us?"  No one answered for a spell, and then Susan Bones raised her hand. </p><p>Anne nodded to her and Susan began to speak, "Well, the title of the poem suggests it takes place before the world sleeps, and sleep is often figurative for death- it makes sense that the poem is said to a dying world, considering the historical context." </p><p>Anne nodded and then pointed to Lee Jordan's raised hand, "Yeah, I think that the speaker wants the world to realize that troubles of the time were because of false preachers, not the government."  Anne spoke, "Is that a literal meaning of false preachers, or figurative?"  Lee thought a moment, "Probably both, the real church leaders and everybody else telling.....HEY!  It could be talking about the false statements that mechanization would solve all the world's problems, and that the cities were where you should be!" </p><p>Anne smiled, "That is a very good probability, Lee.  I never quite considered that one before.  Holli, were you going to say something?" </p><p>The strawberry blonde in the last row shook her head, "Lee already mentioned it."  Soon, other students began to offer their opinions on the poem.  Hannah Abbott offered to sing a version of it with Elenore Branstone if someone was willing to take the bass line and speak the poem over their background vocals.  No one wanted to help, so Anne suggested that she find someone and they perform it later.  The girls happily agreed to her suggestion.  The class hour flew by and soon Anne found herself dismissing her students and closing up her classroom for the night.</p><p>Anne entered her chamber to find Angel pouring over a pile of Potions notes that covered a great amount of the table.  She sat down in front of a clear spot on the table and began to read the Limericks handed in that day.  Angel left for dinner in the Great Hall and Anne continued to grade papers through dinner and long after Angel came home to bed.</p><p>Wednesday Anne awoke at Noon.  She showered and dressed before making a path to the kitchen for her lunch.  The house elves were busy trying to read her recipe for pizza dough.  They were a bit confused by her handwriting, so she convinced them to wait until Friday to decipher it and she would help them to make pizza for Dinner.</p><p>Anne continued her study of Romantic poetry in her class that day.  She saw Snape seated in his corner.  He was watching the students file into the room.  After the students had settled into their seats she drew an old volume out of a drawer in her desk. </p><p>She introduced the book to them, "This text is from the year 1910 and is titled <strong><em><u>Twelve Centuries of English Poetry and Prose</u></em></strong>.  I have found many hours of solace between the pages of this agéd text.  Our next piece is entitled <strong><em><u>Ozymandias</u></em></strong> by Percy Bysshe Shelley.  Listen closely to this poem and try to identify irony, satire, or sarcasm in this text."</p><p>
  <strong> <em> <u> </u> </em> </strong>
</p><p align="center"><strong><em><u>Ozymandias</u></em></strong><br/>
<strong><em>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</em></strong><br/>
<em>I met a traveller from an antique land</em><br/>
<em>Who said:  'Two vast and trunkless legs of stone</em><br/>
<em>Stand in the desert.  Near them, on the sand,</em><br/>
<em>Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,</em><br/>
<em>And wrinkled lip, a sneer of cold command,</em><br/>
<em>Tell that its sculpture well those passions read</em><br/>
<em>Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,</em><br/>
<em>The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.</em><br/>
<em>And on the pedestal these words appear--</em><br/>
<em>"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:</em><br/>
<em>Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"</em><br/>
<em>Nothing beside remains.  Round the decay</em><br/>
<em>Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare</em><br/>
<em>The lone and level sands stretch far away.'</em></p><p> </p><p>Anne looked up from the old text and leaned back on her desk.  "Well, can anyone tell me which of sarcasm, irony, or satire are in this poem?" </p><p>Mandy Brocklehurst raised her hand.  "Yes Mandy?"  "Well, the fact that all that remains of his great kingdom is irony.  Also the face of the king sneers, not like a 'king of kings' would look." </p><p>Anne nodded and asked another question, "Are there any double meanings to the words in this poem?" </p><p>Dean Thomas raised his hand and spoke as Anne addressed him, "Well, the word 'mocked'- it can either mean imitated or scorned.  I think that is a double meaning, as is the word 'beside'- it can mean nothing else remains, or nothing next to it remains."</p><p>Anne encouraged Dean, "Very well said.  Now I would like you all to group into sets of three and think of images that this poem evokes- not only visual images, but other types of sensory details are acceptable also."  The students grouped up and for the last half hour of class Anne rotated around the classroom talking to each group about the various images they found in <strong><em><u>Ozymandias</u></em></strong>.</p><p>Anne went home that night to her dungeon apartment to finish grading Limericks.  She saw Angel leave for dinner when she was about five papers short of finishing.  She finished her papers and went to bed at the same time Angel did.  She was becoming quite tired due to the long week.  The emotional strain of Monday was definitely taking its toll on her physically.</p><p>Anne slept through Thursday morning and after showering and putting on her green velvet dress she headed to the kitchens for lunch.  She was greeted by a troupe of excited house elves.  They told Anne to promise she would meet them after lunch on Friday to help them to make pizza.  Anne made herself Hummus and Pita for lunch, fascinating the house elves that were helping her.  She talked to the house elves about soups and how to make them just so until seven minutes before her class was scheduled to begin.  Anne realized the time, told the house elves she'd meet them tomorrow, and then ran to her classroom.  Standing outside her door, and slightly annoyed, was Professor Snape.  Anne apologized profusely for her tardiness.  Snape seemed less than amused.  She opened the door wide and let her students in early.  After they were seated Anne began the class.</p><p>She smiled broadly to her students, "How many of you remembered that your Poems of Address were due today?"  The students grumbled and gasped as only five hands were raised.  Anne laughed, "Figured so.  Today is a workday so you five can relax and do your other homework if you want to.  Please check in your poems as they are completed."  Anne picked up the pile of Limericks and passed them back as her students began to work.  Once she was done she sat down and began to grade the five Poems of Address that lay on her desk.  The rest of the poems trickled in as the hour drew to a close.  Anne dismissed the class and gathered the rest of her papers to grade that night.  She left the classroom and when she arrived at her chamber she sat down and began to grade the poems.  There was a knock at the door and Angel left with Harry, Ron, and Hermione for dinner.  Anne sat up all night with a bag of potato chips grading papers.  At midnight they were done and Anne stumbled into her hammock to get as much sleep as she could before her busy pizza baking day.</p><p>Friday morning arrived nine hours later.  Anne sprang from her hammock and ran up to the showers and back.  She was ready to bake by ten o'clock.  She waited until lunch, smoothing her hands over her brown travelling dress.  Anne braided her hair and then could wait no longer.  It was eleven and she excitedly ran up the stairs to the main level and then to the kitchen.  She dodged the students on their way to lunch and entered the kitchen with an unbound enthusiasm.</p><p>They made pizza dough and sauce until three o'clock when Anne had to clean up for her class.  The house elves had been instructed how to cook the pizza, and Anne had left with every confidence in their abilities.  She showered and changed into her pale blue dress with half length bell sleeves.  Anne entered her classroom and shortly thereafter Snape entered.  She flung open the door of the room with a smile and let her class enter.  She asked her students what their opinion on the Romantic poetry was.  No one answered. </p><p>Anne asked them what the problem was.  For a moment no one answered, then Ron raised his hand, "No offence Miss Schetzek, but after Monday a few of us are a bit apprehensive about your class.  It's not everyday that we find out that one of our teachers is a former Death Eater." </p><p>Anne smiled, "I understand completely.  Well then, what do you want to know?  I open myself up to your questions, comments, and concerns for the rest of the hour."</p><p>For a moment no one spoke, and then Owen Cauldwell spoke up, "How does someone like you end up in the Dark Arts anyway?" </p><p>Anne sighed, her smile still shining, "That is a question I am still trying to answer myself.  I can tell you my story though, and maybe that will help.  I moved from America to England when I was eighteen years old to attend Cambridge University.  It was there that I met others involved in wizardry.  One of them introduced me to their teacher, an old man living in a neighbouring village.  I won't go into all the details of my life at this time because it is still a bit painful to talk about.  The old man eventually took me to a meeting of other wizards.  That was where I first met Voldemort.  Yes, I say his name- once you know an evil personally you might as well call it by its proper title- that reduces your fear of the thing.  Anyway, I was twenty at that time and quickly growing in my powers.  He did not have his own body at that time.  At first I found him somewhat repulsive, but as time grew I found that I became used too much stranger things than someone sharing a body.  The parasite taught me many different things, most of them harmless at first.  He taught me levitation, duelling, basic spell casting, and finally the Unforgivable curses.  By the time I turned twenty-one I was one of the Death Eaters.  I became a favourite of Voldemort's, simply because I believed all that he told me and I was easily led.  Then came the missions- dirty work that was a bit disconcerting at first, but I got used to it.  Eventually I was sent on a mission to 'eliminate' a troublesome Muggle who was probing to far into the past of one of our members.  I failed that mission- instead of killing her according to the plan I lost track of her in the subway system under London.  That was my first failure, but Voldemort was quite forgiving of my miscalculation.  He told me that not everyone can succeed every time.  He assigned that task to another Death Eater and let me take a break.  I rested for a period and then on my twenty-second birthday he stationed me in Ireland.  That was where I met Angel, but I will get to that later.  A group of Death Eaters, myself included, went to a little village on the sea to root out the source of a disturbance there.  A local witch and wizard had become too strong for our comfort and were attempting to find anyone associated with the Dark Arts and turn them in to the Ministry of Magic.  We confronted them in their home one night.  I refuse to go into any detail as to what events came to pass that night- they are to horrific to remember......but anyway, after they were dead, we heard a noise from the upstairs.  A five year old child had heard our noises and was crying in her sleep.  I convinced the rest of the group to leave and to let me take care of the child.  They did and I went upstairs to check out the situation.  I found the little girl, but couldn't bring myself to harm her.  That night I made a decision.  I would leave the Dark Arts and take the child with me.  I stayed at the house that night.  The next morning I returned to the Dark Lord with a sinking feeling in my heart.  Five months later I learned that Voldemort had sent a group of Death Eaters to my home town.  My sister Grace had been training in wizardry and had been 'eliminated' as a challenge to my rise to power.  In the middle of that night I packed all I owned into a cedar chest, a sea chest, and a satchel.  I levitated them quietly out of the door and left the service of Voldemort forever.  The next day I found myself in the same seaside town I had carried out my last mission in.  Curious, I went to the local orphanage.  Sure enough I found the same five year old girl in sitting in a corner.  She was crying softly to herself, asking everyone who passed if they could adopt her.  I talked to the nuns and left that day with a daughter.  I told her to gather her things so she dragged a miniature sea chest over to me.  We left and I booked a flight to England, spending much of the little Muggle money I had left.  We kept moving through my twenty-third year and my twenty-fourth year until we had seen much of England, Scotland, and Wales.  We had a few scrapes nearly being captured, but made it out of all of them.  I home schooled Angel for the entire time that we travelled.  Before I had turned twenty-three Angel had told me how her parents died.  I had very cautiously told her of my involvement in the Dark Arts.  She had been entirely open and accepting of my past, forgiving me because of my own regrets of having ever been associated with Voldemort.  Angel knew basic wizardry from her parents and we continued to discover for ourselves what skills we possessed.  I turned twenty-five on October thirty-first of this year.  I stumbled across Hogsmeade quite by accident and stayed there until someone told me of Hogwarts.  I was down to my last ten gallions, so I pressed the trail.  We carried all of our luggage with us one day and set out to find the castle.  We entered the Entry Hall and set our chests down in the hallway, along with my satchel.  Then I opened the door to the Great Hall, hoping I had found the right place.  That was when you all saw Angel and me for the first time."</p><p>The class was captivated by her story to the very end of the tale. </p><p>Anne looked at the clock above the door, "Time for you to all to be dismissed.  I hope that clarified some things for you!"  The students left the room, many of them stopping to tell Anne how glad they were she had returned from the darkness.  Anne's heart warmed as she spoke to each student.  Maybe she and Angel would stay after all.</p><p>After all the students had left the room she sighed and sat on the corner of the desk laughing to herself. </p><p>Professor Snape walked over to her, "Well, you handled that quite well, Miss Schetzek." </p><p>Anne's smile softened, "It wasn't easy- and call me Anne."  He nodded and there was a slight silence before she spoke again, "So...how did I do this week?  I know it wasn't a typical week, but did I do O.K.?" </p><p>Snape almost smiled, "You did fine, Anne.  Now won't you come to Dinner tonight?  It has been quite quiet at the Head Table.  Perhaps you could get a conversation going?  After that confession today, you may want to make an appearance- you wouldn't want it to appear that you were hiding, would you?"  </p><p>Anne laughed lightly, "Agreed.  I will definitely be at Dinner tonight.  The house elves and I have a surprise for everyone tonight, and I wouldn't miss that for the world."  They left the classroom at the same time, Snape pausing a moment as Anne locked the door.  They began to walk to the dungeons in silence.  As Anne turned the corner to her chambers she noticed the door was slightly ajar.  She commented to Snape, "Angel must have a guest." </p><p>Snape nodded and walked to his classroom one door down, "I will see you at Dinner." </p><p>Anne nodded, "Precisely!" as she entered her apartment.</p><p>Anne entered the room to find Angel, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny all seated around the large table.  Angel was helping Ginny with her Potions work while raiding Anne's "snack stash".  Anne smiled at the study group. </p><p>She tapped on Angel's shoulder, "You owe me potato chips, two Hershey's chocolate bars, and three two litres of Ruby Red Squirt.  Anyway....dinner tonight should be interesting." </p><p>Angel looked quizzically at her mother, "What about dinner?  Are you coming?" </p><p>Anne nodded, "Yes, I'm coming, and I won't tell you a thing about what the surprise is; you'll find out when you get there."  Anne winked at Angel.  She sat down at the table with them, "Can't promise anything, but if you need help I may be able to assist." </p><p>For the next few hours she sat at the table helping them with various subjects of homework and learning a few things herself.  The entire group left the room together to make tracks to the Great Hall.  In the hallway they met Professor Snape.  He nodded curtly to Anne as she locked her door. </p><p>Anne spoke, "Care to join us Professor?" </p><p>He busied himself with locking the door to the Potions Lab, "No thank you." </p><p>Anne shrugged as Ron shouted, "Last one to the Great Hall is a rotten egg!" </p><p>Angel, Harry, and Hermione dashed off to catch up with Ron as Anne stood laughing behind them, "Guess I'm the rotten egg," she remarked to Snape.  Anne waited a moment as he locked his door and they walked to the Great Hall in silence.</p><p>Before the meal began, Albus Dumbledore rose to address the students and staff, "Tomorrow, as you all know, you will be leaving the school for Christmas Break.  You have all, by now, received your grades for your mid-terms and well know whether or not to study over the Break- I trust you will have a wonderful and safe time, so let the feast begin!"  On each table rows of pizzas of every topping appeared.  Holli MacCumhail approached the Head Table and spoke to the Headmaster.  He rose once again, "There has been a request that there be mixed tables for this gathering, and it is a request that I will grant."  A cheer swelled from the student body as Holli ran down the stairs and sat down with Angel.  Anne smiled as the students mingled and laughed.  A pizza party before Christmas Break was definitely one of her best ideas yet.</p><p>The next morning Anne awoke to the sounds of excited students preparing to board the Hogwarts Express.  Angel had left the room, so Anne threw on her bathrobe to find her.  She mounted the stairs to find Angel at the top saying her goodbyes to her classmates.  Anne smiled and returned to her room to grab her clothing.  She then made her way to the shower and tidied up for the day.  She smoothed her full dark blue skirt before slipping into her maroon T-shirt.  The half length sleeves neatly covered the Dark Mark.  She returned to the hallway after dressing and began to wish the students, "Happy Holidays."  The next three weeks certainly would be quiet around Hogwarts.</p><p>The rest of Saturday Anne spent with the house elves.  For lunch they took a break form their regular cooking to fix Hummus and Pita for the few students and staff members left at the school over Christmas Break.  The house elves were intrigued by the ethnic dishes Anne was so fond of and they were determined to learn these fascinating recipes for themselves.  They were also quite interested in the secrets to crock pot soups and Anne was their ticket to that information.  The kitchen was filled with the smells of various soups and stews, attracting the nose of both Minerva McGonagall and the Headmaster himself.  They were surprised to see Anne in the centre of the group of house elves. </p><p>Minerva attempted to attract Anne's attention, "Anne?  Anne!" </p><p>Anne gave a little start, "Oh, Minerva, Albus, come right on in- you can join us if you want to- the soups will be ready for dinner tomorrow." </p><p>Minerva nearly spoke in protest to Anne's involvement in the kitchens, but Albus cut off her opportunity, "I, for one, would be more than happy to join you- it could be interesting to learn your secrets."  He smiled and stepped into the kitchen further.  Minerva hesitated at the door, but at Albus' prompting entered the kitchen also. </p><p>Shortly thereafter Angel appeared in the doorway, "Mum, can I go to Hagrid's hut with Harry, Ron, and Hermione?" </p><p>Anne turned from her cauliflower mushroom barley soup for a moment and shouted to Angel across the room, "Dress warm and you can go- just be back here for dinner."  Angel thanked her mother and ran off to find her winter coat.</p><p>Angel scrambled up the stairs from the dungeon with her heavy coat in her arms.  She met Hermione at the top of the stairs.  The boys were waiting for them in the Entry Hall.  Hermione and Angel ran to meet them as Angel was attempting to put on her coat.  The four friends left the huge front doors to find themselves in a world of white.  Angel skipped through the snow with Harry, Ron, and Hermione following. </p><p>Harry turned to Hermione and Ron, "Where <strong><em><u>does</u></em></strong> she get all that energy?"  Ron shrugged and Hermione raised her eyebrows.</p><p>Back in the castle Anne had finished with her crock pot and was circulating through the kitchen checking the various soups.  She finished her rotation and sat down on the countertop. </p><p>Bob stepped over to her, "What does Anne suggest for dinner tonight?  We finished off most of the leftovers ourselves over the past few days.  Winky and Dobby say there is no more pizza, the students finished it off yesterday.  What does Anne think for tonight?"  Anne looked around the large kitchen and began asking Bob if they had certain ingredients.  Bob confirmed that everything was somewhere in the kitchen, so Anne asked if they had a large pot to boil noodles in.  Bob once again positively answered her inquisition and curiously tipped his head, "What is Anne thinking?" </p><p>Anne looked at him kindly, "Have you ever made Fettuccini Alfredo with Linguini noodles?" </p><p>Winky shook her head, "Winky has never made that," she turned to Dobby, "Has Dobby?" </p><p>Dobby shook his head and turned to the rest of the house elves, "Have any house elves ever made Fettuccini Alfredo with Linguini noodles?"  They all shook their heads. </p><p>Anne stood up from her countertop perch, "Well, after tonight you will have.  Find the pot to boil the noodles in, and gather the following ingredients..."  Anne listed a series of foodstuffs and began to make dinner for the few students remaining at Hogwarts.</p><p>That night at the single table used during Christmas Break sat Anne, Angel, Harry, Hermione, Harry, Ron, Hagrid, Minerva, Albus, Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, and Holli.  Anne was curious as to why the three Slytherins had not gone home.  She could see that Angel was just as inquiring, as were the other students.  Anne decided not to spoil the light atmosphere of the meal by bringing up the topic, so she merely ignored this as an irregularity and smiled as all the students temporarily got along with one another.  After dinner Anne retired to her chamber while Angel retreated to Gryffindor House with Harry, Hermione, and Ron.  She opened up the sea chest tucked under the hammock and pulled out a vibrant red bolt of cloth, a roll of thread, a box of pins, and a needle.  She laid the items on the table and set to work.</p><p>Later that night Angel crept into the chamber thinking that her mother may have been asleep.  She very carefully entered the room. </p><p>As Angel shut the door Anne looked up from her work, "Angel, it is ten o'clock at night- you should have been in bed by now- and home by far earlier." </p><p>Angel looked sheepishly at her mother, "Sorry Mums, we were talking about things and the time slipped away.  I hope that this is not going to create a problem?" </p><p>Anne smiled, "Just try to be more practical about the times you are getting back- I would like to get some sleep each night." </p><p>Angel climbed up on the table, "What are you making, Mums?"  Anne grinned, "Well, I don't have a dress formal enough for Christmas anymore, so I decided to make myself one...I do hope it turns out all right!"  Angel's smile met her mother's and she clamoured up into her loft.  Anne tucked her in, turned down the torches, and fell asleep the moment her head hit her pillow.</p><p>Sunday morning came all too early for Anne.  She dragged herself out of bed and stretched while she walked over to her dressing corner.  She dug through her clothing chest and pulled out a simple black velvet dress.  Anne laid the dress on her hammock as she reached for her bath robe.  She made her way to the door, closing it quietly on her way to the showers as not to wake Angel.</p><p>When Anne returned to her chamber, she noticed Angel was still fast asleep in her loft.  Anne decided not to wake her and went back to work on her dress.  At eleven o'clock Angel finally sprang from her bed, bounding down to the floor below. </p><p>She walked over to her mother who was stitching the sleeves of her project gown, "Mums?  Is it time for lunch yet?" </p><p>Anne looked up from her work and answered, "Nearly, wait for a short hour or so and then it will be time for lunch.  Heaven knows what we are having, probably soups."</p><p>The day flew by faster than any Anne had experienced during her stay at Hogwarts.  Before she realized the day had passed, she was stitching the hem on the skirt of her Christmas dress and readying herself for dinner.  Anne and Angel walked together to the Great Hall.  They were delighted to be having crock pot soups as they had eaten for lunch.  Angel tried the vegetable soup, while Anne stuck with her old favourite, Mushroom Cauliflower Barley soup.  They laughed through dinner together, and somehow the Slytherins managed to keep a tentative peace with the other students at the table.  Anne decided she would have to inquire as to why Draco and the other Slytherins were staying at the school over Christmas Break. </p><p>She walked over to Draco and in an exceptionally friendly manner cleared her throat to begin speaking, "What caused you and your friends to stay here over Break?  Albus has told me you usually spend this time of year at home." </p><p>Draco turned to her, "My parents are quite busy, if you must know- it is none of your business anyway."  Crabbe and Goyle nodded their agreement. </p><p>Anne stepped back to Angel, "Well if they aren't as friendly as rabid pit-bulls...I wonder what their parents are up to." </p><p>Angel looked her mother full in her face, "I think I know <strong><em><u>who</u></em></strong> they are with- I don't even want to know what they are doing while in his service."</p><p>On Monday, Anne and Angel made a trip with Hagrid to Hogsmeade for Christmas shopping.  Angel and Hagrid departed in one direction, while Anne went off on her own.  Anne knew just what to find Angel. <br/>
<br/>
She went strait to the tailor shop and softly approached the desk, "Excuse me, Miss?  I need a set of plain black robes for my daughter, and I also will need your help in finding her a little something special...."</p><p>Meanwhile, Angel had led Hagrid to the Quiddich Supply shop. </p><p>She looked up at Hagrid's tall frame towering over her, "Mr. Hagrid, what do you think- can we find something for Mum in here?" </p><p>Hagrid smiled down at the little lady he was escorting around Hogsmeade, "Knowing' yer mother, this'll be the place that we find 'er Christmas present."</p><p>After Anne left the tailor shop, she crossed the street and entered a confections shop.  She was careful to note the positions of all the shops as they passed, for she knew that she would never remember their names.</p><p>Hagrid and Angel left the Quiddich shop with a large parcel.  She fingered the coins in her hand, "Well, I still have a little left, so let's go to the pet shop and see what we can find there- Mum has always wanted an Owl..."</p><p>Anne left the confections shop and walked quickly down to the Potions shop.  She had a mission of her own to complete over Christmas Break.</p><p>Angel, Anne, and Hagrid met back in the Great Hall an hour later after they had hidden their gifts from one another.  They laughed together, telling one another of whom or what they had seen while in the town.  Anne asked Hagrid to watch Angel that night while she finished an errand of her own.  He happily agreed to grant her request.</p><p>Monday evening Anne left the school property and teleported herself into a quiet alley in Hogsmeade.  She slipped out from between the buildings to finish her shopping without anyone to give away her secret task.  She travelled around the shops purchasing little stocking stuffers for Angel and a few other little gifts.  She also stopped and bought herself a nice scroll to write her Christmas letter to the Headmaster on.  She finished her shopping and teleported back to the property just beyond that belonging to Hogwarts.  Anne made her way carefully through the forest to the school.  She was unafraid of the forest, even at night, for she knew that far more evil things lurked Azkaban, and in the heart of her former Master.</p><p>Anne knocked softly on the door to her chambers as the clock in the Entry Hall chimed midnight.  She thanked Hagrid immensely for his help and hid the gifts under her table.  She pulled out her sewing and began to diligently work on finishing her Christmas dress.  It was near 5:00 in the morning before Anne finished her sewing and crawled under the covers in her hammock.</p><p>Angel slept nearly until noon the next day and left her mother a note that she was going to, "Check on the status of the Christmas gifts."  Anne woke an hour later and smiled at her daughter's note.  It read,</p><p>
  <em>"Mum- Good Morning to you!  I have gone to chek on the statis of the Christmas gifts.  I hope they have rapped themselfs over-night.  See you this after-noon."  </em>
</p><p>The little misspellings made the note quaint to Anne, and she tucked it in her cedar chest next to her clothing.  She pulled the bags out from under the table and began to wrap the stocking stuffers in colourful paper she had bought the night before.  After an hour of careful wrapping of the stocking stuffers, Anne wrapped gifts she had picked up for Minerva, Hagrid, and Albus.  She then pulled out Angel's gifts.  She tied a ribbon around the small bag of candies she had purchased and set them aside.  The silver box that the robes lay in was not decorated, so Anne wrapped the corners with a crimson ribbon and left the simplicity of the wrapping lend to its charm.  After finishing with those parcels, Anne wrote out her scroll to Albus and set everything aside on the top of her cedar chest.  She dragged her heavy sea chest out from under her hammock and slowly opened it.  She drew out a small ebony box and set it on the table.  Anne carefully began to measure and mix these with the potions she had purchased the day before.  She poured the finished concoction into an old label-less wine bottle she had found on her travels and quickly corked it.  She shook the bottle gently and tied it with a violet ribbon.  To the ribbon she attached a small note that read,</p><p>
  <em>"Merry Christmas Severus- may the years ahead be blessed with love and understanding.  Your 'neighbour' in Hogwarts, Anne."  </em>
</p><p>She tucked the ebony box and all the unused potions into her sea chest and tightly latched the lid.  She placed the bottle on the floor next to the sea chest and went to the Great Hall to meet Angel for dinner.</p><p>Christmas Eve proved to be very peaceful.  The Slytherin students were unusually quiet at dinner, while Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Holli were unusually excited about the following day.  Angel's eyes were glimmering in the dim light as she anticipated the dawn.</p><p>Christmas morning came early as Angel bounded over to her mother's hammock to awaken her at 6:43. </p><p>Anne was already up.  "Mum, Saint Nicholas found me here too!  Can I open my stocking now?  Please Mum......"  Anne beamed at her daughter as she lit the torches around the room with her hand-magic as she called it.  Angel pulled her stocking over to the table.</p><p> Anne spoke as she pulled herself out of bed, "Well, you know we have to go up to the Christmas tree to open other presents- I tucked them under it last night." </p><p>Angel replied, "Well Mum, that is where I had Hagrid put yours too, so maybe I should take my stocking up there and open it- well, what are we waiting for?  Let’s go!!"  Anne laughed as Angel practically dragged her out of her chamber and up the cold stone stairs to the Great Hall.</p><p>By the time they entered the Great Hall, it was 7:00 and Hagrid, Minerva, and Albus joined them shortly after.  Angel was too excited to wait until after breakfast to open her presents, so Anne let her empty her Christmas stocking before breakfast.  She poured the contents onto the floor in front of the tree and set to busily unwrapping the little toys her mother had found or made for her.  There were colourful little tops, a bag of marbles, a set of jacks, and many bright paper dolls with carefully detailed dresses that glittered in the morning light that the charmed ceiling cast down on the happy company.</p><p>Everyone was in good spirits when the large breakfast was laid out in front of them on the one long table.  Surprisingly enough, even the Slytherins were cheerful.  Anne smiled at Draco Malfoy and was surprised that he returned her smile.  Angel was restless all through breakfast as she anxiously waited the time when she would be allowed to tear open her presents.  Anne laughed at her impatient earnestness as Angel squirmed while waiting.  Finally breakfast was over and Anne followed Angel as she raced to the Christmas tree and crawled under it searching for her presents.  Anne smiled as she watched her daughter and listened as only a mother could to the music of Angel's excited voice. </p><p>Angel pulled out the little satchel of candy and ran to hug her mother joyously, "Thank you Mums- do I have anything else under there?" </p><p>Anne laughed and hugged her daughter back, "Yes child, one more gift, now go and find it." </p><p>Meanwhile Hagrid had found his present from Anne under the tree.  He tore off the blue wrapping and stared in wonder at the crystal globe in front of him.  It was gently tainted with a watery blue colour and in the centre if the globe was an intricately carved black dragon. </p><p>Hagrid sighed with wonder as he stared deeply into the orb; he walked over and gave Anne a huge hug, "Oh thank yeh Anne- I coulda never thought yeh would b'able t'find summat like that!" </p><p>Anne smiled, "I heard about your dragon friend back when Harry was a first year and I thought that this would be perfect for you." </p><p>Smiles spread as Minerva opened a little box and pulled out a delicately crafted Celtic knotwork broach, "Anne, where did you ever find this?" </p><p>Anne smiled broadly, "I have had that for years, since I was a child- I have never worn it, and since you wear broaches and such, and I thought it would look lovely with the dark colours you wear, I decided that this was the perfect gift for you."  Minerva's smile spread across her face as she fashioned it on her dress and removed her old broach. </p><p>Albus found his scroll as Angel cried out triumphantly, "Ha!  Mum, I have found it!" </p><p>Albus sat back in his chair, "Anne, I will read this later on my own time.  Angel- show us what you found."  Angel gazed entranced by the silver box.  In an instant her eyes changed and she tore the ribbon off, hung it around her neck, and lifted the lid off the box.  She gasped as she drew out a simple set of black robes.  She set them aside as her mother's eyes teared up for joy and Angel drew out the other set of robes in the box.  They were a deep emerald that floated as Angel drew them out of the box.  They were trimmed delicately with gold and the large butterfly sleeves drifted gently around the body of the robes.  The room fell silent as Angel starred in disbelief at the robes in front of her; shifting her gaze to her mother she gently pulled them over her pyjamas and pulled them closed.  She twirled around, then ran to her mother and gave her the biggest hug possible. </p><p>No words were spoken between the two for a short time, and then Anne spoke, "Now go put them away until Christmas Dinner- they are only for very special occasions and holidays."  Angel nodded and complied, then handed her mother a long, thin box from under the tree. </p><p>It was as tall as she was, and Hagrid had to help her to carry it to Anne, "Here, Mum.  This is one of the things- the other one isn't quite here yet." she turned to Hagrid, "Can you go check on it for me?"  Hagrid nodded as Anne knelt down to unwrap the box at her feet.</p><p>Gently Anne turned the box over to untie the delicate silver ribbon from the dark blue case.  She lifted a latch in the middle of the lid flap and carefully drew it open.  Under a couple of layers of tissue paper shone the deep mahogany handle of a Cleansweep Quiddich broom. </p><p>Anne pulled it out of its casing and ran her fingers over the slightly used wood, "My Lord, Angel, where did you ever find this?  It is just like my old one I left back.....  This is wonderful!" </p><p>Angel jumped onto her mother's lap, "Wait 'till you see what the other thing is that I got you!  Hagrid- we're ready!" </p><p>Hagrid came through the doors to the Great Hall with a barn owl on his arm, "'Ere she is, Angel, 'ere she is." </p><p>The owl took flight and landed on the broom handle Anne was still holding, "For you, Mum."  Anne sat in an overjoyed shock for a moment before she gave Angel the biggest one-arm hug that was humanly possible.</p><p>That day flew by in a flurry of motion as Anne and Angel prepared themselves for Christmas Dinner.  Angel wore her lovely emerald robes while Anne wore the dress she had stitched just for the occasion.  It was red taffeta with cap sleeved to hide her Dark Mark and a little diamond of embroidery on the chest where a necklace would fall.  The dinner was wonderful, smooth and calming without incident.  Anne tucked her daughter into bed late that night with a sigh, folding their dress clothing and placing them into her cedar chest.  Anne herself crawled under her covers and sighed deeply, another Christmas come and gone, this one the first in many years she had celebrated without being alone.</p><p>The 26th came and went in a blur, ending with the 27th coming before it was expected.  Anne decided that she needed to test out her owl before the new semester started, so she pulled out a piece of parchment and thought of who she knew outside those still at Hogwarts.  There were only the other teachers and the dark wizards who came to her mind, neither of who she felt she could talk to.  The other teachers did not really know her, and the dark wizards were currently trying to kill her (contacting them was not a wise choice).  She searched the room with her eyes hoping that something in the room would give her a mental clue as to whom she should contact.  Her eyes fell on the bottle corked beneath her cot.  Severus:  she would send him an owl.  Anne laughed as she thought of what his reaction would entail, and then pondered if he would bother to respond.  She scrawled the letter quickly,</p><p>
  <em>"Dear Professor Snape..." </em>
</p><p>she paused- no need for formality if she was writing a friendly letter, so she cut the top off of the parchment and began again,</p><p>
  <em>"Dear Severus," </em>
</p><p>much better,</p><p>
  <em>"I hope you have been having a wonderful break and are looking forward to the second semester.  It is so odd here without hearing your Potions lectures from next door!  I am excited to continue teaching this next semester!  Really the whole reason that I am sending this to you is to let you know that Angel gave me an owl for Christmas and to test her wings.  Let me know if she does alright!  Also, what did you get for Christmas?  See you soon!  Love always: ~Anne."  </em>
</p><p>She rolled up the letter and tied it with a green silk ribbon and gave it to her owl, "I need to name you before you fly off- do you like the name Deirdre?"  The owl hooted softly and nodded, "Then that is your name- be swift dear, and come back with a response if he is in the mood to give one!"</p><p>The rest of the day was a blur, and all that Anne could remember was that Angel and the house-elves were quite enthusiastic about planning for a New Years party and preparing all the food for it.</p><p>On the 28th of December in the dim early evening light, Anne patiently awaited by the front door of the castle watching the snowfall for the return of Deirdre.  She hoped that Severus would respond quickly, she was anxious to here from him.  Over the Holidays her thoughts had for some reason often turned to him.  She was curious to why he was so bitter and cold to everyone in the school, but for some reason he had been able to sit and tutor Angel and she had thought he had been rather pleasant toward her.  Anne knew he had a past in the Dark Arts, and she hoped that he was safe from the Dark Lord.  She knew that she herself was being hunted, and for some strange reason she felt that if he were to be in danger, she would feel affronted herself.  It was odd that she should feel such a connection to someone who was virtually a stranger to her.  She shook her head free of the thoughts as Deirdre flew into her sight.  The owl dropped a thin scroll into Anne's outstretched hands and flew off the owlry to catch a well-earned rest.  Anne was too impatient to wait until she went inside so she tugged at the end of the ribbon and it slid off of the letter.  She noticed that it was green silk.  Carefully she unrolled the message and smiled.  As she had suspected, it was quite short and to the point.</p><p>She pulled her eyes from the graceful script as Holli called her name from the Entry Hall, "Anne, Angel wants to know if she and Harry, Hermione, Ron, and I can all stay the night on New Years Eve.  Is that alright?" </p><p>Anne smiled and turned her attention to Holli, "Oh- of course.  I don't think any of us will be sleeping that night anyway- but beware that I was planning on opening the room up to the entire group to use for a dance hall after I pull the table into the hallway." </p><p>Holli's smile grew to a full out grin, "That is wonderful!  This will be so much fun....  Thanks Anne!" </p><p>Anne turned her attention back to the falling snow and then to the letter. </p><p>
  <em>"Miss Schetzek, the owl performed her duty as expected.  I did not get anything for Christmas.  I will see you on January 3rd.  ~Prof. Severus Snape."  </em>
</p><p>So much for a lack of formality.  Anne rolled up the scroll, tied it off, and walked back into the school.  She opened the door to her chamber and lit the torches with her hand-magic.  She walked over to her sea chest and cautiously opened it and slipped the letter inside.</p><p>Sunday, December 29th- Angel and Anne sat once again in their cold quarters in the late morning reading the parables of the book of John with a light heart and a love for song.  Angel pulled her tattered songbook out of Anne's sea chest and flipped through it.  Anne sighed.  Why she had ever let Angel ever see the contents of her sea chest was still a mystery to her, but the child had understood the purpose of everything in it.  Anne shuddered at the thought of what was below the false bottom of the chest that she had not let Angel's curiosity discover.  Hopefully she could be rid of it all before the end of the year.  Angel began singing and brought Anne's thoughts back to the present. </p><p>

went on with their relaxation for that Sunday.  Angel disappeared with her friends while Anne hunted all over Hogwarts until she found a piano.  She finally found one tucked in an obscure classroom on the fourth floor.  She sat down and began to play anything that came to her head.  For hours on end she played, her tired fingers pushed forward by the sheer force of her will and her need to express herself through music.  Classical pieces flew off her fingers alongside pop music from her childhood and dark themes that she had written while in the service of Voldemort. </p><p>Hagrid knocked on the door, "Anne?  It's suppertime if yeh were plannin' on joinin' us." </p><p>Anne smiled, "Yeah, I'm coming, wait for me?"  He nodded.  They walked to the Great Hall and Anne took her seat with Angel and the other students.  After dinner, Anne decided, she would have to ask Albus if she could use that room as her escape room when she needed to disappear; days when she had been especially reflective and had been thinking to much on the past.</p><p>In the blink of an eye it was 7:00 pm on December 31st and piles of food were arranged on the long table in Anne's room that had been shoved against the wall.  The rest of the room was filled with the students, teachers, and house-elves dancing to rock music and somehow Anne had gotten an old television set to work powered off of magic and it was showing the New York celebration.  The volume of the television set was muted so that only the rock music could be heard.  The small room was overflowing and the party extended into the hallway beyond.  As Angel turned up the volume on "I Love Rock 'n' Roll" on the radio Anne had rigged to also run off magic, Holli and Anne began to dance a little more spiritedly and the party really had begun.  Hours later and the food was diminishing, and the ball was just beginning it's descent to the rooftop.  The entire group of friends huddled together into the chambers and shouted out the countdown together.  Even Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, and the few other Slytherins joined in the joyful yell to the beginning of the New Year.  Anne smiled- this was the family she felt included in, the family of the staff and students of Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry- and this was where she wanted Angel to grow up.</p><p>6:00 a.m. January 1st- Wednesday- The group of partiers stumbled up to their respective Houses and fell into bed. </p><p>Angel and Anne collapsed into their beds as soon as all their guests had left.  "Angel?"  "Yeah, Mum?"</p><p>"Weren't we having guests stay the night here tonight?" </p><p>"We were Mum, but they decided to go to bed in their own beds so they could sleep all day tomorrow."</p><p>"Angel, I think that is a good idea." </p><p>"What?" </p><p>"Sleeping all day today- the staff returns on the third and I want to be well rested for that."  Anne sighed and felt her bones settle as she lay on her hammock.  She turned out the torches and heard Angel turn over before she slipped off into a deep and restful sleep that lasted until noon.  She let Angel sleep and began to plan for her next sewing project.  After she decided that she was making a slightly formal black dress out of velvet, she gathered her materials and began to work.  At 6:00 pm her eyes began to droop and she climbed back into bed.  Angel had slept all day.</p><p>Anne woke at 5:00 am on the third and noticed that Angel was already awake and studying for her classes, "Just brushing up, Mum, before I have to jump back into the whole schoolwork thing." </p><p>Anne smiled, "Are you excited that all the teachers are coming back today?" </p><p>Angel gave her mother an impish grin, "Yup, and I know you are too- at least about seeing Professor Snape." </p><p>"Angelique Marie LeFay!  I hardly know the man!" </p><p>"I know Mum, but do you honestly think that you two will stay strangers?  I know something big will happen here, and it might just be..." </p><p>"Angel, don't even say that- you know how I feel about anything more than friendship and I know that is what you are hinting at." </p><p>"Sorry Mum." </p><p>"It's alright- just don't pull that stunt again."  Anne went over to the big table and pulled it with her levitation to the centre of the room where it had stood before the party on New Years Eve.  She threw on her bathrobe over her nightdress and put her daily clothes into a basket to take up to the showers.  She returned to her room 45 minutes later in her traveller’s dress and threw her traveller’s cloak on over it to shield her from the chill of the winter air.  Angel dressed herself in a pair of jeans, a purple t-shirt and a white cardigan sweater that she had bought in Ireland along with a thick pair of wool socks and pink bunny slippers.  </p><p>Anne laughed, "Angel, those slippers never cease to amuse me."</p><p>At 9:00 am the first wave of teachers began to filter into Hogwarts.  Anne heard the door slam shut next door and smiled to herself:  Severus was back.  She went to her hammock and picked up the bottle she had mixed for him and gently shook it.  She waited for the door to open and close again and then she slipped out of her door and set it in the centre of his desk.  Quietly she escaped back to her own chambers and sat down at the table to work on her dress. </p><p>Angel walked into the room, "Mum- it's nearly lunch and when I ran into Mr. Snape he asked where you were.  I told him you were lurking in the dungeons.  I think he may have actually been amused." </p><p>Anne laughed, "How could anyone not be when you are wearing those adorable slippers?"</p><p>Anne and Angel went upstairs for lunch and mingled with the returned staff.  Anne noticed that as usual Severus had distanced himself from the group and was standing on the outside of the group.  Before she could approach him, she felt a slight tug on her skirt. </p><p>It was Winky, "Anne?  Winky has a wondering- will the rest of Anne's friends like Anne's soups?" </p><p>Anne's eyes shone kindly at the little house-elf, "Of course I think they will, Winky.  You and your friends are such wonderful cooks that I think you could satisfy even the pickiest of eaters." </p><p>Winky grinned, "Thank you Anne!  Winky is eternally grateful for your compliment!"</p><p>Lunch went smoothly, and afterward Albus called a staff meeting.  Anne entered the room a little late; she had been delivering Angel to Holli and all her friends.  The staff was chatting pleasantly when she opened the side door at the back of the room and stepped into the chamber. </p><p>Once again she noticed Severus distancing himself from the group and once again her opportunity to talk to him was interrupted, this time by Albus Dumbledore, "Ladies and Gentlemen- your attention please?"  Silence fell over the room, "Thank you, I have a rather disturbing piece of news to give you, our Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Miss Terlynise Adrians, was unfortunate enough to break her ankle and a few ribs in a rather serious skiing accident in the Alps.  Now while we are glad that the extent of her injury was not too great, we are left with a problem- no Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor, and it is a class that we cannot go without.  I was wondering if there was anyone here who would volunteer to teach the class."  Anne's eyes met Snape's.  She read in his face that he wanted that job, but knew that because of his position as Potions Master that it would be impossible.  As the silence hung like a wet blanket over the room, the double doors at the front of the chamber flew open with a resounding crash as they slammed into the wall.  A man stood in the doorway, his face weathered and his black hair strikingly similar to that of Professor Snape, only shorter- just brushing his chin.  He walked regally into the company with a slight limp, favoring his right leg, barely detectable to someone who was not trained to identify people in a large crowd, as Anne was. </p><p>He stood facing the staff, panning his vision from left to right, his eyes first locking on Severus' face, and then on Anne's.  Then his gaze fell on the Headmaster, "Hello, I am looking for a position where I may aid in the guiding of young wizards for the cause of defeating He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.  Can you help me?" </p><p>Albus smiled, "We are in need of a Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor if you feel you are qualified." </p><p>"I feel that I am quite qualified for just that type of work." </p><p>Albus nodded, "Then come with me for an interview- Minerva, I would like you to also come and talk to this gentleman.  What is your name sir?"</p><p>"You may call me Eddwords- my first name is of no concern to anyone."</p><p>After they had left and the other staff members milled about, speculating on the newcomer, Anne finally made her way to Professor Snape, "Hello Severus- it's good to see you're back here safely.  How was your break?"  He muttered something unintelligible.  Anne spoke again, "Severus- that man, he seemed to zone in on us there when he first walked in.  Do you have any ideas why?  It was a bit creepy.  This is all too convenient." </p><p>Severus turned his gaze to her, "Miss Schetzek- think about it for a moment- what do we share?" </p><p>Anne shook her head, "I don't understand...." </p><p>His voice grew slightly more impatient than usual as he leaned close to her ear and whispered intensely, "I know you know that I have a past, one that I am not proud of, and one that you have a parallel to.  The only two wizards in the room with connections to the dark arts are the two he focuses on- I know you aren't so daft that you could not see it as well as I could."  He let the conversation fall as Anne's fears of her former life came flooding back to her in fresh torrents.  She excused herself from the room and nearly ran back to her chambers to think things over.  One thing that she concluded before she opened her door: she would be avoiding this Mr. Eddwords as often as possible.</p><p>Severus Snape left the crowded meeting and escaped into the dungeons and back to his classroom.  He noticed that the door was opened a few centimetres.  Bloody thing- always drifted open if it wasn't latched perfectly.  He pulled the door open and entered the room.  He sighed, only half the year left.  He walked over to his desk and noticed a wine bottle sitting on the desk.  That had not been there before he left.  He dragged it over to in front of him and untied the violet ribbon.  He carefully unfolded the little note and read it aloud to himself,</p><p>
  <em>"Merry Christmas Severus- may the years ahead be blessed with love and understanding.  Your 'neighbour' in Hogwarts, Anne."  </em>
</p><p>Severus sighed as he uncorked the bottle, not quite knowing what to expect from his gentle neighbour.  Out of the bottle drifted pale violet smoke that formed into the shape of a butterfly and then fluttered off into the air, dissipating as it went.  Severus shook the bottle and found that all its contents had evaporated into the butterfly.  He set the bottle under his desk and tucked the note into the top drawer.  This little gesture of kindness was something Severus Snape was not used to.</p><p>At dinner that night the teachers resumed eating at the Head Table and the students all sat at one of the tables.  To Anne, the room seemed uncannily quiet.  She waved to Angel slurping her chicken noodle soup.  Angel waved back with a noodle hanging from her lips as she sucked it inward and it flipped up and smacked her on the nose.  Anne laughed and Snape turned to her with a slight amusement.  From the end of the table, Eddwords intently watched Anne and Severus.</p><p>On Saturday, January 4th, the students all arrived back from their break on the Hogwarts Express.  Anne stood at the doorway and greeted each student with a smile as they walked into the Entry Hall.  Angel went visiting after the train had unloaded and helped her schoolmates to unpack their things.  Anne spent the time sewing and by the end of the day she had made quite a lot of progress on her project.</p><p>The next day Anne spent planning for the next unit she was going to teach.  She decided it would be on music.  It promised to be and interesting lesson.</p>
