    <p>This is a Ginny Weasley-centric fic that will focus largely on her development as a character in the Harry Potter universe. So we're clear the ultimate and main pairing in this fic will be Ginny Weasley and Tom Riddle. It will definitely be slow burn, simply because I want this pairing to develop from dark and twisty into a healthy and mutually beneficial relationship, additionally I just really love angst. If you ever have a problem with how slow the progression of their relationship is, I would like you to keep in mind that Diary Tom (the template from which my Tom Riddle will spring) essentially mind-rapes an 11 year old girl. He gaslights her and pretends to be her friend; he takes away her freedom, something which is terribly important for Ginny. I am never going to write or endorse toxic relationships but I am intrigued by what their relationship could have been/became so I will explore that in this fic. The original idea for this fic was inspired by "A Game of Risk" by AlwaysPadfoot which I read on Fanfiction.net, this is a story where Tom stays with Ginny even after the events of the chamber and is disgusted by Voldemort and decides to fight alongside Ginny against the monster a version of himself has become. This is the general idea of ONE of the things I am exploring in this fic. As I said before this story largely focus on Ginny and her journey as a person and in the fight against Voldemort. I don't have everything plotted out, so we will see where this goes.</p>
<p>I do my best to be as inclusive as possible, so if you are at all racist or sexist or homophobic I can most definitely assure you that you will not like this fic as there will be elements of all three.</p>
<p>It is important that everyone keep in mind this is an Alternate Universe of the Hogwarts and Harry Potter that you know. If you notice something is off, for example, I have decided to change the date of Ginny's birthday to April 17th because I feel the personality of an Ares fits better with the Ginny I have crafted than the imitation-Lily that JKR created, then it is a choice I made in order for my story to progress the way I want it to and is not a mistake I made.</p>
<p>I have also adjusted the time line for fifth year and will list important events that happen prior to the start of my fic below:</p>
<p>Friday, September 1st: Umbridge arrives at Hogwarts/start of term</p>
<p>Monday, September 18th: Umbridge becomes High Inquisitor and begins class monitoring</p>

<p>Friday, September 22nd: Dumbledore blocks the ban and approves all teams for play</p>
<p>Saturday, November 4th: Slytherin v. Gryffindor match (this day is covered in Chapter 2)</p>
<p>As of the start of the fic, Dumbledore's Army has yet to be formed. To avoid confusion and make it easer to follow along, below I have listed Ginny's class schedule:</p>
<p>Monday: Care for Magical Creatures, Herbology with Hufflepuff (Lunch) Double Divination</p>
<p>Tuesday: Double History of Magic with Ravenclaw (Lunch) Defense Against the Dark Arts with Slytherin, Ancient Runes</p>
<p>Wednesday: Transfiguration with Hufflepuff, Charms with Ravenclaw (Lunch) Ancient Runes, Astronomy</p>
<p>Thursday: Herbology with Hufflepuff, Care for Magical Creatures (Lunch) Charms with Ravenclaw, Transfiguration with Hufflepuff</p>
<p>Friday: Double Potions with Slytherin (Lunch) Double Defense Against the Dark Arts with Slytherin</p>
<p>Since we know literally no one is Ginny's year I will be making up a lot of OC's as I go, one of which will become a main character. Miri Lestrange is the daughter of Bellatrix and Rodolphus, her parents were sent to Azkaban pretty much right after she was born. She was raised by her Aunt Narcissa and Uncle Lucius. Additionally, because I want a good education for the students Binns' will soon be binned and replaced by an OC of mine, Deirdra Vastry and Trelawney by Marren Kessler who studied Divination and the like under the tutelage of centaurs because I find it the height of ridiculousness that Dumbledore would ask something of someone that would get said someone banished from their own species. I have no time for the sheer ridiculousness of Albus Dumbledore, most especially since it is often to the detriment of his students and everyone around him.</p>
<p>While I have a certain vision for some of the actors that play the characters I am creating and those that already exist that I am refining, I would never demand that anyone else share my vision but I have listed said actors and characters below should you like to:</p>
<p>Ginny Weasley as played by Elle Fanning</p>
<p>Tom Riddle Jr. as played by Richard Madden</p>
<p>Luna Lovegood as played by Emily Kinney</p>
<p>Hermione Granger as played by Antonia Thomas</p>
<p>Miri Lestrange as played by Alia Bhatt</p>
<p>Professor Deirdra Vastry as played by Ruth Negga</p>
<p>Professor Marren Kessler as played by Noel Fielding</p>
