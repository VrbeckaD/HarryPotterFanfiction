    <p>Newt flew around the corner and down the cement steps into his menagerie, eager to put the day he had spent at the Ministry behind him. He entered his shed, finally surrounded by the earthy smells of herbs and dirt that he associated with home. He took a deep breath and felt his muscles relaxing as the tension began to seep from his body. He was finally in his element and blissfully alone after being surrounded by Aurors and officials for the past nine hours.<br/>
<br/>
After removing his suit jacket and tossing it across his cluttered desk, Newt rolled up his sleeves and began to gather the items he would need for his nightly rounds. Packets of seeds, worms, bundles of meat wrapped in butcher paper, and a bag of dried woodlice all were collected and placed haphazardly on his work surface. He turned around in the small space to begin collecting his tools, tossing them one by one onto the workbench that ran along one side of the cluttered room.<br/>
<br/>
He stepped out of the back door and around the corner to collect the dented, silver buckets from the step. A flash of white seen out of the corner of his eye caused him to look up toward the habitats that stretched out to the back of the basement menagerie. Tina sat with her back against a rock below Dougal’s swing, her knees pulled up to her chin, and the Demiguise hanging from her shoulder. Her head was leaned into his fur, turned away from where Newt was standing.<br/>
<br/>
She had to be down here for a reason, Newt knew that she didn’t normally come down to the basement alone. He felt torn between giving her the space she obviously wanted and going to see if he could help. His stomach clenched as a wave of nervous energy flowed through his body. Newt wanted to go to her, but he knew he never had the right words. He never knew what to say to make people feel better. He wished for his brother’s skill with speech or Jacob’s charisma, especially in rare moments like this one.<br/>
<br/>
He desperately wanted Tina to be happy, to see her smile, especially after everything that had happened to her in the past few weeks. He <em>needed</em> to know if she was okay. He hesitated in the doorway, taking a step toward Tina and then doubling back into the shed. He stopped and grabbed a clean towel, wiping his hands on the rough fabric. Newt paused briefly before he tossed the towel onto his desk with a flourish and strode out of the shed before he could lose his nerve.<br/>
<br/>
Newt slowed his pace as he neared Tina’s hunched form. He put his hands in his trouser pockets, rubbing the edge of the fabric with his thumb in a soothing motion, as he took quiet steps down the stone pathway. As he came closer, he noticed that her shoulders were occasionally shaking as she clung to Dougal. Was she crying?<br/>
<br/>
“Tina?”<br/>
<br/>
Tina’s head jerked up in surprise and swung around to look at Newt. Tears flowed freely from her eyes and, when she saw him, a fresh wave of sobs overcame her as she buried her face in her hands in a failed attempt to hide her sadness.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p><em>I could find the whole meaning of life in those sad eyes. They've seen things that you never quite say, but I hear.</em><br/>
<em>Come out of hiding, I'm right here beside you, and I'll stay there as long as you let me because you matter to me. Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody.</em><br/>
<em>You matter to me, I promise you do, you, you matter too. I promise you do, you see?</em><br/>
<em>You matter to me.</em></p>
</center><p>She swiped at her eyes, desperately trying to hide the evidence of her tears to no avail. She shook her head back and forth, never lifting her face from the protection of her arms. Newt approached her as if she were a wounded animal, his light steps and slow, fluid movements coming easily after years of experience. He sat down on the ground next to her, making sure to leave plenty of space between them in case she didn’t welcome his presence.</p><p>“You can talk to me. If you want. I mean-- you don’t have to, obviously, but…” Newt shook his head at the words coming out of his mouth. Why was he so terrible at this? He sighed audibly, his eyes directed at his brown, leather boots while watching her out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>Tina lifted her head just far enough to address him, her eyes downcast and continuing to issue tears. “I don’t know why you’d want to talk to me, honestly,” she said to him, her voice cracking and low, “after all I’ve done to you. To everyone. I can’t believe you haven’t tossed me out at this point.”</p><p>Newt’s head shot up as he looked at her, his eyes wide and his mouth gaping open in shock. “Tina...what on Earth--?”</p><p>“I am good at nothing but hurting the people in my life.” She interrupted, “The <em>only</em> thing I was ever good at was my job, and now I-- I don’t even have that.”</p><p>“Huh?” Newt was finding it hard to say what needed to be said. Thoughts flashed across his mind in a whirlwind, his emotions shifting from confused to angry to sad and back faster than he could process. He wished for the briefest of moments that she shared her sister’s legilimency talents so she could pluck the thoughts from his mind. While he knew what he was feeling at her words, speaking those thoughts into something audible was not coming easily to him. It never had.</p><p>“Here.” She interrupted his string of confusing thoughts by tossing a crumpled piece of parchment at him and putting her head back into her arms, renewed sobs shaking her shoulders as she clung to Dougal with one shaking hand.</p><p>Newt lowered his hand to pick up the paper, wondering if he should read it. The wax MACUSA seal stared up at him from the ball of yellow parchment, its cracked, green presence seeming ominous. He straightened the paper, smoothing it carefully with his hand and began to read. His brow furrowed as he came across the lines halfway down the page that he knew had set Tina’s emotions off.</p><p>
  <em>...As a result of your personal actions, from this moment forward, you are no longer employed as an Auror for the Magical Congress of the United States of America. You are not to return to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement without express written permission from the Director of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Any return to the premises will require an official escort. Your personal belongings will be sent to the address on file…</em>
</p><p>“Tina? What happened?” Newt was nearly speechless, but he managed to choke one coherent question out, his eyes raising from the letter to look at her hunched form.</p><p>“I went rogue. I was ordered to go to Paris and kill Credence on sight...and I refused.” She raised her head slightly higher, her eyes not meeting his own. “They took me off the case and put me on desk duty. So I...left.” She leaned back against the rock and stared at the enchanted ceiling. “I hopped on the next ship out of New York, taking all of the information I could find with me, and I-- I went searching for him.” She paused, her eyes finally seeking Newts. “I wasn’t going to let them kill him. I <em>couldn’t</em>.”</p><p>“I know.” Newt said quietly. “They asked me to go too. I refused. I couldn’t hurt him, Tina. I never could have done anything to-- to hurt him or take away his freedom. I--” His eyes narrowed as he made the connection. “They asked us to do the same job.”</p><p>“Yes,” Tina looked down once more, tangling a hand into her messy curls, “and if I hadn’t been such an <em>idiot</em> and cut ties with you, we would have known that.”</p><p>“Tina…it’s okay.” Newt shifted his body to face her, shrinking the gap between them.</p><p>“No, Newt,” Tina interrupted, “it’s not. I was <em>horrible</em> to you. I treated you terribly in Paris. I was unfair to you and you-- you did nothing wrong.” She wrung her hands in front of her, her arms hugging her knees tightly. “I ruined <em>everything</em>. I ruined my relationship with Queenie and drove her right into Grindelwald’s hands. I ruined Queenie’s and Jacob’s relationship. I couldn’t even save Credence in Paris! I-- I have no job, I can’t go home, but I shouldn’t stay here either...” Tina was on the edge of hysterics as tears continued to fall down her face.</p><p>“Tina.” Newt found a surge of confidence and needed her to know the truth in the situation. He addressed her with surety, needing her to understand. “Tina, look at me.” She raised her eyes to his, her posture remaining shrunken and unsure. “Paris was a month ago, and I hold no ill feelings toward you for what happened between us. I-- I understand why you didn’t trust me.” Newt’s voice shrank as his stomach knotted with nerves, “I am truly sorry for what I wrote in my last letter. I never intended-- I mean, it was never about you. It wasn’t.” Newt took a deep breath and surged forward with his thought. He needed her to know. “I wish I had been able to give you confidence in me. In my intentions. If I had, you-- you <em>never</em> would have believed what you read in that magazine. I take full responsibility for that.”</p><p>“Newt…”</p><p>“And you are welcome here as long as you want to stay.” Newt surged forward, nearly oblivious to the fresh sheen of tears that welled up in Tina’s eyes at his admissions, “Here in my flat, in London, whichever. I have contacts at the Ministry, my brother is Head Auror...I’m sure we can work something out here... or-- or back at MACUSA if you still want to leave.”</p>
<p></p><center>
  <p><em>It's addictive the minute you let yourself think the things that I say just might matter to someone.</em><br/>
<em>All of this time I've been keeping my mind on the running away, and for the first time I think I'd consider the stay because you matter to me. Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody.</em><br/>
<em>You matter to me, I promise you do, you, you matter too. I promise you do, you see?</em><br/>
<em>You matter to me.</em></p>
</center><p>It was then that Newt nervously raised his eyes and allowed himself to study Tina’s face. She gave him a small smile and her eyes expressed an emotion other than the sadness she had been carrying for weeks.</p><p>“I wish I could be as forgiving as you,” Tina said, her voice scratchy and admiring, “you’re wonderful, do you know that?”</p><p>Newt’s cheeks flooded with color and he hung his head in embarrassment. A toothy grin spread over his face at her words. “I just want you to be happy, Tina. You matter to me, and I will do whatever I can to show that to you.”</p><p>Another wave of tears rolled over Tina’s cheeks, though this time they were accompanied by a beaming smile and the first wave of true happiness she had felt in weeks. She tentatively reached out her hand, seeking his. Upon contact, he raised his head to meet her gaze, a look of surprise flooding his features. He glanced down at her slight hand covering his own, then turned his hand over to grasp hers tenderly.</p><p>“Will you stay?”</p><p>His words were no more than a whisper. Tina squeezed his hand affectionately before uncurling her body and scooting slightly closer to Newt.</p><p>“Alright.”</p>

As long as you’ll have me.</em>
