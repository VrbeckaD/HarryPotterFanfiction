    <p>The bell tinkled, signalling a customer entering the shop.</p><p>“Hello! Welcome to the Empo- oh, it’s you.” Jung Hoseok’s face fell when he saw the figure who was shaking the cold out of her clothes.</p><p>Song Sera laughed. “Well, hello to you, too, Hoseokie! Why don’t I get a warm ‘Emporium’ welcome? Why are you discriminating among your customers?”</p><p>“Well, if said customer comes in every week asking ME for nasty icky stuff, said customer doesn’t deserve my warm welcome.” Hoseok turned his dainty nose up at Sera. Sera hid a smile behind her hand. She harboured an insane urge to pinch the bridge of Hoseok’s too perfect nose. “How can I help you this week, noona?”</p><p>“I’d like some snake venom, century rose oil and pressed tuberose please.”</p><p>Hoseok scrunched his nose. “Snake venom, ugh. Noona, you know I really can’t stand icky stuff. And tuberose? That flower is spooky.”</p><p>“Then get the rose oil, then. Am pretty sure that at least isn’t creepy enough for you. Just point me in the right direction. I can get the snake venom and tuberose myself.”</p><p>“You’ll do no such thing. We at the Emporium pride ourselves in serving our customers to the best of our ability.” Hoseok replied primly, as he led Sera deeper into the store. “Besides, the hyungs are around. They can get all the nasty stuff for you.”</p><p>Figures.</p><p>They entered through a small side door, leading into a room that logically shouldn’t exist in a store as small as the Emporium. It reminded Sera of the Beast’s library in Beauty and the Beast, except instead of books, there were rows and rows of glass jars filled with the weirdest things. A broad-shouldered young man was standing close to a ladder near one of the shelves, hands on his hips as he watched another young man with silvery-blue hair reach for a glass jar on one of the upper shelves.</p><p>“No, no, no, Yoongi hyung, it’s the third jar on your right. That’s the SECOND jar on your right.” A deep voice called out from the middle of the room. Sera peeked from behind Hoseok to spy a third young man, with ash-brown hair, wearing glasses, watching Min Yoongi reach for the jar from behind an ancient looking computer. “That’s the cured frog skin. We want the cured TOAD skin.”</p><p>“Toad skin, frog skin, it’s all amphibians.” Yoongi grumbled, his gravelly voice wafting down to his audience below. He stretched his hand. “I can’t reach the damn jar. Just substitute it with frog skin in the spell, Namjoon-ah.”</p><p>Kim Namjoon’s scandalized expression was too comical, Sera had to giggle. That attracted the attention of all 3 men.</p><p>Hoseok cleared his throat. “Our customer here needs some icky stuff, too.”</p><p>“Sera! Hello!” Kim Seokjin beamed at her, taking his eyes off of Yoongi. “Hold on a sec, let us get this stuff for Namjoon’s spell and we’ll attend to you. Hobi-ya, that’s not very nice.”</p><p>Yoongi had apparently given up on reaching for the jar and was summoning it instead. Sera watched as the jar floated into the man’s outstretched hands. “Yeah, Hobi. That’s not very nice. Sera’s here so often she practically pays your salary.”</p><p>“Hyung.” Namjoon groaned. “You know you’re not supposed to be using magic. You’re still in recovery!”</p><p>Yoongi shrugged, apparently giving up on climbing down the ladder and floated down instead. “I’ve got you and Jin hyung around. You guys can always carry me if I collapse in exhaustion.”  </p><p>“That’s not the point!”</p><p>Sera cleared her throat. “Yeah, um, I just need like 3 things and I’ll be out of here double-quick.” she raised an eyebrow at Yoongi. "It's good to see you making a speedy recovery, Yoongi."</p><p>He arched an eyebrow right back at her. "It's easy to make a speedy recovery when your refrigerator has more than just ramyun in it." </p><p>Sera wondered if she should seal a certain window when she gets home today.</p><p>Namjoon tilted his head in confusion. "People don't keep ramyun in fridges, hyung." </p><p>"That's not the point, Joon-ah." </p><p>"But you just said-" </p><p>“Stop it you two, you’re making Sera uncomfortable.” Seokjin admonished Yoongi and Namjoon. Sera could’ve sworn Hoseok was mumbling something that sounded very much like ‘not bloody likely’ under his breath while maintaining that sunshiny smile.</p><p>“What do you need, Sera?”</p><p>“Some snake venom, century rose oil and pressed tuberose please.”</p><p>Namjoon looked up the location of the items on the computer, and programmed the ladder to the correct position. Hoseok stood guard as Seokjin climbed up, based on Namjoon’s instructions. He’d got up from his terminal and stood beside her, watching as his cousin effortlessly plucked the correct jars.</p><p>Yoongi mumbled indistinctly under his breath. Something about not trusting men with long arms.</p><p>“Defensive spells? Are you planning on a duel soon, noona?”</p><p>Sera sighed internally. Trust Namjoon – one of the most brilliant minds in the magical community – to catch on to the spell Sera was about to attempt.</p><p>“No, but… it’s almost October. You know what that means.” Sera shifted her weight on her foot uncomfortably under Namjoon’s intense gaze.</p><p>“Yeah, I just… wow, noona. I wish I could help, somehow. I mean… if I’m reading it right. The spell that I think you wanna try out.” he rubbed the back of his neck nervously. "That's some pretty advanced spell work involved, but I'm sure you've discussed this with your mentor." </p><p>Sera shrugged. Oh, yeah, that... she knew she'd forgotten something...</p><p>Even though the magical community in Seoul was pretty large, people still gravitate towards the Emporium for every little thing that they needed. The Kim family have been running the store for as long as anyone could remember and their extensive network ensured that they could get their hands on whatever little thing their customer needed.</p><p>Except for unicorn hair. No one’s seen a unicorn in ages.</p><p>And, oh, phoenix feathers. They’re endangered, you know.</p><p>As part of the River Song family, Sera’s parents made sure their kids knew their way in and out of the various magical establishments around Seoul. Everyone knew that the River Songs had a heavy burden to bear. A centuries old curse that saved a kingdom, wiped out a generation and doomed a family.</p><p>Doomed to fight a battle against the Enemy every decade. Doomed to watch as the Enemy goes after the Guardians and Guardian Candidates, ensuring that the River Songs will never have enough Guardians to be considered a serious threat to the Enemy. Doomed to watch as members of their clan be respected, yet somewhat ostracized.</p><p>Doom and gloom. Yeap, they're just full of good cheer, the River Songs.</p><p>Yes, the River Songs carry a heavy burden as Guardians of Seoul. It was once a position that many coveted, a position that perhaps was too desirable, resulting in blood oaths and unspeakable curses.</p><p>It really didn’t help that people keep expecting her to get killed at any time by the Enemy ever since she turned 21. But Sera figured that the Enemy had bigger fish to fry. Some of her other cousins fit the Guardian image more. Were more powerful and adept at magic than bookish, shy Sera. And had multiple attempts on their lives, while Sera managed to live life quite uneventfully. Even if she was the only River Song to be born in October – the month of the curse’s anniversary - in recent memory.</p><p>It probably helped that Sera went to school far away from Seoul, and was a relative unknown, even among her clan members. Mahoutokoro in Japan for her early education, and then off to Hogwarts in the UK, where she found herself more often than not helping a reluctant Yoongi bail Seokjin, Namjoon and Hoseok out of their scrapes. The four Korean boys had always gently prodded Sera to socialize more, despite her shy ways. She had to admit that bailing them out of their scrapes were amongst her more memorable moments at school.</p><p>“Well, if you need help or a safe environment to work on your spells, our doors are always open. You just have to say the word.”</p><p>“Thanks, Nams, that means a lot to me.”</p><p>“Hey,” Namjoon flashed his dimples at her. “That’s what friends are for, right?”</p><p>“Are we friends with a River Song now?” Yoongi interjected. It was a long-standing joke of theirs, stemming from the fact that when they were in school, Yoongi was reluctant to call Seokjin, Namjoon, and Hoseok his friends, while Song Sera of the River Songs was famous for being a loner.</p><p>“If we’re not friends, then what would you call our relationship with Sera, hyung?”</p><p>“Unfortunate classmates? Merchant and customer? Business transaction?”</p><p>“How impersonal.” Seokjin piped in. “And inaccurate for you, Yoongi, since you don’t work here. But since you insist on spending time here, make yourself useful and pack a vial of this snake venom for Sera.” He shoved the glass jar of cloudy substance into Yoongi’s hands.</p><p>Yoongi’s face scrunched up in distaste. “Why meee? I’m supposed to be in recovery!”</p><p>“We just watched you float down from 10 feet high, I think you’re done recovering from your attack. Besides, poisons and the Dark Arts are your thing. Also, Hobi is getting sick just from being near the snake venom jar.”</p><p>There was a definite darkening of Yoongi’s aura as he walked away. Namjoon dragged a green-looking Hoseok to help him with his spell – Sera wasn’t sure that was going to help Hobi, if cured toad’s skin was one of the ingredients – while she followed Seokjin to get her flower-based items.</p><p>“How are you holding up, Sera? I heard you and Joonie talking.” Seokjin smiled over his shoulder as they moved to another part of the Emporium. Sera tried to act like she wasn’t staring at Seokjin’s broad shoulders. Kim Seokjin had the face of an angel and a body that was a work of art. Sera had never met anyone who didn’t see cherry blossoms fall the first time they laid eyes on the handsome magical merchant.</p><p>It really wasn’t rocket science to figure out why. Seokjin’s mother had Veela ancestry. And although Sera had never known Seokjin to wield Veela magic, his Veela genes probably had a hand in making him pretty darn irresistible.</p><p>No wonder The Emporium’s business was booming.</p><p>“Okay, I guess. I’m trying to prepare as much as I can, oppa, as best as I can. But it’s difficult work, and… well, I’m not as gifted as Namjoon or Yoongi…”</p><p>“Well,” Seokjin stopped at a wide table full of weird apparatus that reminded Sera of the Potions classroom back at Hogwarts. “If it’s potions you need, you know Yoongi and Namjoon can always help you out with that. I can get Hobi to pop in and test out your warding barriers. But spellcasting is kinda iffy since it’s so personalized, but honestly, the guys and I are always on-board if you need a hand with that, too. You just need to say the word.”</p><p>Seokjin smiled at Sera’s thoughtful expression as he started measuring liquids. “You know Yoongi and his tsundere ways. If he was in better condition, am sure he’d grump his way into somehow camping out in your living room.” he regarded her over a stoppered vial. "You do realize that the reason he's still living with us is because I feed him proper food, right?" </p><p>"Ramyun is proper food!"</p><p>Seokjin snorted. "Sure. If you're a struggling university student. Even then... no." Seokjin smiled affectionately. " Anyway... Yoongi. He does care, you know... in his own way. Don't be too hard on him, yeah? He's kicking himself for getting majorly hurt so close to October. You know he'd do anything for you." </p><p>Sera simply nodded. She knew Yoongi’s tsundere ways well, all right. She still harboured a teensy-weensy tiny crush on the Metamorphmagus who changes his hair colour at will. It didn’t help that as an Animagus, Yoongi would morph into a very cute cat. Sera still remembered the first time she discovered Yoongi was an Animagus. She had found the cat sleeping by the door to the Ravenclaw common room and was immediately charmed by it, so much so that she brought it in – against all school rules – and fell asleep stroking the cat. A few hours later there was a loud thud and a sheepish Yoongi lay on the floor, naked except for her blanket.</p><p>To this day both Yoongi and Sera couldn’t figure out why none of them was yelling or panicking, and were both acting like it was perfectly normal to find an uninvited, naked classmate on your dorm floor.</p><p>Sera had gotten used to having Yoongi pop up in cat form next to her door, no matter where in the world she was. The Songs were vacationing in Switzerland when there was a scratch and a meow at her door. Next thing she knew, cat Yoongi had sauntered in and made himself comfortable on her hotel bed.</p><p>It was like Yoongi had a homing beacon on her. Her family had stopped questioning it after Yoongi followed her down to breakfast one morning after her first year, still yawning and wearing her clothes. Apparently, centuries ago, the Min family did this quite often in the Royal Courts, and the Guardians of Seoul were most often than not their favourite humans.</p><p>Not that Yoongi the grumpy human would ever admit that Sera was his favourite whatever. He still threatens to turn Hoseok into an armchair for being too loud, when everyone knows that Min Yoongi would flip the world if anyone even as much made Jung Hoseok sad.</p><p>“Yeah. Yoongi’s a good friend. I know, oppa. I know.”</p><p>Seokjin’s responding smile was gentle, but his expression was worried.</p><p>Too many things happening all at once, so near to October.</p><p>*******</p><p>“Sure we can’t tempt you to stay for tea?” Seokjin smiled, as he handed Sera her parcel. “I made proper scones.”</p><p>Sera shook her head with a smile. “Thanks oppa, but I have a lot of research to do. Maybe next time.”</p><p>“If you need anything, noona, just text me, okay?” Namjoon smiled gently at her from behind the counter. “I’m serious. You can call us anytime.”</p><p>“I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks, Nams.” Sera smiled back, only to be engulfed in a thorough bear hug by Hoseok. The warmth from his body somehow seeped through her clothes, making Sera feel warm and toasty. Just like him. “I worry about you, noona.” Hoseok murmured as he fixed her scarf. “I know it’s useless to do so, and bar Yoongi hyung, you’re probably the most well-equipped of all of us to have to do this, but I worry about you.”</p><p>Sera smiled at the younger man. He was too loud, too lively, too bright for her, but Hoseok always reminded her of home. “It’s nice to know that people worry about me, Hobi. I appreciate that. It’s still September. You’re coming to test my wards, right?”</p><p>Hoseok nodded, blowing on Sera’s hands. Hoseok was an adept of Hearth Magic, and that little gesture meant that Sera would have warm hands until she reached home. Sera was glad. She wasn’t a fan of the cold.</p><p>“I’ll call you to set an appointment soon.”</p><p>“Ya Song Sera, let me walk you home.” Yoongi suddenly popped up beside her as she stepped unto the sidewalk. Sera squinted at the young man next to her.</p><p>“Uhh, you don’t have to do that, Yoongi, it’s still light out, I can get home just fine.”</p><p>“I insist.”</p><p>Sera shrugged. It really wasn’t that far - just a few stops away by train – but Sera learned long ago that Min Yoongi marched to his own tune.</p><p>Besides, seeing how October was coming up and she was getting the heebie-jeebies, it didn’t hurt to have an Auror walk you home. Even if he was still on sick leave and looked pale as a ghost. What she didn’t agree to was the literal walking instead of taking the subway.</p><p>“C’mon, the fresh air will do you good.”</p><p>“Uhh… I kinda like being unhealthy right about now.” Sera grumbled as Yoongi tugged at her sleeves.</p><p>“So how long is your leave for?”</p><p>“Until November 2<sup>nd</sup>.” He yawned. “Why? Need a roommate?”</p><p>Sera snorted. “No. Like that has ever stopped you before, though.”</p><p>“Your boyfriend’s not gonna like it when he finds me curled up on your couch.”</p><p>“You think you’re so sly. You know very well I don’t date.”</p><p>Yoongi grinned that gummy grin of his. “Oops.” He shrugged. “Who knows? A lot could’ve changed since I saw you last. What was it, 2 months ago? Heh. You know you’re ALLOWED to date, right? No one said Guardians – or Guardian Candidates – can’t date. Your cousin Joongki broke hearts left, right and center.”</p><p>“My cousin Joongki,” Sera sighed. “Was voted one of Korea’s 50 most handsome wizard and graduated with top marks from Mahoutokoro. I’d be surprised if he DIDN’T date.”</p><p>“My point being that you could stand to live a little, Sera. You’re still so shy. It seems to be getting worse, since school.”</p><p>“I know, I know. It’s just… I don’t like talking needlessly. Making small talk. I find it a chore. I have everyone that I need, though? Family, friends. I have you and Namjoon and Hobi and Jin oppa, too.”</p><p>“I don’t want you to be lonely Sera. You don’t have to be lonely. I don’t want you to think that you’re not gonna survive your Guardian candidacy, so you don’t want to start relationships.” Yoongi huffed.</p><p>“I don’t want you to live like you’re gonna die soon. That’s not living.”</p><p>There. There it was. Yoongi had said it.</p><p>And truth is, Sera couldn’t even deny it.</p><p>Ever since she’d turned 21, Sera had concluded that she might very well die before she reached 30.  It was a few days after her cousin Hyena’s attack – a Guardian candidate who was much stronger and more adept than her – and it was at her wake that Sera realized that when the Enemy comes for her, she might not survive. Sera was startled to realize that subconsciously, she had never made any plans beyond the age of 30. It was like somewhere at the back of her mind, Sera had accepted the fact that she was probably going to die young.</p><p>And Yoongi – observant Yoongi – had picked up on that.</p><p>Sera reached for the young Auror, squeezing his arm. “Thank you for caring, Yoongs.”</p><p>Yoongi shook his head. “That wasn’t the answer I was hoping for, but okay. I can tell when you’re done discussing things.”</p><p>Sera chuckled. Yoongi really did know her best.</p><p>*******</p><p>Yoongi waited patiently as Sera keyed in her door access code. He was tentatively poking something in front of him, and for a moment the protective wards surrounding her apartment shimmered purple. He laughed.</p><p>“Hoseok told me you had new wards up to replace the old one we put up but… you programmed it to let me through, didn’t you? Awww. Did you miss cat Yoongi? Is 2 months apart too long for you?”</p><p>“Shut up.” Sera’s ears burned. She wasn’t about to admit to Yoongi that her wards would allow him, Namjoon, Hoseok and Seokjin through, while keeping other magical beings out. The wards wouldn’t hurt muggles, as well. It was designed to protect her from magical attacks. Muggles can deal with her top-notch home alarm system instead.</p><p>She half-turned. “You wanna come in for ramyun?”</p><p>He smirked. “RAMYUN ramyun? Or… you know….” Yoongi made quote marks “RAMYUN ramyun.”</p><p>“Oh, God, no. Please don’t be gross.”</p><p>That smirk didn’t leave his lips. “Why have ramyun when I have scones waiting for me at the shop? Nahh. You go ahead. I don’t want to distract you from your experiments.”</p><p>“Thanks for walking me home, Yoongs.”</p><p>“Hmm. Stop being sappy and lock the door, dammit. I need my scones.”</p><p>She managed to stick out her tongue at him as the door swung close.</p><p>Yoongi smiled softly at the closed door. Sera was definitely on his ‘Favourite People’ list.</p><p>She was also on his ‘Too Stubborn For Their Own Good’ list.</p><p>But he was one to talk. It was glaringly obvious how similar they both were. Except Sera cared what people think, and Yoongi really didn’t give a damn.</p><p>He drew in a deep breath and reached out towards the wards, eyes narrowed in concentration. The palm of his hands stung a little as it made contact, then quietened to a low thrum. Yoongi recited a warding spell, over and over. Silver-white strands shot out from his palms, slowly turning the purple barrier into a mix of purple and silver-white.</p><p>He thought he could hear a small shriek when his protective spell started activating.</p><p>Whoops. Perhaps he should’ve warned Sera beforehand. She would’ve felt the two spells melding.</p><p>Yoongi took a shaky step back, breathing hard, perspiring. He watched as the purple-silver-white barrier slowly became invisible.</p><p>Whoa, okay. So maybe he wasn’t as strong as he thought. Hoseok would be nagging at him for overtaxing himself, while Seokjin would probably manhandle him and tuck him into bed straightaway. But really, what Yoongi would hate most is having Namjoon going all I-told-you-so on him.</p><p>He picked the worst time to get injured in that black market phoenix feathers smuggling bust. Sigh.</p><p>Sorry, Sera. The most I can do is amp up your wards. Not in any condition to do more.</p><p>Yoongi’s phone chimed as soon as he stepped out of the building.</p><p> <br/>
</p><p>            <strong>QueSera</strong></p><p>            You idiot.</p><p> <br/>
</p><p>Yoongi grinned.</p><p> <br/>
</p><p>            <strong>Min Suga</strong></p><p>            You’re welcome.</p><p> <br/>
</p><p>He inhaled deeply before exhaling in a whoosh.</p><p>There. That niggling feeling of being watched.</p><p>Yoongi whipped around, focusing in the direction he felt that watchful gaze was coming from. But of course, the alley was empty, save for a stray breeze. He frowned. He really should investigate, especially since part of the reason why he accompanied Sera home was because Hoseok had said he felt like he was being watched when he had run deliveries for Sera the week before.</p><p>But the protective spell had winded him, and whoever it was that was watching them didn’t seem to be making a move. So it should still be safe… until October, at least. Besides, if anyone tries to force through the barrier, Yoongi would be alerted as well.</p><p>Not liking the situation he was in, but having no choice, Yoongi sighed resignedly and whistled to himself as he trudged back to the Emporium, daydreaming of hot buttered-scones and steaming mugs of tea.</p><p>*******</p><p>The hooded figure exhaled as he watched the broad-shouldered young man with silvery-blue hair whistle and walked away. There was a bittersweet taste in his mouth when he recognized the song – Bittersweet Symphony by The Verve.</p><p>In his mind he saw a much younger Min Yoongi, decked in Slytherin colours and cheering wildly, his cherry blossom pink hair bouncing about, mouth open wide showing off his trademark gummy smile, ignoring the dirty looks and hissing of his fellow House mates as he essentially celebrated their opponents’ win in Quidditch over his own House.</p><p> <br/>
</p><p>
  <em>“Kid, you did it! You caught the Golden Snitch in record time, too! Ravenclaw wins the Quidditch Cup!” Yoongi thundered into the microphone, forgetting his official duties as commentator. He was also – in his excited state – unknowingly speaking in Korean.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’m so proud of you!”</em>
</p><p> <br/>
</p><p>The hooded figure shook the memory away. That was a lifetime ago. A different time, a different life.</p><p>A different Min Yoongi.</p><p>A different me.</p><p>A few minutes later he stood outside an unassuming door, chanting a revealing spell over and over again. In no time at all, a protective barrier emerged. The hooded figure gently blew at it, delicate ice crystals forming. It was a simple and unobtrusive spell to see how strong the wards were, and was too delicate to bother anyone synced to it. He grimaced as he watched his ice crystals evaporate instantly. The barrier was strong. Too strong.</p><p>A cruel smile twisted his lips.</p><p>Well… we’ll see how well it holds up when October rolls by.</p><p>*******</p>
