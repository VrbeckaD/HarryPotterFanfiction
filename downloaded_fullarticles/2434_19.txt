    <p> </p>
<p>As Draco Malfoy escapes the castle and runs as far away from the battle as quickly as his legs can carry him, he has no idea that he's about to doom himself to a much more horrifying fate than being killed in battle.</p>
<p>In fact, Draco probably will never know the true extent of his misfortune.</p>
<p>He doesn't know that if only he had turned right at the first junction of corridors, he would have ran straight into his mother's arms.</p>
<p>He doesn't know that the rumble of the wall that nearly crumbled down on him as he dodged the curse of a raving Death Eater silenced the screams of his father calling out his name.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe it's best for him not to know how close he came to being saved, just before his life is about to be torn apart.</p>
<p>Maybe that's his one last ounce of luck in a sea of misfortune.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>He doesn't see him before it's too late.</p>
<p>He had stopped against a tree to catch his breath, panting heavily. He never wanted to go into the Forbidden Forest but he hopes his parents might be there, maybe already waiting for him. He hasn't seen them in the castle and he doesn't even allow his mind to consider the fact that they might have been killed. Surely after the Dark Lord died they would have know they had to get out of there.</p>
<p>Draco knows his parent's aren't like his aunt Bellatrix or the Carrows, in fact their loyalty to the Death Eaters had been waning over time and the only reason they hadn't turned their backs on him earlier was that until then they believed he would win. He knows his mother in particular has never forgiven the Dark Lord for humiliating her husband and putting her son in danger. So, rather than lingering in battle and trying to kill as many people on the “other side” as possible, they surely would decide to escape. The only true loyalty a Malfoy had was to oneself and to the Malfoy line, after all.</p>
<p>Draco looks up and straightens himself up again once his lungs stop feeling like they're on fire. He has no need to run now, his priority is to find his parents.</p>
<p>He knows of the dangers lurking in the Forest, but as most of its most fearsome inhabitants seemed to have joined the battle and not have come back yet, in that moment it might be the closest thing to a safe hide-out there is around there. It certainly can't be more dangerous than being in the midst of the fight.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for him, in his haste to reconcile with his family and flee from there he has failed to consider one important detail.</p>
<p>He is far from the only one to have had that same idea.</p>
<p>“<span>Fancy meeting you here, boy”.</span></p>
<p>Greyback's low rumbling voice freezes him on the spot. He turns towards him slowly, as if hoping it might have been a trick of his anxiety-ridden mind, but there he is standing in front of him. There is no mistaking that bulk, that fierce looking face with a wide sadistic grin that is all blood and sharp teeth, nor his amber eyes which almost seem to glow in excitement as the man looks at him as if he wants to eat him up.</p>
<p>Draco shivers at the thought. He can't help but fear that's exactly what that vile beast intends to do, now that there's no need for him to pretend they're on the same side.</p>
<p>“<span>Running away from the battle, are we?”, the man says, tilting his head as his grin widens even more, looking almost like a snarl.</span></p>
<p>“<span>A... aren't you doing the same thing?”. </span></p>
<p>Draco wishes his voice wouldn't tremble, that he could sound and act as firm as he intended to be. He knows that he's shaking and that the man will see his fear and weakness and that only terrifies him even more.</p>
<p>Greyback chuckles and the only thing Draco can think of is how his teeth glisten in the moonlight – not a full moon yet, thankfully – and how much they look like fangs. He thinks of running away, but knows the other would just catch up to him in no time.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <em>I'm screwed</em>
  </span>
  <span>, he realizes, feeling his blood run cold. That's it, he's going to die there, and there's nothing he can do about it but beg for mercy and hope that foul beast can be somehow persuaded to spare him. </span>
</p>
<p>“<span>This isn't my fight any more. I've got to take care of my pack”, Greyback says, raising his arms to gesture and pointing all around himself. </span></p>
<p>Suddenly, Draco realizes just how wrong he was in assuming all wild and dangerous creatures have left the Forest as what has to be at least a dozen werewolves step out from the shadows, surrounding them. Much like Greyback they're in human form but he can tell what they are right away.</p>
<p>All blood drains from Draco's face and he looks at him pleadingly, too terrified to even speak.</p>
<p>“<span>What's the matter boy? Scared of the big bad wolf?”, the beast asks him, and laughter erupts all around them. “Can't hide under mommy's skirt anymore, can you?”</span></p>
<p>“<span>P-please don't kill me”.</span></p>
<p>Draco wishes he wouldn't sound so pitiful, that his voice wouldn't betray the fact that he's on the verge of tears. He wishes he could face death with courage but he's scared and alone and he doesn't want to die, oh Merlin he doesn't want to die like that, mauled by those disgusting monsters.</p>
<p>Greyback laughs even harder and Draco can no longer hold back his tears, and when the man starts to approach him he cannot stop himself from running even if he knows it's futile, sprinting as if his life depended on it – and it probably does.</p>
<p>He doesn't even make it halfway back to the entrance of the Forest before he is vehemently shoved against the ground by the weight of the wolf, his loud panting against his ear as he screams in terror. He claws at the ground in an idle attempt to pull himself out of his grasp but Greyback is pinning him down and shoving his face against the dirt, muffling his cries.</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco feels his breath on his neck and he freezes in place, thinking </span>
  <span>
    <em>this is it, oh no he's going to bite down, he's going to tear out my throat, please somebody help me!</em>
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Instead something warm and wet touches his skin and he realizes the other is </span>
  <span>
    <em>licking</em>
  </span>
  <span> him like a dog, and his body recoils in disgust as his skin is covered in goosebumps. </span>
</p>
<p>“<span>I always thought you looked like a tasty little snack. A shame I couldn't have you earlier, but I think I will still enjoy myself”, Greyback whispers against his ear before licking it. Draco tries to get away from that contact but the man's hand is on his head and tightens its grasp on his hair, pushing down harder. His mouth tastes like grass and dirt and dust and snot but he has to keep it open to breathe through it as his nose is squished shut by that pressure.</span></p>
<p>Not that it matters since he's still certain that Greyback intends to kill him, except instead of tearing through his throat like a literal wolf maybe he will torture him slowly, take his time savouring the kill just because he can.</p>
<p>It's not until his robes are ripped off of him that he starts to get an idea of just what the man might intend to do. It's just a horrible feeling gnawing at the back of his mind, a thought so horrible he doesn't even dare to formulate it fully even as his underwear is also ripped off and he hears a rustle as the man readjusts something in his clothes.</p>
<p>
  <span>He only snaps out of it once he feels something warm and hard and way too thick press against his lower body. If his face hadn't been hidden against the dirt it would be bright red. He just can't believe it, can't believe even someone as vile as that werewolf could actually</span>
  <span>
    <em> try to have sex with him.</em>
  </span>
  <span> He truly is nothing more than a feral beast.</span>
</p>
<p>“<span>Let me go!”, he manages to scream as soon as the man lets go of his head to grasp onto his hips, forcing him to raise them as he starts to rub that disgusting... </span><span><em>thing</em></span><span> against his ass. “My father will murder you! If you so much as-”</span></p>
<p>“<span>Shut the fuck up!”, Greyback roars right against his ear, so loudly and abruptly that Draco fears his eardrum will split. He doesn't even realized he's pissed himself in fear until a sudden warmth spreads against his legs as a small puddle is formed underneath him.</span></p>
<p>Greyback starts to sniff loudly and lets out a snorting laugh as soon as he recognizes the smell.</p>
<p>“<span>I haven't even started and you're already getting wet”, he jokes. Once again more laughter erupts all around them, and Draco realizes the other werewolves must have caught up to them too and now are watching as he's about to be soiled by that... that...</span></p>
<p>“<span>Monster!</span><span>”, he cries out, his shoulders shaking as he starts to sob. He cannot stop him, he knows he can't, and he wishes he had the courage to tell him he'd rather die than be subjected to that humiliation. But as horrible as that thought is he's still more afraid of death, of being eaten alive by those beasts or something even worse.</span></p>
<p>Greyback only chuckles at his retort. “You say that as if it's an insult”. He seems to find that amusing, clearly unaffected by Draco's insults or threats. Much to the boy's horror he spreads his buttocks apart, revealing the small untouched hole, before spitting on it.</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco squeals in shock and disgust. How could that creature </span>
  <span>
    <em>spit </em>
  </span>
  <span>on him? The sudden sensation of the man's saliva sliding between his cheeks and against his entrance is unexpected and unpleasant and he tries to wriggle away.</span>
</p>
<p>“<span>Please, stop!”, he begs as the man repeats his action before rubbing his shaft between the soft mounds of flesh, his claws digging into the pale skin as his grasp tightens to prevent him from escaping. Draco's voice raises along with his panic. “</span><span><em>Merlin, no!</em></span><span> Please! My family is rich, my father will reward you greatly if you bring me back untouched, so </span><span><em>please</em></span><span>-”</span></p>
<p>“<span>I'm already getting what I want from you, kid”, Greyback replies, his voice breathy and husky from the arousal. “I'm going to take your tight, virgin Pure-blood ass, break you in with my cock. And then, if I'm not bored with you, I might leave you alive”. The threat is clear to Draco even if the other doesn't express it fully. If he's in any way displeased with him, the man will kill him.</span></p>
<p>He hangs his head low and his sobbing increases in volume as he realizes there is nothing he can do to stop this, that he's really going to be violated by a werewolf and Merlin knows what kind of foul diseases he might be infested with. Again he tries to struggle when he feels the tip of the man's cock is starting to press against his entrance, but Greyback leans down and his teeth clamp down on the boy's shoulder and grows menacingly.</p>
<p>His fangs don't press down enough to break the skin but they will leave a mark, and Draco immediately freezes at the unspoken threat. Oh Merlin, he thinks, what if the beast bites him? Will he get infected too, even if it's not the full moon!? Will he become a monster like him? No! His family would be disgraced! He has to prevent it at all costs!</p>
<p>
  <span>That's why he doesn't try to move this time as he feels that pressure on his hole again, and he can't see it but he can feel it and he can tell it's </span>
  <span>
    <em>huge</em>
  </span>
  <span> and it </span>
  <span>
    <em>can't </em>
  </span>
  <span>possibly fit in. For a while he's almost relieved because there's just</span>
  <span>
    <em> no way</em>
  </span>
  <span> it's gonna go in, Greyback will soon realize it too and give up, and...</span>
</p>
<p>The searing bright hot pain courses his whole body as his ass seems to split apart. Draco doesn't even realize that he's screaming until he runs out of breath, his whole body so tense it feels like it's made of wood.</p>
<p>Greyback doesn't slow down nor stop, in fact his scream seems to have incited him even more. He pulls back only to slam in again and again, each time sliding in further and seemingly ripping him open from the inside. At least that's what it feels like.</p>
<p>“<span>AAAH! STOP! NO! LET ME GO! LET ME GO!”, he frantically screams, trying to crawl away from him as soon as he can move again, but the man's grip on his hips is as strong as that of a Devil's snare.</span></p>
<p>“<span>Ohh, it feels so damn good! I shouldn't have waited so long to fuck you”, Greyback says inbetween groans of pleasure, completely ignoring his protests. “I should have just bent you over and fucked you right in front of your dad, and that other hot piece of ass he married... too bad she's not here or else she could have been next!” </span></p>
<p>Even in his pain, those words get to Draco and he turns his face to glare at him as he snaps:</p>
<p>“<span>Don't...</span><span><em>AAH! </em></span><span>T-talk of my mother l-like</span><span><em>- AH!</em></span><span> L-like that y-you vile</span><span><em>-AAAH!”</em></span></p>
<p>
  <span>Greyback grins again, his eyes glinting with malice. “Maybe we should go and get her too”, he proposes, filling Draco's heart with horror. “Her cunt might be used up but I bet your dad is too much of a priss to have fucked her ass, so it might still be as tight as yours!”. He slams his cock inside as hard as he can right after that, his grin growing so wide it gives him a deranged look as </span>
  <span>he hears the boy's screams.</span>
</p>
<p>“<span>We could always try both and compare!”, another werewolf comments, and Greyback grunts in approval.</span></p>
<p>“<span>NO!” Draco yells out in panic, shaking his head and trying to scratch and pull away the man's arms, but he might as well have tried to do the same to a tree trunk for the exact same result. “DON'T YOU FUCKING TOUCH HER YOU- </span><span><em>AAH!”</em></span></p>
<p>He cannot finish his sentence as Greyback chooses that exact moment to push himself fully inside him, down to the very base, until his balls rest against the younger man's.</p>
<p>“<span>Then will you come with us?”, the man asks, speaking right against his ear in a whisper so low and rumbly it's almost a growl. “We could always just kill you and take her instead, she's got more holes for us to fill and a nice pair of tits. I know Longfang and Bonecrusher would just </span><span><em>love</em></span><span> to play with a pretty thing like her...”</span></p>
<p>“<span>NO!!!” he screams again, his voice rising and almost cracking. The prospect of death would already be terrifying enough, but to die horribly and to condemn his mother to such a horrible fate sounds like his worst nightmare. “Don't... don't touch her! I...” - his voice cracks again and he has to force himself to continue. “...I will come... please, t-take me instead”.</span></p>
<p>Greyback chuckles. “What a good little mama's boy”, he says, ruffling his hair in a mockery of an affectionate gesture. One of the few women in the group makes a small disapproving sound, but clearly she doesn't dare to object to her leader's choice. Instead, she glares at Draco as if it was all his fault.</p>
<p>Before the boy can even start to try and make sense of that Greyback starts to move again, this time pulling back slowly as if to make him feel every inch of the cock that was just buried inside him. Draco crosses his arms in front of himself and hides his face against it, sobbing and letting out a long continuous wail. It feels as if his insides are being pulled out of him, and now he's sure he can feel and hear something dripping from his legs and he's sure it must be his own blood.</p>
<p>“<span>I've opened you up for good”, Greyback comments as soon as the tip of his penis finally pops out of the other's abused hole. Draco doesn't even have time to be relieved before clawed fingers are jammed inside him instead, twisting around and pushing inside his tight channel, as if to tear him apart from the inside. They slide in easily, too easily, confirming Draco's suspicions that he must be bleeding by now. “You're still nice and tight, though. I think we'll have lots of fun playing with you, even when you're so worn-out that your ass can't even close by itself”.</span></p>
<p>
  <span>Finally those fingers are pulled out, and Draco braces himself as he waits for the man's cock to be back inside him again. Instead, G</span>
  <span>reyback moves away and gets back on his feet before kicking him, drawing a loud yelp in response.</span>
</p>
<p>“<span>Get on your knees, bitch!” the werewolf barks at him, kicking him again. </span></p>
<p>Draco's arse still feels like it's on fire from the rough fucking, still he hurries to move before the other can decide to kick him again out of impatience. His side is sore already and he's not sure if his ribs are broken or if the ache is just from being bruised, but what he's sure is that Greyback will not hesitate to smash his ribcage open if he doesn't comply fast enough.</p>
<p>So he does as he's said, wincing at the stabbing pain from his insides every time he repositions himself. More blood trickles down his legs and someone from the crowd comments that he looks like a bitch on her period, making laughter erupt all around him.</p>
<p>
  <span>Greyback however isn't laughing, probably because he's too focused on his own arousal. Draco can see it clearly now as it's right in front of his face. It looks as horrible as he thought it would, especially as it's covered in blood – </span>
  <span>
    <em>his own blood</em>
  </span>
  <span> – and way too big to even believe it could have gone inside him. </span>
</p>
<p>“<span>Look at the mess that you made on my cock”, the man says, grasping on his shimmering blond hair until Draco hisses in pain, hard enough to yank some of it out of his scalp. “You're going to lick it clean for me, then you're going to suck it, and then, if you do a good job, we'll leave the other Malfoy bitch alone and bring you back with us”.</span></p>
<p>“<span>Don't call her li-”</span></p>
<p>
  <em>-SMACK!-</em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Before he can finish his sentence the back of Greyback's hand connects with his face and, for a</span>
  <span> split second, Draco sees stars. </span>
</p>
<p>The right side of his face is first really numb and cold, then it starts to burn and swell up. The metallic taste of blood starts to spread from the corner of his mouth. Licking his lip, he realizes it was split open in that spot.</p>
<p>As the pain from the hit subsides he looks up at the older man with a mixture of humiliation, fear and anger. Greyback's eyes narrow in response, his lips pulled back in a ferocious snarl, and he even starts to growl.</p>
<p>“<span>You're pissing me off already. Don't fucking talk back or you'll get a bashing!”, he barks threateningly, tightening the grasp on his hair and twisting his hand until Draco cries out loud. “The only thing you'll need to use your mouth for is sucking my cock! Got it, bitch?”.</span></p>
<p>
  <span>He doesn't really wait for a response before pushing his dick against the boy's mouth. Draco's first instinct is to clamp up his teeth and press his lips together in a thin line, but then he remembers t</span>
  <span>he threats about his mother and his fists clench at his sides but his jaw relaxes and slowly he forces his own lips to open, choking back a sob when the man's cock is roughly shoved past them. </span>
</p>
<p>It tastes of blood of course, in fact it's so overpowering that Draco cannot taste anything else, which leads him to bitterly wonder if he should be glad about it. The man pulls himself in and out of his mouth, stopping just past the tip, then tugs on his hair and forces him to tilt his head as he rubs each side of his length against his lips.</p>
<p>“<span>I told you to lick it clean you stupid fuck! Do you want me to hit you again?”, roars Greyback, to which Draco hurries to stick out his tongue and slide it along the man's shaft, face scrunching up in disgust. That at least seems to please the werewolf, who lets out a satisfied grunt and guides his mouth along his shaft, rubbing himself against that warm little tongue. When it reaches the tip again he makes sure that Draco's tongue reaches every nook and cranny, instructing him to swirl it around his thick glans to clean up the blood that has collected there in the edge of the crown.</span></p>
<p>Finally after what seems like an eternity the man's cock is fully clean, all glistening with saliva and so hard it's throbbing, dark veins bulging out on the surface.</p>
<p>Greyback takes a few moments to contemplate the results, humming to himself. Then he wastes no time before pushing himself in again, this time leaving a few inches inside Draco's mouth rather than moving in and out of it.</p>
<p>“<span>Now it's time to suck me off. I'm sure even a prissy little thing like you know how it's done”, the man ordered, before adding almost casually: “Or else we can just get your mum to show you”.</span></p>
<p>Draco feels like throwing up at the mere thought of doing something so vile, but the fear of that threat overpowers his disgust. Tears of shame and frustration well up in his eyes and start sliding down his cheeks as he forces himself to suck on the man's flesh as if it was a really thick Sugar Quill.</p>
<p>He can barely make out any taste above the metallic blood flavour still filling his mouth, but the texture and warmth and the sheer knowledge of what he is doing are enough to make his stomach roil. He keeps repeating to himself that he has to do it, he has to keep those beasts away from his mother at any cost, even if it means humiliating himself in front of them.</p>
<p>If there's one adjective that would never come to mind when describing him, that would be “brave”. Draco has never been particularly brave, in fact he's always been known for being kind of a coward. That's part of what made his whole ordeal under the Dark Lord so hard for him. He could no longer hide under his father's name, he had to try and prove that he could do it on his own. And what he had found out in the process is that, in fact, he's far less inclined towards violence than he thought he was. If there's one thing he learned is that it's far different to see someone suffer in front of him, far different to have to directly cause pain than to heard second-hand tales about Mudbloods and semi-humans being disposed of.</p>
<p>Of course, his mother knew that from the start. She'd always said he was her sweet, gentle boy. At some point it had started to irk him, to make him feel like she wasn't taking him seriously. Besides, he has never wanted to be sweet or gentle, instead he has always dreamed of being strong and powerful like his father.</p>
<p>Now he understands that yes, maybe she had been biased, but she had been the only one to see that he wasn't going to be the kind of man his father expected, and that she loved him nevertheless. If his father's love is something he always felt he'd have to fight for, his mother's love has always felt unconditional and unwavering.</p>
<p>That's why, as much of a coward as he might be, no matter how terrified or hurt, he will not let them touch her, he will protect her in any way he can. Those monsters will not sully her purity, even if he has to give up every inch of his dignity to prevent that.</p>
<p>“Man, you<em> really </em>suck at this”.</p>
<p>Greyback's voice is full of disappointment and irritation, making Draco fear he might have crushed his only chance. However, instead of pushing him off of himself and running off to find the boy's mother, the man merely places both hands to the sides of his face and holds tight before shoving his whole length in without warning, choking him with his dick.</p>
<p>Draco’s eyes widen in shock, his throat spasming around the man’s girth. <span>Soon enough he learns that just because it's not ripping his ass open doesn't mean the man cannot find new terrible ways to hurt him with it. As hard as it might have been to hold back from throwing up before it does not even compare to the sheer feeling of utter rejection that seem to shake his entire body, drenching him in cold sweat. </span></p>
<p>“<span>Now that’s better”, the man says, sounding a million miles away from him, white noise filling Draco’s ears. “Don’t you fucking throw up on me bitch or I swear I’ll beat your face into a pulp!”.</span></p>
<p>Draco tries his best to swallow down everything, from the man’s cock to his own fear and bile rising up inside him, his hands grasping on the sides of Greyback’s trousers and it takes all of his self-control not to try and push himself off of him.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <em>I have to endure it for her, for her, </em>
  </span>
  <span>he keeps repeating to himself like a mantra, trying to empty his mind from everything else but that one single thought, trying to focus on that instead of the awful depravity that he is being forced to endure.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Somehow it’s almost </span>
  <span>
    <em>worse </em>
  </span>
  <span>than being fucked. If before he thought that he might die from the pain, now he knows he will die if only the man hesitates a bit too much before pulling back and giving him those few seconds of mercy before shoving himself all the way in again, and again, and again - until Draco’s jaw feels like it’s about to</span>
  <span> come unhinged.</span>
</p>
<p>And so would he – if not for the fact that his mind is a fog from the lack of oxigen and his eyes are so watery he can barely make out the blurred shape of the towering figure in front of him. The blood buzzes so loudly in his ears that he’s deaf to any sound except from his own constant gulping and gargling.</p>
<p>Everything just blends together into a shapeless mass of pain and discomfort as Greyback’s thrusts quicken in pace to the point where his balls slap violently against Draco’s chin with a wet almost-splashing sound.</p>
<p>Drool leaks down from the boy’s mouth almost-continuously, prompting Greyback to make some sort of nasty remark about how his mouth is getting wet like a cunt, which would probably fuel the blond’s shame if it wasn’t for the fact that his body is quickly going limp like a ragdoll. His hands move weakly in a desperate, instinctive attempt to escape, idly scratching at the man’s sides until they can no longer rise up and just slide helplessly along the werewolf’s legs, dangling down the boy’s side like pendulums at the same rhythm as the man’s thrusts.</p>
<p>Even then Greyback doesn’t stop, in fact this seems to fuel his excitement even more as he shakes his hips in a frenzy, thrusting himself inside that wet sloppy hole as if it were nothing but a tool for his sexual pleasure. Which, in his mind, is exactly the case.</p>
<p>
  <span>By the time he finally cums and pulls out his cock to spurt his seed all over him, the boy’s face is a mess of snot, spit and smeared blood. The only thing that keeps him from falling down like a dead weight is the man’s grip on his head, but Greyback has </span>
  <span>already grown tired of playing with him for the time being, so he lets him slip down on the grass with a soft thud.</span>
</p>
<p>“<span>Pathetic”, the woman from before speaks up, her voice seething in disgust. “If that’s the sort of vermins the Dark Lord allowed amongst his followers, no wonder he le</span><span>t himself get killed by some brat”.</span></p>
<p>“<span>Remember his father, don’t you? Always looking at us like we were dirtying his nice furniture just by being in the same room”, Fenrir says, rolling the unconscious body to the side with his foot and placing the sole of his boot against the boy’s head. “I’d really love to see what kind of face he’d make if he saw his precious little heir getting soiled like this”. He pushes down, grinding his heel to press Draco’s face into the wet soil. It would be so easy to crack his skull open like an egg, splattering his brains on the ground. He tries to imagine Lucius’s horror at discovering the carnage, feeling a warm shiver along his whole body, making his hair stand up and his already spent cock twitch. If it wasn’t for the fact that he just came he would already be hard as a rock.</span></p>
<p>“<span>I remember his pretty wife”, comes the she-wolf’s reply, her mouth twisting into a leering grin. “I bet her screams would sound lovely”. She glances aside to her companion, a taller and much bulkier woman who licks her lips hungrily at her comment. </span></p>
<p>
  <span>Greyback considers the suggestion for a few minutes. Sure, the Malfoy woman </span>
  <span>
    <em>is </em>
  </span>
  <span>quite attractive but she’s also way too old for his taste. As much as he likes the idea of fucking her raw and maybe knocking her up with a few of his pups just to spite Lucius, he’s sure it wouldn’t take long for him to grow tired of her. Besides, she’s never shown fear to him in the same way her boy has. </span>
</p>
<p>He still remembers the first time he had encountered him, the way his already pale face had turned as white as a sheet at the sight of the infamous werewolf and how he had almost inconsciously tried to hide himself behind Lucius – as if that fop could do anything to stop Fenrir if he had decided to attack them. No, the only thing that stopped him from shoving them aside and ravishing that fearful little thing had been the fact that he was trying to make allies for the sake of his people. So he had ignored his own raging hard boner and waited to get back from his trip before jerking himself off to the memory of Draco’s terror, imagining just how much more scared he could make him if he didn’t have to play nice with his stupid stuck-up father in order to try and gain the favour of the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>No, he decides, it’s not the boy’s mother that he wants, it’s his panicked screams that he wants to hear as he rapes him, it's him that he wants to see groveling and begging for mercy before crushing his hopes, it's his eyes that he wants to see filled with desperation as he realizes his nightmare will never end.</p>
<p>“<span>I'm a man of my word, Longfang. The poor thing tried his best to be a good little slut... it really moved my heart”, he says, pretending to wipe a tear from his face as several of the werewolves around him chuckle. “I'm sure he'll become everyone's favourite cumdump in no time”.</span></p>
<p>Longfang grimaces as if she just bit something sour, but doesn't dare to talk back. Many of the other werewolves are cheering, while one of them jokes that it sure is cruel to separate mother and son like that – Greyback is not surprised to notice it's Bloodhound, because of course the greedy bastard would want to have both. But that'd mean going back into the battle they just left and risk losing yet other valuable pack members, while they have a perfectly good toy right there who's not even going to put up a fight in his current condition.</p>
<p>With no further ado, Greyback picks up the still-unconscious boy and easily hoists him over his shoulders before gesturing to the other wolves to follow him.</p>
<p>“<span>Come on, we've wasted far too much of our time here.”, he barks out, his tone suddenly turning serious. “Let this be a lesson to us all, this is the last time we'll fight someone else's fight! The next time we're in battle it will be to lead our werewolves brethrens to victory!” </span></p>
<p>And this time, every single one of them is cheering.</p>
