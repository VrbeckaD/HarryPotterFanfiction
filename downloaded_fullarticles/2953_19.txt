    <p>Prologue<br/> I was just finishing up a spell I was working on to advance my Astral Projection, when my favorite Aunt walked into the room.<br/><br/> “Hey Baby Girl, whatcha doing?”, she asked.<br/><br/> “Hey Aunt Konnie, just fixing up a spell for one of my dimensional jumps.” I replied.<br/><br/>“Alright, just be careful on this one. The last time you came back after your jump caused headaches for both me and your Aunt Misty.”<br/><br/> “I made sure to draw a salt line and am ready to meditate once I get back. No headaches this time I promise.” My Aunt huffed.<br/><br/> “I’ll believe that when I see it. Goodnight.” She called heading back out of my room closing the door.<br/><br/> “Night!” I called after her. I finished mixing the Traveling Powder with the comfrey oil and the burnt ashes of the parchment that had the date and time of where I wanted to be. I added a drop of lavender oil to get to REM sleep faster and took up the pendant of the Deathly Hallows.<br/><br/> “You better work well since you cost me so much.”, I said to the pendent that cost a good chunk of my last paycheck. It needed to be hardy and last many years as it was my connection to the world I was going to.<br/><br/> I dropped it into the oil mixture and made sure to get every crevasse between charm and chain soaked. I took up and Amethyst pendant I got as a gift and swung it clockwise 3 times around the glass bowl I was using.<br/><br/> “So Mote It Be.” I said as it passed around the first, second then third time then let it swing on its own until it stopped pointed straight over the charm dipping it into the mixture before setting it carefully aside.<br/><br/> I picked the pendant up out of the mixture and placed it over my head and around my neck, taking the last of the oil and rubbing it into my forehead and hair until gone. I walked within the salt line I drew, cautious of my Aunts warning. I don’t need to give Aunt Misty any more headaches than she already gets, and Aunt Konnie always draws my mothers Migraines to help her out.<br/><br/> I pick up my Spell book and go over the Rules I’ve collected over the years of my travels:<br/><br/> Astral Projection to Alternate Dimensions<br/><br/> Important Need To Know<br/><br/> 1) You can never enter an Alpha Timeline<br/> 2) You are you, no matter who your other self is in Alpha Timeline<br/> 3) You will feel everything, nothing is muted Pain or Feelings.<br/> 4) Any Media, whether Book, Movie, TV Show, Comics, Game or even Music is an Alternate Dimension and is open to Astral Projection- Exception being Alpha Timeline.<br/> 5) Fanfiction published or not is also fair game. Many writers are simply doing Astral Projection in Basic Form- See Rule #4<br/> 6) Fanon and Headcanons are Canon somewhere, be ready to find disturbing things if necessary. If you don’t be relieved<br/> 7) F*** s**t up as much as you want nothing will change from Alpha timeline. However, you will be known as a D*** in said timeline.<br/> 8) Once you leave the Dimension you will not be allowed back in. You will “split” from the other you, who will live out the remainder of that life down the path you put them on. Think 2-way Ticket, No Returns<br/> 9) Any and all supplies or needed papers will be on hand or scattered wherever you are. It would be too easy to have them right in front of your face, but they will be where such things would normally be in any household.<br/><br/> I sigh, set down my book and close my eyes feeling the lavender oil do its job making me tired. I plug my phone onto its charger turn my light off and snuggle into my blankets as I hear Itachi fly through my open window and land on his perch on my altar.<br/><br/> “Ya know it’s a good thing you’re a familiar otherwise you’d be fried crow at the state fair, with the amount of times you’ve flown through my spells and lines.” I say as I look over at Itachi my crow. Well not really mine as its Illegal to own one in the US, but he and his brother tend to follow me and mine around all the time, so we just gave them names and perches for when they want to drop in on us. “Stupid Bird”, I say as he squawks at me indignantly.<br/><br/> “Yeah, yeah I’m going to bed. Ill see you when we cross over.” I yawned and turned over pulling my blanket over my head, not having to wait long for sleep to claim me.</p>
