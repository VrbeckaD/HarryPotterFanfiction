  <span class="s1">Chance was often in a euphoric state, wether his peers and professors were aware of it or not. Being raised in the muggle world certainly had its perks, the medication he had been on since the ripe age of seven went un-noticed each year when he brought it into the castle. And then in his fourth year he had ran out and need his parents to send an emergency supply via owl. When they came through with no complications—Chance started to think that perhaps it was possible to bring others in. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">So he did. Cahlis and Zhao didn’t notice anything because they weren’t aware such things even <em>existed. </em>In all honesty if anyone was going to catch the blonde it would have been Mira and Haneul, but they never noticed because they were no longer around the Slytherin, and if they did from afar—they didn’t say anything. Chance got away with it all. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It wasn’t until his fifth year that he tested some of the more <em>powerful</em> drugs. He never was advertised them nor did he sell them to anyone, every man for their own he believed. Just because the rest of the population could get through their mundane reality without anything other than a cheering potion to get them through, didn’t mean Chance had to do the same. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He even managed to bring in coke once, it was good quality and not at all like the poisoned, cheaper versions that feel like grains of dirt when rubbed between his fingers. No, this was <em>fine </em>and powdery. It was pure <em>bliss </em>and Chance would have happily continued to chase that high once he experienced the coming down. But that wasn’t why he only brought it in once. He decided once was enough because it was too much of a risk. His dorm-mate, once sugar-crazed often mistook it for sherbet (a highly entertaining outcome when the boy announced it was the most disgusting sherbet he had ever tasted) and then when Zhao went on his ‘diet’, he had busted Chance snorting it in the bathroom and proceeded to throw it in the fire out of pure hatred that he could no longer have some. Chance, of course, didn’t correct him. But it was too much of a waste around his companion.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Eventually it was easiest to just stick to weed, he could even grow his own plant inside his dorm with nonethewiser. Though it was a little suspicious when Chance came back to the dorm with a plant and a green thumb when everyone knew Chance didn’t care about anything that didn’t revolve around himself. He didn’t have to explain much though, not when his sister was so much of a green thumb she bragged that it was <em>her </em>influence that encouraged her older brother into better habits. It was all far too easy. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Until now. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">When a human devouring plant had overrun most of Hogwarts, leaving devastation, chaos and even death in it’s wake—it had them trapped, cornered like a mouse between the cat’s claws and in a state of panic in all their common rooms. Well, most of them. Chance had lost Zhao along the way. During the time they were forced to sleep in the Great Hall to the attempt of being evacuated, Chance had nowhere he could light up without being discovered. He wasn’t the only muggle-born that wasn’t aware of muggle drugs, <em>surely. </em>He wasn’t going to test it and find out. But that meant he had to detoxify during the week that sustained, and his peers were unlucky enough to experience a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>level Chance King that if it weren't for the blood that ran red underneath his skin—would have been deemed inhumane. He became irritable and cruel, those who tolerated him quickly disappeared until all that was left was Zhao Feng who was arguably not much more empathic than a rock. They had made a deal mid last year, when the world seemed to be upside down and Chance was in a state that seemed almost clinically insane—to be the foundation and freedom they both desired and so desperately needed. That if they were going to drown under the pressure and pain of living in this world then they would do so together. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Which was why Chance appeared psychotic when he realised that Zhao was no longer draped around his shoulders once everyone was in the common room. He had been coming down from a high that lasted for nearly two weeks now. He couldn’t give a damn about a murderous plant nor those who had met their end. He couldn’t give a damn about the water leaking through nor the possibility of the Black Lake plunging down around them. If his pet hadn’t made himself readily available, Chance would have left him behind as well—he hadn’t made a deal with the pet after all. But losing Zhao suddenly made him care about all of those facts at once, and it made him <em>angry. </em>Chance tore through the Slytherin Common Room, lifting up cushions and pushing over chairs. Barging through the student population leaving a trail of curses and abusive threats as he went. He stared at the broken fireplace, his eyes otherwise dead, held a rare anger that he usually veiled from view. Zhao was not here. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">He drew his wand and turned on the plant. It seemed like he was going to have to make an effort to stay alive, at least until he upheld his end of the deal. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">________________________________________________________________________ </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">It was over, the Ministry had sent aid that destroyed the man-eating plant. Chance didn’t know how nor did he care. He was too busy looking for Zhao. The entire student body was back in the Great Hall but had branched out into the Entrance Hall and into the courtyard. Chance’s face was expressionless as he shouldered his way through the crowd, onyx eyes flicking to each face as he passed through the Great Hall and out into the courtyard. He was past due time and need to have a smoke, but he was a man of his word and would not rest peacefully until he could see the Slytherin with his own eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“Cha Cha?” </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">The blonde whipped his head around and there he was, getting to his feet in the corner of the courtyard as Zhao realised it was Chance. His feet moved him forward, and in a state of relief, yearning and anger, Chance’s hands went straight to the boy’s collar.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“You better kiss me back.” </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Chance’s mouth slammed against his and ignored the noise of surprise until he felt the pressure respond against his lips. He let out everything he was feeling, and hoped to never have to feel that strongly again. He demanded angrily, his tongue dancing against the brunettes—<em>how dare you fucking leave me</em>. His fingers twisted in the tufts of the brunettes hair in yearning—<em>I never want to come that close to not keeping my word ever again. </em>His hands dragged themselves to cup the boys face until his forehead was leaning against the Zhao's in a result of haggard breathing of relief—<em>I don’t have to exist in this world alone. </em></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1"><em>“</em>I hate you.” </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>I really don’t. </em>
  </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">________________________________________________________________________ </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Chance blew smoke into the Slytherin’s face as he lit his joint in their corner of the courtyard. Zhao wrinkled his nose but was otherwise transfixed with watching the blonde draw smoke from the little white stick, and how the end would glow red. With how the vein in Chance’s neck became more prominent as he sucked in, and the shape of his mouth as he breathed out. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Chance held it out, “try it”. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">Zhao took it from him, “what is it?” </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">A glint of amusement glittered in the blonde’s charcoal stare, “it’s a relaxant, helps ye chill out.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Zhao shrugged and breathed it in, choking on the smoke as he inhaled and as it burnt his throat. </span>
</p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“No thanks.” Zhao handed it back. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
  <span class="s1">“It burns less if ye take it from here” Chance tapped his own lips, which Zhao briefly glanced at disinterested before turning his attention elsewhere. Chance merely smiled. </span>
