    <p>He had been working at Hogwarts for years, since he graduated to be exact, but this was the first time Draco would be entering platform nine and three quarters with a child of his own. Scorpius, a ripe eleven year old boy, was more excited to spend the whole year with his father rather than just the summer holidays than he was to go to what his father claimed to be “the best wizarding school.”</p><p>His mother died a week after Draco returned for summer. They were still sore, but at least Draco didn’t have to leave his young one unparented due to his age.</p><p>The two are soulmates. Well, were. Draco’s noticed the swirling crescent shape that was a match to Astoria on his side has started to fade. That wasn’t what was worrying him. No, now he noticed he had a different mark starting to appear on his hip bone.</p><p>“Malfoy! Good to see you!” Potter called from a little further away. He approached the two after handing a cart back to his second son.</p><p>“It’s Professor Malfoy to you.” He remarked with a small smile. They had gotten over their feud years ago. Had to.</p><p>“Right.” Harry bowed as deeply as he could. “Master of potions, grand Professor Malfoy Of Hogwarts: school of magic. Delighted that you could grace us common wizards with your excellency.”</p><p>“Well spoken, Potter.”</p><p>“Professor Potter.” He interjected before turning to Scorpius. He smiled a real smile and rubbed his hand on his unprofessional denim jeans and reached out for a handshake. “You must be Scorpius!” The pint sized blonde looked at the elder before returning the gesture hesitantly. “I’m Harry Potter, but you should call me Professor Potter.” He threw an overexcited hand over Draco’s shoulder. “I work with your old man here.”</p><p>“P-pleased to meet you.”</p><p>Then Harry is dragged away to say goodbye to his daughter and ex-wife. He and Ginny were still on good terms, still close friends, they simply fell out of love. They hugged and said goodbye before Harry tagged behind his youngest new student to get him settled on the train. Draco followed behind, helping Scorpius carry his things.</p><p>Harry was going towards them now alone, going back to the teacher car. As he passed he made sure Draco was watching as he looked at Scorpius then the last car of that train’s segment as if to suggest where to sit him. Draco played along and peeked in, noticing Harry’s youngest son Albus sitting alone.</p><p>“Why don’t you sit with this boy? He’s your age. Maybe you can become friends.”</p><p>“Okay, Father. And if he is mean?”</p><p>“Come tell me. I’m just back there.” He motioned to the door at the other end of the hallway. “I promise he won’t be mean. Just introduce yourself and see what happens.”</p><p>“I’ve never had a friend my age, Father.”</p><p>“I know, darling.” He kissed the top of his head and flattened his hair down before pressing past him to join the other teachers. He sat in his usual place from years past and simply snapped at a magazine from the table to make it hover in front of him so none of the other staff would bother him.</p><p>“Do it?”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“Did you tell your son to sit with mine?” Harry asked while sliding onto his stomach on the seat beside Draco.</p><p>“Yes. Why does it interest you so?”</p><p>“I just want them to be friends.”</p><p>“It is better to let friendships form naturally.” He states and turned the page as if he had been reading.</p><p>Harry agreed quietly and was distracted by the other professor that had gone to school at the same time as them, the herbology teacher Longbottom. It was a question about his soul mark.</p><p>“It faded the same time that Ginny and I... stopped being in love. It was slow, fading bit by bit, I don’t think either of us really noticed it at first.” He then sat up and held the top of his jeans. “Wanna see? There’s just a little left!”</p><p>“W-where, is it?” Longbottom stammered.</p><p>“Right thigh.”</p><p>“N-no... no thank you."</p><p>The older blokes turned their noses up to the conversation but Draco could see them watching through the corner of their eyes, even looking a tad disappointed when Harry removed his hands from his clothing.</p><p>The sorting ceremony was exciting for Draco. He hadn’t had a single doubt when he was sorted into Slytherin, but Scorpius was different. He of course hoped for Slytherin but would certainly show support for his only child no matter what house he was put in. While watching and clapping for the other new students he couldn’t help but consider each option.</p><p>He had always been very smart. Ravenclaw, had he not been so loyal to Slytherin, would be his genuine first hope for the boy. Slytherin of course would be the natural second. Scorpius was rather courteous and was raised to be a right gentleman so as much as he’d make a fuss vocally he would be thrilled for Scorpius to be a Gryffindor. Hufflepuff houses many good people, but he just didn’t see his son getting put there. If he was, he’d be totally on board of course, it was just the least likely of the four.</p><p>“Malfoy, Scorpius!” Headmistress McGonagall called proudly, even making a point of sending a smile to Draco.</p><p>Scorpius hurried up, ducking down as if afraid the hat would be too heavy for his neck. It was placed on and didn’t answer nearly as quickly as it did for the Hufflepuff that came before him. “The first Malfoy I’ve actually been sat on in years.” The hat whispered into his ear. “But, you’re clearly one house even still. Slytherin!”</p><p>Draco cheered extra loud for his son, getting a huge grin from him before he dashed off to join the Slytherins. Harry even gave him a small fist bump since they were sat beside each other.<br/>It was only two more students until “Potter, Albus” was called. He looked notably nervous. He even sat there for a while with the hat whispering to him. “You could do great things...” before Albus was just pleading for it to pick one. “Slytherin!” Was eventually called and Albus didn’t look as shocked as he was glad to get out of the middle of the whole school’s attention. Harry looked a little confused but forced a smile when he got elbowed.</p><p>The first weeks went pretty well. It wasn’t until Draco looked back at his new soul mark that he even remembered it was there. It hadn’t gone away and now looked as though it was finished forming all together. It was sharper than the one with Astoria. It had a more linear shape and vaguely resembled lighting.</p><p>He forced it to the back of his mind when he was interrupted very soon into the year by his son entering his personal living quarters. He was visibly distraught.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>“I think I’m getting my soul mark.” He cried quickly, “Father do they normally happen this young?”</p><p>“There is no normal-“ Draco answered, “but at eleven?”</p><p>“What do I do?”</p><p>“I don’t know! I didn’t get mine until I hit puberty.”</p><p>“Oh Merlin! Am I starting puberty?!”</p><p>Draco hugged his panicked son. “I can say with certainty that is not what’s happening.” They took a few deep breaths together. They’ve been dealing with each other’s panicky tendencies for long enough that it was easier to prevent them from getting to panic attack levels. “Are you sure it’s a soul mark and not a birthmark or something?”</p><p>“I can’t see it myself. It’s on my back.” He mumbled and got two fingers under his chin to make him make eye contact with Draco again. “Al pointed it out as I was getting changed.”</p><p>“Okay. Let me see it.”</p><p>Scorpius nodded and pulled his shirt off and turned. It was definitely a soul mark. It was also a rather linear one, but rounded off into swirls at the end of each little line.</p><p>“Oh. Maybe you were just destined to fall in love young. Happens sometimes.”</p><p>“What if I don’t like them?”</p><p>“Then this will change.” He ran his hand down Scorpius’s back. “It may seem like it, but these are not always permanent.”</p><p>Scorpius hugged him once more. “Okay. Thank you, Father. I love you.”</p><p>“I love you too."</p><p>And they separated for the night. Draco thought briefly about his own new mark and smiled at the thought of being able to fall in love again. The mark from Astoria was still mostly there and seemed to want to stay but he was okay with that.</p>
