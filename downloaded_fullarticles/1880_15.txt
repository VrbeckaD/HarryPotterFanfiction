    <p>
  <span>Lily was having a shit day. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>An absolute train wreck of a shit day; a kid from the daycare she worked at had projectile vomited on her shirt, her headphones had conveniently decided not to work, and she’d missed her bus </span>
  <em>
    <span>twice.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>So she had to take a forty minute walk without headphones, holding an Asda bag containing a vommed-down shirt. She wanted nothing more than to shower again, then sink down on the balcony floor and chain smoke with Sirius as she bitched about not finding any Flame dates and about the annoying children at the daycare. Because she was morally corrupt and in a pissy mood.</p>
<p>
  <span>As soon as she stepped foot inside hers and Sirius’ flat, she was met with the sound of shaky sobs. She couldn’t help but to groan. She didn’t want to groan, of course, she wanted to see what was wrong with Sirius, but another warm shower and a smoke sounded </span>
  <em>
    <span>so </span>
  </em>
  <span>much better.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily took a couple of deep breaths, dropped the bag with the vomit shirt on the ground, stuffed her keys in her pocket and kicked her shoes off as she hung up her coat on the hook. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She walked through the flat and knocked on Sirius’ door. The sobs didn’t stop though, nor did they become any quieter, so she assumed that he’d taken his hearing aids out. She pushed the door open and saw Sirius sitting on the edge of his bed, his fist in his mouth to quiet his sobs as he obsessively clicked on the power button on his phone. His hands were shaking and his leg kept bouncing up and down as he just clicked repeatedly. Lily didn’t see the screen turning on though, and she frowned as she took a step inside the room. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sirius?” she asked, her voice loud enough that Sirius would hear her if he had one of his hearing aids in. He flinched, but he didn’t look up. She took a few big steps into the room, then crouched down right in front of him and waved her hand. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His head snapped up, and he let out another sob when he saw her. Lily frowned.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>‘What’s going on?’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>she signed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sirius threw his phone down on the bed, then signed, </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘It’s not working,’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>with shaking hands.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?” Lily said, then realized that Sirius couldn’t hear her that well, and signed it instead. Sirius shook his head, sniffling and wiping his face. </span>
</p>
<p>“I don’t know, I don’t know, it’s not turning on,” he said it out loud, his voice progressively getting louder with every word. “I need to listen to music and I obviously can't do it without my phone and it’s not turning and-,” another sob cut him off.</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily hopped up on the bed and sat down beside him, putting her arm over his shoulders. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>‘I’ll call Remus and the phone company for you,’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>she signed it clumsily with one hand, but Sirius must’ve understood anyways, because he nodded and leaned against Lily’s shoulder, still sniffling. Lily pulled her phone out of her pocket, and decided to call Remus first.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She pressed her phone against her ear, holding with up with her shoulder as she rubbed her eyes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Remus picked up almost immediately, and the first thing that Lily heard was a very rushed sentence that almost sounded like, “Is Sirius okay?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?” Lily grabbed her phone with her hand again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sirius. He’s not answering my Facetime calls, is he okay?” Remus said, slower this time. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, yeah. His phone’s not turning on though. I think he's having a panic attack or something and needs music,” Lily put her free hand in Sirius’ hair and started scratching his scalp in some half arsed attempt to calm him down.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Is his phone dead or what’s going on with it?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t know, Re,” Lily said. “He just said that it’s not turning on.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I-. Okay, okay. He’s alright and it’s just his phone,” Remus muttered, and Lily was sure that he was just reassuring himself. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“</span>
  </em>
  <span>I guess I’m coming over tonight then, instead of us going to the cinema.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, no shit,” Lily said. “Look, I have to terp the call with the phone company so we can fix this, but I’ll see you later.”</span>
</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Remus said. “Yeah, see you.”</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily hung up the phone, then poked Sirius’ shoulder. He looked up at her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Remus is on his way,’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>she signed. Sirius let out a sigh of relief and nodded.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Good,’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>he signed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily looked up the number for Sirius’ phone company, then put the phone on speaker, listening to the annoying tune of the queue music. Her stomach grumbled, and she groaned again. She wanted to ask Sirius to make dinner, but she needed him with her as she talked. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>After waiting for ten whole minutes - ten minutes that she should’ve spent in the shower or on the balcony - the tech guide finally picked up.</span>
</p>
<p>“Hello, this is James speaking, thank you for holding. How may I help you today?” Lily let out a large breath at the voice and gestured for Sirius to sit upright.</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey, so.. Er,” she mentally cursed herself for being socially awkward in the worst situations. “My friend’s phone isn’t turning on.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh,” the tech guide, James, said. “Describe the problem.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Uh, well,” Lily said. “It’s not turning on.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes, you said that,” the guy let out a chuckle. “Did it just… Randomly stop working? Like you haven’t dropped it or gotten water in it?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily signed the question to Sirius, who shook his head. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>‘It worked fine this morning, and then it just turned off. It was fully charged and everything,’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>Sirius signed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You still there?” James asked. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, sorry,” Lily said. “My friend’s pretty much deaf so I’m terping for him. He says that it worked fine this morning and then just shut off, fully charged and everything.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What does he- Okay no, nevermind,” James said. “So no former struggle with the phone?”</span>
</p>
<p>“No, and he needs it to listen to music through his hearing aids,” Lily explained. “They’re bluetooth connected.”</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Oh, </span>
  </em>
  <span>that’s something I didn’t know. Interesting,” James hummed. “Right, er… Have you tried turning it on and off again?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily stared down at her phone in disbelief. She had just told him that the phone was pointedly </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>turning on, and he suggested to turn it on anyways.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Are you fucking joking?” she said it somewhat calmly, albeit a bit shrill, even though she wanted to yell. She wanted to fucking scream into the abyss and never call anyone again. “The phone is </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>turning on, and we can therefore not try to turn it on and then off again.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right. Right, of course,” James said. “Er… Have you tried connecting it to a power source?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily facepalmed. An actual, hard slap against her face, which even stung a little. Sirius frowned at her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Tech guide is being a dick,’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>she signed, then took a deep breath. “Is it your goddamn goal in life to be an annoying dick? I have described the problem - the phone turned off, fully charged, and now it’s not turning on again.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Look, lady-,” the tech guide said, but Lily cut him off.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Evans.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“My name is Lily Evans. Don’t call me lady,” she almost hissed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Look, Evans. I’m just following procedure as I can’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>see </span>
  </em>
  <span>the problem,” James said. “You’ll have to come into one of our stores and they’ll help you better than I am right now, okay?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Right,” Lily sighed. “Thank you for trying to help, sorry if I was rude. Bye.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Have a n-,” Lily clicked off the call before he could finish the sentence. She groaned and turned to Sirius. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>‘I’m going to shower and then I’ll have to take your phone to the store,’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>she signed. Sirius frowned and swallowed hard. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Didn’t the guide help?’</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>‘No. I’ll fix it though. Don’t worry.’</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>
  <span>The guy in the phone store had been a downright dickhead, even worse than James-The-Phone-Guide, and hadn’t even tried to help. He’d only taken half a look at Sirius’ phone, then said “Buy a new one.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Which Lily obviously did, despite the fact that neither she nor Sirius could really afford it. She just didn’t have the energy to do anything else about it. All she had wanted all day was a peaceful smoke on her balcony.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And now, after the worst day in history, she was </span>
  <em>
    <span>finally </span>
  </em>
  <span>sitting on her balcony, cigarette in hand as she swiped left on every person that came up on Flame. They were all far too shallow, some with requirements in their goddamn profiles, which just made it worse.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Amelia, 23, London. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Left.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Gilderoy, 21, London. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Left.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Susan, 25, Manchester. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Hard fucking left. Lily wasn’t going to date someone in Manchester. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>James, 24, London. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Lef—</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily stilled mid swipe, and stared at the profile. The guy was cute. Hot, even. Dark skin, a mess of black hair, square glasses. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily took a drag from her cigarette and read through the profile.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>James, 24, London.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Bisexual. I would say I like long walks on the beach, but I really don’t. I’d rather eat curry and play football. Or annoy people on the phone.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Phone service/tech guide. I suck, I know. I’m sorry.</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Some would say that I’m a mummy’s boy, and to that I say, “You’re absolutely fucking right.”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>I like Debussy, if you know what I mean ;) (That’s a joke, I just love classical music. Honestly, catch me bopping to classical music on our first date)</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Lily snorted and swiped right. The profile wasn’t that funny, but funny enough to get her attention.</span>
</p>
<p>She stubbed out her cigarette and went back inside, finding Sirius and Remus on the sofa, trying to set up the former’s phone.</p>
<p>And that was when it dawned on her that she’d probably swiped right on James-The-Phone-Guide.</p>
