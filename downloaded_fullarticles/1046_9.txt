    <p>
  <span>The Winchester's were a perfectly normal family, living in 85 Street Saint Margaret's Road in the Scotswood District. Normal, if you count a single witch mother and witch daughter as normal. Normal doesn't always mean perfect, although they were perfectly normal. They were the last people you expected to be involved in something as intricate as a prophecy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rizah was the owner of a small local bakery down in Diagon Alley, providing for her small daughter and creating a loving environment for all who walked in. Rizah was a very short woman with plump cheeks and boy-cut hair that barely was long enough to run her slender fingers through. Her daughter, Estelle, was the polar opposite of her mother's appearance. Tall, almost as tall as her mother by the age of 10, lanky, and long, dark hair down to the small of her back. The only thing Estelle shared with her mother in appearance was her eyes. Valley green with glittering gold orbs hidden behind the rolling hills of colour. Estelle’s eyes were nearly cat-like seeming to glow in the dark to see when walking in any area with little to no light. The Winchester's had a small screech owl named Link, to whom could do no wrong in their eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Winchester's had a secret, a secret only few knew about. They didn't think they would know what to do if anyone had found out and spread it like another family's “secret”. Estelle was tied to a prophecy her grandfather had told her mother about on his deathbed. Her grandfather was a distant relative Estelle never got to meet. Unbeknownst to her grandfather or mother's knowledge, she was pregnant at the time with a set of twins. Estelle’s sister was given to her father.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rizah kept Estelle locked away, exposing her slowly to the Muggle world and all its creations. She gave Estelle all her knowledge of both worlds, although she excelled at magic. Learning spells that weren't in her future curriculum although she was wandless. She became very advanced from the time she discovered she could do magic to current day. Every day she became more advanced and more interested in learning. She almost always spent half of her allowance on books about several different magical subjects and chocolate frogs. (She always loses half of them though, despite them only having one good hop in them) She got many different subjects of books, including Herbology, Magical Creatures, Potions, Charms, History of Magic, Transfiguration, and even Defense Against The Dark Arts. She ended up being very talented with Potions and Transfiguration. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That brings us to the present day, the day Estelle gets her letter and our story begins...</span>
