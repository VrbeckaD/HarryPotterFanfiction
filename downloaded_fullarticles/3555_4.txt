    <p>Everyone from the second year up was surprised to see that Professor McGonagall did not put away the Sorting Hat once the last of the new first years had joined their house table. Instead Dumbledore rose to his feet and clapped his hands softly together to get everyone’s attention.</p><p>“As the holidays will have no doubt dulled your powers of observation, I shall point out that we have a new member of staff this year,” – he extended a hand to the goateed man at the end of the staff table, who removed his cigar from his mouth and waved it in greeting to the students, - “Professor Ives is our new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, although a native of Scotland, he was educated in America which means he does not have a House here at Hogwarts. In order to make him feel truly a part of the school, he will now be Sorted.”</p><p>A rapid whispering filled the hall as students expressed surprise, and asked each other if an adult had every been Sorted before. As the new professor rose to his feet and offered the headmaster a small bow the ghosts provided the answer; no, this had never happened before. The portrait frames were filled to bursting as the painted inhabitants of the castle jostled for room to witness Hogwarts history in the making.</p><p>Necks were craned and toes stood on tips so curious eyes could take a good look at the latest wizard to take on the ill-fated Defence Against the Dark Arts position. Professor Ives’ cigar vanished in a swirl of smoke as he walked with an efficient clipped gait to the stool at the front of the hall. He was not much taller than McGonagall with dark collar length hair; his unusual robes drew a fair number of appreciative glances as he flicked the thigh length tails behind him to sit on the stool. Everyone recognized the anxious glance he cast as McGonagall lowered the battered Sorting Hat on to his head, they had all been there, all had felt that uncertain thrill as their future in Hogwarts was decided.</p><p>At the Gryfindor table James turned his head and whispered to the taller boy leaning on his shoulder; “What do you reckon Sirius? Think we’ll get him?”</p><p>“Hope so, might be useful to have a Defence teacher in house.”</p><p>From across the table Remus gave a low whistle and jerked his head toward the Sorting Hat; “Think its ready.”</p><p>The Hat was ready, in a loud clear voice it announced; “RAVENCLAW!”</p>
