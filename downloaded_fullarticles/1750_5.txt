    <p>Any hope that she had that one of her loves had survived was killed as she stared at the casket sitting in front of her.  She knew that if Severus were alive, no matter if he was close to death he would have been there next to her as their love was interned and laid to rest. To see that casket holding the other piece of her heart just brought everything crashing down.</p><p>What happened next was the final nail in the coffin…</p><p>The weeks following the war were unimaginable for Hermione and the rest of the surviving members of The Order of the Phoenix as well as the rest of Wizarding Britain.  After the fall of Voldemort the remaining Death Eaters at the scene seem to have been struck down by an unseen force.  It seems that old Voldy thought that if he fell this time, all of his followers deserved to be caught and imprisoned or put to death.   It was like a tidal wave of wizards and witches falling to the ground with confounded looks upon their faces.  While death would have certainly been worse for his followers, many of them would be going to Azkaban this time without the option of claiming they were imperused.<br/>
When Hermione finally had the chance to turn around and look at all of the people that they had lost she felt something die within her.  Lying out seemingly so peaceful were the bodies of Tonks and Remus, Fred, Colin Creevey, Oliver Wood and many others. These were people that she grew up with, that she loved. One body was missing and she knew that her chance of finding him, saying goodbye and laying him to rest at last would never happen.</p><p>“What a terrible loss, I had so hoped that Mr. Lupin would have survived this war along with Nymphadora.  After such a tragic childhood and painful life, it is unfortunate he could not enjoy the future that his sacrifices and losses have brought.”</p><p>One voice she had never hoped to hear again in her lifetime came from behind her. Albus Dumbledore.  If she could have possibly imagined this moment and she was amazingly unsurprised by it, she never would have imagined it happening here of all places.  It took a deep calming breath, a stiffening of her shoulders and the occluding of her mind to turn around and face the man that everyone had believed to be dead for the last year.</p><p>“Professor Dumbledore, how kind of you to be here today to say goodbye to our dear friends. Hermione paused and continued, however I didn’t expect for you to be addressing them on this side of the veil.  I guess we all imagined that you would have been greeting them on the other side as you did Harry”.</p><p>“Ah.. Ms. Granger,  how good it is to see you again but unfortunately under such terrible circumstances. Professor Dumbledore exclaimed his eyes somber but still twinkling. I was so relieved to hear that you, Mr. Weasley and Harry survived your run in with Tom.”</p><p>“Yes we were fortunate to survive our as you said, run in with Tom and Bellatrix, the fucking Horcruxes and the Hallows”” We’ve had just a terrific seventh year” Hermione muttered fully looking the meddlesome wizard in his face.</p><p>“Yes, I do understand that the three of you have had a difficult time this past year.” Dumbledore said quietly but still looking incredibly full of himself.</p><p>“A difficult time, Hermione sneered her voice low. I believe that it was more than a difficult time for not only the three of us but also the other people affected by this war. We thought you were dead; her voice began rising. We thought that Professor Snape had murdered you. You sent three teenagers off on a wild goose chase looking for objects that you knew where they were as well as what they were. You left the most obtuse hints of the Hallows finishing the war.”  Losing steam Hermione finished her rant.</p><p>“My dear, I had every faith in the three of you completing your mission. You must understand that I could not reveal all of the plans to Harry with his connection to Lord Voldemort, or the rest of the order. I had not intended to become ill that year and once I knew that Draco had been ordered to kill me and for Professor Snape to complete the task should he fail, it was just the logical decision to keep certain things unknown and to continue with the plan to fake my own death.</p><p> “Yes that would be the logical approach Professor. Hermione agreed with another sneer worthy of Snape.  In war though, specifically this war, Logic doesn’t seem to have come into play very much.” </p><p>“Excuse me Ms. Granger? a surprised sounding Dumbledore questioned.  Every plan that was made, every order carried out was for the greater good. We succeeded in defeating one of the most evil Wizards of all time.”</p><p>“The Greater Good of who professor? Hermione questioned. If you knew what he had done, if you knew that they were, why did you not destroy them? Why did you send children to do your work? How could you willingly let so many people die?  You knew he would go after the wand. You wanted Snape dead. Why?  What do you have to gain with his death?” breathing heavily Hermione gasped out.</p><p>“You”, Dumbledore simply said.  </p><p>“Me?” Hermione questioned looking confused. </p><p>“Yes Ms. Granger, I know that you are the brightest witch of your age and extremely powerful in your own right, I wanted you and Harry together and I wanted him to continue to naively follow my instructions and my tutelage.  I can mold him into the perfect politician. With you by our side everyone will take notice and listen.</p><p>“But why Professor Snape?  Just speaking his name caused her heart to break just a bit more.  She didn’t think it was possible. Why would you set him up like that? Force him to cast the killing curse, making everyone hate him and distrust him, you set him up to take your wand so that either Harry or Voldemort would go after him and then you still tasked him with telling Harry he had to die.  Why did you want him dead so badly and what does it have to do with me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Severus didn’t know that I could see them because he wasn’t aware that one of my particular talents is to see binding strings.  Dumbledore seemed to pause for effect. His and Mr. Lupin’s were lit all through their schooling until Sirius Black decided to introduce Severus to the Wolf. That may have been just a little suggestion that I might have passed along. He murmured more to himself sounding more than a bit pleased. I thought that that would be the end of it. So I then decided to invite Mr. Lupin back to Hogwarts to teach and also to help keep an eye out for Harry, with the amount of disdain Severus held for Mr. Lupin I had no worries. The reappearance of the Wolf and the friendship of Mr. Lupin and Mr. Black just seemed to cinch the break once again at the end of your third year.  Little did I know Mr. Lupin was going to see Severus before he left.”</p><p>“But what do they have to do with me?’  She knew of course but she wanted Dumbledore the arsehole to confirm it.</p><p>“Don’t think that I can’t read you Miss Granger” You may be a pretty good Occulemens but I am a far better Legilimins, if you need me to say it, you were their third”.</p>
