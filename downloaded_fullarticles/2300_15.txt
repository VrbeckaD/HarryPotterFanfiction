    <p>The warmth of night seeped in through the cracks and gaps in the walls and the tarp tacked over the window.  Outside the moon was full, a pale disk suspended from the Stygian arch of the sky.  Admiral Sal Salinas, the Nereid of Nassau, tossed and turned in her bed, belly sloshing with grog and Merlin knew what else.  Rum.  She needed more rum, not that watered-down swill Hagrid favored.<br/>
Alas, there was none to be found in her cabin.<br/>
Sal snatched up her beech wood wand and summoned a bottle, which she uncorked with relish.  As she drank she realized—or perhaps remembered—that someone else was tangled up in her sheets.<br/>
The woman in her bed stirred and opened one large, dark eye.  “Ah, hello there…you,” said Sal.<br/>
“It’s Narcissa,” said the woman, with some asperity.<br/>
“Sorry, love.  I’ve been properly marinated since midday.  Did we pick you up in Port Royal?”<br/>
“Close, Admiral.  I’m a gunner on the Dog Star.  We’ve met before.”<br/>
“Oh!  The captain’s cousin, then?  Aren’t you married?”<br/>
“My husband died at sea last year.  You were on the ship.”<br/>
“My sincerest condolences, dear Narcissa.  Perhaps I shall sink a Navy ship in his honor.”<br/>
“You already did.  Several, in fact, with Captain Sirius.”<br/>
Sal grinned, teeth like pearls, pristine in the gloaming.  “You’re right!  Oh, do wipe that sour look from your face, love.  I’m still quite lashed.”<br/>
“That I can see.”<br/>
“Please, know that my memory’s usually better than this.  Yes, I remember your husband, Lucius, your captain’s boatswain.  And I know you and your son, Draco.  Yes, it’s all coming back to me now.  He’s just twenty, yes, just eight years my junior?  Oh, he wouldn’t like this much at all, would he?  Fancy a drink?”<br/>
“To your health, Admiral.”<br/>
“And to yours.”<br/>
As Narcissa fell to dreaming, Sal burst out onto the deck, bottle in one hand, an orange in the other.  “Merlin’s beard, you do know you’re supposed to peel it before you eat it, Sal,” said a voice by the ship’s railing.  Hermione Granger, her first mate, came forth and sloughed off the fragrant rind.  “Why on earth have you been drinking?  You’re to meet with Admiral Minerva come sunrise.  She’s never taken kindly to your antics.”<br/>
“Not true, not true at all!  She found them quite adorable when I was a child.  In any case, I would hardly refer my penchant for drink as <em>antics</em>.  Mother Min loves her rum as much as any other pirate.”<br/>
“You haven’t seen your foster mother in three years.  You may have forgotten your gentle breeding but I can assure you she has not.”<br/>
Sal brandished her wand and upturned the now-empty rum bottle.  “A disenchanted, disgraced noblewoman shouldn’t scold a fosterling who only followed in her footsteps.  The Captain of the Dog Star did much the same, did he not?”<br/>
“Sirius is still under the command of the Silver Fleet.  <em>You</em> left and took some of her best captains along with you.  But not all of this is about you.  Not everything is about you.  There are the Deathly Hallows to think of.  The fleets must unite if we’re to have at least a chance of finding them.  There is a <em>war<em> going on, in case you’ve forgotten.  How is it to end if we do nothing about it?”</em></em><br/>
Sal ruffled the dark, gleaming snakes of her hair and cast a gimlet eye at her first mate.  Only Hermione ever spoke to her this way; she was the only member of the Laughing Tippler’s crew who wasn’t afraid to do so.  Most days, Sal adored her for it.  Most days, but not today.  “We don’t even know if the Deathly Hallows are real!” she cried.  “If this journey yields naught we’ll be the laughing stock of the pirate world.”<br/>
“If we don’t embark on this journey we’ll likely end up <em>dead</em>.”  Hermione waved her own wand, setting the dancing rum bottle on the planks.  “Quite petty of you, to steal one of Sirius’s shipmates,” she said.<br/>
“Nonsense, darling, utter nonsense,” said Sal, grasping at the change of subject.  “I’m no kidnapper.  I’m no rogue.  Narcissa came here of her own volition.  We’ve long since had our fun.  She’ll return to her captain forthwith.”<br/>
“You should go back to bed, Admiral.  The hour is late.”</p><p>Wherever she went, Admiral Minerva McGonagall arrived like a shift in the weather, a storm or a sea-borne breeze as befit her mood.  She was a woman as elegant as she was imperious, whose bouts of quiet rage—seldom though they were—instilled fear in all who knew her.  Of all her foster children, Sal and Sirius had been her favorites, her darling protégées in the courts of England and Spain and later on the open waters of the Caribbean.  The woman loved as fiercely as she censured.  Sal dreaded her arrival as much as she craved it.<br/>
“Alright?” said Hermione, adjusting Sal’s tightly-laced crimson vest and matching hair-ribbon.  <em>Red is your color, my little beauty</em>, her foster mother had said.  <em>Wear it with pride</em>.  Sal swatted Hermione’s hand.  Minerva loathed fussing of any sort.<br/>
“Am I bloody fucking alright?” she hissed through her teeth.  “Of course not.  She’s about to board.  It’s a veiled insult, you know.  She’ll never let me back onto <em>her</em> ship.”<br/>
“Deep breaths, Sal.  You’ll be just fine.”<br/>
A few minutes later Sal met Minerva at the gangplank.  “Welcome to my ship, Admiral,” she said.  “You look well.”<br/>
“Hello, Salacia,” said the Admiral, ice in her tone.  “The Laughing Tippler, is it?  A charming name.  Yes, how very charming.”  At her side loomed Sirius the Black, tall and dark and devilishly handsome.  Sal paid him no heed but grinned at his first mate, Harry.<br/>
“Let us retire to my cabin and discuss terms, shall we?”<br/>
“Hold a moment, little songbird.”<br/>
Sal held her tongue.  Minerva would not call her Admiral, for she did not consider her such.<br/>
Her foster mother’s oval face was serene, the lines on her skin beautifully set, emphasizing the delicate features.  Wisps of silver-strewn black hair fluttered in the wind.  Her eyes were sharp and vibrant as she cast them about the ship.  Minerva McGonagall was the Lady of the Seas, King George’s Bane.  One had only to look upon her to know it.  “Before we speak, I must insist on meeting and inspecting your crew,” she said.<br/>
Sal fought back a wave of nausea.</p>
