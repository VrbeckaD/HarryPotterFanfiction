  <b>Prologue</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>From a very young age, Tonraq and Senna knew there was something different about their daughter. Sure, there was the whole hyperactive thing, but they figured that could just be a kid being a kid. It was little things, like when they would get calls from the police that Korra had somehow magically found herself inside the polar bear exhibit at the zoo, or had just about taken off a teacher’s head when she threw a book at her (“It just flew off the shelf, I swear!”). Okay, maybe not so little, but being Korra’s parents meant having the principal on speed dial. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Naturally, they didn’t believe it when Korra received the letter, stating she was to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. They figured it was just her way of acting up because she didn’t want graduate her current grade and go to the next school. However, when a bald, middle-aged man donned in purple robes appeared on their doorstep, it was hard for them to deny that the whole thing wasn’t a prank. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Diagon Alley was amazing, the only downside to the trip being Senna bought Korra an owl when she really wanted a dog. “Dog’s aren’t allowed,” her mother explained repeatedly, only to have her daughter pout and look away. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Regardless, Korra loved her owl: a large barn owl she named Sir Screech-a-lot (“Sir” for short). After her very first night of Hogwarts, she sent Sir home, explaining that she’d been sorted into Gryffindor and how the feast had been wonderful and she’d even started making friends with an odd, quiet kid on the train. Things were off to a good start.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>______________________________________________________________________________</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>By her second year, she had made three friends: Asami, a pure-blood Ravenclaw; Mako, a half-blood Slytherin; and Mako’s first year brother Bolin, a very enthusiastic Hufflepuff. They truly were a sight to behold as they started taking Hogwarts by force - every stray stink pellet seemed to be traced back to them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Korra found a dog on the grounds one day: only a puppy. It was small and white and, unable to resist, she snuck it in her back up to her dorm. Her roommates were good enough at keeping it quiet but after a few months, as the dog (which she’d named Naga) started growing, it became harder to sneak her enough food and clean up after her. Finally, tipped off by a jealous Gryffindor, Headmaster Tenzin discovered it. He had a long argument with the stubborn girl before finally agreeing to allow the dog to live on the grounds, where the gamekeeper could help watch over her. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>______________________________________________________________________________</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was during their third year that the group started gaining the most power. Straddling the line between old enough to be popular and young enough to be blown off as annoying kids, they were just able to find their true spot on the popular side. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Everybody </span>
  </em>
  <span>knew about Korra’s group - who had started going by Team Avatar (it was Asami’s idea; Korra didn’t really understand it). The trips to Hogsmeade made it only too easy for them to start expanding their horizons - they mapped secret corridors and found ways to be able to set off fireworks in the Great Hall while lounging in their dorms. Bolin introduced them to the house-elves in the kitchens and they befriended them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>During this year, Korra, inspired by Asami, started playing Quidditch. Asami was a natural, having been raised by a father who made some of the best brooms in all the Wizarding World. The Ravenclaw team had such an advantage with her as Seeker that she insisted on being moved to Keeper so the other teams would have a chance. Korra became an excellent Gryffindor Chaser - almost as good as Asami. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bolin was infatuated by Quidditch but never tried to make the team; Mako claimed he would rather build his skills before trying out. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>______________________________________________________________________________</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fourth year was when tragedy struck. Mako and Bolin had been living on the streets since their parents died back when Bolin was no more than a baby. Even though they now had Hogwarts to house them the majority of the year, summers were still dangerous for the orphans, as had been proven when, in early July, Bolin became the victim of a rampant werewolf attack. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Senna and Tonraq took the boys into their home for the remainder of summers to come. Even with the new parental figures and his optimistic outlook on life, Bolin fell into depression. On full moons he was forced to hide in fear of hurting his friends. Team Avatar took this concern to Headmaster Tenzin, who admitted there was nothing he could do to stop the transformation. He wouldn’t say it outloud, but it was obvious he was just grateful the boy was alive.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bolin was forced to spend the days around the full moon in the Haunted House in Hogsmeade, which soon came to be known as the Shrieking Shack, due to the screaming that could be heard. Rumors started flying around the school of the monster that resided in the Shrieking Shack, none of which that made Bolin feel any better about himself.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And that’s when Asami got her brilliant idea: an idea so forbidden that only she could’ve thought of it; so reckless only Korra could’ve agreed it it; so dangerous that only Mako could’ve made the final call, his face grim as he looked upon his two friends’ and said, his voice low for fear of being overheard,</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“When do we start?”  </span>
