    <p>Scorpius was always easily excited. One thing Albus loved about him.<br/>“I have four weeks to practice, then the new captain will decide who he’ll pick for the team. Oh, and there will be a test game. It’s on 12th October. You’ll come, right? I’ll make it, I know it. I mean I know it because I already was in the team last year… well in another reality but it was still me… kind of, you know?!” Scorpius couldn’t stop.<br/>“Scorp, calm down.” Albus laughed. “They can be glad to have you in their team and they will realize that as soon as they see you playing.” Albus smiled. <br/>It had felt so good to be with Scorpius again after these endless summer holidays with his family. <br/>“Of course, I’ll come.”<br/>Scorpius had practiced whenever he had free time. Five other Slytherins volunteered as Chaser but only one would be taken. Scorpius and an older boy were the last ones standing. The decision was made during the test game. First the other guy played 20 minutes then it was Scorpius’ turn. It had been a rainy day. It was autumn and storms were nothing unusual.<br/>Albus sat alone some rows above a small cheering crowd. They came to support the other boy. Albus was almost unable to see what was happening in the clouds. Albus had probably been more nervous than Scorpius. A familiar feeling came up… a feeling that he hoped he wouldn’t feel so soon again. Fear. The fear of Scorpius getting hurt. The fear of losing him. Getting hurt during a Quidditch match happened regularly. His throat tightened. His heart was racing, and he was shaking. Panic rose within him. That was the first time he begged that Scorpius wouldn’t make it into the team. He knew that wasn’t right. It felt like betraying him and he knew that was selfish, but if Scorpius was really picked as Chaser he wouldn’t know how to survive the Quidditch season.<br/>Relived that Scorpius landed on the ground in one piece, Albus went down. Scorpius was grinning and totally soaked.<br/>“What do you think? Am I gonna make it?” Scorpius asked Albus as he waited for the Slytherin Captain to announce his decision. <br/>“Oh, Albus… you look really pale. What’s wrong?” Scorpius asked worried.<br/>Albus only shook his head. “I’m fine.”<br/>Scorpius now looked even more worried, knowing exactly that he wasn’t.<br/>“Soo…. Here we are. Congratulation Malfoy. You’re our new Chaser.” The Slytherin Captain shook his hand.<br/>Albus mouth fell open. ‘Oh no.’ He thought.</p><p>As the others had left, he was pulled into a wet hug.<br/>“I can’t believe it! That’s amazing!” Scorpius shouted. “Aren’t you happy for me?” He asked, staring at Albus as he didn’t response.<br/>Albus forced himself to smile. “Of course, I’m happy for you!”<br/>“Doesn’t sound like it.” Scorpius said sceptically.<br/>“I do mean it… I just don’t feel well. Sorry.” Albus looked down.<br/>“Here.” Scorpius pulled out some chocolate. “Eat this.” <br/>Albus did as he was told. It revealed its effect pretty soon and Albus felt better.<br/>“Let’s get you inside.” Scorpius smiled and put an arm around him, leading him into the castle.<br/>In the middle of their sixth year, Albus and Scorpius had been so close – also physically. Being close became as normal as breathing. And Albus wanted to be close to Scorpius. He used every chance to hug him or softly push and pull him whenever he teased him. They faced mountains of paperwork, endless lessons and annoying classmates, but they had each other. It was them against the world.</p><p>When Albus first saw Scorpius in his green Quidditch uniform, he blushed hard. <br/>“How am I looking?!” Scorpius asked proud.<br/>Albus couldn’t remember a word. He didn’t want to know how stupid his expression must have looked.<br/>“Albus?!” Scorpius raised an eyebrow. “Can’t be that bad…”<br/>He totally misinterpreted Albus’ expression.<br/>“You’ll probably get a date with whoever you want after that match…” Albus didn’t know why he said that but it was too late to take it back.<br/>Scorpius’ face dropped, and he bit his lip. “Well… I don’t think so.”</p><p>One night, Scorpius had woken Albus. He had missed dinner. During O.W.L.’s year, Scorpius often missed dinner, because he was absorbed by the exam preparation. Albus would usually save him some food or drag him out of the Library into the Great Hall. But this time he missed dinner himself, because of another detention.<br/>“Albus… pssstt… ALBUS!” Scorpius woke him by shaking him.<br/>Albus woke with Scorpius inches from his face.<br/>“Albus let’s get some leftovers in the kitchen… pleeeese I can’t sleep. I need some pancakes or anything else. I’d kill for pancakes right now…”<br/>Albus just woke and gowned by the flood of words.<br/>“I don’t have the invisible cloak anymore. I needed to give it back to James, remember?!” He responded sleepy.<br/>“Please.” Scorpius pulled on his arm.<br/>“I’m just trough with detention.” Albus mumbled into his pillow, tightly holding onto his bed.<br/>Scorpius let go. “Fine. I’ll go myself.” He threw a pullover on and was about to leave.<br/>“Hey! Wait. Idiot. Do you think I’ll let you leave alone?!” Albus got up. </p><p>On one hand, Hogwarts was a huge place with uncountable hidden corners and rooms, on the other hand it could feel like the tiniest place on earth. As soon as the classroom door closed, and the lesson started, you were locked away with a small number of students as in every other school: <br/>The next they had a Transfigurations lesson with Ravenclaw. McGonagall was late for class, which was unusual so there was enough time for gossip:<br/>“Melinda told us, she saw you two on your date last night.” A Ravenclaw girl giggled and she immediately got all the attention of the whole class.<br/>“We were not!” Albus shouted in rage. This had been the wrong reaction.<br/>“Better you do it in the kitchen than in our dorm.” A Slytherin boy said, and everyone laughed.<br/>“We just missed dinner and got something to eat, because we were hungry.” Scorpius said calm and continued reading. Albus couldn’t understand how he could stay that calm.<br/>“Oh come on, you stick together 24/7, and you hardly can keep your hands of each other. We’re not blind, Lovebirds.” Another Ravenclaw boy responded and overdramatically pulled the girl next to him into a hug to stress what he meant. The whole class burst into laughter. <br/>Albus got up, ready to punch that guy right into his face. Scorpius now looked up from his book, blushing. He pulled on Albus arm, signalizing him to sit down again. <br/>“Albus, just let them talk.” He said quiet. <br/>Albus violently pulled his arm out of Scorpius’ grip. <br/>“Scorpius you’re turning red.” The Slytherin girl noticed. <br/>“Stop it!” Albus addressed the others.<br/>“Or what? Slytherin squib.” The Ravenclaw boy provocatively raised an eyebrow. <br/>Albus clenched his wand.<br/>“You…” He pointed his wand towards him.<br/>Now the boy got up and took out his wand as well. He was confident. <br/>“You don’t dare, …fag.” <br/>“Expellia…” Albus was determined to hurt him, but the boy reacted much quicker.<br/>“Flipendo!” The boy said loudly and Albus hit the wall. <br/>Now the Ravenclaws cheered.<br/>Scorpius rushed over to Albus.<br/>“Leave me alone.” Albus said and got up. He ran out of the classroom. In that very moment McGonagall entered. He ran passed her.<br/>“Mr. Potter!” She called after him, but he didn’t stop. </p><p>The rest of the day, Albus skipped classes. Scorpius knew quiet well that it was better to leave Albus some space, but they barely fought, so it didn’t leave Scorpius unaffected. He hated it when Albus acted so cold. He shivered as he remembered the last time Albus acted like that: Harry had forced him to stay separated from Scorpius for days and he tried to follow his father’s orders. Scorpius swallowed and forced himself to think about something else.</p><p>In the evening Scorpius couldn’t wait any longer. He left the Library and went into the Slytherin Common Room ready to confront his best friend about what happened. To his surprise he wasn’t there. So, there could only be one place where Albus was. Scorpius made his was up to the Astronomy Tower. Meanwhile it had started to pour on the glass roof. The staircase seemed endless. As he reached the top, Albus sat at a window and watched the thunder outside.<br/>“Albus, can we talk?” Scorpius asked.<br/>Albus shortly looked at him and then back out of the window. <br/>“I fear you have to face another detention.” Scorpius weakly smiled and slowly went over. <br/>Albus didn’t react.<br/>“I’ve wrote down a summary of the last lessons.” <br/>Still no response.<br/>“Albus, listen. They are stupid idiots. They always were. We have us, right?! That’s all that counts.” Scorpius reached out for Albus. <br/>“Don’t touch me!” Albus pulled his arm away.<br/>“So, what?! Let them talk. They are always talking! Anyway, THIS isn’t as bad as the Voldemort’s child rumours about me.” Scorpius said angry.<br/>“IT IS FOR ME!” Albus shouted and the words echoed in the tower.<br/>Those words immediately cut Scorpius off. He made several steps back, turned around and ran down the stairs. It hit him harder than he expected. Albus knew that he had hurt him with those words.</p><p> </p><p>After their fight, they didn’t talk for days. To Scorpius it felt like ages. In opposite to Albus, he buried himself in all kind of books to abstract himself from their fighting, the bullies and from something else…  Of course, they didn’t fight forever, but Albus had consciously physically distanced himself from Scorpius because of their classmate’s rumours. <br/>Ever since the escalation in class, which had been several weeks ago by now, Scorpius did question his sexuality. He hadn’t give it much thought until that point. It was just natural to be around Albus, to be with him, to hug him. But now, all that was gone and this time, unlike during their fourth year, it was Albus own decision and not his dad’s orders. <br/>‘How could Albus take that feeling?’ Scorpius wondered. It killed him.</p><p> </p><p>One late Saturday night, Scorpius slowly made his way back from the Library to his dorm. Everyone was in their Common Room to spent time with their friends. Hogwarts was actually full of variety and tolerance, but there wasn’t one gay couple. Scorpius wondered who he could possibly talk to about his feelings and why that was such a taboo topic even in a place like Hogwarts. He slowly passed a huge stone wall which suddenly formed into a small door. Scorpius looked around. He had passed that wall uncountable times and he was a hundred percent sure that there had never been a door. He slowly opened it and sneaked in. <br/>“Hello?” He asked unsure.<br/>The room was very small and empty, except for one portrait. Scorpius hesitated but entered and closed the door behind him. As he stood in front of the empty portrait, he suddenly saw someone entering it.<br/>“Professor Dumbledore?” He asked unbelieving.<br/>The former headmaster was never to find anywhere else than in McGonagall’s or Harry’s office – that was an open secret. <br/>“Good evening Mr. Malfoy.” Dumbledore said kind. <br/>“You… you know me?” Scorpius asked perplexed.<br/>“I am still part of the school life here, even if you may not see me.” He smiled. “Is there anything you’d like to get off your chest?” <br/>“Sir, I’m not sure if you’re the person… ehhh portrait that can help me.” Scorpius admitted.<br/>“Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.” Dumbledore raised an eyebrow.<br/>As Scorpius thought about it he remembered a chapter in Dumbledore’s biography that was written by Rita Skeeter. It was never confirmed, but the rumours were that Dumbledore had been in love with Gallert Grindelwald. He was willing to give it a try:<br/>“It’s about love… I guess.” Scorpius started, but didn’t know how to continue.<br/>“I fear you have to be more precisely.” <br/>“Ehhh… I think something is wrong with me.” Scorpius looked unsure at the old man.<br/>“And how do you get to that conclusion?”<br/>“I think I’m in love with my best friend…” Scorpius admitted and looked down, blushing. Saying it aloud for the first time made it awfully real, but not less true.<br/>“Hmm… and who is your best friend?”<br/>Scorpius hesitated. “It’s Albus Potter.”<br/>“Hmmm…” Dumbledore just said.<br/>Scorpius couldn’t interpret anything in that. He looked up. Dumbledore was smiling. <br/>“I can tell you: There is nothing wrong with you.”<br/>“But there isn’t anyone in Hogwarts like me.” <br/>“I wish I could tell you that in Hogwarts everyone is accepted just the way they are. It should be like that, I always wished for it to be like that, but we both know that it isn’t always that easy, right?!”<br/>“I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.” Scorpius admitted.<br/>“There isn’t a right answer. I can’t tell you what to do. But it is always a good start to figure out what is most important to you.” <br/>Scorpius thought about that for a while. That answer was defiantly not good enough. <br/>“Sir… may I ask you something?... Did you… did you love Gallert Grindelwald?”<br/>Dumbledore now looked torn apart. He looked happy and sad at the same time. Scorpius didn’t know that this was possible.<br/>“Yes. I did.”<br/>“But did you tell him? Did he know what you felt for him? How could you hide who you were for all your life?” Scorpius had so many questions.<br/>“I fear my story won’t help you find any answers.” Dumbledore shook his head.<br/>“Please. You must help me. There is no one else I can ask.” Scorpius said desperate.<br/>“I thought I didn’t deserve love and I accepted my fate.” Dumbledore paused.<br/>Scorpius swallowed. He didn’t want a life without love.<br/>“But I was mistaken. It is the one thing I regret. If I had the chance to live my life again, I would choose another path, because I learned that love is the one thing worth fighting for … no matter in which way it may appears.”<br/>Scorpius was surprised by that answer and relieved. <br/>“I fear that’s all I can tell you for now. I wish you a good night, Mr. Malfoy.”<br/>“No. Wait. Please!” Scorpius called after him, but he was already gone.</p>
