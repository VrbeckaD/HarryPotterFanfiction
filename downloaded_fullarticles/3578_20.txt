  <strong>WEDNESDAY, 13 MARCH</strong>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Severus wakes up late, clutching the sheets around his body, curled up as if he’d been repeatedly kicked in the stomach while he slept. Eyes still shut, unwilling to face reality just yet, he chases sleep as far as he can. It comes and goes for an hour or so and then it’s gone, leaving behind unidentifiable wisps of dreams. When finally he opens his eyes, it’s already past noon. The bedroom is drenched in sunlight and the pillow wet against his cheek.</p><p>He remembers the appointment at once. It’s at three o’clock. The thought of it has hovered on the surface of his conscience all night. Even though last night he thought he’d decided he wasn’t going to go, now that there’s still time to make it, he feels obliged. He starts shivering, as he always does when nervous. The prospect of having to tell his woes to a stranger is enough to churn his insides.</p><p>He had hoped to somehow sleep through it, so he wouldn’t have to make the decision. The hour would have come and gone while he slept on, completely unaware. Afterwards, he could have managed to convince himself that it was too bad, that it was an accident, that it would be for another time.</p><p>There would have been no other time. He has become an illustrious coward.</p><p>He’s been back in London two weeks now. Two weeks gone by in a haze. Two weeks of sleeping because it’s all he can tolerate to do. Two weeks of sleeping and waking, but not really. Of walking around the flat like a ghost and eating because he <em>must</em>, chewing tasteless food that he orders in because he hates this place but at the same time can’t stand to leave it.</p><p>Lying on his back, he watches with weary eyes the uneven patch of daylight on the ceiling, and in a rare moment of bravery – or clarity, perhaps – he decides that he will go. He will get himself out of this bed and he will make his way to that wretched office even if he has to crawl all the way there on bloody knees.</p><p>He’s been wallowing in self-pity long enough. Today is the start of something new.</p><p>It’s a promise he’s made before. But he means to keep it this time.</p><p>On the bedside table, as if on cue, his phone starts to vibrate. He promptly ignores it, shifting onto his side and away from the insistent buzzing. It only adds to the apprehension, and he repressed the urge to knock it off the table.</p><p>He’s certain it’s Marine calling. Again. He can <em>sense</em> her name on the screen, see it without looking, along with that little picture of her from two summers ago. Face caught in a beam of sunlight, flirty smile and a silly straw hat.</p><p>He doesn’t answer. She’ll leave a message and he’ll to listen to it later, along with all the others. Maybe.</p><p>There’s a tiny pinprick of a hole in the wall, where a canvas used to hang – a bland reproduction of an already boring Monet that he threw away at first sight – and he stares at it. He takes deep breaths. He will not have a panic attack. Not today. Today is meant to be different.</p><p>It’s almost one when he finally extricates himself from bed and makes his way along the corridor and into the bathroom. He hates this bloody bathroom. All crispness, lights, and mirrors. There’s nowhere to hide in here.</p><p>Even though there’s really no time, he runs himself a bath and avoids his reflection as he strips, still shivering, body heavy with sleep. He makes the water scorching, as hot as he can endure, and sinking into it is like slipping out of nothingness and into existence. It’s like being wrapped in someone’s embrace, like turning into something concrete, something that can feel. Something that can be hurt, yes, but also soothed.</p><p>He often has this unshakable feeling of disappearing. It comes as suddenly as those waves of panic he’s become so accustomed to, but it’s more like a numbness, an inevitability. A certain dread that something is coming for him with the sole purpose of engulfing him in shadows, of erasing him. It makes him want to run and hide.</p><p>Sometimes he’s scared of dying and no one finding out.</p><p>For a quarter of an hour, as the water slowly cools around him, Severus slips back into life. Emerging from the tub, however, is even more painful than getting out of bed. There is a weight that wasn’t there before, like his insides have turned to lead, like he’s being held back, like the planet’s gravity has shifted to focus entirely on his body.</p><p>Heat radiates from his skin, and yet the cold is still there. It runs deeper, embedded in his bones.</p><p>Often, at night, he thinks about sandstorms. He likes to imagine himself standing in the middle of a vast, scorching desert full of heavy winds, and let the sand whip his skin like burning needles.</p><p>He catches a glimpse of his reflection as he rises from the tub and he can’t look away fast enough. The gaze that meets his in the mirror is that of a pale-faced, bearded stranger, and he finds himself unable to avert his eyes. It feels like a trick, like he’s standing on one side of a glass wall and someone who bears him an uncanny resemblance stands on the other, mimicking his every move.</p><p>But then, the more he stares at this stranger, the more familiar his features become. Eyes so dark you can barely see the pupils. Thick eyebrows that seem constantly frowned no matter how hard he might try to soften their expression. A nose that crooks slightly to the left. Angular cheekbones.</p><p>Yes, if he squints he can see it. This face is his own, the face of Severus Prince. When he blinks, it blinks also. When he tries to smile, it stretches painfully in a sort of grimace that doesn’t reach its eyes.</p><p>He prepares to shave, as respectable men do before important appointments. He gets everything ready: the brush, the oil, the cream, and his trusty old razor. But he can’t bring himself to begin. His fingers hover over it all, pale and trembling, his gaze never leaving that of the man in the mirror.</p><p>Black eyes, still half a stranger’s, stare back at him, impassive. Shaving would only unveil more familiar traits, reveal the sharp lines and angles of his jaw, accentuate the thinness of his lips. No. No shaving today. He’s quite content looking unlike himself for the time being. He leaves everything on the counter and heads back to the bedroom, shivering still.</p><p>He dresses slowly, in clothes that have been thrown in a suitcase and then thrown in drawers haphazardly, clothes slightly wrinkled but clean. Trousers and a button-down shirt. He takes his time, hoping, deep down, that making himself late will give him an excuse not to go out.</p><p>If only the weather would cooperate, he could simply convince himself that braving torrential rain isn’t worth it. But the sun is shining.</p><p>Still, how easy it would be to just slip back into bed. No need to undress. He could just fall back in, let gravity do the job. Maybe even sleep some more if he tried hard enough. He ends up leaving the bedroom in a hurry. The temptation is just too great, and he can’t trust himself with anything anymore.</p><p>The flat suits Severus’ current appearance. It is a stranger’s, picked out and furnished by a young woman’s voice on the phone.</p><p>He’s on the top floor of an old warehouse building turned into <em>luxury apartments</em>. It has an open-plan, hardwood floors, and walls of exposed bricks with wide windows. There is a thick carpet in the living room, and a comfortable sofa with its matching armchairs in shades of beige – all arranged around designer coffee tables – and a cushioned seat near the larger window where he likes to curl up. The entire back wall is made up of shelves, from floor to ceiling, filled with all sorts of items, the central one a large flat screen television. To the left, the kitchen area has all the modern appliances one might need, a large island, and a refurbished wood table that’s too long and has too many chairs that Severus will surely never be able to fill with people.</p><p>It’s all very aesthetically pleasing, but nothing here means anything to him. The books on the shelves are an odd amalgam of classic literature and bestselling thrillers, and the art on the walls is generic and dull. Nothing about it feels particularly “luxurious” to him.</p><p>He spends so much time staring out the window, debating whether he should really go out, changing his mind and then changing it again, that by the time he finally makes his decision, he has barely half an hour left. He rushes towards the tube.</p><p>In the carriage, Severus leans back against the closed doors, keeping his eyes down, letting himself be rocked softly by the rhythm of the train. It doesn’t take very long for the familiar, ever-present feeling of dread to swim back to the surface.</p><p>He’s gotten so used to being alone, to being unseen, that the alien feeling of being amongst others is almost too much to bear. The fear grows rapidly, the dread that if he were to look up, he would find all eyes set on him. He can feel their gazes without looking. He can feel them read his every thought, see his life and feel what he feels. And he feels that they enjoy his suffering.</p><p>He takes deep breaths, forbidding himself to look up. If he did, he would know for sure that he’s imagining things, but still he doesn’t dare. Because what if he isn’t imagining things? What if they really are all staring at him? What then? No, he will not look. He will not snap at them. He will not become one of those neurotics who randomly yell at people on the train. He breathes deeper still, trying to reason with himself.</p><p><em>There’s no need to look up,</em> he repeats in his head, breathing steadily.<em> You’re just imagining things, you know you are. There’s no one looking at you. They don’t know, they can’t possibly know. You’re just being paranoid. Just hold on, you’re getting off at the next station. It’ll all be over soon</em>.</p><p>Taking more and more deep breaths, he turns away from the other passengers, keeping his eyes down still, ready to bolt out the doors the moment they open.</p><p>As he finally steps out of the tube at Monument, Severus allows himself a moment to gather his wits, breathing in the chilly air. People walk by without taking any notice of him.</p><p>The building he’s looking for is one of those weirdly shaped skyscrapers that seem to have grown like weeds all around the city during his absence. He spots it easily enough and walks fast towards it.</p><p>The office is on the thirtieth floor. As he stands across the street, waiting for the crossing light to turn, he looks up at where he imagines it to be, one of countless narrow windows reflecting the bright, mid-afternoon sky. Then he makes the mistake of glancing at his watch and realises he’s already ten minutes late.</p><p>They are expecting him up there, waiting for him. There is a pretty receptionist waiting to greet him, to hang his overcoat. And in the next room, there is a leather armchair, ready for him to sink nervously into it.         </p><p>And just like that, his great resolution dissolves and Severus changes his mind. He swiftly walks away, head down, avoiding people’s straying gazes like a schoolboy cutting class. Shaking his head, he tries to be reasonable and straightens up. It’s not like everyone can tell he’s just decided to ditch his new therapist. Nobody cares about that sort of thing. And it’s too late anyway, he’s already walking away. He will live with the consequences. Surely nothing more than a voicemail informing him that he’s failed to make his appointment and inviting him to reschedule.</p><p>The more he thinks about it, he doesn’t need a new therapist after all. The old one in Paris hasn’t helped much. Besides, the main reason he decided to return to London was to start anew. What if he’s spent the first few weeks back living like a hermit, neglecting his personal hygiene and avoiding other human beings? This sort of thing happens to everyone, doesn’t it? Everyone needs to rest eventually. Especially after moving to another country. And he <em>is</em> up and about now, isn’t he?</p><p>No, there will be no need for therapy in this new life. The way he sees it, if he’s managed to get through the last eight months without offing himself, he should be just fine.</p><p>He starts heading back to the station, but the thought of returning to the flat stops him dead in his tracks. There is an annoyed grunt from behind, and a businessman in a grey suit walks around him, cursing under his breath and shooting a dark glance over his shoulder. Severus ignores him.</p><p>He stands on the pavement, hesitant. He thinks about the flat and his bed, too large and constantly unmade, with its cold, ruffled sheets. He thinks about the walls, their whiteness, and that tiny hole, the spot he fixes his eyes upon when he feels himself slipping. And for all the comfort the place has brought him – was it really comfort? – he doesn’t want to spend one more minute in there. For the time being, at least. He fears if he sets foot back in the flat now, he will never come out again. He simply cannot spend any more time hiding from the world and staring at a piece of wall. He turns sharply and enters the first shop he comes across.</p><p>He finds himself in a coffeeshop, with dark walls, wooden tables and chairs, and a barista who raises his head as Severus barges in, almost tripping over the doorsill.</p><p>It’s one of those places that sells a panoply of sugary, whip-cream and syrup-based drinks. Severus usually avoids them – too sweet and too complicated – but he supposes he might as well order something since he’s here anyway. New life and all that rot. He awkwardly steps up to the counter. Perfectly conscious that he’s in unfamiliar territory, he tries to look confident and finally orders the biggest size latte they have.</p><p>The young man picks up a paper cup and a black, felt-tip marker and looks at him expectantly. “What’s your name?” he asks.</p><p>Severus frowns, glancing around. “I doubt that’s necessary. I’m the only one in line.”</p><p>“Gee. Sorry for asking,” the barista says indifferently.</p><p>Severus stands by the counter to wait. He tries to replay in his mind the words he’s just said and the tone he’s used and realises with some embarrassment that he snapped at the boy. He really <em>must</em> get used to interacting with other humans again…</p><p>He looks around nonchalantly to hide his shame. Soft music is playing in the shop, and everyone present is quietly minding their own business. The most commotion comes from a table of students seemingly working on a school project. He takes out his phone and tries not to look at the time, because doing so would undoubtedly bring the appointment to mind, and he tries not to look at all the unanswered messages either, so he ends up flipping between the screens in a mix of boredom and nervousness until his order is ready.</p><p>The paper cup reads <em>Grumpy McFrowny</em> in elegant cursive.</p><p>He takes it hesitantly. The barista looks at him coldly before cracking up a small smile, almost apologetic.</p><p>Severus sits near the window with his back to the counter, knowing very well that otherwise he wouldn’t be able to stop himself from staring at the young man, whose smile is very lovely indeed. The drink is decent enough, scalding hot, and the heat sends tremors of delight down into his shivering bones.</p><p>As he sits, watching the passers-by on the street, a strange feeling of satisfaction settles in his chest. It’s pathetic, despite the missed appointment – he’s decided to use the word <em>missed</em> instead – how proud he feels of having stepped outside. But he’s reached a point where he should celebrate the small victories. Maybe he could push his luck and try to get some writing done while he’s at it.</p><p>The journal he takes out of his bag was a gift. Genuine leather, with his initials in elegant silver lettering on the cover. The spine is worn from being opened repeatedly, the edges of the pages crinkled from being flipped through, the cover scratched from being carried around. But the pages, all of them, are completely blank.</p><p>The truth is, Severus has never had such a dry spell in his life before. He hasn’t written a single word for going on two years.</p><p>In his defence, it’s not because he hasn’t tried. At first, he would go to bed every night with the absolute certainty that the next day, this hell would end. And he would sit before his typewriter in the morning, ready to let the words flow. Only they didn’t.</p><p>Now, he rarely bothers anymore, and the typewriter has been collecting dust, like a relic from a lost epoch. He’s left it in its familiar spot at the old place and thinks about it from time to time, bitterly. The new flat has a computer that he’s barely touched. He’s nearly lost all hope, but there’s still this one journal that he keeps carrying around. Just in case a verse, a rhyme, a fragment of a poem comes to mind.</p><p>Of course, he could always, as a last resort, recycle himself into a novelist. Hell, maybe he could even write about his own life. God knows there’s material enough in the person of his father to fuel a good thousand pages.</p><p>He could write it all. All of it. Starting with the miserable town of Cokeworth, and the even more miserable house on Spinner’s End. Then the people who lived there: his father, Tobias Snape, an angry drunk; and his mother, thin and willowy Eileen, who was too scared to stand up to him. Then there was scrawny little Severus, who was constantly terrified, who was home-schooled and didn’t have any friends. His father didn’t believe women should be allowed to earn a living, he thought his wife’s place was at home, so home she stayed and taught her son from old, out-of-date textbooks.</p><p>But even if he’d attended school, Severus doesn’t think it would have made a big difference. He was reserved and solitary in nature, his home situation made him uncommonly secretive, and he had never mastered the art of getting along with other children. Maybe it was better he stayed home, too. That way no one could see the bruises.</p><p>Over the years, all of this has become unreal, like a blurry, damaged home movie featuring strangers. Even in his nightmares, Severus feels detached, unaffected. Like he’s just witnessing the horror.</p><p>He doesn’t remember every detail of it, but he could easily improvise. He can’t even recall what would happen to make his father mad – it seems he didn’t need a reason most of the time. It was always more or less the same. He would just come home from the mill, or the pub, and he would find things to get mad about. And no matter what she did, no matter how small she tried to make herself, Severus’ mother would always, always be in the way.</p><p>Writing about her would be the hardest. She died when he was eight years old, and his memories of her have been fading ever since. What he <em>could</em> write about is her absence. Pages and pages about the emptiness she left in his life, and about the dread, the infinite dread of being left alone with his father. Like being dragged headfirst into a pit. But Severus was lucky for the first time in his life. His grandparents came for the funeral, and they took him away to live with them.</p><p>He remembers them still as he saw them that day, for the very first time. Twin silhouettes in the doorway of the house, one holding onto the arm of the other, pale daylight behind them. His grandmother in one of her austere dresses, and his grandfather in his beloved fedora.</p><p>Ironically enough, along with most of the family, they had fallen out of touch with his mother over her choice of husband. All these years later, Severus can’t help but wonder if what was left of his mother’s pride had stopped her from seeking their help. If she had endured the abuse all these years simply not to let her family know they had been right all along.</p><p>To say this was the beginning of a very different life for him would be an understatement. One day he was living in a dreary world of bricks and dust, fear and guilt, and the next he was thrown into the midst of the London aristocracy, wearing silk pyjamas and drinking his tea out of delicate china.</p><p>They changed his name to theirs, to his mother’s, to Prince. To separate him from his <em>distasteful parasite of a father</em> – his grandmother’s very words. And they sent him to school, a prestigious establishment in the heart of the city, a family tradition of sorts which his grandfather had attended, as well as his mother, her two brothers, and all of Severus’ cousins.</p><p>Yes, he could write about all this, but he refuses to. And he refuses to because if he starts this story, he will have to finish it. And one thing leading to another, it would all lead him back to the very place he doesn’t want to go. A little bookshop in Paris. Eyes meeting across rows of old, dusty paperbacks. A smile and a knowing look. The end of a story, and the beginning of another one. One he doesn’t care to get into again.</p><p><em>It takes an ocean not to break</em>, a voice sings softly from the speakers.</p><p>And so, Severus ends up doing absolutely nothing. The journal remains empty. He hasn’t even brought a book to keep him company. He just sits and drinks, looking out the window. He orders two more lattes and stops only when his heart starts trembling inside his chest from all caffeine he isn’t used to anymore. It also may or may not have something to do with the fact that the last one is made by a different barista and just doesn’t seem to taste as good as the first two. The young man has left without Severus noticing, and he somehow manages to convince himself he isn’t bothered by it.</p><p>He finally takes his messages, more out of boredom than any real interest, and realises his voicemail has been full for a while now. They all date back a week or so. Six of them are from Marine, each more worried and annoying than the one before. Once again, he feels this old guilt, this feeling that other people care about him infinitely more than he does about them.</p><p>The emails are countless – agent, editor, publishers, magazines, newsletters… One is from Fabrice, friendly but brief, carefully inquisitive, with mentions of the weather, of an old movie he watched the other day. Severus is more than certain Marine prompted him to send this, but Fabrice being a man of few words, he appreciates the sentiment nonetheless.</p><p>There is even one from Loïc, his landlady’s son, a bright young man with a passion for literature and philosophy with whom he used to chat on the stairs. He wishes Severus all the best in London and asks for his opinion on a passage from <em>Zarathustra</em> for a dissertation. His is the only message Severus replies to.</p><p>Just as he’s about to close his inbox, a new email appears. It’s from Étienne this time. <em>Look what I found</em>, the object says, and there’s something in attachment.</p><p>Severus deletes the message without opening it. Then he goes into the trash and deletes it there too. Just in case.</p><p>He sits alone, letting the hours pass by, watching the lowering sun spread gold on the upper parts of the surrounding buildings. The other barista, not the handsome one, changes the music to something more upbeat, and just as a crowd of agitated young people walk in, Severus decides it’s time for him to leave.</p><p>Surprisingly enough, the day hasn’t been such a waste, and he starts thinking maybe he shouldn’t go home just yet. He decides to allow himself a stroll through London, like he used to do all the time years ago, when he was still full of dreams and still longed for Paris. It used to make him happy. Maybe it would again now.</p><p>He leaves the coffeeshop and starts walking. He’s always loved how the old mixes in with the new in this part of the city. Skyscrapers stretching up higher than steeples, sculpted stone facades tucked in between walls of glass and steel. The architecture here has a certain kind of aesthetic that just doesn’t seem to be found anywhere else.</p><p>The familiar smells on the air, the stray rays of sunlight peeking through the buildings, the cool breeze on his face ignite something in Severus. A hint of a pleasant feeling. Albeit small, this sudden spark is the closest to happiness he’s felt in months.</p><p>A flock of pigeons take flight, and he follows their reflection in the glass displays of a series of small shops when he catches a familiar glimpse between the buildings. He continues down the street, walking in the shadow of rows and rows of scaffoldings, and when he emerges into daylight again, he’s standing before St Paul’s, watching its steepled dome stretch towards the darkening sky.</p><p>Severus has never been a religious man. Endless unanswered prayers whispered in the dark while his mother’s sobs echoed through the house have seen to that. But churches have always managed to bring a sort of peace into his heart. He’s kept many fond memories of this one. Being huddled safely between his grandparents during Sunday morning mass, sleepily listening to the hymns and the hum of prayers and gazing up at the pillars and engravings to the pleasant sound of countless leaflet pages being turned.</p><p>He could head around and go inside, but the thought of finding himself among so many tourists chills him. He keeps walking instead, almost absentmindedly. He lets the different sights bring different memories to the surface. He lets the emotions fill him up, embraces them.</p><p>By the time he walks into Soho, the sun has almost completely set, and queues are forming outside restaurants and pubs – hordes of young, beautiful people laughing with their friends. He tries not to stare at their happy faces as pangs of longing shoot through his chest. For all the time he’s spent seeking isolation in the last few months, he realises he wants nothing more in this moment than to be amongst them all. To be surrounded, smiled at, talked to. To be noticed.</p><p>He keeps walking until he reaches Old Compton Street. He doesn’t even really mean to; his feet just lead him there. Even after all these years, he still knows the way. He could probably get there with his eyes closed, purely by instinct.</p><p>How many times has he wandered out after dark, while everyone was sound asleep, to end up exactly here? He can still remember how scared he was the first few times, how terrified that someone would recognise him, that people at school would find out, that everyone would know. He feared the very word then. <em>Gay</em>. Hearing it on the street or in school, even if it wasn’t directed at him, made his blood turn cold.</p><p><em>Fucking little poof!</em> his father would yell, drawing his fist back. It had fuelled Severus’ dread for years. If even this drunken sack of shit could see him for what he was, how could he possibly hide it from the rest of the world?</p><p>The street hasn’t changed much, but the people on it are younger, more beautiful, more openly affectionate than they were then, when he first wandered here, curious and afraid.</p><p>It was here, aged seventeen, that he got his first kiss and his first blowjob, all on the same night. And he went home afterwards, ashamed and exhilarated, and he didn’t sleep a wink. Partly because of the shame but mostly because of the exhilaration. He couldn’t stop thinking of that warm mouth, of the short hair he’d grasped tightly, when he should have been thinking instead of all the pretty girls his grandparents insisted he meet every other weekend at dinner parties.</p><p>When he’d finally gathered up the courage to tell them, almost a year later, that he had no interest in pretty girls, their initial reaction was to sigh and look helpless. At least it wasn’t a novelty in the family. They had both been prepared years ago when his uncle Joachim had proclaimed his own homosexuality, even if it had never been a well-kept secret.</p><p>While Severus’ grandfather seemed generally unaffected by the revelation – “live and let live” had always been his motto, uttered along with a slight shrug of his bony shoulders – his grandmother would shake her head in annoyance. She complained often that since it would now be up to his cousin Oscar to further the family line, none of them should expect any real feats of genius from the future Prince offspring. However, if she first saw his homosexuality as an inconvenience, soon she was taking it in stride and introducing him to what she called <em>respectable young gentlemen with proclivities like yours, or so I heard</em>.</p><p>But this is entirely the wrong place to be thinking about her.</p><p>All this reminiscing has managed to make Severus feel even more lost. Where has time gone? How did he end up here, all alone, unhappy, unable to reach out to anyone? He’s forty years old but he feels like an old man.</p><p>Without meaning to, he’s already decided to enter a pub and drink himself miserable.</p><p>The whisky he orders is the cheap brand, the one his father used to drink before beating the shit out of his mother. It glints a pale amber in the dim lights, like diluted piss, and tastes like bile on his tongue.</p><p>There is much better alcohol – bottles and bottles of it line the shelves right in front of him – but somehow, tonight, this one seems fitting. Severus drains his glass and the barman pours him another one without a word.</p><p>There’s a sticky spot on the bar he can’t stop touching, where the varnish has rubbed off over years of sweaty hands and spilled pints. He pokes at it like an old wound. Why did he have to go and think about his mother? His father he can always handle. The anger feels good, makes him feel alive. But his mother…</p><p>She was a different woman when his father wasn’t around, and Severus tries, as much as he can, to separate her from him. It seems only fair to imagine her this way. It feels like a kindness. When it was just the two of them, she would smile and laugh. She loved to sing, and she taught him how to dance once, humming softly as they waltzed across the kitchen, his small feet on top of hers.</p><p>He remembers being fascinated by her hands. She had long fingers, graceful. She had been a pianist once, a lifetime ago, but there was no music in his father’s house. She would caress Severus’ scalp with those fingers, making him shiver. And she would always paint her nails, even when she was sad and bruised. Sometimes, when she was shaking too much, he would do it for her, his small, clumsy hands carefully applying thick coats of red varnish on her bitten nails. Even when he made a complete mess of it, she would smile and kiss his face.</p><p>He remembers her wedding band. A glint of gold, and how it kept slipping on her finger.</p><p>He keeps ordering whisky until his head is foggy and his mouth numb.</p><p>On the other side of the room, sitting alone at the bar, a man shoots him a sultry look from under a fringe of dark hair and Severus feels sudden warmth spread through his body. He almost turns to ensure the look really is directed at him, but he doesn’t have to. There is no mistaking it.</p><p>He pauses, a rabbit caught in headlights. When’s the last time someone looked at him this way? Just the effect it has on him, this simple glance, this flicker of interest, makes him realise just how much he’s been craving it. And when the man’s lips curl into a smirk and he jerks his head to the left, Severus doesn’t even hesitate. He doesn’t even stop to think that if it wasn’t for the whisky, he would never even consider such a thing.</p><p>With newfound courage, he stands and follows the stranger into the narrow hallway leading to the loo. The only thing registering in his clouded head is that for once, for the first time in weeks – <em>months?</em> – he doesn’t feel cold anymore.</p><p>As soon as darkness envelops them, the stranger’s mouth is on his neck, warm and wet, and a great shiver sweeps through Severus’ body. Suddenly he’s alive again, fire rushing through his veins, and his hands, of their own volition, are sneaking under the man’s shirt and touching, touching warm flesh, grazing ribs.</p><p>How long since he’s touched someone else’s skin? How long since he’s even <em>wanted</em> to?</p><p>“You’re so hot,” the mouth whispers against his ear before biting down on the lobe.</p><p>Severus gasps like a drowning man. <em>What’s your name?</em> he wants to ask. Because he’s never really been able to separate lust and love before and kissing a stranger in the dark hallway of a pub is so unlike him that he can’t totally comprehend what is happening. But he’s forgotten how to speak, and all he can manage is an unintelligible moan before the stranger’s mouth cuts him off, all teeth and tongue and warmth. And it doesn’t even matter that the man tastes like cigarettes and beer and that he’s even drunker than Severus is. Nothing matters in this moment. He would probably be ashamed of the sounds he’s making if he wasn’t so fucking hard.</p><p>“I like your beard,” the stranger says, grinning as he starts undoing Severus’ belt.</p><p>Severus can’t talk, can’t think. Doesn’t want to. He just leans back against the wall, legs weak, and lets the man reach down into his pants, breathing hard.</p><p>Someone comes out of the loo then, illuminating the dark hallway around them. Severus’ eyes snap open, startled. A fraction of a second is all it takes for him to slip.</p><p>Light hits the stranger’s face a little too brightly, at a strange angle. And suddenly, from under dark eyelashes, the eyes that meet Severus’ suddenly belong to someone else. To his alcohol-addled mind, they become the very same eyes he’s seen nearly every day for fifteen years. Amused and sparkling with laughter. Angry and shooting daggers. Wide and in awe. Intense and hooded with pleasure. Clouded over with pain.</p><p>“What the<em> fuck</em>?” the stranger hisses as Severus pushes him away roughly before vomiting on the floor.</p><p>Nothing much comes out, but it physically hurts, like his whole body is trying to turn itself inside out. He leans heavily against the wall, gasping for breath and dry heaving, desperately trying to repress the sobs crawling up his throat.</p><p>“Fucking hell…” the man says as he stumbles away, shaking his head.</p><p>Severus wipes at his mouth with his sleeve and slides down against the wall, wrapping his arms around his shivering body.</p><p>“You alright, mate?” the man who’s just come out of the loo asks carefully, keeping his distance.</p><p>“Colin,” Severus whispers, voice so low he can barely even hear it himself.</p><p>He hasn’t said the name in months. He’s tried so hard to will it out of existence. It shouldn’t mean anything anymore, but it does. It still means everything.</p><p>Severus waits there, in that hallway, until three men come for him – the barman, the man from the loo and another one. They lead him away gently and put him in a cab.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <strong>THURSDAY, 14 MARCH</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>He dreams about the waterhole again. It’s a circular well, several feet wide, in the middle of a forest, judging by the tree branches overhead. The walls are old stone covered in a thick layer of moss and algae, and much too slippery and high to climb.</p><p>The hole is filled with water and flooded in sunlight, and Severus has forgotten how to swim. His body is heavy, struggling to stay afloat, muscles aching with the effort, being pulled under the surface by fear and panic alone. He <em>knows</em> he’s going to drown, it’s only a matter of time. The waiting is the worst part. He feels he should just give up and slip under, let the water take him. Why delay the inevitable? He’s just so damn tired.</p><p>Something wraps itself around him then, <em>someone</em>. A body, warm and soft, warmer than the sunlight on his face. He feels arms around his torso, he feels legs intertwine with his. He feels someone there, but he can’t see a face. He sees only water and sunlight, green leaves overhead and the dark depths underneath. But the body is there against his, keeping him afloat. And he feels that this body loves him. And he loves it too, harder than he’s ever loved anything in his whole life. He feels it like something expanding inside his chest, growing and growing until it’s crawling up his throat.</p><p>Severus wakes with a choking gasp, sitting up in bed, head pounding painfully. The longing is nestled inside his chest like a claw wrapped around his heart and tightening its grip. He barely makes it to the bathroom in time to throw up. Then, despite his best efforts to avoid it, he starts sobbing like a child.</p><p>This often happened in the days after Colin. Severus would rush to the bathroom and throw up, then cry and throw up again. After Colin wasn’t available anymore to shiver on the floor in pain, Severus had taken over. But not in the same way.</p><p>The alcohol, the dream, the longing, all this makes the situation much different, of course, but the sudden realisation that things are repeating themselves, even in a different way, doesn’t help the feeling of defeat that sweeps over him.</p><p>When the worst of it has passed, he leaves the bathroom, still nauseated, still dressed in yesterday’s clothes. The living room is filled with sunlight. He shuts the curtains and makes his way into the kitchen in the dark. There, Severus toasts one slice of bread and takes only a few bites with a large glass of water and two aspirins. Then he sits at the table for a long time, staring into space, taking deep breaths, urging the pounding headache and the pain in his chest to disappear.</p><p>Half an hour later, he’s curled up on the sofa and just about ready to fall back asleep when his phone starts ringing, the sound of it coming from somewhere nearby, though he has no idea where he’s left it.</p><p>He wants to ignore it and just drift off to sleep. It’s probably Marine again. It’s always her. She’s calling more and more often now that she can’t leave messages anymore. She must have enough of his silent treatment, and he hopes she doesn’t decide to keep calling all day, though he wouldn’t put it past her. If she does, she picked the wrong fucking day. It occurs to him that he would save himself a lot of trouble if he just talked to her already. Telling her right off to leave him alone might work… though he seriously doubts it.</p><p>Severus groans in annoyance. Why isn’t the bloody thing on vibrate anyway? He stumbles to his feet and wanders around, searching for the source of the noise. He finds it in the pocket of his overcoat, which he’s left crumpled by the front door. Astoundingly enough, it’s not Marine’s name on the screen. This one he wasn’t expecting.</p><p>He clears his throat, and before he knows it, is answering the call. “Hello?”</p><p>“Hi,” comes the reply, followed by a slight hesitation. “Severus?”</p><p>“Yes, Constance.”</p><p>There’s a sigh of relief and he hears the smile forming on his cousin’s lips. “I didn’t know if you still had the same number.”</p><p>“Well… you know me. Creature of habit,” he says, heading back to his spot on the sofa.</p><p><em>What</em> is he doing? Why did he pick up? He was going to answer if it was Marine, just to tell her to leave him alone, but he doesn’t want to talk to Constance. He should have told her she had the wrong number and be done with it. Maybe she wouldn’t have recognised his voice. He should just tell her he’s busy, that he really can’t talk right now, or that he’ll call her back in a bit… He wouldn’t call her back.</p><p>He already knows where this is going. He needs to hang up <em>now</em>.</p><p>“God, it’s so good to hear your voice,” she says fondly. “How long has it been? Oh, don’t answer that! I don’t want to know.”</p><p>“It’s been years, I expect.”</p><p>Can she hear how reticent he is? Is it audible in his voice? And if so, should he try to hide it?</p><p>There’s a pause then, and he knows exactly what she’s about to say before she does, softly. “How are you doing?”</p><p><em>God</em>, he could have predicted the very intonation of her words. He’s heard them so many times before, spoken in the exact same way.</p><p>“I’ve been better. But I’ve also been much worse,” he says shortly, letting her know he’s not exactly up to discussing this particular topic a length.</p><p>“Good… I know it’s…” She trails off, and he waits while she struggles with what to say next. “I hear you’re back in London.”</p><p>“Yes. Oscar will have told you.”</p><p>Surely everyone knows by now. Well, it’s his own damn fault. If he didn’t want his family to know he was back, he shouldn’t have asked his cousin to help him find a place to stay.</p><p>Constance chuckles. “Of course, he did. We’ve been talking about it actually, and we’d like you to come to dinner. This Sunday. If it works for you.” She pauses for just a second but doesn’t give him the time to say anything before she starts gushing out words uncontrollably, like she used to do as a teenager. “It would be at the house. Oscar lives there now, with Anna and the kids, and Mother and Father, but there’ll be Uncle Joachim, and I’ll be there with George. And Gwen will come. Everyone really wants you to be there, Sev! Ella, Oscar’s youngest, she can’t wait to meet you. She’s read all your books–”</p><p>He cuts her off before this can go on. “Constance, slow down, will you? I’ve…” He hesitates, unsure how to phrase this. “Look, I’ve just now started to get settled in and… Well, truth be told, I’ve been feeling slightly under the weather–”</p><p>“I understand,” she says softly, and of course she’s seeing right through the excuses. “I’d just… I’d like you to consider it, at least. It doesn’t even have to be this week…  I know it must be hard for you… I can’t imagine… And I know you don’t want to talk about it. But we all want to see you, Sev. I mean… <em>I</em> want to see you. I want to be there for you, if you’ll let me.” A pause then, and softly, “We’re still friends, right?”</p><p>He lets out a short sigh, his heart suddenly heavy. “Of course.”</p><p>He has this memory of her right then. They were sixteen years old and had just returned from school. A Smiths song was coming from the record player. He was lying on the floor of his bedroom, watching dust motes suspended in sunlight. She was sitting on his bed, chatting away, praising Morrissey, her one true love.</p><p>He realises then how much he’s missed her, and how deeply. For years they had been inseparable. Partners in crime. Being in Constance’s presence has always been so incredibly easy, so natural. To this day, she remains the most honest, the most open person he knows. There is not an ounce of malice to her character, she is only pure emotion.</p><p>If Constance were a body of water, she would be one of those beaches in the Maldives, where the water is so clear the sand through it is gleaming white.</p><p>“I’ve missed you,” he says before he can stop himself.</p><p>There’s silence at the other end.</p><p>“Me too,” she says after a while, her voice small and tight, and he thinks she might be crying.</p><p>“But I’m sorry, I don’t think I want to see everyone just yet. It’s been such a long time, and–”</p><p>“It’s okay, I understand,” Constance assure him softly. “I just thought I’d ask. You don’t have to decide now. You can think it over, there’ll be a place for you at dinner whether you show up or not.”</p><p>“Alright, I’ll think it over. I’ll call you if I change my mind.” He strongly doubts he will, but he feels terribly guilty shutting her down completely.</p><p>“Okay. Well… it was good to hear from you. Take care now, Sev.”</p><p>“You too.”</p><p>There is a slight pause, like she wants to say more, but then she hangs up.</p><p>He doesn’t go back to sleep. He couldn’t possibly now. He can’t even remember the last time he spoke to Constance. They used to call each other at least twice a week when he first moved away. Then maybe once a month, then only on birthdays and special occasions. Then not at all. How did it all fade into nothing? How could he lose interest in someone with whom he’s shared so much for so long? How can he just give up on people like that – on Constance, of all people?</p><p>He feels the strong urge to see her right now, and he could if he wanted to. She would greet him with open arms, and they would never talk about this long silence. Only, he wishes they could meet and talk about nonsense like they did when they were younger. Now it would only be questions and comforting advice and support, and he doesn’t feel up to dealing with all that. He doesn’t want to be spoken to softly, to be pitied, to be asked to talk about his feelings. If he wanted that, he would have gone to see the damn therapist.</p><p>He takes a long, hot bath and gets dressed, but he doesn’t shave. The man in the mirror still doesn’t look very much like him, and he wonders if Constance would even recognise him if he saw her on the street. He’s lost weight, too. Considerably. He hadn’t noticed before today. Another reason not to shave – who knows what his face looks like under all that facial hair.</p><p><em>I like your beard</em>, the stranger said last night. The thought makes Severus shiver, not entirely in a bad way. He tries to forget about it all, to lock it away in a corner of his mind, but he can’t quite manage it. Maybe there’s just too much locked in there already.</p><p>He needs to get out of the flat. Desperately. Anything rather than stay trapped in here with his own thoughts. He grabs his coat and leaves in a hurry.</p><p>If there’s one part of London that hasn’t changed much in all these years – that never really changes, to be honest – it’s Westminster. Maybe Severus is just imagining things, but it seems to him even the air smells the same as it did back then, when he used to walk these streets every day on his way to school and back.</p><p>Big Ben chimes three o’clock as he crosses the street after a sightseeing tour bus and heads towards Westminster Abbey. That’s where he spots the first Hoggarts students. Two boys and one girl, standing on a street corner, arguing about a group essay. He recognises their uniforms on sight, the crest on their black blazers and the blue-and-bronze tie of Raven House.</p><p>The girl has crossed her arms and is shaking her head vehemently at one of the boys. “You <em>cock</em>!” she exclaims a little too loudly, earning startled looks from the passers-by. “I’m not failing because of you!”</p><p>Severus shakes his head and keeps walking, lips curled into a smile. Even from here he can see Hoggarts School’s main hall, its bell tower rising among trees and steeples. As he approaches, he knows which exact window belongs to the headmaster’s office, which ones look into the dining hall, and even the very one out of which he used to gaze in boredom during old Professor Binn’s History lessons.</p><p>As he nears the front gates and peeks through the wrought-iron fence and into the yard, he recognises the statue near one of the side entrances which, one dreadful afternoon when he was fifteen, was accidentally beheaded by a cricket bat and earned the whole class detention because, in a surprising feat of solidarity, they all refused to name the culprit.</p><p>It feels good to remember these things. Strangely, the incessant feeling of longing that he can’t seem to rid himself of has morphed into something different, and Severus finds himself yearning for those long-lost afternoons where all he had to worry about were essays and marks and which cute boys in his year might be gay, too. How easy life seemed before. Before he decided to pursue his dreams and go to Paris. Before he met Colin.</p><p>The thought of Colin comes and for once he lets it. Colin had been in London once in his whole life and hated it deeply, complained about it often, probably just to annoy Severus. In fact, this played an important role in his decision to return home. Paris is full of Colin, but Severus has never visited London with him. There are no memories here. <em>Tabula rasa</em>.</p><p>Lessons are just letting out for the day and the narrow street is swarming with students. Severus desperately wants to slip in through the front doors and wander the familiar halls, but it wouldn’t take long for him to be noticed, and he isn’t sure such a thing really is allowed. The last thing he needs is to be caught lurking about where he has no business being. Instead, he follows the flow of chattering kids along, listening in to their conversations, which centre mainly on teachers, schoolwork, and which boys or girls they want to snog.</p><p>Distractedly, he follows a group of older teenagers into a side street and heads after them into a cosy little pub. The Three Broomsticks. God, he’d forgotten about this place!</p><p>The house used to be home to a particularly gifted broom-maker in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, hence the name of the pub – at least according to the bronze plaque outside the door. Inside, in a glass case over the grand fireplace, are displayed <em>the last three broomsticks made in the shop</em> before the broom-maker was apparently <em>murdered in horrendous jealousy by a fellow artisan</em>. Its convenient location, along with its doubtful and frankly aloof origin story, make The Three Broomsticks a prime spot for Hoggarts students, and thus its alcohol-free menu is as extensive as the offered selection of ales and liquor.</p><p>The pub is positively bustling at this hour, but Severus miraculously finds a seat at a small table near the back of the room. He orders a cup of tea and waits patiently, gazing at his surroundings.</p><p>He should be panicking, surrounded by so much noise and chaos, but the context, the familiarity of the location somehow puts him at ease. He’s pretty sure he must have come in here before, when he was still a student. The kids he followed inside are crowded near the bar, animatedly talking all over each other. One of them is waving a book around – even from a distance Severus recognises the cover of it as Plato’s <em>Symposium</em> – and making a mighty speech while his friends occasionally interrupt or snort with laughter.</p><p>When his tea arrives, he drinks it black and sighs in delight. The sunlight hitting the front window reflects in the mirror behind the bar and drenches the pub in golden light. He shuts his eyes briefly, temples still throbbing, but enjoying the moment nonetheless.</p><p>“Severus Prince?”</p><p>The man standing before him he immediately recognises as a teacher. It’s in the way he carries himself, in the way the crowd of students seems to part respectfully around him, in the elegantly-cut tweed jacket he wears, in the old leather satchel hanging from his shoulder, and of course in the first volume of <em>The Longman Anthology of British Literature</em> tucked under his left arm.</p><p>Severus recognises the man as a teacher even before he recognises who he is.</p><p>“Lupin,” he acknowledges, only mildly surprised.</p><p>Remus Lupin’s smile creates deep parentheses around his mouth. He hasn’t changed much in all these years, except there are hints of grey in his brown hair, more pronounced around the temples. His face is still young, but the way he squints in the sunlit room accentuates the wrinkles around his eyes as he looks at Severus in astonishment.</p><p>“I have to be honest,” he declares with disbelief, “you’re just about the last person I would have expected to see today. What brings you here?”</p><p>Severus almost cringes. It seems Lupin wants to engage in conversation. But of course, he does. You don’t just happen on an old schoolmate you haven’t seen in what, twenty years, and just vaguely nod in their direction. Well, that’s what Severus would do, but Lupin has manners, so it’s only natural for him to want to talk.</p><p>“I suppose I was feeling nostalgic,” he answers.</p><p>Then, seeing how Lupin is just standing there, smiling amicably at him, Severus gestures to the empty chair across from him in what he hopes is a friendly way.</p><p>“Would you like to sit?” he asks with a tentative smile. It probably ends up more like a slight and barely perceptible twitch of his upper lip. He knows this, he’s seen it in the mirror enough times.</p><p>Lupin glances at his watch briefly before taking the offered seat. “Yes, thank you. I believe I can spare a few minutes. I’ve a school club meeting soon. Oh, I teach at Hoggarts now,” he adds with a chuckle. “English and Literature.”</p><p>Severus had already figured that out, but he represses a smirk at the confirmation. Naturally. What is it they say? Those who <em>can’t</em>, teach. But he doesn’t say this. Now is not the time for sarcasm. He’s had so few interactions with other human beings in the past few weeks. It would be a shame to ruin this one. And besides, he really isn’t one to talk. If the saying were true, then he’s the one who should be looking for a teaching job.</p><p>“Good for you, Lupin,” he says instead. “You’ve always been the studious type, I remember.”</p><p>Lupin laughs. “What a polite way to say that I am, and have always been, an insufferable bookworm.”</p><p>“I believe it takes one to know one,” Severus admits with a smirk.</p><p>“How about you then?” Lupin asks kindly. “Should we expect another book soon? It’s been a few years now since <em>Silhouettes</em>, hasn’t it?”</p><p>It’s been eight years precisely. At first Severus is taken aback, but then again, if Lupin teaches literature, of course there’s a good chance the man is at least aware of his career. His genuine interest, however, is quite flattering. And Severus hasn’t talked about his work with anyone for a long time. Except there’s really nothing to tell.</p><p>“I did publish a few works since, in Paris,” Severus informs him.</p><p>“Yes, I’m aware,” Lupin replies in something akin to admiration. “But I’m afraid French has never been one of my strengths, and poetry tends to lose its essence in translations. It’s a shame, really, I quite liked your early works.”</p><p>Severus’ ego immediately takes over and he can’t stop himself gushing out, “Actually, I am working on something now. It’s… coming along well.”</p><p>Oh God. That sounded completely clumsy, even to his own ears. Perhaps his ability to lie to others is rusty now that he’s solely used to lying to himself – and is even good at it.</p><p>And Lupin suddenly has <em>The Look</em>, the one they all get. He <em>knows</em>. Somehow, he knows, and he can see. Lupin is not an idiot, he can see clearly what’s going on. He knows Severus isn’t really working on anything new. He knows Severus has become a complete failure. And most of all, he knows why. He knows about Colin.</p><p>Maybe Severus has more control than he thought and manages to stop the sudden feeling of impending horror from showing on his face, or maybe Lupin has seen the expression and caught on, because the fleeting look of sympathy is gone from his eyes as fast as it appeared.</p><p>“Well, I’m looking forward to it, Severus. I really did enjoy <em>Silhouettes</em>. I was quite surprised when it didn’t win the T.S. Eliot.”</p><p><em>You and me both</em>, Severus thinks bitterly.</p><p><em>Silhouettes</em> is a collection of twenty-five poems, all varying in length, which he has centred around the theme of strangers and the notion that each person, no matter how unimportant they can seem to our eyes, leads their own complex existence, and that though we are at the centre of our own universe, we are for others nothing but silhouettes passing through their lives. Severus wrote most of it on the terrace of the café across the street from his apartment building in Paris, and had it published in London in the spring of 2005.</p><p>It wasn’t his first book, actually his fifth work of poetry in English, but it happened to catch the eye of a particularly difficult literary critic who praised it in a few columns, and that was it. Copies flew off the shelves. Only a few months later, it was shortlisted for the T.S. Eliot prize for poetry, and in January of the following year, Severus travelled to London to attend the award ceremony.</p><p>He’s still ashamed when he thinks back on it. He was so confident, so sure to win. Maybe because even if he’d gained certain recognition through the years, none of his works had ever generated so much hype before. <em>The Guardian</em> had called it <em>full of evanescent beauty</em>. Maybe it went to his head a bit.</p><p>Yes, he had been so sure to win. Until he read Duffy’s book in his hotel room.</p><p>He can clearly recall the exact moment he realised he wasn’t going to win. He wasn’t even halfway through the bloody thing, his heart fluttering in his chest as he read. Something about being trapped in time waiting for death and love coming like a flight of birds. Then he sat up and swore out loud.</p><p>Maybe he would have won if he’d been nominated the next year, or the year before, but he didn’t stand a chance against <em>Rapture</em>. He isn’t exactly upset about losing. God knows she deserved the prize more than he ever did. But it shifted something in him, that book, something deep inside himself. He had never read anything so beautiful before, anything that touched him so thoroughly, and that it had been written by someone else enraged him.</p><p>As pathetic as it may seem, he hasn’t written anything in English since then. He hasn’t read the book again either. He’s never even finished it, just tossed it in the bin.</p><p>“Yes… Maybe next time,” he tells Lupin lightly, trying to look unaffected by the whole thing. Which he isn’t, of course. Even if eight years have passed. Because ruminating everything that has ever gone wrong in his life is what Severus is good at.</p><p>Lupin smiles again – <em>damn</em> that man and his smiles – and glances at his watch. “I’m afraid I have to go now,” he says before standing. “I really shouldn’t keep the kids waiting. I’m always berating them about tardiness and they’ll never let me hear the end of it if I get there late. We’re discussing <em>Beowulf</em> this week.”</p><p>“Oh, yes. Of course,” Severus replies, feeling relief flood through him.</p><p>He watches as Lupin searches his inside pocket and takes out a small card and a pen.</p><p>“I wonder if I could invite you over for a cup of tea tomorrow night, so we might catch up some more? My wife is working late nights and I would not mind the company. Say, around seven?”</p><p>Severus watches, powerless, as Lupin writes down his address on the back of the business card and hands it to him with another kind smile. “Check your schedule and let me know if you can’t make it. My mobile number is on there, and my email. I hope you come. It’s not every day one can converse with a real poet.”</p><p>“I… well… Thank you. I will… let you know.”</p><p>
  <em>Oh, for fuck’s sake, Severus! Get a grip!</em>
</p><p>“See you around, Severus,” Lupin says brightly before walking back through the crowd towards the door.</p><p>Severus watches as a few students call out and wave to Lupin, who responds with smiles and kind words, and then the man is gone.</p><p>What the devil just happened? What is it with people inviting him over? First Constance and now Remus Lupin, a man he hasn’t seen in twenty years! Does he look so desperately lonely? He didn’t think it showed…</p><p>Lonely or not, there is no way in hell he will go to Lupin’s for tea tomorrow. In what twisted world would he be stupid enough to spend a whole evening being smiled at and talked to like a wounded child? Watching people walk on eggshells around him has never brought him anything other than extreme annoyance, so why on earth would he want to subject himself to a whole evening of it?</p><p>Lupin can very well shove his invitation up his own arse!</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
  <br/>
  <strong>FRIDAY, 15 MARCH</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>It’s pouring rain. Severus attempts to take a nap three times, starts reading and gives up on four different books, and listens to half the records he owns. By three o’clock, he finally has to admit that he’s bored out of his mind.</p><p>It’s astonishing in a way. It’s as if the last two days have somehow managed to pull him from his relentless cycle of cowardice and laziness, and he is now finally fully awake, and more importantly, seeking distractions. Sleep, which usually comes easily, now seems to elude him.</p><p>At four in the morning, in a fit of insomnia, he even turned on the computer in an attempt to write. Granted, he didn’t manage to get a single word down, but the intention alone means something. He did go through the trouble to turn on the bloody thing. That’s more effort than he’s done in a long while, even if he ended up browsing Amazon instead.</p><p>Around six o’clock, he realises he’s starving. But of course, he has no food at home aside from an old loaf of bread that’s just about to go stale.</p><p>It’s while rummaging around the kitchen for a takeaway menu that he sees Lupin’s card. It’s lying on top of a pile of rubbish in the bin. Before he knows it, Severus is picking it up and turning it over to glance at the handwritten address. Without forming it in a complete thought, he’s already decided to go.</p><p>At first, he can only stand there, shaking his head at how very desperate he must be. Only yesterday he was absolutely opposed to the idea of accepting Lupin’s invitation, almost disgusted by it, and now, without a second thought, he’s actually decided to go. Has he no self-respect left at all?</p><p>But there’s something else happening. There’s this strange sensation again, this feeling telling him that he really <em>must</em> go. Marine jokingly calls it his <em>feminine intuition</em>. He just <em>knows</em> that accepting Lupin’s invitation is the right thing to do. It’s a tingle on the top of his head, like a shiver, but not totally unpleasant. Secretly he likes to imagine that it’s his mother’s ghost steering him in the right direction, running her fingers through his hair like she used to. But he would never, in a thousand years, tell anyone this.</p><p>And to be honest, it really isn’t much of a choice. Either spend a few hours with Lupin or die of boredom. And it can’t be <em>that</em> bad. They will probably end up talking about literature. Severus will agree to talk about his work if it comes up, but carefully avoid mentioning any future projects again. And if worse comes to worst and Lupin has the nerve to bring up Colin, Severus has already rehearsed a very polite little speech to put him in his place quite nicely.</p><p>He showers and gets dressed. He still doesn’t shave, but after looking at the stranger’s reflection for a while, decides that he’s badly in need of a haircut.</p><p>It’s still pouring outside, and he can’t find an umbrella anywhere, so he decides to get a cab. Through the Friday night traffic, it ends up taking much longer by car than if he had simply taken the tube, and he arrives a bit late, but at least he’s warm and dry. Lupin lives on the corner of a row of identical terraced brick houses. Nothing much differentiates his from the others, apart from a withered potted geranium on the front step.</p><p>Severus leaves a good tip for the driver – he always does so when cabbies don’t feel the need for small-talk – and hurries to the door, eager to get out of the rain. There is warm light coming from the window to his right, which he assumes to be the living room’s, but the blinds are shut. The knocker shines golden under the streetlamps. Severus rings the doorbell instead and hears its echo through the bowels of the house.</p><p>It takes only a few seconds for Lupin to open the door. He is dressed exactly like Severus imagines a man like Lupin would dress outside of class. In a pair of brown corduroys and a thick, hand-knitted jumper.</p><p>“Ah, Severus,” he greets with a smile. “Good evening. Come in, please.”</p><p>Lupin opens the door wider and Severus hurriedly shakes the rain from his overcoat before stepping inside.</p><p>“Good evening,” he replies, unable to remember the last time he visited someone. “Sorry I’m late. Thank you again for inviting me.”</p><p>“Oh, you’re welcome. I didn’t know if you were really going to show up, but I’m glad you did. I imagine you must be very busy.”</p><p><em>Busy? </em>Severus almost snorts.</p><p>Lupin takes his coat and hangs it next to another one on a hook by the door. While removing his shoes, Severus notices a pair of men’s boots on the floor that are definitely not Lupin’s – they look like they might belong to a younger man, and he’ll be damned if this one ever wears anything but oxfords.</p><p>“I hope you don’t mind, but I have another guest,” Lupin announces suddenly. “Harry has a habit of showing up unannounced,” he finishes with an affectionate smile.</p><p>“No problem. This is your home,” Severus replies shortly, trying to ignore the knot forming in his stomach. It may seem foolish, but the thought hadn’t crossed his mind that he might meet someone new tonight and it makes him suddenly nervous. As he follows Lupin down the hallway towards the living room, he takes deep breaths.</p><p>What on earth possessed him to come here tonight when he could be safe at home, by himself? Oh right, he was bored. And the top of his head tingled. What fucking rubbish.</p><p>The hallway is warm and has a pleasant smell, like sandalwood with a hint of vanilla. Lupin’s house is elegantly furnished, but not overly richly so like most houses in these areas tend to be. There is no priced antique furniture so fragile it can barely stand to be looked at, let alone sat on. Items are stylishly mismatched, and there’s a feminine touch, evident in the pillows, the afghan throws, and the scented candles carefully displayed. But there is also a hint of messiness undoubtedly belonging to the resident professor – books lying around, a pile of essays on an end table. There's also a child in the house – Severus spots toys and a safety barrier in the stairwell. A large fluffy cat stares at him lazily from where it’s curled up on the arm of the sofa. A fire is blazing on the hearth.</p><p>But all this Severus barely notices before his gaze settles on the figure in the corner of the living room. There is a young man sitting cross-legged in a large armchair. In his hands, he cradles a steaming mug of tea, and is in the process of blowing on it softly when they enter. When he looks up, Severus feels like he’s just been punched in the guts.</p><p>The boy has a beautiful, pale face and dark hair, but it’s his eyes that stand out. A truly stunning shade of green. Even from a distance, they manage to render Severus speechless.</p><p>“Harry, this is Severus Prince, an old schoolmate of mine,” Lupin announces.</p><p>The boy, Harry, first looks surprised then seems to remember his manners, and his mouth – which Severus finds very, very lovely – curls into a smile.  Unfolding his body from the chair, he stands to shake Severus’ hand.</p><p>Severus half expects to feel some kind of electric current, but there is only warmth when their hands touch. A moment later, however, the strangest feeling comes over him. He barely manages to stop the confusion from showing on his face as the strongest impression of déjà vu he’s ever experienced washes over him.</p><p>For a fraction of a second, he’s convinced beyond doubt that he’s stood in this exact spot before, in the middle of Lupin’s living room, reaching out to shake hands with this boy. Has Severus seen him before? No. No, he can’t <em>possibly</em> have seen him before. He would remember him. Severus would never forget such a face.</p><p>“Hello,” he says, his tongue heavy and dry in his mouth.</p><p>Immediately he wants to smack himself. <em>Hello??? What are you, an uneducated plebeian?</em></p><p>“Nice to meet you,” the boy greets him before turning towards Lupin, looking uncomfortable. “You should’ve told me you were expecting someone. I could’ve come back another time–”</p><p>“Nonsense, Harry. You’re welcome here anytime,” Lupin tells the boy softly before turning to Severus. “Harry is a former student of mine. Harry, you may have heard about Severus. He is a published poet.”</p><p>“<em>Right</em>... Severus Prince,” Harry says, now looking at Severus in something like amazement. “I thought your name sounded familiar.” He cringes then, slightly embarrassed. “Sorry though, I haven’t read any of your stuff. Poetry’s not really my thing. No offence.”</p><p>“None taken,” Severus manages, trying to sound casual and not like he’s getting closer and closer to cardiac arrest every time the boy’s eyes meet his.</p><p>In any other situation, if anyone else had dared tell him that <em>poetry’s not really their thing</em>, he would have replied with a scalding remark. But for once, Severus miraculously manages to shut his mouth on the matter.</p><p>“Please, Severus, take a seat. Let me fetch you some tea,” Lupin says pleasantly before stepping into the kitchen.</p><p>Wary of the large cat squinting at him from the sofa – felines never seem to like him – Severus takes a seat in the other armchair, the one closest to the fireplace, his insides shivering nervously. Harry, who's curled back into his own armchair, smiles at him politely before taking a sip of his tea.</p><p>While his attention is focused on the drink, Severus takes the opportunity to get a thorough look at him. His hair is inky black, without the slightest hint of brown to it, which is quite rare for someone of his complexion. His face, his neck, and what Severus can see of his hands is creamy pale. It’s this contrast, perhaps, that makes the sight of him so striking at first glance, that makes his face seem illuminated.</p><p>Under a forehead partially obscured by tousled curls, his eyebrows are perfectly straight lines. Being stuck in a perpetual frown himself, Severus has always been envious of such faces. The boy has a small, narrow nose, perfectly defined cheekbones, and a pale, wide mouth. And under dark eyelashes are those eyes of his. Those eyes that can’t possibly be described in words.</p><p>He is dressed simply, in tight black jeans and a grey, fitted jumper. His socks have a Christmas pattern on them.</p><p>Writers, poets especially, are good, swift observers. Severus gets all this in a few seconds’ look, in the infinitesimal amount of time it takes Harry to take a small, tentative sip of his tea before looking up again. Severus casually looks away then, as though contemplating the room with curiosity.</p><p>No, no, he’s definitely never seen this boy before. There’s no doubt about it. And yet... Oh, how he suddenly wishes they were sitting far apart in a room full of people, noisy and crowded, so he could go on staring at the boy as much as he wants without being noticed by him. It’s definitely something he could do for hours...</p><p>“So, you’ve attended Hoggarts?” Severus asks somewhat faintly.</p><p>“Until two years ago,” the boy tells him.</p><p>That would make him what? Nineteen? Twenty? Severus feels old, looking at him. What did nineteen-year-olds look like back in the day? Surely not this. God, he’s something to behold.</p><p>“And what are you doing now?”</p><p>“Nothing much,” Harry replies with a shrug. “I work in a bookshop.”</p><p>“We were just discussing Harry’s occupation,” Lupin interjects from the adjacent room.</p><p>Harry scoffs. “We weren’t <em>discussing</em> anything. Remus was berating me about my future.”</p><p>“I was only saying you should keep your options open,” Lupin says as he walks back into the room with a steaming kettle, an extra cup and a plate of tea cakes balanced on a tray. “Perhaps Severus could weigh in. If I recall correctly, he’s an Oxford man?”</p><p>“That’s right,” Severus says, nodding in thanks when Lupin hands him the cup. “I studied English and Literature in Oxford. Then I did my Masters’ at the Sorbonne, in Paris.”</p><p>“Did you always want to become a writer?” Harry asks him, genuinely interested.</p><p>“Deep down, yes, I suppose I did. Although it's not quite what my family had planned. They wanted me to become a chemist,” Severus admits, dropping a cube of sugar into his tea. He doesn’t usually take sugar, but this small action allows him to avoid the boy’s unwavering gaze for a few seconds and to catch his breath. There is something in the way Harry looks his interlocutor so straight in the eyes when he speaks that is unnerving. It’s something very rare for someone his age.</p><p>“So, you <em>knew</em> that’s what you wanted, and you went for it. You didn’t just blindly fall into people’s expectations and go into science,” Harry summarises, like he’s trying to make a point.</p><p>Severus is slightly confused. “I suppose...”</p><p>“Harry has been thinking about going down a different path lately,” Lupin explains.</p><p>“<em>You’ve</em> been thinking about it,” Harry corrects him. “I just said I’d consider. Remus thinks I’m too good to work in a shop,” he tells Severus.</p><p>“Harry is brilliant,” Lupin adds. “He could get in anywhere, and he knows it. Sometimes I think he’s doing this just to spite me.”</p><p>“Not <em>just</em>. But it’s part of it,” Harry says with a brief smirk. “There’s just so much pressure on people my age to do something with our lives, to become functioning members of society, to be assimilated and earn a living and become important. What if what I want now, right this moment, is just to work in a bookshop and spend my free time doing what I want to do instead of having to pore over textbooks all day long and stress about exams? There’s no harm in that, is there? What do you think, Mr Prince?”</p><p>Severus throws a brief look at him as Harry dangerously balances the teacup on his knee while shifting in the armchair to a more comfortable position. The sleeve of his jumper rides up slightly as he moves, and Severus glimpses part of a tattoo on his left wrist, a series of runes. He averts his eyes, adds some milk to his tea.</p><p>“Call me Severus, please,” he says. “And there is no harm in that, no. You are still young. If you need time, I think you should take it. Besides, in my experience, there are some things school cannot teach you.”</p><p>He’s embarrassingly satisfied to see Harry shoot Lupin a triumphant look.</p><p>“See, Moony? That’s what I’ve been saying. <em>Severus</em> understands. Why can’t you?”</p><p>“I only want what’s best for you,” Lupin says with a sigh.</p><p>“Well, no one knows what’s best for me better than I do,” Harry retorts with some exasperation.</p><p>Lupin makes a face like he begs to differ but says nothing.</p><p><em>Moony</em>, Harry just called him – his old school nickname. Severus had forgotten this. He strongly hopes it’s only because Lupin is now teaching there that it has resurfaces and prays to whatever deity might exist that his own never does. <em>Snivellus</em>, they called him, thinking they were clever little shits.</p><p>A strange silence settles on the three of them then, nothing breaking it other than the cat's loud purring. After almost a minute, Harry puts his cup down on the end table, gets up from the chair and stretches. Severus does his best to avoid looking at this.</p><p>“If you’ll excuse me, I’ll step out for a bit,” the boy announces. And after stroking the cat’s ears roughly, earning himself a muffled growl, Harry disappears into the hallway.</p><p>“Don’t toss your fag ends in my plant again!” Lupin calls out to him, shooting Severus an amused glance.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” comes the annoyed reply.</p><p>Not long after, they hear the front door open and shut softly.</p><p>Lupin takes a few more sips from his tea before putting the cup down. “Harry is James’ son,” he tells Severus quietly. “You remember my friend James Potter?”</p><p>Of course, Severus remembers. It’s always there, in the back of his mind, but time has gone by, and most of the time he doesn’t let it bother him. As soon as he neared Hoggarts yesterday though, all those memories resurfaced. But even then, he’d done his best to repress them. It’s been over twenty years, what good would come from dwelling on this again? But he <em>does</em> remember. In what<em> </em>world could he ever forget James Potter?</p><p>James Bloody Potter. He was in their year at Hoggarts. A spoiled, privileged kid who could smell all of Severus’ vulnerabilities like a hound hunting a prey and had tormented him for years.</p><p>From the look on Lupin’s face, he knows that Severus remembers everything – every insult, every threat, every humiliation. And he has this look of shame and embarrassment on his face. Let him be ashamed! For even if he’d never actively participated in said torment, Lupin had never done anything definite to stop it. He’d always been the voice of reason amongst his friends. He could have dissuaded them, but he never did.</p><p>Oddly enough, to this day Severus can’t help thinking that if Lupin hadn’t been friends with Potter and that miserable bastard Sirius Black, perhaps the two of them could have been friends back then. Somehow, this only makes the whole ordeal seem worse.</p><p>“I do,” he says simply, after a very long pause.</p><p>“James died when Harry was little, along with his wife. Maybe you remember her, too. Lily Evans?” Lupin’s voice is still unbearably softened, and he’s picked up his teacup again, though he isn’t drinking from it. Obviously, this is still a painful subject for him, even after all this time.</p><p>“I remember her.”</p><p>A pretty redhead with gorgeous green eyes. Which, apparently, she’s passed onto her son. Astoundingly, Severus remembers having fancied her for a year or two, before he discovered he wanted something else entirely. She’d always been kind to him – all smiles and asking him to exchange notes in class so they could compare each other’s work. She was smart as a whip, beautiful and elegant. How a girl like her could have ended up with James Potter eludes him.</p><p>“He changed, you know,” Lupin adds, looking straight at him. “James. In later years, he changed. His parents died when we were seventeen, only a few months apart. They weren’t young, but it was still a shock. That’s around the time he started dating Lily. When she got pregnant, it wasn’t planned, not so soon, but they decided to keep him. They both needed him, I think. Lily’s family was shit, James’ was dead, and he had a good inheritance. They wanted something of their own. They got married straight out of school. James did a lot of growing up, and I know he felt regret about how he acted when he was younger. I think... I think if he was still alive now and he saw you again, he would want to apologise for how he–”</p><p>“Well, we’ll never really know now, will we?” Severus says before taking a long, burning sip of his tea. He hasn’t said this sarcastically, not really. He just doesn’t feel like talking about all this and would very much love to just let it be water under the bridge and all that.</p><p>Lupin sighs heavily in response. “I just wanted to tell you now, before you found out. In case Harry let it slip. I know nothing I say can undo what James did, but please don’t let this cloud your opinion of Harry. He’s a great kid, terribly intelligent and he has a good heart–”</p><p>“You can rest easy, Lupin. I promise I'll make no attempts to destroy the perfect image of your dearly departed friend, which I’m more than certain you’ve done your utmost best to polish over the years, by heartlessly revealing to the boy the extent of his father’s... ignominy.”</p><p>Severus has to suppress a victorious smirk when he realises he’s managed to rid himself of that damned kind smile Lupin permanently sports.</p><p>“Ignominy?” Lupin says with an unexpected sneer. “Don't pretend you didn’t antagonise him every change you got!”</p><p>The rage comes like a warm thing curling up inside his chest, and for a second Severus can’t speak.</p><p>“Oh, <em>I</em> antagonised him?” he says softly, almost trembling with rage. “It was all <em>my</em> fault then, was it? I asked for it? I asked to be constantly humiliated?”</p><p>“You knew how he was!” Lupin hisses furiously. “He was a hot headed and insufferable show-off. If you'd just ignored him, he would have walked away. But no! You had to rile him up, every time...”</p><p>“Rile him up???”</p><p>Severus can’t believe this is happening. For a second, a fraction of a second, he wants to stand up and punch Lupin in the face. The impulse is so great that his legs tremble with the desire to lift him up. But he doesn’t move. He wants to curse Lupin and tell him his dead friend had it coming, that losing his precious parents and then getting himself killed was all he deserved.</p><p>He’s just about to insist, to press Lupin to continue and say what he was about to say. But at that very moment, they hear the front door opening and Severus falls silent. It's raining harder than before. He can hear it hitting the windowpanes.</p><p>They remain silent. They both sit there, staring darkly at each other. By the time Harry returns, his hair now shining with droplets of rain, they have both somewhat managed to regain their countenance, although Severus’ face feels warm and he’s certain it shows. After barely a glimpse of their faces, Harry snorts with laughter.</p><p>“What’s gotten into you two? Has Remus been rambling on about <em>Beowulf</em> again?” he asks Severus sympathetically as he curls back into the armchair, tucking his feet under his legs. “I know you think it’s revolutionary,” he tells Lupin, “but really it’s a complete bore.”</p><p>Severus clears his throat deeply before speaking. “You much prefer Tolkien, don't you? I noticed your tattoo earlier. Elvish, isn’t it?”</p><p>The way Harry grins at him jolts through his heart like lightning. “Yeah! Wow, you’re very observant,” the boy says, pushing back his sleeve to show him the complete tattoo running the full length of his forearm. The runes, Severus notes, are not black ink, but a dark blue. “It’s part of a quote from <em>The Two Towers</em>: It translates to, <em>Even darkness must pass</em>,” Harry recites softly.</p><p>“Beautiful,” Severus says before he can stop himself, unsure exactly whether he is talking about the quote, the tattoo, or the boy.</p><p>“<em>The Hobbit</em> was the first big book I read,” Harry says with a fond smile. “I found it at the bus stop when I was eight and brought it home without my uncle knowing. I’d read it in secret at night. Before long I’d read all the others,” he recalls, reaching out to grab a cake from the table and dipping it into his tea.</p><p>“So, Severus,” Lupin says suddenly, not quite looking either of them in the eye. “How long have you been back in London?”</p><p>“Only a few weeks.”</p><p>“Oh, have you been away?” Harry asks.</p><p>“I’ve lived in Paris for eighteen years,” Severus says, blowing softly on his tea. He burned his tongue earlier and the tip of it feels annoyingly rough.</p><p>Harry shakes his head. “Right. You studied in Paris, you said that. I didn’t know you lived there so long. My friend Hermione would know. She’s a big fan of yours. She’ll flip out when she finds out I had tea with you,” he says with a laugh that almost manages to kill Severus on the spot.</p><p>“I met only Severus again yesterday,” Lupin says. “It was quite unexpected. We hadn’t talked since Hoggarts.”</p><p>“Were you good friends in school?”</p><p>“Acquaintances,” Severus says shortly, before Lupin can speak. Best cut this subject short as soon as possible, he thinks, lest the conversation deviates to the boy’s father. The last thing Harry needs is a repetition of the altercation he’s just missed.</p><p>“I bet you were a raven,” Harry says with a smirk.</p><p>Lupin snorts, but Severus ignores him. “Actually, I was a snake.”</p><p>Harry pouts adorably at this. “Well, my friend Ron always says I’m a terrible judge of character. Guess this only proves him right.”</p><p>“Is Dumbledore still around?” Severus asks curiously.</p><p>“He retired three years ago,” Lupin says in between sips of his tea. “McGonagall is headmistress now. The first woman since the school was founded.”</p><p>“Frankly, I’m surprised Dumbledore lasted that long,” Severus remarks. “I thought he died years ago.”</p><p>“It was a close call. He was only a heap of dry bones by the end,” Harry adds. “Dry bones in a purple three-piece suit.”</p><p>Lupin winces. “The school is in good hands now. Better hands. Less… frivolous, let’s say.”</p><p>“I liked Dumbledore’s frivolous hands,” Harry says with a grin.</p><p>“Yes, yes, the students all liked Dumbledore. The parents and the Board members, on the other hand… Most of them were happy to see him go. He got considerably barmier the older he got.”</p><p>Harry scoffs into his teacup. “Rubbish. What’s their excuse for keeping Binns then?”</p><p>Severus can’t hide the shock on his face. “Binns is still teaching? For Christ’s sake, he must be older than–”</p><p>“Than <em>Christ</em>, by now. Probably,” Harry says. “Only <em>he</em> didn’t get barmier with age. Only more and more boring.”</p><p>“I’m certain <em>boring</em> is an understatement,” Severus adds.</p><p>“Be nice, you two,” Lupin scolds. “Professor Binns is a kind man who’s worked hard for many years–”</p><p>“<em>Years</em> is also an understatement,” Harry interrupts, grinning at Severus, whose heart trembles in delight.</p><p>“How about Filch?” Severus asks, turning to look at Lupin so as to try and catch his breath a little. “Still terrifying students?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>Lupin groans at the thought of the old caretaker. “He’s got himself that grotty cat now. Mrs Norris, he calls her.”</p><p>“Demonic-looking thing," Harry mutters.</p><p>“Some stray he found in a side alley. Took her under his wing. Somehow, he’s managed to get permission to let her roam school property,” Lupin continues. “He seems to believe he trained her to catch students misbehaving.”</p><p>“And about once a month, someone covers her with glue and he has a fit,” Harry adds.</p><p>“Only one of the many traditions the Weasley twins have left behind,” Lupin says in a somewhat bitter tone.</p><p>“My best friend’s brothers,” Harry tells Severus. “They once shaved her fur into curse words. Oh, don’t look so patronising,” he tells Lupin. “It wasn’t <em>me</em>! I know you did worse in your time. I’ve heard the stories.”</p><p>“It wasn’t me either!” Lupin says defensively. “It was your dad and Sirius–” He trails off, shooting Severus a worried look.</p><p>Severus has to repress a smirk. Here Lupin was, worried that Harry would let it slip, would mention his father, and that they'd be forced to discuss this painful history they have, when, lo and behold, he's just let the cat out of the bag himself.</p><p>Harry stares at the two of them in turn, and he seems about to say something when Lupin cuts him off.</p><p>“So, Harry, what have you been reading lately?”</p><p>The boy doesn’t answer immediately. He looks at Lupin, then at Severus. Lupin is fidgeting, and Severus is sure he must have a somewhat satisfied look on his face. Harry knows what they're avoiding. It's blatantly obvious.</p><p>“Flaubert,” he says finally.</p><p>Lupin smiles, seemingly relieved that he's conceded to change the subject. "Are you done with Proust already?"</p><p>“Finished it last week. I’m on <em>Madame Bovary</em> now.”</p><p>“You’ve read Proust?” Severus asks, surprised.</p><p>He’s never heard of anyone reading Proust without having to, be it for a class or some official reason, let alone a nineteen-year-old kid.</p><p>“Not the whole thing. Just the first two volumes. I’m taking a break now before number three.”</p><p>“He thinks <em>Beowulf</em> is a bore and yet he likes Proust,” Lupin says disbelievingly with a shake of his head.</p><p>“It’s not for everyone, it’s true, but I enjoyed it as well,” Severus tells Harry, who beams at him in return.</p><p>The boy then starts talking about which parts of the story he liked best, making observations and parallels to other works Severus never would have thought anyone his age had even heard about, all the while carefully ignoring Lupin’s presence and attempts to join the conversation.</p><p>What can possibly be going on here? Obviously, Harry had noticed the tension when he’d returned. He would be an idiot not to, and it’s obvious to Severus by now that he's no idiot. And, of course, Lupin and he must have a much more complicated relationship than simply professor and former student, given how close the man was to Harry’s father. But even then, what would make a gorgeous nineteen-year-old visit an old professor, unannounced, on a Friday night when he could be going out and getting rat-arsed with his friends?</p><p>Now that he knows about Harry’s parentage, Severus finds himself searching for James Potter in him. At first, he’s convinced that this will explain the feeling of déjà vu from earlier. But he can’t find a resemblance. Well, there <em>are</em> a few physical similarities, to be completely honest, but they are so thoroughly thwarted by the difference in mannerism as to be completely eclipsed.</p><p>James Potter was the epitome of rugged masculinity. He was loud and obnoxious and completely devoid of anything resembling gracefulness. Harry, however, has a sort of fluidity to his movements that his father never had. He possesses a natural elegance which, when Severus thinks about it, reminds him more of Lily Evans. Harry is all wit, bright smiles and quiet energy, and Severus finds his presence soothing. He feels surprisingly at ease around the boy, which is unusual for someone he’s only just met.</p><p>The clock on Lupin’s mantel strikes nine.</p><p>“I really should go,” Harry says apologetically. “I’ve got work early tomorrow.”</p><p>Severus feels his heart sink as he watches the boy stand up. Lupin stands too, much too quickly, in his opinion, and he looks... relieved. Tired of being ignored, is he?</p><p>Far from eager to be left alone with Lupin, Severus follows them into the hallway. “I best be off, too,” he announces.</p><p>Astoundingly enough, Lupin looks, if only for a fraction of a second, devastated by the news. What is wrong with the man? Was he truly expecting Severus to stick around so they could continue their earlier... discussion.</p><p>“You heading for the tube?” Harry asks. “We can walk together. It's stopped raining.”</p><p>Lupin looks positively grief-stricken, and then Severus understands. It’s not Harry’s behaviour, nor Severus’ presence that’s troubling him. It’s Harry and Severus. It’s the two of them talking and laughing and getting along that he has a problem with.</p><p>“Yes, of course we can walk together,” Severus says, doing his best not to smirk.</p><p>Harry grins at him and his heart trembles in his ribcage. Good God, he’s worse than a teenager!</p><p>Meanwhile, Lupin has turned an unappealing shade of red and seems to be searching desperately for a way to intervene without making his purpose or desperation show. Severus quite enjoys watching this internal battle.</p><p>Harry is busy slipping his boots on, seemingly unaware of what’s happening. </p><p>“Remember what I said earlier... about Draco...” Lupin tells him, his voice soft, not so low as to prevent Severus from hearing, but enough so that he understands this is for Harry alone. “Don’t call him back. You don’t need to. You’ll be fine–”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, I’ll be fine,” Harry replies a little brusquely, “I get it.”</p><p>While the two of them are quietly arguing, Severus stares uncomfortably at a painting near the staircase, a reproduction of Monet’s <em>Thames below Westminster</em>.</p><p>How obvious, how commonplace. How perfect for Lupin’s house. The same painting that used to hang in Severus’ bedroom and which he’d thrown away in disgust.</p><p>When he turns back, Harry is putting on his coat in a hurry. “I’ll wait for you outside,” the boy tells him moodily, and then he's out the door without a last glance towards Lupin, who just stands there, awkwardly powerless.</p><p>“Teenagers, right?” the man mutters with a nervous chuckle.</p><p>“Well, Lupin,” Severus says, putting on his own coat, “this has been an... interesting evening.”</p><p>Is there a cordial way to tell the man he hopes they won’t see each other for another twenty years? Why is he even trying to be cordial at this point?</p><p>“I can’t say it went anything like I thought it would,” Lupin says quietly.</p><p>Severus huffs softly, shaking his head. “And what did you expect? It was a nice gesture, Lupin, inviting me here tonight. Truly, it was. But there’s too much history between us. Try as we might, we’ll never be friends, and you know it.”</p><p>“I know, I know,” Lupin acknowledges, nodding humbly. “It was naïve of me to even consider. But it’s just… When I saw you yesterday, I thought… I mean, I wanted to…” he trails off uncomfortably. “Constance is very worried about you, and I thought–”</p><p>Severus chuckles dryly. Now <em>this</em> explains everything.</p><p>“Well, you’ll be glad to know that there’s no need to pretend to befriend me and report to my cousin anymore. I’ve spoken to her and we’re planning to meet very soon. Now that it’s all settled, you can continue about your business and kindly stay out of mine.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Severus. I didn’t mean to upset you.”</p><p>“I’m not upset,” Severus all but snaps. “I suppose I should have known you two would be keeping in touch. The great star-crossed lovers,” he adds derisively. “The lion who fell in love with the snake.”</p><p>Because yes, Constance and Lupin had danced around each other for years, much to Severus’ greatest dismay. Constance admired Lupin’s kindness and bookish nature, and he’s certain Lupin must have found her elegance and intelligence attractive – not to mention that strangely enticing, mildly gothic phase she went through at fifteen, which doubled her number of suitors. And yet they never became a couple, never even fooled around the slightest bit.</p><p>He likes to believe it was because of the way Lupin’s horrible friends treated her cousin that Constance never pursued him. But all in all, it was probably because, despite her affection for Lupin, the fact that he came from an unknown lower-middle class family and only attended Hoggarts as a fellow deterred her. Constance had always given prime importance to the Prince name, after all. Or maybe she’d only been waiting for <em>him</em> to make the first move, but Lupin, even though he was the sort to claim open-mindedness and pride himself on being completely devoid of prejudice, resented her financial situation and good name.</p><p>Or maybe he simply thought himself inadequate. And he would have been right to.</p><p>If Remus Lupin were a body of water, Severus decides then, bitterly, he would be the Dead Sea. Nothing grows in there. It has no wildlife, nothing interesting swimming beneath the surface. You can’t even really drown in it, you just float around.</p><p>“We’re both married now,” Lupin says coldly. “To different people, thank you very much.”</p><p>“To be honest,” Severus sneers, “I half-expected to find you married to Black. There were bets, you know, on how long it would take you both to come to your senses.”</p><p>He knows he’s struck a nerve from the furious look on Lupin’s face. But his hand is already on the doorknob, and Harry is waiting for him.</p><p>“It was a pleasure, Lupin,” he says dryly before leaving.</p><p>The sound of the door closing behind him is an absolute delight. Oh, how Severus <em>loves</em> having the last word.</p><p>Outside, the rain has stopped, and everything seems to shine in the crisp evening air. Harry is leaning on a parked car, typing on his phone. Severus approaches him, once again struck at how beautiful he is.</p><p>The boy lets out a snort of laughter and shows him the screen. On it is a series of text messages exchanged with someone named <em>Hermione</em>. Surely the friend he mentioned earlier.</p><p align="right">
  <em>You’ll never guess </em>
  <br/>
  <em>who I just met </em>
  <br/>
  <em>at Lupin’s</em>
</p><p align="left">
  <em>Who?</em>
</p><p align="right">
  <em>Severus Prince</em>

  <em>Shut your face!!!</em>
</p><p>“Shouldn’t have told her now,” Harry says with a grin before slipping the phone into his pocket, “she’ll be nagging me all night. Want one?” he asks, pulling out a pack of Marlboros.</p><p>Severus shakes his head and watches in silence as the boy lights one and inhales deeply.</p><p>“I lied, you know,” Harry mumbles around a mouthful of smoke, “about working early. I’ve got the day off tomorrow, but I just had to get out of there.” He pauses for a second, letting out the smoke in a long stream. “Remus means well but sometimes he’s a complete arse.”</p><p>“You don’t have to tell me.”</p><p>They stand there for a moment, just looking at each other. Harry has developed smoking to an art form that fascinates Severus. Everyone smokes in Paris, but he’s never taken up the habit himself. Watching Harry smoke, however, is strangely erotic. It feels like watching something that ought to be done in private. He wants to say something, anything, but he’s speechless. He’s a bloody poet, and here he is, standing speechless in front of a nineteen-year-old boy.</p><p>After a minute or so, Harry starts down the street calmly. Severus follows him without a word. He has a feeling Lupin might be peering at them through his living room blinds.</p><p>For a long moment, there is only the sound of their footsteps on the wet pavement.</p><p>“So, I bet my dad was a prick to you too, huh?” Harry says suddenly as they turn the corner onto the main road.</p><p>Severus’ steps falter, only for a second, while he struggles with what to say next. There is an unmistakable note of bitterness in Harry’s voice that strikes him deeply, and when he looks at the boy's profiled face, half-obscured in the darkened street, Severus finds him frowning in a way that makes him look much older.</p><p>“It’s alright,” Harry continues with a dry chuckle that comes out in a cloud of smoke. “I won’t get upset. I’ve heard it all. Hoggarts is a small school and stories stick around for ages. Besides, I’m not that thick, I know you and Remus weren’t the best of friends. It was bloody obvious the moment you walked in there.” He jerks his head in the general direction of Lupin’s house and clears the ashes from his fag with a moody flick of his wrist. “I'm sorry, you know...” he says between two long drags. “For what it’s worth...”</p><p>“There’s no need for you to apologise,” Severus tells him. “You had nothing to do with this.”</p><p>“I didn’t really know my parents,” Harry says softly, looking alternately into the distance, or down towards the pavement, anywhere but in Severus’ direction. “They died before I could remember them properly. And I didn’t really know anything at all about them until I got into Hoggarts. My aunt and uncle, the ones who raised me, they didn’t talk about them. And I’d imagined all sorts of things, wondering what they were like… All this time I’d been idolising my dad, and when I found out he was nothing but a bully... I was furious.”</p><p>“He really was not so terrible as that,” Severus tells him quietly, and after all this time, he can somewhat convince himself of it. All this seems so far away. “You know how children can be.”</p><p>Harry laughs dryly. “You sound just like Remus. He always says that, that it wasn't as bad as I think. But most of the time, he doesn't even want to talk about it, so how can I know for sure? He never wants to talk about <em>anything</em>. Says there's no use discussing it, that the past is the past... My therapist says I shouldn’t see him so much… That his refusing to discuss these things is <em>detrimental to my recovery</em>...”</p><p>He falls abruptly silent. Once more, Severus doesn’t know what to say. Harry is probably embarrassed to have mentioned he has a therapist, but it would be terribly hypocritical of Severus to judge him for that when he’s not even brave enough to actually talk to one himself.</p><p>“So...” Harry says after a while, “what made you want to move to Paris?”</p><p>“Well, I wanted to become a poet,” Severus explains, grateful for the change of subject. “And at the time I thought the only way to do so was to follow in the footsteps of the great.”</p><p>“The great?”</p><p>“Baudelaire, Verlaine, Rimbaud…”</p><p>“Rimbaud? Isn’t he the one who pissed on a table once?”</p><p>“Yes… When I was your age, I thought he was a god.”</p><p>Harry throws his head back and his laughter mixes in with the smoke. Severus is convinced he’s never seen anything so beautiful in his entire life.</p><p>“You must’ve been such a pretentious little shit,” the boy says with disbelief.</p><p>Severus can't help but smirk. “You have no idea.”</p><p>“I like Baudelaire, though. He’s the one who said you should always be drunk, that it’s the only way to appreciate life.”</p><p>“<em>So as not to feel the horrible burden of time that breaks your back and bends you to the earth, you have to be continually drunk. But on what? Wine, poetry or virtue, as you wish. But be drunk,”</em> Severus recites flawlessly in French.</p><p>He’s glad it’s dark outside so Harry cannot see the blush that’s surely spreading on his face. Why, oh <em>why</em> can’t he just refrain himself from showing off?</p><p>Harry laughs again, but in no way mockingly. “Did you learn French in Paris?”</p><p>“I certainly polished it, but it’s a language that’s always appealed to me. Mostly I learned it when I was younger, through a lot of reading, and the lessons Hoggarts offered. Does it still have the language program?”</p><p>“Yeah, it does. I took Italian.”</p><p>“Why Italian?”</p><p>“Oh, there was a cute exchange student in my year, and I wanted to talk dirty to him,” Harry says with a shrug.</p><p><em>Him</em><em>?</em> Severus’ heart gives a joyous lurch. </p><p>“Turns out they don’t teach you that stuff in class,” the boy continues, oblivious to the reaction his offhanded words just caused. “But I got pretty good. I spent the summer in Rome when I was fourteen. That really helped. I try to keep practicing, though. I still have a pen pal. Rosa. We keep in touch with Facebook and all. Do you miss it? Paris, I mean.”</p><p>Severus doesn’t answer immediately, still troubled by that fleeting revelation. His mind keeps screaming at him to get over it, but still he keeps repeating the words in his head, over and over, until he’s not even sure he’s heard them right. Should he comment on that? Or ask Harry to repeat what he just said? No, definitely not! That would just give the wrong impression. He should just keep his mouth shut. Besides... <em>Oh, bloody hell! Does it even matter if the boy shares your fancies? It’s not like you have a chance with him either way!</em></p><p>Harry is looking at him expectantly. Yes, right, he’s asked Severus a question. Does he miss Paris? He’s not entirely sure himself. Yes, he’s been back in London for almost three weeks, but he feels he hasn’t seen enough of it to really know.</p><p>He clears his throat deeply. “I miss... the little things. Fresh bread in the morning from the bakery on the corner. I miss the smell of the air. And the terraces... London has a lot to learn from Paris.”</p><p>Harry grins. “The smell? Really? I’ve always heard that it stinks in Paris. Besides, if London had terraces, we’d just be drinking rainwater.”</p><p>“Good point,” Severus admits with a smile.</p><p>“Jack Kerouac wrote that Paris is a woman, but London is an old man puffing on a pipe in a pub.”</p><p>“That’s a beautiful metaphor.”</p><p>Severus has never actually gotten around to reading Kerouac, but he doesn’t say so. He hates admitting things like that.</p><p>They’ve reached Pimlico Station. Harry flicks his fag end carelessly onto the street and slips his hands in his pockets. Severus follows him inside and down the stairs, neither of them speaking.</p><p>There is so much Severus wants to ask him, but he keeps his mouth shut. <em>Do you have a boyfriend?</em> seems hardly appropriate coming from a man old enough to be his father. A man who knew, and was tormented by, his father. And even if Harry answered no? There is no way in hell he’d be interested in Severus, let alone attracted to him. And yet... Yet Severus desperately wants to ask. But the thought of Harry laughing at him... like his father has done so many times before, though not for the same reasons, of course. Surely Severus would die from the embarrassment.</p><p>They are headed separate ways. Severus is southbound to take the Northern Line home, and Harry says he’s off to meet up with some friends. Then he looks at Severus for a time, conflicted, as if he wants to say something more. Or ask something more. <em>Ask me</em>, Severus thinks. <em>Please, please, ask me</em>.</p><p>He has almost gathered up the courage to ask for the boy’s number himself when Harry finally speaks.</p><p>“It was really nice to meet you, Severus.”</p><p>“You as well,” Severus says softly, his mouth terribly dry. <em>Say something else, you bloody idiot!</em> he berates himself. <em>Speak now. Now, now!</em></p><p>Harry pauses again. “Good night then,” he says after a moment.</p><p>And Severus watches as he walks away then disappears down the stairs to the platform. It feels like sand running through his fingers. The top of his head tingles wildly. But he ignores it, like the coward he is.</p><p>He’s so lost in thought that he barely remembers making the journey back to his flat. He does it all on autopilot, letting his feet and his subconscious lead the way. Somehow, he manages to switch lines and reach his station. It’s pouring again when he gets out, and he walks through it all, through the freezing sheets, and he soaks it all in. It doesn’t matter.</p><p>When he gets home, he sits in the dark at the kitchen table, dripping water, a puddle forming on his chair and on the floor.</p><p>“Harry,” he whispers into the silence. Just to test how the name sounds from his mouth, how it feels on his lips.</p><p><em>Harry</em>. So simple. Barely two syllables. Half a whisper.</p><p>Severus is shivering. Whether from the rain or something else. He’s so cold it’s indescribable. Inside and out. Just pure, biting, raw coldness.</p><p>In this moment, if Severus were a body of water, he would be a vast, unnamed sea in the Arctic. The kind that’s so cold it makes your heart stop when you fall into it.<br/><br/></p><p> </p>
