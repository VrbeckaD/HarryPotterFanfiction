    <p>She couldn’t believe she was feeling this way. About Draco Malfoy of all people! What had gotten into her? She was usually so logical. </p>
<p>But what was he doing being so nice to her lately? Clearly he wanted something from her. Probably her notes from Transfiguration the other day when she’d noticed he’d been absent. Wait, why had she noticed that? She normally paid no mind to the ferret, as Ron called him. It was a fairly apt nickname, but slightly immature and cruel. She tried to avoid using it, except in her own mind. </p>
<p>Just yesterday he’d asked her if she was deaf beneath that “beautiful raven’s nest of hair.” She’d thought she’d been imagining it at first. Then she’d blushed and ducked her head to hide behind her hair. But had it really been a compliment or just a slip of the tongue? Maybe even an insult in disguise to get her to let down her guard so he could hurt her even more. </p>
<p>Stop! She would not contemplate these silly things any longer! She had homework to do. </p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Hermione sighed to herself as she sat in her favourite chair in the library. She hated to admit it, but she was lonely. She wished she had someone that would study with her. But Ron and Harry just weren’t interested. </p>
<p>In fact, if they were here, they’d probably ruin her concentration. Which was generally the reason she escaped to the library anyway, so why was she feeling this way all of a sudden? </p>
<p>Someone cleared their throat behind her. She ignored the noise, desperately re-reading the same sentence that she’d read three times already in a futile attempt to regain her concentration. It just wasn’t working and she sighed again, this time with frustration, pushing her hair back from her forehead with unnecessary force. </p>
<p>“Keep it down over there Granger, some of us are trying to study you know!” came a familiarly frustrating voice. </p>
<p>“Malfoy. Why am I surprised?” she retorted, not looking up from the pile of papers before her. </p>
<p>“Don’t know Granger. Why are you?” he asked insolently. </p>
<p>She shook her head to herself, deciding to take the moral high ground and not answer back, no matter how tempted she was to answer with the perfect one-liner that was trailing its way around in her mind and distracting her even more than her loneliness had just a few moments before. </p>
<p>She tried yet again to focus on the work before her and found it impossible. All it was doing was giving her a headache. Even humming one of her favourite Muggle songs didn’t help at all, so she gave up with one final dramatic sigh and laid her head on the desk, using her hair as a pillow. It wasn’t very comfortable, it never had been so Lord knew why she still tried it every time she couldn’t be bothered to walk all the way back to her dorm to take a proper nap. </p>
<p>***</p>
<p>She stretched out the kinks in her neck as she opened her eyes. How long had she been sleeping? </p>
<p>“One whole hour, Granger,” Malfoy’s voice answered her unspoken question. Was he a mind reader now? </p>
<p>“I didn’t ask you!” she snapped. </p>
<p>He looked confused. “Ugh, yeah you did,” he sneered, a frown marring his handsome features. Wait, did she just call him handsome? </p>
<p>“Oh…” was her oh-so-intelligent response to that. </p>
<p>She continued stretching for another minute or so, then glanced at the blank sheet of paper before her, resting so innocently on the scratched wood of the desk. Hermione Granger with writer’s block! Who would have thought? A polar bear in a snowstorm had never been one of the issues she’d faced as a student. Normally the words just flowed like water off a cliff and into the ocean, drop after drop of ink onto the page, gradually adding to the multitude of words already in existence. </p>
<p>Hesitantly, she picked up the quill that lay near her right hand, figuring that writing something down on the page would be better than nothing at all. She crossed her fingers and hoped that once she had something written down the rest would follow, like it always did. </p>
<p>She dipped her quill in the ink jar and pressed the tip of the quill to the page. After a few seconds she lifted it without having moved it to form anything. Now a small black circle, still damp, marred her otherwise perfect piece of paper. She added a horizontal line to the dot, dragging it about a centimetre from the small round dot. Then she stopped. What was she doing? This was not like her at all! </p>
<p>She cocked her head to the side, realised her impromptu doodling was looking far too geometric. She added a gentle curve to the flat line, curving downwards in a slightly spiral formation. It was no wonder people did this in class all the time. She’d always sneered at them, but it was really quite fun. </p>
<p>She chuckled quietly to herself, shocked by this realisation. </p>
<p>“Could you keep it down over there Granger? Otherwise I’ll come over there and hex you!” Malfoy exclaimed, throwing his quill down as he got to his feet. </p>
<p>He stomped toward her and she tried not to let her fear show. She hated to admit it, but she was slightly scared of him and what he might do to her if she had truly angered him enough. But her pride stopped her from apologising. In fact, it kept her as silent as a mouse as she tried to hide her shaking from him. Was it just her or was it unusually cold in here? Funny how she’d never noticed that before. </p>
<p>She looked up and there he was, looming over her. She tried not to notice how good-looking he was from this angle, as she’ d never seen him this close up before. As she looked him right in his grey eyes, she found it impossible to hold back the shivers wracking her body. The room really was getting colder. How late was it now anyway? She for one wouldn’t mind knowing how much sleep she was missing out on in her lovely comfortable bed back in the Gryffindor dorm room. </p>
<p>“You look exhausted,” Malfoy said softly. “You should go and get some sleep. It’s clear you’re not going to finish whatever you’ve been working on tonight, judging by the way you’ve been doodling more badly than Weasel in Potions when he doesn’t know what to do, which is always. Besides, knowing you, it’s probably not due for another fortnight anyway.” </p>
<p>She just looked at him. If you’d asked her to describe the expression on her face, even if she’d had a mirror she wouldn’t have known, she was that confused. Why was Malfoy being this nice? And how did he know that she’d decided to start early on the assignment they’d been assigned earlier in the lesson of Transfiguration he’d missed? Was that why she was so befuddled? </p>
<p>Eventually, when she’d sorted out her thoughts to the furthest extent that they could be at this late hour, she nodded at him. She started to pack up her things, moving like a snail because she was just that tired and her mind seemed to have flown away out of the stained glass windows like that ridiculous golden Snitch-thing that Harry was always chasing after for some reason in his Quidditch matches. </p>
<p>“Do you want some help?” Hermione jumped at the sound of Malfoy’s voice right behind her, as she’d thought he’d have gone back to his own desk by now. “Gee, you scare easily for a Gryffindor, Granger,” he chuckled softly, and damn her for thinking it was one of the sexiest sounds she’d ever heard in her short life. </p>
<p>“Umm, no thanks,” she replied absent-mindedly when she realised she hadn’t replied yet, and despite the fact that this was just Malfoy and she didn’t normally care what he thought, considering he was being so nice, she figured the least she could do was be polite in return. </p>
<p>A pale but muscular arm snaked its way around her, barely brushing over her waist as it passed. It helped her pack up her mess of notes that she’d spread out all over the breadth of the table, making full use of the space hours ago when she’d sat down to do a few hours of study before she went to bed. Gosh, had it really been that long ago when she’d come in here? She hadn’t realised. </p>
<p>In no time at all, all her things were packed up and in order, and the pale arm belonging to none other than Draco Malfoy withdrew back past her waist, avoiding touching her this time. She turned around to face him, to thank him of course. She wouldn’t have anyone think her rude, not even her arch-enemy! </p>
<p>Except when she turned around he was right in front of her, closer than she’d expected him to be. She was suddenly more flustered than she should be around him, her eyes fixed on the floor. She was in Gryffindor, what was she doing? Where had her bravery gone? <br/>So she looked up, briefly made eye contact and quietly thanked him as she did. Then she bent over, grabbed her things from the table and raced past him and out of the library. Who knew she could move that quickly? She certainly didn’t.</p>
