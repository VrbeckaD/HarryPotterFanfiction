          <div class="userstuff"><p>Lord Voldemort, the Darkest Lord of all time, strode down the suburban muggle street, wand in his sleeve. He wore a dark green muggle suit with a green and silver tie (of course) and, as a disguise, a fake moustache. </p><p> </p><p>Not that anyone would recognize him here, of course. It was a typical summer Tuesday, in Little Whinging, Surrey. All the houses looked the same: brick, with poo-coloured tops. Even his destination, the Little Whinging movie theatre, was a brick square. </p><p> </p><p>He arrived at the theatre ten minutes before his film was supposed to start. He bought a ticket at the front desk, reveling in the obvious apprehension of the muggle there. That was why he was here: to find out what muggles feared so he could ensure their terror when he had taken over the world. </p><p> </p><p>His ticket was for a film that had come out in 1988, directed by George Sluzier. Supposedly the original, the one he was seeing, was much better than the newer remake. It was a horror film, especially scary for muggles.</p><p> </p><p>Lord Voldemort ordered a bucket of popcorn and a Coke. He chose a seat in the middle of the theatre. There weren’t many other people there - just a short teenager in the front, who was turning to look at the only other person seeing a thriller film on a Tuesday afternoon in summer.</p><p> </p><p>“Voldemort!” shouted the person.</p><p> </p><p>Lord Voldemort looked more closely at the person. Green eyes, black hair, lighting scar - by Merlin, it was Potter!</p><p> </p><p>“Harry Potter,” he said.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve come to kill me before I’ve even seen a film?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve never seen a film before?” asked Lord Voldemort in surprise.</p><p> </p><p>Potter shook his head. “Never.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well. You’d better watch this one, then. And I won’t be killing you today, there’s no audience.”</p><p> </p><p>Potter laughed. “I think we are the audience.” He looked pointedly at the screen, which was now showing an advert for ketchup.</p><p> </p><p>Lord Voldemort laughed back. “You know what I mean.” He decided to sacrifice his seat for the dubious pleasure of Potter’s company - well. It would be a pleasure for him to see Potter’s discomfort. He couldn’t imagine Potter finding his company pleasurable.</p><p> </p><p>Potter looked at him in surprise. “What!” he squeaked.</p><p> </p><p>Lord Voldemort shrugged. “Why not?” he asked.</p><p> </p><p>Potter opened his mouth, and left it that way, looking quite ridiculous. “Really,” tutted Voldemort, reaching over and nudging Potter’s jaw closed, “the supposed Saviour of the Wizarding World making a face like that.”</p><p> </p><p>Harry flushed, but before anything else could happen, the film started.</p><p> </p><p>“Popcorn?” offered Voldemort.</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” said Potter absentmindedly, reaching over and taking a handful.</p></div>
