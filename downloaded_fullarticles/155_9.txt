    <p>Link was riding in the interdimensional spacer time bus of the four legged mutant bus driver. The four legged mutant bus driver was like "Time to go to hogwarts." so link got off the bus and walked into hogwarts. And then dumbledore said, "I apologize for the rudeness of this question, but who the flying fuckedy fuck might you be, young one?"</p><p>"I am Link, and this is my fairy friend Navy," replied Link, pointing to the aforementioned fairy.</p><p>"Hi, I'm Navy," said Navi.</p><p>"Well then a jolly good pleasure to meat both of you," said Dumbledore britishly, because he's from britishland(It's an island in asia,) "Link you must be a wizward, because the muggle repelling charms didn't send you flying into a hogwarts toilet."</p><p>"K, what's a hogwarts toilet?" Link asked wisely.</p><p>"A Hogfarts Toilet is a bloody toilet found at the geographical location of hogwarts of course. Now, will you be joining the bloody school?" asked Dumbptydore with a british accent.</p><p>"Sire, why not. The interdimensional four legged mutant bus driver said it was time to go to hogwarts so I probably should. The four legged mutant bus driver has never steered (LOL! GEDDIT?! CAUSE HE DRIVES A BUS AND THEREFORE STEERS A WHEEL! RRRROOOFFFFLLLLMMMMAAAOOO) me wrong before," Link replied even more wiselier.</p><p>"Excellent, but you'll jolly well need some bloody money to buy your school things," britished Dumbledore.</p><p>"I have money, I have rupees," Said link holding up a green rupee.</p><p>"Hmm," Said dumbledore opening a magazine in a british manor, "Accordion to fictional currencies monthly, 1 rupee is worth eleventy billion galleons, so you probably have enough."</p><p>"Awesometasticular!" Said link happily.</p><p>"Indeed so, now will you need bloody assistance in diagonally?" Asked Udmelborskador britishly.</p><p>"No thanks, just directions should be fine" replied link. "I've never gotten lost before, but even if I did, one of navi's fairy powers is to know everything."</p><p>"Sure bloody thing," Re-replied Dumbledore while explaining the directions of how to get to Diagon Ally Britishly.</p><p>"Kthx" Said link while playing the ocarina and dancing a Kokiri Jig and walking off toward diagonally while riding his unicycle and juggling fish.</p><p>Link went forth happily riding his unicycle into shops, who clapped at his impressive unicycling skills, since he could ride on it as fast as a normal person could ride a bycicle except a billion times faster and with incredibly precise precision. But some wizards and/or witches were angry at the muggle contraption and tried to avada kedavra link, so link played the song of time to open a time hole and pull the master sword out of the time hole which he then used to deflect the avada kedavra beams back at the evil wizards who tried to kill him, killing them instantly. Some aurors came to arrest link but some people pointed out that they were evil dead wizards who tried to avada kedavra link which was good because it meant link didn't have to deflect their subduing spells until they collapsed of exhaustion.</p><p>Link spent the entire day buying a buncha stuff and bought a lot of stuff, he converted 2 of his rupees into galleons at Green Got's so he had twenty twoty billion galleons and spent 50, so he put the other 775,999,654,128,546,228,214,864 Galleons in his Infinity wallet that he got from the ultimate great fairy that lives on the four legged mutant bus driver's four legged mutant bus. It was able to hold infinite Munny. That's why it's the infinite wallet. Then link went and bought books, and potions crap, and a wand that was made of the ancient burning phoenix of the sun, and the wood of an ebony tree. Link went to sleep at the inn for seven weeks and it was time to head back to hogwarts to get sorted.</p><p>Students were supposed to go on the warthog train, but Link was no mood for such idiotic fiddle faddlery, so he simply waited until the last second before mcgonagall would call his name to be sorted and leapt into the air with lightening fast speed all the way to above hogwarts and crashed through the roof, then used the glider to gently float down into the sorting chair for mcgonagall to place the sorting hat upon his head.</p><p>"Gryffindor," said the sorting hat.</p><p>"Cool," said Link.</p><p>"Detention," said Mcgonagall.</p><p>"Nah," said Link.</p><p>"What do you mean nah?!" Macdonald Demanded.</p><p>"Link is kind of... Above any sort of restrictions on anything, they're his antithesis, for he comes to free those bold enough to follow his path to the end of all reason," Said Navi wisely.</p><p>Link nodded helpfully.</p><p>"Well then he is quite free to leave," Mcgonnacall sternly said, for though she wasn't evil, her heart was full of chains and horribleness.</p><p>"Nope, I'm staying! I'm bound to no law and travel where I wish! Such is the nature of the truest soul! Exclaimed link with such virtue that the chains around mcgogganal's heart began to slowly crack, and she fainted from the newfound freedom and had to be winged with a hospital."</p><p>Meanwhile the students were escorted to their common rooms and link said a boy with a lightning scar off his forehead. So link introduced himself "Hello, my name is Link, and this is my farty Navi."</p><p>"Hi I'm Parry Hotter, Nice to meet you," Harry shook Link's foot. And then they went to bed sleep.</p><p>End</p>
