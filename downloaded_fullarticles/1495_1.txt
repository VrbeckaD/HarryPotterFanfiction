    <p>Marcus watched his father standing behind the podium in his impeccably tailored suit and stiff tie. He felt some pride at seeing him give a speech, but this pride was interrupted by a person asking the bartender for the remote. The screen on which his father spoke flickered, before changing channels. </p>
<p>“Don’t want to listen to that political garbage.” The man who had changed channels laughed. “Especially Flint. I mean, did you hear about his plans for the football field?”</p>
<p>Frowning, Marcus wondered what the stranger was talking about. “No. I didn’t hear about them.”</p>
<p>“He wants to replace the local field for a hotel. ‘Increase tourism and the region’s economy’ or some shite.”</p>
<p>Marcus gaped. Hesitant and unwilling to believe the stranger, he checked his phone and sure enough, Google confirmed it. </p>
<p>“Well that’s bloody typical.” It was just like his father to overlook his only son’s passion for football in favour of increasing his chance at becoming mayor. Football was what Marcus lived and breathed; without the field he had no clue what he would do. </p>
<p>Sighing, he looked down into his glass and swirled the amber liquid around before draining it. His father knew that he loved football, but that wasn’t important. It never had been. Since Marcus was a child the only careers that Cygnus Flint had encouraged were those with high success rates and impressive earnings. Once he had started high school, Marcus’ father had realised that his son’s low grades would not lead him to being a lawyer or accountant. Football was all it seemed that Marcus was good at, but Cygnus still ignored it. Being athletic wouldn’t ensure a good job. </p>
<p>His thoughts becoming angry, Marcus slammed the empty glass on the bar and pushed his chair back. When he was angry he needed an outlet and football provided that. Hailing a cab, Marcus paid the driver to take him to the field. If it was going to be replaced with a hotel then he might as well make the most of it. </p>
<p>It was that train of thought that had caused Oliver Wood to also venture to the football field. He repeatedly kicked the ball around, the exercise keeping his body warm in the cool evening. He hoped more than ever that Flint wouldn’t be elected. Oliver’s best friend, Percy, was also campaigning for mayor. Despite his young age of 25, Oliver knew that Percy had more political experience than Flint and supported better policies that would bring positive change to the region. Hopefully voters would recognise that. </p>
<p>Oliver jogged over to the football and half-heartedly gave it a kick. He heard a thump and a curse as it hit someone in the darkening light. Oliver immediately ran towards the sound, feeling bad for the unexpected victim. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I didn’t realise anyone else was here so late.”</p>
<p>Marcus scowled, picking up the ball and throwing it back to the man. The hoodie the stranger was wearing advertised ‘Vote Weasley’ in an outrageous red. Marcus couldn’t help but roll his eyes at the naivety of supporting such a young candidate. </p>
<p>Oliver noticed the gesture and frowned, looking down at his hoodie. Scottish accent dripping with sarcasm he spoke. “Oh and I suppose you’re supporting someone so much better?” </p>
<p>Marcus guffawed. “Like Cygnus Flint?”</p>
<p>“Since you actually know his first name, then yes.” Oliver was starting to become agitated with the man. </p>
<p>“He’s my father so yeah, I know his first name.” Marcus smirked at the look of pure horror on the man’s face. </p>
<p>“I think I owe you a second apology. I didn’t expect Flint’s son to be... on a football field.” Oliver was really thinking of how Cygnus’ son could be so handsome, but he stopped himself from saying it just in time. </p>
<p>Marcus’ expression grew sour again. “I didn’t find out about that until a few minutes ago. I’m about as pissed as I’m willing to bet you are.”</p>
<p>“I’m quite pissed.”</p>
<p>“Well I’m more pissed then.”</p>
<p>Oliver laughed, shoving a hand into his pocket. The cold was starting to get to him now that he had stopped moving. “I’m Oliver Wood.”</p>
<p>“Marcus.”</p>
<p>“Well Marcus, d’you like football?” Oliver directed his eyes to the football resting against his shoe. </p>
<p>And that’s how the two strangers began a highly competitive game at 9 pm. Marcus was a superb player, expertly weaving around Oliver and dribbling the ball. Oliver was a perfect match, being a great goal keeper and stopping the majority of Marcus’ attempts to score. </p>
<p>“I’m curious,” Oliver said to Marcus some time after their game. They had gone to a small midnight espresso cafe and were nursing coffees, glad to be out of the cold. Somehow both reluctant to part from each other’s company. “Why does a man promise to replace a football field when he has a son such as yourself?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been trying to figure that one out.” Marcus replied, eyes flickering to Oliver’s hands that were distractedly fiddling with a sugar packet. </p>
<p>“Maybe you can figure this one out. How does the son of a mayoral candidate and the best friend of his the opposing candidate have a civil conversation?” Oliver smiled, sipping his drink and leaning back in the chair. There was something about Marcus’ quiet yet aggressive personality that intrigued him. </p>
<p>“Weasley’s your best friend?”</p>
<p>“Since high school.” Oliver responded. “Despite what you may think based upon his age, he’d be a great mayor and I’m not just saying that because I’m on his promotions team or his best friend.”</p>
<p>Marcus laughed. “I don’t believe you’re not biased, but I’m willing to bite. Why do you think he’d be so great?”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you come to our offices tomorrow and ask him?” Oliver smirked, finishing his coffee and leaning back in his chair.</p>
<p>“Now that would piss off my father.”</p>
<p>“Precisely.”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The elections came and went, and after an encounter with his father that left a bruise beneath his ribs, Marcus tried (to no avail) to forget about the late night field encounter with Oliver Wood. As the public had expected, and much to Marcus’ chagrin, his father was elected as Mayor.</p>
<p>For the sake of expenses and to help with campaigning, Marcus had still lived at home. However this election had only brought out the worst in Cygnus’ parenting, so Marcus packed his bags and began renting a flat across from the field he so loved. The field that was under development for a hotel.</p>
<p>- </p>
<p>“Marcus.” Oliver was shocked, and his face betrayed it. “It’s been a while, I thought you’d forgotten we existed”</p>
<p>“I was busy.” Marcus shrugged nonchalantly. Truthfully, Marcus had been trying to reach out to contacts to begin a sporting career but as soon as they heard he was Cygnus’ son they dismissed him. None of them wanted the son of a Mayor who was destroying a football field for the sake of tourism. </p>
<p>“Percy, meet Marcus Flint.” Oliver gestured between Marcus and a well-presented young man, who looked as if he had been ironed and not just his spotless suit.</p>
<p>“A pleasure.” Percy said warmly, giving Marcus a strong handshake. “Did you want to talk in my office?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t intended as a meeting, but it certainly panned out that way, and at the end of it Marcus’ political opinion had been shifted even more. He also had an invitation to a protest against the hotel replacing the field.</p>
<p>“Can I tell Oliver to look forward to seeing you there?” Percy asked, smirking.</p>
<p>Marcus, confused at the insinuation but not displeased by it, nodded. “Yes, yeah you can.”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“You know, you’re a man of surprises.” Oliver appeared at Marcus’ side, passing him a banner to hold.</p>
<p>“Yeah well, I try my best.” Marcus laughed. His laugh didn’t do a good job at disguising his terror, especially when he was such a visible figure in the town now and this was a highly publicised event.</p>
<p>Marcus held open the banner and tried to forget about his father, and just picture a faceless man who wanted to tear apart his passion. His stomach hurt from a newly formed bruise and he grimaced.</p>
<p>“Hey, I think it’s pretty commendable that you’re doing this.” Oliver said, noticing Marcus’ discomfort. He followed the other protestors down the street towards the field, and Marcus walked in step beside him.</p>
<p>He swallowed his thanks. “After the protest do you want to go to mine? It’s close by to the field.”</p>
<p>Oliver turned his head and smiled warmly, his teeth gleaming in the sun and lighting up his face. “That would be nice.”</p>
<p>With that, Marcus and Oliver joined the crowd whose anger carried them through the many chants and marching. Even when the television crew found Marcus amongst the protestors, he continued forward; “Listen to the public, not your tourism!”</p>
<p>Cygnus would no doubt see his son on the news, but Marcus no longer cared. He had left his father’s good books a while ago; this wouldn’t be the first or last time he did something to cause more displeasure. Besides, he liked spending time with Oliver and this protest was a good excuse to invite the man over to his flat and get to know him more.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Oliver looked around the small and bare flat, secretly quite pleased that Marcus seemed to be picking up his hints and had invited him over. Boxes lined one wall and tape still sealed some of them, indicating that the man had recently moved in.</p>
<p>“Would you like a drink or anything?” Marcus asked from the kitchen, turning the kettle on. </p>
<p>“Only if you’re having something.” Oliver responded, before Marcus accidentally walked into him as he left the kitchen. Automatically Oliver’s hands went around the man’s waist, and getting no indication to move them, he brought himself closer.</p>
<p>Marcus’ breath was in his throat and he pushed a strand of Oliver’s hair from his face, and leaned forward. His eyes flickered between Oliver’s eyes and his lips, until they shut on their own accord as they kissed. Rough lips moving together and in sync, his stomach full of butterflies. <i>Finally</i>.</p>
