    <p>Layla huffed irritatedly at her friend Penelope Clearwater. "When are you going to dump that waste of space called Weasley?" It annoied her so much that the male was still around her friend.<br/> <br/> Janette rolled her eyes at Layla. "What she means is that you've gone way beyond the requirements of your dare. Are you actually starting to like the Weasley?" She asked as if she was disturbed of the idea.<br/> <br/> Penelope giggled softly at her friends. "Oh, don't worry about that. I already have a plan to dump him." She paused for a bit to make sure her so called boyfriend wasn't nearby. Not spotting him anywhere insight she continued. "I'm doing it today in front of the Great Hall. I'll also make sure to tell him how unlovable he truly is." She gave of a sadistic smile.<br/> <br/> Percy slowly halted into a stop. He had been walking with his brothers, Hermione and Harry. Though, his girlfriend's group didn't see him, he had heard everything the three said. He could feel tears trickling down his face as his brothers growled protectively. He felt both Hermione and Harry engulf him into a hug.<br/> <br/> George and Fred stalked over to the group of girls. They both had a scarily angry look on their faces. Making most of the people around scramble around to get away from them. Their magic started to crackle around them. They wanted too make them pay.<br/> <br/> While, Ron himself was angry at what was said, he also didn't want the twins to get in trouble. He carefully reeled in his temper and gave a sigh. "Fred! George!" He called out to them waiting for a moment til they turn to him. "Prank them..yeah? Just nothing to dangerous that can get you in trouble." He flashed then a nervous worried look.<br/> <br/> The twins nodded their heads towards their worried little brother. "They deserve more for hurting Percy but we see your point." They looked at each other then looked back at Ron. "We'll prank them for a long while though." They both got a nod of approval from the golden trio.<br/> <br/> Harry sighed softly and shook his head. "What, a start to third year." He mumbled under his breathe before addressing the four. "I'm going to take Perce to Ollie. Hopefully, I can get Flint to help." He said, carefully steadying a broken looking Percy before they started walking.<br/> <br/> Hermione looked at them with a sad expression. Once they disappeared she gave Ron and the Twins a determined look. "I'll help you plan out some pranks." She got an amused looks from all three. "I just won't publicly join in..if that's okay. However today is a diffrent story." She stated nervously. However, the three understood her perfectly.<br/> <br/> Hermione casted a spell that would give them a minor shock if they insult anyone. Next Ron casted a spell that would change the three girls hair into diffrent color like a mood ring. Finally the twins casted a spell that would make them blurt out what they really think of someone except each other. All four were proud of there work as they all went to dinner after their first day of classes.<br/> <br/> Marcus noticed that Potter was walking with the Weasley from his year. He frowned as he noticed the red head looked broken. "What, happened to him Potter?" He asked lowly as he wondered up to him.<br/> <br/> Harry gave the older Slytherin a soft smile. "I'll tell you what happened to Percy. However, I think it would be better if we take him to Oliver first." He studied Flint carefully before explaining. "I think he'd be more comforted that way..if you don't mind." He said almost shyly making the older Slytherin nod his head in understanding.<br/> <br/> Marcus gently picked up the red-head. He noticed how Potter barely was able to steady the older male. "It will be faster if I just carry him Potter. Though, you also look like you were about to topple over any minute." The younger nodded in agreement to his statement.<br/> <br/> Meanwhile, a very angry sentiant castle was arguing with a certain headmaster. It was about the safety of the students and the dementors. If he wasn't going to do anything then she well. Hogwarts will start by revealing herself to the students once they arrive in the Great Hall.</p>
<p>Once in the Great Hall Marcus and Harry went straight to Oliver Wood. Marcus gently placed Percy onto his boyfriend's lap. Which effectively startled Oliver into looking at him. He rolled his eyes before turning to Harry. "Okay, now can you tell me what's going on with Percy, Potter?"<br/> <br/> "A deal is a deal. Ollie you have to listen to this to." Harry said softly knowing that the two loved Percy and would do anything to protect him. "What happened was Hermione, Ron and I were walking with the Twins and Percy. Um, Thompson was making it known that she didn't like Percy with Clearwater." He took a deep breathe to clear any lingering thoughts. "Fostor mentioned that Clearwater gone past her requirements of a dare on dating Percy." His had a dark and angry look on his face. "The Bitch herself stated that she was going to dump Percy in front of the Great Hall and tell him how unlovable he is." He sneered at the thought then smirked. "I wouldn't worry to much because as we speak the Twins, Ron and Hermione are giving them the punishment they deserve." He couldn't wait to see what they have done.<br/> <br/> Their was an ugly sneer on Marcus' face. "Unlovable my arse. I would smash their faces in if it weren't for the fact they are girls." He looked at Percy with adoration in his eyes. "Besides Percy has to be the cutest male Weasley out of all of them." He admited only loud enough for Harry, Oliver and Percy to hear.<br/> <br/> "We'll have to ask the Twins to somehow prank them into being male temperarally. For I would love it if you'd smash them into pieces." Oliver admitted to his Slytherin boyfriend. "Besides I don't like my favorite Weasley being hurt. Though now that we have him. I doubt Marcus and I will let him go." He announced softly to mostly Harry as Marcus was nodding in agreement to him.<br/> <br/> Harry chuckled softly at them. "You two better court him properly. I'm pretty sure if you don't then Ron will send Fred and George after you. Though, personally I would send Ginny and Hermione after you two." Both Oliver and Marcus gave him a serious look and a nod of approval for that statement.<br/> <br/> Percy turned slightly red. "H-harry please don't joke like that." He looked hopeful but was afraid as well. However, he knew that Harry would never joke about something like this. Plus the looks that Oliver and Marcus was giving him only proved what Harry was saying.<br/> <br/> "Oh, right! Um, Percy?" Harry asked shyly as he remembered he wanted to ask the older red-head something. "Do you think you could accompany me to Grengotts to do a full inheritance test during Hogsmed weekend?" He looked almost younger as the three saw how scared he looked as if he was ready to be rejected again.<br/> <br/> "Of course I will Harry." Percy slipped off of Oliver'a lap and gave the shy thirteen year old a hug. "Personally I think Mum or Dad would be better than me." He admitted to Harry. "Thank you, for trusting me little brother." He said softly as he knew his whole family practically adopted him into there large family.<br/> <br/> "Thank you, Percy." Harry said softly. "Also   don't believe anything Clearwater and her friends say. You are lovable and probably even smarter then they are." He said with a nononsence tone of voice.<br/> <br/> Fred and George had pulled Percy into a hug once they arrive. "Harry is right Perce. You are smarter then them and they are just jealous of your awesomeness." They said in unison. Though, they often make jokes that hurt their smart brother. That doesn't mean they don't love him or mean to hurt him.<br/> <br/> Ron smiled shyly at Percy once Hermione and he got close to the group. "Plus you taught Harry, Hermione and I about wizarding manners and culture. That I have to admit I forget most of the time." He looked sheepishly at him.<br/> <br/> Marcus sighed softly. "I better get to the Slytherin table. Almost everyone is here now." He kissed Oliver's cheek as well as Percy's. "Oliver and I will send out letter of intent to court to you sometime after Hogsmed weekend. So, please look out for it." He said smirking as Percy turned red. He quickly stalked over to his house table.</p>
<p>Hermione tilted her head. "Letter of intent?" She asked softly feeling slightly confused at the new term.<br/> <br/> Oliver turned to Hermione and smiled. "The letter of intent is to tell the reciver that you are interested in them romantically. With the letter of intent you also give your first courting gift." He explained.<br/> <br/> Ron then jumped in on explaining " think of it like this 'Mione you already know that we have marriage contracts, right?" The girl nodded at him. "Well, this is another tradition like that except less perminant. Once the receiver gets three courting presents he or she is allowed to back out of the courting. Erm, I don't remember the gestures though."<br/> <br/> Olliver chuckled softly at this. "Ron is correct about the three gifts. Once the receiver gets the first gift, she or he must nod their head to their courter if they are pleased with the gift they received. If they are displeased the stare at the courter for a few minutes. Then the courter has two more tries to woo their receiver. However, the receiver can back out anytime after the first gift." Oliver said softly hoping that Hermione understood is rant-like explination.<br/> <br/> The Twins decided to continue. "The starting age for courting is thirteen. The only difference is that if the receiver excepts the courtship completely at that age. Well, instead of getting the family consort ring they get a promise ring." They looked at Percy. "Is that right or did we get that wrong?"<br/> <br/> Percy smiled softly at this younger twin brothers. "Your both correct in those statements." He gently sat in between them as he almost forgot he was still hugging Harry. "Sorry about that."<br/> Harry chuckled softly. "That's okay. I a forgot too. Mostly because I was interested in the conversation." He smiled sheepishly and sat on the opposite side of Hermione. "For some reason I think something is to happen." Everyone agreed with him when they saw Dumbledore marching into the Great Hall.<br/> <br/> Hermione giggled softly. "I think I'll try to find out more about it later. I'll make sure to inform you of any new information Harry." She got a quick nod from both Harry and Ron. "I wonder what got Dumbledore in such a hissy fit?" She tilted her head not realising that he could hear her.</p>
<p>Everyone paicently waited for the food to show up. However, Dumbledore refused to speak. He was to angry at Hogwarts for that. Soon the personafication of Hogwarts appeared. She looked like a beautiful yet bubbly blonde. <em>"Good evening, Students. I am Hogwarts or at least the personafication of the castle at least." </em>She smiled softly as everyone looked at her. <em>"The only reason I'm showing myself now is because of a certain idiotic Headmaster." </em>She said cheerfully while glaring at Dumbledore like she wants to murder him. <em>"Said Headmaster thought it was amusing to put three students in danger for the past two years they have been here. So, change will happen whether you like it or not. Also it will happen some time after your first Hogsmed Weekend. Bye for now.</em> Once the women disappeared the food came. Everyone was pondering what the change would be and if they would be happy with it. They also wonder why Clearwater, Thompson and Foster did something to urk the Weasley Twins because of them having multiple pranks on them. They found out once Clearwater broke up with the elder Weasley. Though they were throwly disgusted with them.</p>
