    <p>A cloaked figure appeared in front of the quaint home on the chilly night of Halloween. The small family was sworn and promised by many that their home was untraceable, protecting them from all dangers that surrounded them. The war that had been going on around them spilled directly into their home as red eyes gleamed with the thrill of entering the premises completely undetected. The man of the household attempted to protect his new family, being the first line of defense against the dangerous foe by blocking the attacker in the hallway. A violent flash of green light hit the man and illuminating the surrounding part of the house, now merely a corpse falling to the floor. Minutes later two more blinding green flashes of the same curse glowed from within the home.  As quick as it happened, it was over; the figure disappeared after striking the baby with the Unforgivable Curse. Unknowingly, the attacker did not succeed before his attack backfired, leaving the youngest occupant of Godric’s Hollow alive, crying and completely abandoned. </p><p>About an hour or so after the attacks, a loud POP was heard. A couple dressed in black appeared just outside of the house where the other cloaked figure had arrived. Quickly they entered the home and discovered just what they knew had happened. The body of James Potter lay motionless on the floor, eyes lifeless as the couple loomed over them. </p><p>“Look at this, my darling! Such a quick death for cousin James! How unfortunate,” the man said, looking down at the corpse. The pencil moustache curved with the smile that grew when looking at the still warm body of the wizard. The curse that he was struck with left no marks save for the destroyed furniture and household items.</p><p>“Such a small explosion for the Killing Curse, don’t you think, dearest?” the red-lipped yet otherwise pale monochrome woman said looking about the clean home. </p><p>The man nodded and circled the room, “I agree, no imagination whatsoever from Lord Voldemort. At least he could have done is take the time and put effort into property damage!” he exclaimed shaking head.</p><p>“So much opportunity missed, for shame. The Cruciatus or Imperius would have been more creative and time consuming which would have made their deaths more extravagant,” Morticia mused.</p><p>They looked about the first floor of the house before walking through the hallway where the body was struck and carried on before being drawn back to James’ body.</p><p>“There were only two omens of death, Gomez…” The statuesque woman said softly to the man hovering over the form. Black lace and spider webs followed her as she glided over to the two still men. Gomez glanced at the woman before nodding.</p><p>“Of course, Tish! Let’s find the other body!” He said radiating with excitement. Holding out her arm, Gomez quickly took it, kissing the crimson tipped fingers and lead her away from the destroyed living room. The two made their way up the stairs of the otherwise neat little home before crying broke their silence. The couple exchanged glances before heading straight to the noise. </p><p>The door to the nursery was blown off, along with the baby furniture being shattered. Carefully the two walked into the small room to see the wife of James lifeless on the floor next to a wailing baby. The baby seemed fine aside from the gash over his piercing green eyes that were filled with fresh tears that ran down his hot cheeks. </p><p>Morticia’s eyes widened briefly at the scene before her. The baby stopped his crying instantly once the two entered the room and walked closer to stand next to the second corpse.</p><p>“Oh Gomez, look at him. Death and destruction will follow him like a plague. May we keep him?”</p><p>“Of course we’ll keep him! He’s an Addams! Cousin James would have wanted it that way! Can you imagine him living with Lily's side of the family? Clean house? Lace doilies?” Gomez physically shivered at the thought. “We can't in good conscience leave the boy with them!" he declared while Morticia picked up the quiet baby.</p><p>Morticia looked at baby Harry who looked back with those shocking green eyes, a smile growing as the baby studied her. </p><p>“Let’s go, Tish. Other’s will arrive once they realize their friends have met their quick demise,” Gomez said, who was busy inspecting Lily’s body, who had the same curse end her life as her husbands based off the lack of wounds. Morticia nodded and carefully maneuvered around the body on the floor and broken door to stand beside her husband and together they left with a pop.</p><p>-</p><p>“Maman! Come meet the new member of the Addams Clan!” Morticia called out after the three arrived in their foyer. Morticia held the wide-eyed Harry close to her as they walked through the dusty house.</p><p>Fingers humming against the rotting floorboards could be heard through the halls as Thing walked along with the old, gray, frizzy haired Grandmama. Lurch stood behind Gomez and watched with a blank grimace.</p><p>“What did you say?” Grandmama said once in the same room as everyone else, “I have dinner on the fire. Is that for the entrée?” She asked pointing to little Harry in her daughter-in-law’s arms. </p><p>“Oh no, Maman, this is Harry. His parents were just killed,” Morticia corrected her mother-in-law. </p><p>“He was Cousin James’ son! We received two death omens; the bird that died in the sitting room, and the falling of the umbrella,” Gomez explained lavishly. “I knew right away it had to be the Potters so Tish and I apparated there once we connected the two. Low and behold, there they both were,” he continued.</p><p>“Were they dismembered? Maimed? Tortured? Skinned alive?” Grandmama asked with excitement. </p><p>“No, Maman.”</p><p>“They were practically untouched. No fight or signs of torture,” Gomez sighed.</p><p>“That could have been our evenings entertainment and dinner!”</p><p>“Precisely,” Morticia said disappointedly. </p><p>At that moment the family looked at the laughing baby, his eyes sparkling with something that the Addams weren’t quite sure what it was. Grandmama broke the silence while giving another once over at the baby, reading the minds of the married couple in front of her. </p><p>“If you want him as an Addams, you have to invoke a Rite. A blood ritual, specifically!”  Grandmama said, gesturing for the family to follow her back to the kitchen. Arriving there, they all watched the old witch mix some faded-labeled bottles and their ingredients together into her boiling cauldron,  “Or throw him in the pot and eat him. Both work!” She cackled. </p><p>“What must we do?” Morticia asked while putting Harry down on the floor, a dagger in his tiny palms given to him by Gomez upon entering the kitchen. </p><p>“There is a potion that needs to be brewed, then you and Gomez give blood. I put it in the potion. And baby Harry drinks it all up!” Grandmama said happily. Gomez looked at the baby waving around the dagger before his eyes trailed up to his dark haired wife.</p><p>“Tish… Think of it. Only our blood can bind him to us… So many ways to draw blood…”</p><p>“Pumping through our veins in the heat of the moment then drawing it out,” Morticia said lustfully.</p><p>“But! The potion must be completed by the next eclipse,” Grandmama said walking over to her overused grimoire and fingering through the thick pages. </p><p>“How much time do we have?” Gomez questioned, taking Morticia’s hand in hers and kissing it.</p><p>Grandmama grumbled and flipped through her book, “In two nights! I’ll need to go to the Black Market for some ingredients…”</p><p>“Then in two days the blood adoption shall happen! Until then,” Gomez said, “Lurch make up a room for Harry. I do believe we have somewhere to be,” he added and pulled Morticia gracefully closer to his body and kissing her neck. </p><p>A wicked smile formed on her lips as she pulled away and swayed her hips, turning to give a look so enticingly murderous, it could have killed him where he stood. “We will be in the Dungeons,” Morticia said while leaving the kitchen. Grandmama picked up Harry from crawling too far away and stared at the now bloodied dagger in his pudgy hands.</p><p>-</p><p>In two days time, the Addams household had Harry settled into the old drafty house as the potion brewed and the ritual was prepared while the moon moved into optimum placement in the clear night sky. Morticia happily doted on the wide-eyed Harry as he was handed anything he could hold in his small hands. The night of the eclipse, everyone met outside in the graveyard while Lurch carried out the cauldron filled with the ritual potion to the altar in the center of the tombstone garden. </p><p>“You have the baby?” Grandmama said pulling out her grimoire and slamming it on the cement slab.</p><p>Morticia glided forward while Gomez carried Harry in his arms while sucking on an unknown object while he grinned like a loon. </p><p>“Yes, here he is,” she said while Gomez passed the baby into the wild haired woman’s arms.</p><p>“Perfect. All we need now is for him to drink while you two read the passage,” the elder Addams instructed while moving Harry out of her arms and sitting him next to the cauldron on the altar. Harry laughed brightly while being passed around by the three of them. The moon was deep in its eclipse as Grandmama poured the two small bottles of blood into the baby bottle and shook it together with the contents of the cauldron until completely combined.</p><p>Gomez and Morticia walked closer to the altar, hands clasped tight with one another’s while looking down at the passage to speak out loud in unison. Grandmama pushed the bottle into Harry’s mouth. He attempted to pull away before beginning to drink slowly with an odd face.</p><p>“Ab incunabulis (From the cradle) Eo Nomine (Under that name) Harry James Potter<br/>
Ab hinc (From here on) Mutato Nomine (the name being changed) ad (to) Harry Lonán Addams<br/>
Simul (Together) Contra Mundum (Against the world) Ad vitam (For life), Dum Spiramus Tuebimur (While we breathe, we shall defend)<br/>
Meum Pactum Dictum (My word is my bond)”</p><p>Grandmama’s eyes were wide while Lurch groaned, watching the emerald green eyes glow while finishing his bottled concoction. Morticia and Gomez finished the Latin passage and watched as the transformation continued. Harry’s eyes became more piercing, rich and dangerous emeralds. Curiously looking back at the four adults, Harry’s skin paled to match that of the Addams’ complexion, holding the bottle in his hands. </p><p>Suddenly Harry was pulled into the air by the rich magic of the Addams clan, the blood magic that was stronger than both Dark and Light. Grandmama laughed wickedly.</p><p>“Our ancestors are welcoming him! The ritual is complete and a success!” She wailed happily; Harry continued to laugh as the black wisps of magic swirled and engulfed him. Whispers of the dead spoke to him and he seemed to respond in his own way, babbling and reaching out to the magic as if playing with it.</p><p>“Oh Tish,” Gomez said pulling her cold form closer to his own. Morticia leaned into her husbands hold as the baby was placed in her arms by the wisps of magic.</p><p>“Our first child,” she cooed and looked at the mustached man and kissing him passionately. Harry continued to play with the magic that seemed to hover in front of him while in his new mother’s arms. Lurch groaned while picking up the cauldron and heading back to the house. Grandmama grabbed her book and followed, chatting away about the last time the ancestors welcomed a new member of the family through the blood ritual.</p>
