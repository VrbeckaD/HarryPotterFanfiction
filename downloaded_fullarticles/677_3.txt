    <p>It was the middle of dinner when Harry suddenly stood up.</p><p>"That's <em>it</em>, I've <em>had</em> it," he said, walking away from the table.</p><p>Hermione and Ron looked at each other, then followed suit. Harry was marching straight towards the Slytherin table.</p><p>"Malfoy!" Harry yelled, glaring. "Malfoy, the fuck do you want <em>this</em> time, huh?"</p><p>Malfoy just smirked. "Nothing, Potter, why? Has my seductive gaze gotten your panties in a knot? Can't handle a little bit of flirting?"</p><p>Ron looked at Hermione for confirmation that Malfoy had just said "flirting"--Hermione didn't respond. Her eyes flicked back and forth between Harry and Malfoy, trying to piece together what was going on. Harry's face was bright red, and his scar shone white on his forehead. Malfoy grinned, cat-like.</p><p>"Poor Saint Potter has never had anyone wink at him before, he's just so ugly--he doesn't know how to respond!"</p><p>Pansy, Blaise, and Daphne laughed. Well, if you can call Pansy's shrieks laughter. Harry balled up his fists.</p><p>"Listen here, Malfoy, I don't know what you're playing at--"</p><p>"Of course you don't, Potter. I can imagine no one with intellect has ever tried to actually interact with you before, you must be so baffled."</p><p>Hermione could see that Harry was about to burst--she really, really didn't want him to get detention for attempting to hex Malfoy again. That would make it the third time this week.</p><p>She didn't pull out her wand. She didn't need to. "Malfoy," she said, sharply. "Watch your mouth."</p><p>Malfoy sneered. "It's Potter that should be watching his, it's hanging open like a trap door."</p><p>There was an audible clicking sound--it seemed that Harry had, in fact, had his mouth open. Hermione was ticked. "Malfoy, we both know that I can beat you in a fight. Keep your foul mouth to yourself."</p><p>With that, she turned around, jerking her head at Harry to do the same. Still clearly smoldering with rage, he obediently followed. Malfoy jeered after them, "Potter needs someone to help him pick his fights, poor Potter."</p><p>When they got back to the table, Harry began gathering his things. Sighing in defeat, Ron and Hermione gathered theirs, too.</p><p>Once they were out in the hallway, Harry began ranting.</p><p>"Stupid Malfoy and his stupid tongue and his stupid hair and his stupid winks and his stupid--"</p><p>Ron cut in. "Mate, calm down. Malfoy's always been this way. Why did you expect him to change?"</p><p>Harry ground his teeth in frustration, stomping his foot on the floor. "I don't know! I figured after we'd saved the git's life and I testified in front of the entire court that he'd treat me with a bit of human decency! I thought that maybe, I don't know, we could have been friends! It seems so stupid now," he said, winding down. "I really thought we might have been able to start over."</p><p>They arrived in front of the portrait hole.</p><p>Ron sighed, pulling Harry into a hug. "Mate, sometimes people can't change. Malfoy has been a witless git ever since we met him, you can't expect the simple act of saving his life to suddenly give him brain cells."</p><p>Harry's voice was muffled by Ron's shoulder. "I didn't expect him to get <em>smarter</em>, I just wanted him to at least leave me alone. I deserve to be left alone for a little bit, don't you think?"</p><p>Ron nodded, once. "Yeah, mate. You do deserve some rest."</p><p>Harry huffed. "I didn't die for this shit."</p><p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione laughed, and it was almost like the good old days again.</p>
