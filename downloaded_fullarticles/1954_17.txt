<h4>221B</h4><p> </p><p>
The day was still young, not quite midday, yet the tension between the two occupants of a 2nd story flat in the centre of London was more stifling than the humid air outside. A heat wave had descended upon the city earlier that summer month that made the air feel as thick as jelly. It was likely this repugnant reason that the criminal class had seemingly collectively called a temporary truce against the New Scotland Yard, for not even a petty crime of pickpocketing had occurred within the past few weeks. As such, while many of Scotland Yard’s finest were thoroughly enjoying the breather and scrambling around to go on holiday during the lull in work, a particular (rather, the <em>World’s Only</em>) Consulting Detective was beside himself with unyielding ennui. His flatmate, the Good Doctor, formerly Captain, was reaching his wit’s end, having suffered through day after day with the consulting detective’s puerile strops and incessant bemoaning of “Bored!” and “Dull!” It was after the fifteenth utterance of said phrases that very morning that the good doctor finally snapped. </p><p><br/>
</p><p>“Oh for the love of...” John Watson stopped himself, folding his right arm across his chest and perching his left arm upon it in order to support his head while he pinched the bridge of his nose. He attempted to take a deep, calming breath to collect himself before he snapped and threw the kettle at his vexatious flatmate. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Upon release of the exhale he continued, “For someone who detests repetition, you sure sound like a parrot. That is the <em>fifteenth</em> time today you’ve squawked those words.”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>Sherlock, who had been draped upon the sofa, limbs askew like a Victorian maiden befallen a fainting fit, merely lifted his arm away from covering his face to pierce John with the intensity of his glare while he scathingly replied, “I do not <em>squawk.</em> Honestly, John, how your plebeian mind can possibly...”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>“FIFTEENTH TIME!” John interjected before Sherlock could finish whatever cutting remark he was about to spew forth, slamming down the kettle he had just finally picked up. His breath heaved through his chest while both men stared the other down. So engrossed were they in their spat that the flatmates hadn’t even noticed the opening of the front door, nor the careful cadence of the visitor’s ascent up the stairs, accompanied with a gentle thud upon every other step.</p><p><br/>
</p><p>Whatever biting retort Sherlock was about to assail John with as he opened his mouth was interrupted, yet again, by a haughty voice that asserted, “My, my, brother dear, trouble in paradise?”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>Mycroft stood in the opening of the doorway, perfectly poised with both hands resting atop the handle of his umbrella perched in front of him. John’s attention whipped towards him, while Sherlock let out a bedraggled moan, exclaiming, “Go away, Mycroft! You’re not welcome here.”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>John, however, took three strides towards the elder brother and with an air of desperation said, “Mycroft; for the love of Queen and Country, <strong>please</strong> tell us you have a case for Sherlock or so help me, I’m liable to strangle your brother. I haven’t seen him this badly in one of his dark moods in years and he’s driving me round the bend!”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>Sherlock scoffed, and in one fluid movement that belied the previous disarray of his long, lanky limbs, he situated himself in an artful arrangement upon the sofa; seated with one foot on the floor, the other leg folded across at the ankle upon his knee, arms steepled under his chin. “Of course he doesn’t have a case, there’s no case file tucked in his arms, no memory stick in his pocket, his posture is decidedly too lax for there to be any pressing concerns; furthermore, he paid a visit to the bakery down the street before his stop here, indulging in one—no—two of their blueberry scones, which although catastrophic towards his diet, isn’t one of his comfort foods he’s so fond of indulging in when under duress. Really, John, is your frustration so palpable as to obscure the obvious observations? However do you maintain your work at the clinic if you misread the blatant details for a proper diagnosis?” He returned his attention to his brother and snidely continued, “That does beg the question as to why <em>are</em> you here, Mycroft? Surely you have better things to do than waste my time with your obtrusive presence.”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>Mycroft merely raised a single eyebrow at the end of the tirade while John tried to loosen his clenched jaw, unmindful of his hands clenching and unclenching at his sides. Eyes narrowing at Sherlock, he smirked with the knowledge of the one thing he could do to truly give Sherlock his comeuppance, turning back to Mycroft and saying with overt politeness, “Please come in and make yourself comfortable, Mycroft; why don’t I make you a cup of tea?”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>The <em>minor</em> British Government Official’s lip quirked upward on one end in a rare display of bemusement while he replied, “Indeed. Spot of milk and one sugar, if you please.”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>John gave a quick nod and returned towards the kitchen to set about making tea for himself and Mycroft—<em>let Sherlock make his own, for once.</em> At the same time, a growl of protest escaped from Sherlock as he snapped himself up off the couch towards the corner of the room to pick up his beloved violin. If he was to be subjected to a torturous session with his insufferable brother, the least he could do was even the battlefield, perhaps even shorten the excursion, by playing the string of discordant tones most grating to the elder Holmes.</p><p><br/>
</p><p>Sighing softly, Mycroft proceeded to walk forward and sit upon the leather chair so often occupied by the consulting detective and said, “Come now, brother, can’t I merely pay a social visit to inquire into your welfare?”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>With an exaggerated eye roll Sherlock replied, “Ah yes, for you’ve always been a shining beacon of altruistic caring. Don’t patronize me, Mycroft, your motives are never benevolently unbounded.” He moved with violin in-hand to collapse back into the cushions of the sofa, all-the-while harshly plucking cacophonous notes from the instrument.</p><p><br/>
</p><p>“Dear brother, you wound me; and sarcasm doesn’t become you,” came Mycroft’s reply. He brushed away a fleck of dust from his sleeve. “I am always concerned with your wellbeing, as it were.”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>Sherlock let out a derisive snort at that, while John returned to the sitting room, two teacups in hand. He handed one of the cups to Mycroft and proceeded to sip from his own as he sat in his worn, yet cozy chair. Mycroft gave a slight nod of thanks, while Sherlock turned his head stiffly to face John, cocked an eyebrow looking back-and-forth between the two cups of tea before settling on John’s eyes, and said, “Et tu, Bruté?”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>John remained silent, met Sherlock’s enquiring gaze, tilted his head to the side and lifted his cup in a mock display of <em>‘cheers.’</em> Sherlock scowled and ripped a particularly screeching noise from the unfortunate violin before petulantly turning his face away to look out towards the window.</p><p><br/>
</p><p>“As amusing as this domestic display of bickering is, I was rather hoping you would be in a more amenable mood, brother mine. I know all-too-well how much of a quandary you are left in without The Work to occupy yourself with, and thought I could good-naturedly offer you a suggestion to help keep you and your mind engaged.” Mycroft took a sip of his tea and awaited Sherlock’s retort. Verbal sparring was always a requisite between the brothers; to forgo the volley would only ensure Sherlock’s refusal to listen, but by following familial protocol, he knew Sherlock would remain partly interested despite himself, allowing Mycroft to get to the crux of what he was there to say.</p><p><br/>
</p><p>Still looking out the window, Sherlock said, “What could you <em>possibly</em> offer that I would find of interest? Are you really too lazy to do your own legwork? Don’t you have minions to do your bidding for you? If your suggestion is how to eat healthy, I’m rather afraid you’ve missed the mark on that one yourself, dear brother…you’ve put on nearly four pounds since your last visit. Perhaps <em>you</em> should take on more legwork; the exercise would do you good.”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>Mycroft refrained from taking the bait from his brother that commenting on his weight usually provoked. Instead he continued to stare blandly at the younger Holmes, looking for the minute tell that would belie his interest and allow him the opportunity for transparency—well, as transparent as the two brothers ever got—and there it was…the slightest twitch of Sherlock’s head, angling back incrementally towards Mycroft. Though feeling smug at the sight of the tell, Mycroft kept from letting the satisfaction seep into his next words as he carefully said, “On the contrary, little brother; I’ve heard good reviews of the gentlemen’s club <em>‘Ékleipsi’</em> and thought you may be interested in paying it a visit. The good doctor here and perhaps the detective inspector you work so well with might even enjoy accompanying you for a ‘boys’ night out,’ as it were. I believe you may find the experience, <em>illuminating,</em>” he gently stressed the last word with the slightest inflection.</p><p><br/>
</p><p>An indelicate snort resounded from John as he tried and failed to hold in a giggle, but Sherlock’s head snapped immediately towards Mycroft and he leveled him with his penetrating gaze, eyes both calculating and staggered. Mycroft steadily held his brother’s stare, while John finally gave voice to his mirth, unable to repress the amusement any longer.</p><p><br/>
</p><p>“Oh that’s a good one, Mycroft,” he said in between chuckles, “regardless of how your brother feels about it, your visit was worth it just to hear you say that. I’ll get <em>months</em> of enjoyment thinking back on this conversation and imagining Sherlock in a strip club.” More giggles escaped as he wiped the beginning tears from the corner of his eyes and tried to steady his breathing. He let out a little sigh as the last of his laughs died down, only to realize that the brothers were still locked in a silent stare down. Looking back-and-forth between the two, though, he noticed the lack of the normal antagonism behind their gazes at each other. Their looks held an air of open candidness about them.</p><p><br/>
</p><p>Finally, after a beat, Mycroft set down his empty cup, lifted himself from the chair and responded, “Hmmm, yes. Always a pleasure to provide entertainment fodder, Doctor. It’s time I take my leave; country to run and all. Thank you for the cup of tea.” He ambled towards the door, turning back upon the frame to lock eyes with Sherlock again who hadn’t moved a muscle. “And Sherlock?” he said solemnly, “Do give consideration to what I’ve said. The choice of course is yours, though I daresay you would be pleasantly surprised should you follow through with it.” With that, the British Government turned and continued out the door, a small, genuine smile quirking his lips that he would vehemently deny ever existed if anyone were to bear witness to it. The Iceman’s heart gave one solitary, scorching beat, before returning to its petrified state in the frozen tundra of his chest.</p><p><br/>
</p><p>Inside the flat, John shook his head as he rose from his seat to collect the empty teacups and return them to the kitchen. His earlier pique at his flatmate forgotten in the aftermath of the amusing, albeit, peculiar visit, he asked, “Are you sure your brother isn’t under stress? That was rather strange, even for him. I’ve got to admit, I never pictured your brother having any interest in, let alone even any knowledge of a gentlemen’s club, but then to suggest you should go…well. What a laughable consideration.”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>He deposited the teacups in the sink and set about washing them. Upon his return to the sitting room he realized Sherlock was still immobile, eyes not quite distant in the same glassy way that was indicative of his visits to his mind palace, but still held a faraway look. “Sherlock? You okay, mate? Did your brother break you with that last bit of conversation? Sherlock?”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>In one fell swoop, Sherlock sprung from his spot on the sofa onto his feet and exclaimed in excitement, “John! John! Text Lestrade. Tell him to meet us here tonight at nine o’clock. We’re going to the gentlemen’s club. Tell him to dress casually, we don’t want it obvious that he’s a detective. You should be fine in your jumpers, although perhaps not the extra woolly beige one, we don’t want to be repulsive either. The navy blue one will work.” He began bustling about in a whirlwind like a Tasmanian devil as he continued, “We’ll need to stop and get cash, of course, we can’t very well blend in if we’re not interacting with the dancers, and the dancers won’t want to interact with us if we’re not paying. Although we don’t want to take too much with us either, that could give unsavory individuals incentive to harass us. Observation should be our key focus for most of the evening while we deduce what we’re there to look out for.”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>“Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you going on about?” John interjected. “You’re actually taking Mycroft’s idea seriously? And what do you mean, ‘observe to figure out what we’re there for?’ It’s a strip club. You go there to look at half-naked women dance around a pole and shake their bits about,” he finished with a shake of his hand.</p><p><br/>
</p><p>“Of course we’re going, do keep up, John.”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>“Sherlock. Stop. Explain. Why are we going? Why are you listening to your brother whom you usually fight tooth-and-nail against anything and everything.”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>Sherlock let out an exasperated sigh as though it pained him to take the time to answer, “<em>Because,</em> John. There’s a mystery afoot my brother is privy to that he is sharing with us. He can’t tell us directly—likely bound by secrecy or lawful reasons—but he’s pointing us in the right direction for us to indirectly come about it. I don’t <em>know</em> the precise reason as to why we are to go there—not enough data—only that we will discover something enticing that has nothing to do with what is seen on the surface.”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>“You got all that from what he said tonight, did ya? Are you sure you’re not just so bored you’re looking for a mystery within banal, albeit, peculiar conversation?”</p><p><br/>
</p><p>“<em>Yes,</em> John, <em>obviously.</em> My brother and I developed a collection of key words and phrases years ago in our youth, if you must know,” he replied with a sniff. “He invoked such a phrase this evening alerting me to the fact that what he says is with sincerity, and that I should read deeper between the lines. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go prepare for tonight. I suggest you do the same.” With a graceful flair that was pure <em>Sherlock,</em> he grabbed his phone from the coffee table and strode towards and out the door, leaving a bewildered John staring after him.</p><p><br/>
</p><p>“I can’t determine which one of the Holmeses is more barmy than the other. Then again, I’m the one talking to himself. Right. Well, nothing to it but to send Greg a text.” A giggle escaped his lips. At least tonight promised to be more fun than the past few weeks with Sherlock finally lifted out of his melancholic mood, however temporary that may last.</p>
