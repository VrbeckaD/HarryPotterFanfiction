    <p>It had been a long painful day for Harry Potter. The nightmares he kept having of Cedric didn't help either. They made him tired which of course led to mistakes he couldn't really afford to make. He gingerly prodded his swollen cheek and busted lip. It wasn't too bad this time round and his magic will probably heal it by morning. While he could usually ignore the filth that spewed out of the durslys one word had hit him pritty hard. </p><p>Useless.....</p><p>If he wasn't so useless he might have gotten to the cup before diggory or gotten them out of the graveyard. He should have run to the cup as soon as he realized where he was. He barely got out of there himself, but he did get away. Maybe if he had fought back from the start. </p><p>Harry closed his eyes and tried to get the flashing green out of his head the wails of Cedric's father.. </p><p>When Harry opened his eyes he was on his stomach and filled with pain. His back ached and his head throbbed. He had the most peculiar sensation on his back.</p><p>Harry reached a hand behind him and touched something that shouldn't have been there. Swallowing Harry eased himself up into a sitting position and the pain began to fade. Harry ran a shaky hand through his hair only to find more strange changes. His ears had become pointed and feathers mixed in with his hair. He reached both hands behind him and was even more confused.</p><p>On one side he felt a leathery almost bat like appendege and on the other what could only be feathers. Are those wings? The base of his spine tingled and Harry was afraid to find any other strange changes. This had to be a mistake, some curse or hex that hadn't activated till now. </p><p>Pop!</p><p>With a small flash of light a letter appeared in front of Harry, Hedwig chirped indignantly behind him. </p><p>' Mr Harry Potter,</p><p>We are sending this letter to inform you that you have had an early creature inheritance. Your full inheritance is now available to you. Please come to the bank when you are ready to look over your vaults. The letter is a porkey, activate by saying bolts</p><p>Sincerely, griphook'</p><p>Creature Inheritance, that would explain some things. Harry thought. But what kind of creature had two different kinds of wings and a bushy tail. He looked at the letter and  decided he didn't have the time for vaults right now<br/>
He had to get  his new school supplies and get to school. Maybe Hermione would know what he is. He set the letter on his bed and went to get changed. </p><p>The door to his bedroom burst open.</p><p>"BOY!' his uncle barely squeezed though the door. Harry anxiously looked at the clock 8:55 oh no. Harry thought. He hadn't left in time, her slept too late. Harry looked up at his uncle who was staring at Harry in furry.</p><p>" You just had to become more freakish.you ungeatful brat" Harry rushed to his wand on the bedside table. </p><p>"Oh no you don't!" Harry was tackled to the ground. " I'll teach you freak!".Harry felt the beafy hands grab on to his.left wing. He scrambled to get out from under him. A large crack filled the room and Harry screamed in pain as his wing was broken. His uncle made quick work of the other wing. Dazed Harry was focused on not passing out from the pain, he didn't notice his uncle getting up and learning over him. </p><p>The whale of a man glared down at the boy who'd ruined his life. He spit on the disgusting thing and started kicking it. He would kill it this time, it had gone too far. </p><p>Harry felt his ribs cave as blow after blow rained down on him. It was getting harder and harder to stay awake and even harder to breathe. Harry felt himself be picked up and thrown across the room. He hit the bed frame with his broken wings and another cry of agony escaped him. Hedwig in her cage was thrown at Harry and clasp cut him just under the eye</p><p>The door opened again and there stood Petunia and Dudley, Petunia was holding a frying pan they both glared at him and joined the.asult in Harry. Dudley's shoe slammed into his head and Harry briefly blacked out.</p><p>Desperately Harry tried to think of something. The letter! It was a portkey. Harry latched on to hedwigs cage. He felt a flutter of paper by his hand hoping it was the letter and not a scrap of parchment. Harry called out bolts just as his uncle grabbed his foot.</p>
