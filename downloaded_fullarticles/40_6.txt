    <p>“Up! Get up! Now!”</p><p>Aunt Petunia’s knocks on Harry’s door battered his ears with a tooth-rattlingly sharp tatatatat that made dust trickle down from the ceiling. Harry rolled over onto his stomach and pulled the covers over his head. </p><p>“Up!” Aunt Petunia gave the door one last rap before heading back down the hall to the kitchen</p><p>Harry buried his face against his pillow and tried to remember the dream he’d been having. It had had a flying motorbike in it and he’d been able to peek over the side and watch the twinkling lights of London swirl below him like a sea of stars. What really stuck with him, however, was how familiar the whole thing had felt. Maybe he’d had it before? He‘d never been good at remembering these sorts of things. Harry screwed his eyes shut and tried to grasp the faded whisps of the dream.</p><p>“Are you up yet?!” Petunia and her infernal knocking yanked him back to reality.</p><p>Harry clenched his jaw. “Nearly.”</p><p>“Well, get a move on. You need to look after the bacon--and don’t you dare let it burn. I want everything to be perfect on Duddy’s birthday.”</p><p>Harry groaned.</p><p>“What was that?!”.</p><p>Harry’s heart skipped a beat. “Nothing, nothing,” he said quickly.</p><p> </p><p>Dudley’s birthday. How could he have forgotten?</p><p>Slowly, Harry got out of bed and started looking for socks. He found an odd pair tucked between his bed and the wall. A house spider had made its home in one of them, so Harry scooped it up and let it crawl from his palm up onto one of the low rafters. He was used to spiders, in fact, he’d become very fond of them in the years he’d been sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs. He’d even named a few of them.</p><p>He winced as he looked through the small pile of clothes the Dursleys had supplied him.  All of them were dresses. He picked one that looked the least like a potato sack—a drab, navy blue high waist dress that was at least three sizes too big— and smoothed it out on his bed. The thought of putting it on, of catching himself in the mirror, of having other people seeing him wearing, was enough to make him feel physically ill.</p><p>The dresses had been one of the only presents his aunt and uncle had ever given him. Harry had found them dumped on his bed a few days after he’d mentioned to the Dursleys that he wanted to be a boy. What had he been thinking?</p><p>With grit teeth, Harry pulled the dress over his head. He just had to survive the day.</p><p>The kitchen table completely covered in presents. More than enough to fill Harry’s room from floor to ceiling. It looked like he’d gotten the computer he’d wanted, and the second television, and the racing bike.</p><p>No matter how hard he tried, Harry couldn’t fathom why on earth his cousin had asked for a racing bike of all things. Dudley Dursley hated exercise (unless, of course,  you counted punching Harry as ‘exercise’, in which case it was his favourite thing ever). Though he very rarely managed to do that these days. Running was about the only thing Harry was any good at. Maybe that was what he wanted the bike for. So he and his gang could catch up to Harry when he got away.</p><p>Harry had always been small and quick, skinny too. It probably came with spending so much of his time crammed in the cupboard. The fact that many of the dresses he wore were made for women three times his size didn’t help either. In fact, it only emphasised his thin face and knobbly knees. The only part of his body that Harry actually liked was the thin scar on his forehead the shape of a bolt of lightning. He’d had it for as long as he could remember, though he didn’t have a clue how he’d actually gotten it. He’d made the mistake of asking Aunt Petunia once.</p><p>“In the car crash where your parents died,” she’d told him, her nose wrinkled in disgust. “Don’t ask questions.” Those words had quickly become Harry’s mantra.  Don’t ask questions and you don’t have to deal with the consequences of the answers.</p><p>Uncle Vernon came into the kitchen just as Harry started to plate up the bacon, making sure to put the extra crispy rashers on Dudley’s plate. “Brush your hair,” he growled, plonking himself down into the chair beside his wife. The two of them couldn’t have looked any less alike. While Vernon was thick of bone, belly and hair, Petunia was just the opposite: thin and sallow with pinched and sour lips. One would assume that their son, Dudley, would be a mix of both his parents in appearance. However, it seemed that Vernon’s habit of dominating anything and everything also applied to his genetics.  As a result, Dudley was a near-identical replica of his father: Thick in every sense of the word</p><p>Harry had moved onto scrambling eggs when the birthday boy finally made his grand entrance. Harry felt his whole body tense and he suddenly became very aware of the itchy ring of sellotape holding his glasses together. He moved quickly and plated up the three servings. As he set them down on the table, Harry watched as Dudley counted each of his presents on his fingers. </p><p>He braced himself for an explosion.</p><p>“Thirty-six,” Dudley said with the expression of someone who had been force-fed a lemon. “That’s two less than last year!”</p><p>Aunt Petunia seemed to sense danger as well. “We’ll buy you too more presents while we’re out today. How does that sound, Popkin?  Two more presents. Is that alright?” It was like watching someone defuse a bomb.</p><p>Dudley scrunched up his ruby face in thought. “That’ll be thirty...thirty…”</p><p>“Thirty-nine, sweetums.”</p><p>“Oh.” Dudley plonked himself down and made a grab for the first present.</p><p>Uncle Vernon chuckled. “Little Tyke wants his money’s worth,” he said, ruffling his son’s blonde curls.</p><p>And so began the yearly tradition of watching Dudley unwrap his presents, all of them containing things that Harry could only dream of owning. He had just reached his fifteenth present--a remote-control aeroplane--when the phone rang.</p><p>Aunt Petunia waved her hand as if to say ‘don’t mind me’ and she got up to answer it. Dudley didn’t stop and managed to get through two more presents (a video recorder and a copy of Super Mario World) before she returned with a dark cloud over her head.</p><p>“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs Figg’s broken her leg. She can’t take her.”</p><p>Harry’s heart dropped to his stomach.</p><p>Every year the Dursleys took Dudley and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, burger joints, or the cinema. As a result, every year Harry found himself under the care of Mrs Figg, the old woman who lived two streets away. Harry loved it there.</p><p>Mrs Figg, like Harry, was half Palestinian. She'd taken it upon herself to teach him absolutely everything she knew about their culture, from history to customs to Harry’s personal favourite: food. She bred cats for a living, which worked perfectly fine for Harry. He liked cats as much as he liked spiders.</p><p>Harry loved Mrs Figg. She was family, more so than the Dudley’s had ever been. She was the first person he’d told about wanting to be a boy, and the person who gave him the name Harry.</p><p>She was his escape.</p><p>“I could look after her,” Harry offered quickly.</p><p>His Aunt and Uncle acted as though he hadn’t spoken at all.</p><p>“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested.</p><p>“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the girl.”</p><p>“What about that friend of yours...what’s-her-name?...Yvonne?”</p><p>Aunt Petunia shook her head. “On holiday in Majorca.”</p><p>Harry tried again. He couldn’t miss this. He couldn’t wait another year.  “I could look after her.”</p><p>This time they paid attention.</p><p>Uncle Vernon scoffed. “And let you run amuck in that poor woman’s house?”</p><p>“I won’t run amuck!” He cried, but they weren’t listening anymore.</p><p>“I suppose we could take her with us to the zoo,” Aunt Petunia said slowly, “...and leave her in the car.”</p><p>Uncle Vernon’s face went as red as his son’s. “That car’s new, I’m not leaving her in it alone.”</p><p>Dudley had started to cry by this point. Well, ‘cry’ in the broadest sense of the word. There were no actual tears. Just a long, wailing screech punctuated by Dudley slamming his fists against the kitchen table so hard the plates rattled.</p><p>“Oh, Duddydums!” Aunt Petunia threw her arms around him. “Don’t cry. Mummy’s not going to let her ruin your special day.”</p><p>“I...don’t...want...her...to...come.” Dudley yelled, slamming his fists with each word. “She always spoils everything!”</p><p> </p><p>Just then, the doorbell rang and, like someone had flicked a switch, Dudley’s crying stopped.</p><p>“Oh, they’re here already,” muttered Aunt Petunia under her breath. She and her husband exchanged grim looks.</p><p>All Harry could do was hold his breath.</p><p>Half an hour later, Harry found himself squished between Dudley and his rat-faced friend Piers Polkiss. Piers was Dudley’s longest-lasting friend and was often the one who held Harry’s hands behind his back while Dudley hit him. Harry stared straight ahead and tried his best to ignore the two boys elbowing him in the ribs.</p><p>His aunt and uncle hadn’t let him look after Mrs Figg. Instead, they’d just opted to take him with them to the Zoo. Harry had never been to the Zoo before. He knew he should be excited, but he simply couldn’t work up the effort.</p><p>Before he’d been piled into the car, Uncle Vernon had pulled Harry to one side and put his fat, red face right up close to his. “I’m warning you now, girly--any funny business, anything at all-- and you’ll be in the cupboard from now until Christmas.”</p><p>“I’m not going to do anything,” Harry had promised, “honest.” But he could tell Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did.  To be fair to his uncle, Harry did have a habit of attracting danger.</p><p>Back when he’d told the Dersleys about wanting to be a boy, Aunt Petunia had announced that he was no longer allowed to keep his hair short. Up until then, Harry had managed to convince his aunt and uncle to let him  keep his hair in a lieutenant-yar-esque bob. Harry had watched with dread as his hair grew longer and longer until, after a sleepless night of worry, he’d gotten up to find his pillow littered with tufts of thick, black hair. It hadn’t fallen out; there were no bald patches for him to find. No, his hair had simply broken off. From then on, his hair refused to grow past his ears without breaking. Aunt Petunia’s hairdresser had told them Harry had managed to damage his hair somehow, which meant, naturally, that Harry had to spend three miserable days locked in his cupboard.</p><p>Another time he’d gotten in trouble for climbing onto the roof of the school. He’d tried to explain to the headmistress how he’d been trying to jump behind the bins to hide from Dudley’s gang and that he really didn’t know how he’d managed to fling himself up to the school’s chimney, but his explanation simply didn’t cut it. That misadventure had earned him a whole week in the cupboard.</p><p>Uncle Vernon liked to complain when he drove. He liked to complain, period, usually about Harry--though he would never bring himself to actually call him that. </p><p>The topic of Uncle Vernon’s complaining that day was motorbikes.</p><p>“...roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums!” he growled as a motorbike overtook them.</p><p>“I had a dream about a motorbike,” Harry remembered suddenly. “It could fly.” He froze. He hadn’t meant to speak aloud.</p><p>Uncle Vernon slammed on the breaks. He turned around in his seat to face Harry, his cheeks as red and blotchy as a beetroot. “MOTORBIKES DO NOT FLY!” he boomed.</p><p>Harry sank down in his seat. “I never said they did,” he murmured. “It was a dream.” If there was anything that the Dursleys hated more than questions, it was having things act in a way they shouldn’t. To the Dursleys what went up must come down with absolutely no exceptions. Even cartoons were enough to make Vernon burst into a fit of rage.</p><p>It was a very sunny day and the zoo was full to bursting with families enjoying the summer holidays. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers chocolate ice creams from a van in the carpark, and then, because the woman inside had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon pop. It wasn’t too bad either.</p><p>Harry had been expecting the trip to be hell on earth, however, it turned out to be pretty okay. He could walk a couple of steps behind the Dursleys and no one would even know they were related, and Dudley and Piers were far too busy annoying animals to bother picking on him. They ate lunch at the Zoo’s restaurant and when Dudley refused to eat because his Knickerbocker Glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry got to finish the first.</p><p>Harry knew he should have been happy. He should have been relaxed, but he simply couldn’t shake the feeling that it was all too good to be true.</p><p>After lunch Dudley and Piers dragged Harry and his Aunt and Uncle into the reptile house, claiming--rather loudly--that they wanted to see the biggest, most poisonous snake they could find. The two boys darted from tank to tank and quickly found what they were looking for: a fifteen-foot-long monster of a snake.</p><p>Dudley pressed his face against the tank, his breath fogging up the glass. “Make it move!” he snapped at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. “Do it again!”</p><p>This time, Aunt Petunia rapped her fist against the glass with her patented machine-gun tatatat.</p><p>Again, nothing. The snake just snoozed.</p><p>“This is boring!” Dudley moaned and shuffled away to look at the other tanks.</p><p>Harry took the opportunity to move up to the glass and catch a look at the snake. </p><p>“She’s awful, isn’t she?” he whispered. “She does that to me too.” He put a hand against the glass. </p><p>He was miserable enough being locked in his cupboard every now and then, but the boa constrictor was locked in this tank for months upon months. Maybe even years.</p><p>Suddenly, the snake started to move. It raised its head, drawing it close to Harry’s.</p><p>It winked.</p><p>Harry’s mouth dropped open. He glanced over his shoulder to make sure no one else was watching. They weren’t, so he decided to wink back.</p><p>The snake moved its head towards The Dursleys with a look that seemed to say “I get that all the time.”</p><p>“It must be really annoying,” Harry murmured through the glass.</p><p>The snake nodded. It reminded Harry of Mrs Figg’s cats.</p><p>“Where do you come from anyway?” he asked.</p><p>The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign mounted beside its tank.</p><p>Brazilian Boa Constrictor.</p><p>“Was it nice there?”</p><p>The snake jabbed its tail again and Harry read on:</p><p>This specimen was bred in captivity.</p><p>It had spent its whole life in that little tank. Harry’s shoulders slumped. “I’m so sorry--”</p><p>“DUDLEY! LOOK AT THE SNAKE! YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”</p><p>Before Harry even knew what was going on, Dudley had shoved him out of the way. He fell hard on the concrete floor, grazing his knees something rotten. Again, things moved too fast for him to understand.</p><p>One moment Piers and Dudley were right up against the glass, their eyes wide with awe and the next they were screaming with terror.</p><p>The glass in front of the Boa Constrictor’s tank had vanished.</p><p>The snake uncoiled itself quick as a flash, slithering out of the tank and onto the floor. The screams of the other visitors was deafening.</p><p>The snake slithered up to Harry and stopped just by his feet. It lowered its head, as if to bow before moving swiftly on. Harry just sat there in shock, because he could have sworn he’d heard the snake say “thank you.”</p><p>The ride back to the Dursley’s home at number four privet drive was quiet. Even Dudley remained silent; he just stared out his window for the whole ride home. It wasn’t until they were almost home that Piers finally broke the silence.</p><p>“Henrietta was talking to it,” he said. “Weren’t you?”</p><p>Harry said nothing. He didn’t like answering to that name.</p><p>Uncle Vernon waited until Piers had been picked up before starting on Harry. His face wasn’t just red: it was bright purple. He was shaking from head to toe, a vein standing out on his temple. “Cupboard. Go. No meals!” he snapped, too angry to say anything else.</p><p>Not that it mattered, Harry didn’t need to be told twice. He pulled off his stupid dress and tossed it to the floor before climbing into bed. He pulled the covers over his head. At least in the cupboard, he was safe from Dudley’s wrath.</p><p>He wondered if he could sneak out and find his way to Mrs Figg’s house. He’d have to wait until his Aunt and Uncle had gone to bed, but he could figure out the way, couldn’t he? She’d help him. She always helped him.</p><p>He told himself this sometimes. Sometimes he’d picture it out in his head: him turning up on Mrs Figg’s doorstep. She’d throw her arms around him and give him something hot to drink and tell him everything was going to be alright.</p><p>Whenever he spent the day with her, Mrs Figg would always tell him how brave he was. “Just like his father.”</p><p>But his father was dead.</p><p>And he wouldn’t sneak out.</p><p>He wasn’t brave enough.</p>
