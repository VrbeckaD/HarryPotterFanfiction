    <em>Beca stood, breathing heavily, her wand pointed at the Death Eater in front of her. She could feel blood running down the side of her head, and she could taste it in her mouth.</em>

    <em>The Death Eater was already pointing his own wand at her. His arm was shaking slightly, but she could see the hatred shining in his eyes behind the mask he wore.</em>

    <em>She knew those eyes.</em>

<hr/>
<p>It was September 1st, and Beca was dragging her trunk towards her Dad’s car. He was tapping his keys impatiently against leg.</p>
<p>It was her first day of Hogwarts, and her stomach was churning with nerves. She couldn’t believe the day had finally arrived. She was finally, finally, going to see the famous school she’d heard so much about.</p>
<p>She was finally going to get away from her dad.</p>
<p>“Hurry up,” he snapped, watching without helping while she lifted her heavy trunk into the back of the car.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” she said, climbing into the car.</p>
<p>He didn’t answer, he just climbed in beside her and started driving.</p>
<p>It didn’t take them long to get to Kings Cross. Beca knew her dad had magically altered the car so it could beat traffic.</p>
<p>Given his complete hatred of all things muggle-related, she wondered why he bothered with a car at all. But, of course, she didn’t say that.</p>
<p>He didn’t see her into the station, but before she got out of the car his hand closed around her upper arm.</p>
<p>“Remember who you are, Rebeca. You’re a Mitchell. Do not disgrace me,” he said. His hand tightened until it was painful. “And if anyone asks about your mother,” he squeezed harder still, “she was just some witch you never met. Understand?”</p>
<p>She wrenched her arm free, but nodded, blinking back tears.</p>
<p>“I’ll see you in the summer,” he said.</p>
<p>She felt a flood of relief at the thought. She got out of the car, got her trunk, and made her way into the station.</p>
<p>Her dad her told her how to get to platform 9 and ¾, and, after the heart stopping moment of falling through the barrier, she was on the platform. The scarlet Hogwarts Express was billowing steam across the platform and, for a second, Beca forgot she was supposed to be nervous. She pushed the trolly holding her trunk along the platform, gazing open mouthed at the sheer volume of witches and wizards surrounding her.</p>
<p>She’d grown up in the wizarding world, so it wasn’t like seeing witches and wizards was new for her. But this was the first time she’d seen them looking so…happy. And she’d never seen so many her own age before.</p>
<p>A group of wizards a couple of years older than her knocked into her as they ran past, laughing, and Beca stumbled slightly. She bumped into a girl her age with red hair and piercing blue eyes.</p>
<p>Beca swallowed hard.</p>
<p>“S-sorry,” she stammered.</p>
<p>The redhead flashed a grin at her.</p>
<p>“No problem!” She replied, brightly, before turning away to carry on her conversation.</p>
<p>She made her way to the train and, with some difficulty, heaved her trunk onto the train and into an empty compartment.</p>
<p>She took a minute to catch her breath.</p>
<p>She was on the Hogwarts Express! She was finally going. She took her wand out of her pocket and held it in her hands. Enjoying the weight and feel of it as she remembered what Ollivander had said a few weeks earlier.</p>
<p>“Alder!” He said, describing the wood as he placed it in her hands. “Unicorn hair core, 10 and ¾ inches!”</p>
<p>Beca felt a rush of warm run through her, as if she’d just swallowed Butterbeer.</p>
<p>“I think we have a match,” he said, clapping his hands together. “Curious… given your family name… Unicorn hair is often resistant to, um, dark magic. But, the wand chooses the wizard, after all!”</p>
<p>Beca remembered her warm feeling had been extinguished, like she’d swallowed ice water, when Ollivander had mentioned dark magic.</p>
<p>She didn’t have time to dwell though, as the door to her compartment was slid open, revealing the redhead from earlier and a rather uptight looking blonde.</p>
<p>“Can we sit in here?” The redhead asked, gesturing to the empty seats opposite.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Beca said, putting her wand away.</p>
<p>“I’m Chloe!” The redhead said happily, holding out her hand. “Chloe Beale.”</p>
<p>Beca shook it, feeling herself blush. “I’m Beca.” She hesitated. “Beca Mitchell.”</p>
<p>The blonde’s eyes narrowed. “Mitchell?”</p>
<p>Beca nodded, avoiding eye-contact.</p>
<p>“Mitchell like John Mitchell?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Beca said, her throat dry. “He’s my dad.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Aubrey said, looking vaguely disgusted. “Chloe, maybe we should sit somewhere-”</p>
<p>“Don’t be silly Aubrey!” Chloe said, still cheerful.</p>
<p>“I'm… I’m not like my dad,” she said. “I’m nothing like my dad.”</p>
<p>Aubrey opened her mouth to say something but the door slid open again.</p>
<p>“What’s up witches!” A loud girl with an Australian accent said, standing in the doorway. She was already wearing her robes, a red and gold striped tie tied around her neck. “I’m Fat Amy, I’m just looking for first years so I can play guess the house. Everyone I get right earns me a galleon.” She stared at the three girls in front of her. She pointed at Beca. “Slytherin,” she said, as though the word left a bad taste in her mouth. She pointed at Aubrey. “Hmm. Ravenclaw. Or maybe a fellow Gryffindor? Actually,” she squinted and tilted her head, “you’ve got the ruthless, cold eyes of a Slytherin.” She let out a huff of frustration. “Look, I’m just gonna say Ravenclaw. So when the Sorting Hat asks you, make sure you pick it.”</p>
<p>“The Sorting Hat will ask?” Beca said, trying not to sound too hopeful.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Amy said. “Especially if it can’t decide. So you might have a chance to get away from Slytherin! But please don’t, I need the money.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t sort me,” Chloe said, brightly.</p>
<p>“Oh sweetie,” Amy said, “you’re a Hufflepuff if ever there was one. Anyway, I’ll be off. I heard Harry Potter is on this train, so I’m gonna go gawk at him.”</p>
<p>And with that, she slid the door shut, and the girls were alone again.</p>
<p>“Do you really think you’ll be in Slytherin?” Chloe asked, sounding something less than cheerful for the first time.</p>
<p>Beca shrugged. “My dad was. And his parents. And their parents. It usually runs in your blood, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Not necessarily,” Aubrey said. “My Dad was in Ravenclaw, but his parents were both Gryffindors.”</p>
<p>“What house was your Mom in?” Chloe asked.</p>
<p>Beca swallowed, remembering the lie she was supposed to say. “I… I never met my Mom,” Beca said. <em>She was just some witch you never met,</em> she heard her Dad’s voice in her head. <em>Some witch</em>. “She died when I was born.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Chloe said. “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” Beca said.</p>
<p>“So you don’t even know what house she was in?” Aubrey asked, earning a scowl from Chloe.</p>
<p>“N-no,” Beca said. <em>Some witch you never met</em>. “Dad doesn’t like talking about her.” Beca searched around for something to say. “What about your family?” She asked Chloe.</p>
<p>“Oh, that Amy girl was right. I’m a Hufflepuff for sure. My whole family have been Puffs for generations. Cut me open, I bleed black and yellow,” Chloe said, smiling wistfully.</p>
<p>“You’re so weird,” Aubrey said, shaking her head, and Beca laughed.</p>
<p>The sound of Beca’s laughter caused Chloe’s eyes to sparkle. Like it was the best sound she’d ever heard.</p>
<p>The three girls carried on talking, or, more accurately, Chloe kept on talking while Beca and Aubrey joined in occasionally. The sky outside was beginning to darken when Aubrey suggested they change into their robes.</p>
<p>Beca turned her back to the other two girls as she changed. She felt her stomach lurch as a hand lightly touched the bruise on her arm she had gotten from her dad in the car. Beca quickly shoved it into her sleeve and finished dressing.</p>
<p>“How did you get that?” Chloe asked, already changed. She shook her head a second later. “Sorry. I’m really bad at, like, judging boundaries. I shouldn’t have asked that.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” Beca said. “I think I must have knocked it on something.”</p>
<p>Chloe opened her mouth to respond, perhaps to indicate that she didn’t believe her, but then closed it again.</p>
<p>The train rumbled to a halt, and prefects began walking down the corridor, calling for first years to follow them.</p>
<p>Beca, Chloe and Aubrey made their way onto the platform and were jostled together with the other first years, who were easy to spot. They didn’t have house colours adorning their robes for one thing, and they all looked a mixture of both excited and terrified.</p>
<p>She bumped into a boy about the same height as her, which was saying something considering how small she was, and gave him a nervous smile before realising with a jolt that it was Harry Potter.</p>
<p>She didn’t get a chance to say anything to him, as they were both put in separate boats. Beca was still with Chloe and Aubrey, with the addition of a couple of other nervous looking kids.</p>
<p>A giant of a man, who had introduced himself as Hagrid, was saying something in a booming voice as the boats started to move. Beca felt another thrill of excitement ripple through her as she remembered once again that this was real. All those years of waiting had lead to this day, this moment, and it was finally happening.</p>
<p>She glanced at Chloe who looked as excited as she felt, and Beca managed another smile. She realised she’d smiled more in the last few hours than she had in the past year.</p>
<p>“Yell get yer firs’ look at Hogwarts in a minute,” Hagrid called from the leading boat.</p>
<p>Beca held her breath, promising herself she would remember this moment forever.</p>
<p>The boats moved past a line of trees and suddenly, there it was.</p>
<p>Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Home.</p>
<p>“Oh my stars,” one of the girls in the boat with them whispered, and Beca couldn’t even bring herself to laugh at the cheesiness of it.</p>
<p>The rest of the journey finished quickly, and soon they were being lead down the Great Hall to be sorted. They all gaped at the ceiling, which was showing an incredible night sky. Not even the mutterings of some girl telling them it was just an enchantment could dull Beca’s feeling of amazement.</p>
<p>And then the sorting began.</p>
<p>Benjamin Applebaum was sorted into Ravenclaw.</p>
<p>Chloe Beale went, of course, into Hufflepuff.</p>
<p>A tall, brown haired girl called Stacie Conrad was the first Slytherin, and Beca thought she saw her smile falter slightly before she joined the table of cheering Slytherin students.</p>
<p>The girl who had said ‘Oh my stars!’ in their boat turned out to be a girl name Emily Junk, who joined Chloe in Hufflepuff.</p>
<p>More and more were sorted. A blonde boy with a sly grin named Draco Malfoy was sorted into Slytherin before the hat had even left McGonagall’s hand, and then suddenly, it was Beca’s turn.</p>
<p>She heard mutterings from the Slytherin table at the sound of her surname, and she made her way nervously to the stool.</p>
<p>When the hat touched her, she heard a rough, raspy voice inside her head.</p>
<p>“Ah, Mitchell is it?” The voice that she knew belonged to the hat said. Beca didn’t know how to reply, none of the other students had talked aloud, so she just thought <em>yes</em>. “Pretty obvious where to put you, don’t you think?” <em>Yes</em>, Beca thought again, though she felt her shoulders sag. “Or maybe not?” The hat said, a note of amusement in his voice. “You could go anywhere, you know. You’ve got the brains for Ravenclaw and the ambition for Slytherin. You’re loyal, you’d be happy in Hufflepuff. And Gryffindor… Wouldn’t that be a one for the books? And why not? You’ve got the courage. So where should you go?”</p>
<p>But Beca couldn’t answer. She knew where she wanted to go. She wanted to be anywhere other than Slytherin. She wanted to escape the reputation her surname gave her. She’d be happy in Hufflepuff, with Chloe. She almost told the hat to put her there, when her dad’s voice bubbled up out of nowhere.</p>
<p>
  <em>Remember who you are.</em>
</p>
<p>Her dad… He’d be furious if she ended up in any other house. The thought of displeasing him like that made her stomach feel like it had turned to liquid.</p>
<p>To choose any other house would be madness. It was the type of thing a Gryffindor might do.</p>
<p>But she wasn’t a Gryffindor. She wasn’t brave.</p>
<p>If she wanted to survive her next visit home, she knew what she had to do.</p>
<p><em>Put me in Slytherin</em>, she thought.</p>
<p>“Very well,” the hat said, in her head. “Slytherin!” He called out to the Great Hall.</p>
<p>The table of green-clad students were stamping their feet and banging on the table, and she went and sat next to the girl Stacie.</p>
<p>“You don’t look so happy to be here,” Stacie mumbled, just low enough for Beca to hear.</p>
<p>“Neither do you,” Beca said, as Aubrey was placed in Gryffindor, after some deliberation.</p>
<p>“No,” Stacie said. “I’m not.”</p>
<p>“Me neither,” Beca said, watching as the hat was placed on Harry Potter. The room was silent.</p>
<p>“Friends?” Stacie asked, holding out a hand.</p>
<p>“Friends,” Beca said, shaking it. She looked across the hall at the Hufflepuff table and made eye-contact with Chloe. She smiled at her, and Beca felt a swooping feeling of relief when Chloe smiled back.</p>
<p>There was a roar of noise from the Gryffindor table as Harry Potter went to join them, but Beca’s eyes never left Chloe’s.</p>
<p><em>Friends</em>.</p>
