    <p>The Mayor of Michel Delving sat in his chair, reading the latest post that one of his assistants handed to him. It was quite a lot of mail, none of it pretty and the rest giving away too much information. Still, he cared to read one brown parchment, read in fine script and spoken in the Common Tongue. The letter didn't contain too much – or rather it did, for it was very long and quite disturbing.</p><p>
  <em>Dear Mr. Mayor,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You may not know me and I do not certainly know you, but what I have found needs your attention. I have immense money, tons and tons of gold coins, if you consider my offer. And my offer stands firm all the same.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>In two years' time, Mr. Frodo Baggins will turn twelve and he has defeated me once already. I do not yet know what his next plan is, but seeing as I have found a way to travel back in time, this request must not be delayed. It is with great urgency that I come to you at this hour. I have informed the other villains of your whereabouts and I will not hesitate to stop you if you fail me.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Therefore, I have taken note to, at this moment, dispatch my goblins, which are heading your way. Mr. Mayor, you are my prime suspect and you will take charge what I have to say this instant, whether grievous or otherwise outstanding.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>If you do not answer, before I have made my final preparations, I will blow up half of Michel Delving and you will have nothing to stand for, except for your own flour. Do you hear me, Mr. Mayor? My request will not wait another instant.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>In your charge, my most dubious mayor.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Sauron the Deceiver, Sauron the Great, Sauron the Tremendous</em>
</p><p>"Humph!" The Mayor grunted proudly. "What nerve! Come to me and demand ransom. What is this villain up to?"</p><p>But Sauron could not wait another moment. No! Instead, he burst through the door in his black armor and elvish looks, mixed in with locks of dark hair. He couldn't believe this! He was fading in and out. Oh, the nerve of it all! Oh, he would get his physical form back and then Frodo would pay for his crimes.</p><p>"Who are you?" the Mayor asked, quite confused. "What are you doing here?"</p><p>"I have come to bargain," Sauron told him in a deep setting voice. "Give me Frodo Baggins now and you can walk away."</p><p>"How did you get here, in my office?" the Mayor spoke, distraught.</p><p>"Humph." The Dark Lord looked about the place, tensely. "You don't tidy things up well, do you?" He grinned. "Look, I will not ask you again. Where is he?"</p><p>"Where is who?" the Mayor asked in turn.</p><p>"Where is – Frodo Baggins! That's who," Sauron spat. "I'd like to know where he is, so I can destroy him." He pointed his mace at the poor hobbit. "Tell me where he is or I will crush you."</p><p>"You've come to wrong place to do that!" the Mayor fought back. "Get out of my office!"</p><p>Sauron grunted. "I'll be back and you had better not be going anywhere." He stormed out of the office grumbling. This was not a good day at all for him. First, he lost the first battle against Frodo Baggins and his little author. Now this. What more could a dark lord do?</p><p>.</p><p>The Mayor of Michel Delving sat in his chair, reading a newspaper. Three years had already passed, and yet time seemed to move more slowly. He glanced up at the rounded window in his office. No way. There was a giant water bubble floating around, slipping in and out of golden hued lights. Oh could this be?! How could – no! He knew just what was causing this.</p><p>"Sauron," the Mayor protested. "I will—"</p><p>"What?!" Sauron asked, bashing through the wall and splitting the door from its frame. The Mayor's eyes were like daggers towards the Dark Lord.</p><p>"Please Sauron, do not bash apart my door!" The Mayor told him, annoyed.</p><p>Sauron grunted. "Where is he?"</p><p>"Where is who?" the Mayor asked, placing two hands on his hips.</p><p>"Where is—" Sauron shook his head. "Oh, don't play games. You know who I'm talking about, old man – old hobbit! Frodo Baggins, that's who."</p><p>"I'm sorry, but Frodo hasn't been to Michel Delving for a very long time." The Mayor addressed him, quite peeved with the situation. "Now, if you don't mind, I would like my office back. And put that door back together, why don't you?"</p><p>But Sauron didn't put the door back. He smashed it in two, infuriating the Mayor in the process. "Where is he?!" The Dark Lord was enraged now. "My orcs will come here, looking for him! As will the Death Eaters. So, if you don't find him for me, then I will most certainly—"</p><p>"Sauron," the Mayor started, "we're done."</p><p>"We are not done. I will come back and you will pay," Sauron said, his eyes glowering at him before breaking through the wall once again. The Mayor huffed. This was the last thing he expected to see happen.</p><p>"Now I have another door to fix up," he shook his head. There were some things even he couldn't change. But then, he did worry about what would happen to the lad, Frodo Baggins was it? When he discovered the Dark Lord was looking for him? Well, the Mayor hoped he would make it out all right. He hoped it at least. But then, there was no telling what Sauron might do once he found him alive, wherever he was at this very moment.</p>
