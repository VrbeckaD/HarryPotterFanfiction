  <em>The Malfoy Heir lives in Malfoy Manor. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> This is as it has been since the Manor was constructed.  Each brick was laid down with the continuation of the line in mind. Each spell woven into the walls and windows calls out to those of Malfoy blood, whispering: this is where you belong. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Armand Malfoy, “adviser” to William the Conqueror, set foot on the shores of Pevensey with the intention of establishing a dynasty. Anyone who has approached the high walls of his descendants’ imposing Wiltshire home would have to agree he’d succeeded. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> The current Manor is not the first magical dwelling built on this plot of land, of course, lying south of the Salisbury Plain with the power of Stonehenge and various ley lines at its back. There have been castles, moats, and fortifications preceding it. Yet it is the current Elizabethan estate, larger than all those before, that has established itself - with roots almost like a tree, unseen threads woven of wards and blood rituals that stretch down into the soil itself to meld with the land around it. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Even when abandoned in summer for French beach houses, or holidays spent in Alpine cabins, the Manor has stood proud waiting for its masters to return. Each Malfoy raised there feels an invisible pull to this house that has existed for over four hundred years, protecting and nurturing each generation. To be removed from the wards is to feel a deep sense of loss, a homesickness that settles in the soul and can never be assuaged. The fear of such exile has kept children in line and wives faithful. Each heir is educated in the ways of the wards and taught the powerful magics that echo through the grounds and the Manor itself. </em>

  <em> Draco Malfoy no longer lives in Malfoy Manor. </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em> Draco Malfoy is no longer the Malfoy Heir.</em>
