    <p>“You disobeyed me.”</p><p>“I had to-”</p><p>“-You<em> deliberately disobeyed me </em>.”</p><p>“I saved them!”</p><p>“But you could have gotten everyone killed! You think your crew members can trust you if you go off doing your own thing and not taking orders. You were completely unaccounted for!” Tom’s breathing was harsh and Harry was actually tempted to shy back into himself as the taller man towered over him. Harry kept their stares locked and he couldn’t help but notice that Tom looked… almost pained. "<em>You</em> could've died."</p><p>Harry stood his ground, which probably wasn’t the best idea.</p><p>“Twenty lashes,” Tom said, his eyes softened but his grip on Harry’s arm remained tight. “One for every man you could have <em> killed </em>for the sake of your three friends.”</p><p>Harry stood, letting the punishment sink in. “You can’t be serious.”</p><p>“I’m very serious, Harry. Lie down, now.” When Harry didn’t move, Tom continued. “Now!”</p><p>Harry moved quickly, not wanting to make his punishment any worse.</p><p>“Breeches off as well.” Harry wanted to whine but wiggled them down his hips before lying down on the bed. <em> Their </em>bed.</p><p>“Why are you getting this, Potter?” Harry gulped at Tom’s tone.</p><p>“Because I saved people’s lives.” He felt the whip come down on his bare arse.</p><p>“Try again.”</p><p>“Because I went against your orders and risked the crew and their lives.”</p><p>“And?” Harry had thought he’d gotten it right, but then he remembered: Tom never considered Harry to be just <em> crew </em>.</p><p>“And… my life.”</p><p>“Correct. Now I want you to count every lash.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.” Harry felt the gentle caress of the lash before it came down <em> hard. </em></p><p>“One.” Harry gritted his teeth. “Two.” Lashes were never fun, not for Harry at least. “Three.”</p><p>Tom never went easy on Harry, his blows never lessened up and, on some cases, they only worsened. At ten, Tom gave Harry a quick break, but Harry hated that. Tom was methodical with the way that he handed out the lashes, often keeping an even amount of time within each lash, but when he took a break, it caused for the next lash to come unexpectedly.</p><p>Harry squeaked out a quick ‘eleven’, as Tom continued on with the punishment.</p><p>The last one came and tears were coming down his cheeks, his face almost as red as his arse, but it would never be as bruised.</p><p>Tom set the lash aside and went to get the gel that he only used on Harry. Most people that got lashes were sent straight to the infirmary to be dealt with there, but Harry’s was his to deal with.</p><p>“I hate you.” Harry muttered as Tom spread the gel on his arse, causing both a stinging sensation and a cooling effect on the already bruised cheeks. While the words cause a slight tinge of pain in Tom’s heart, he knew that Harry didn't mean it.</p><p>“I’d prefer you to be alive to hate me than dead.” Tom maneuvered Harry slightly so that he could lay down in the bed with him. “I couldn’t live without you, Harry.”</p><p>The man sniffed as he cuddled up in Tom’s chest, the man pressed a kiss to the crown of Harry’s head.</p><p>“Get some sleep, love.”</p>
