<hr/><p>~*X0X0*~</p><p>"Are you sure this is even legal what I am doing?" I asked Cho Chang, feeling extremely nervous for some odd reason.</p><p>"This is such an odd request for me to wear these."</p><p>You'd think I would be used to the jitters I feel, like a thousand of butterflies flying around in the pit of my stomach, as many times over the years as I have performed the duties of my job entails. But tonight.</p><p>Tonight feels-</p><p>I have a feeling and it is-</p><p>weird. To say the least.</p><p>I can't even explain it but I have to do my job.</p><p>I have half a mind to walk away from it.</p><p>To just walk out.</p><p>To cancel.</p><p>But I don't.</p><p>I don't want to cancel my performance tonight.</p><p>It is weird that I actually want to do it.</p><p>Cho is an adult birthday planner whom contacted me to perform at a 'special event.'</p><p>I agreed.</p><p>Only because my rent needs paid.</p><p>No shame in my game.</p><p>All I know is that this is an older gentleman, and I am perfectly okay with that aspect.</p><p>After all, I am no longer in the Wizarding World.</p><p>I decided it best to stay in the Muggle Word after Harry Potter won the war.</p><p>Despite the prejudice in the Wizarding World that still exists today, I know that I belong in the Wizarding World. I just can't go back.</p><p>Too much trauma from the Wizarding Word.</p><p>I decided it best that I leave it behind.</p><p>And that is exactly what I did without a backwards glance.</p><p>"Yes, Hermione! Stop with the questions." Said Cho as she hastily puts the emerald green jewels over my body.</p><p>I am nearly covered head to toe in emerald green jewels, and if Cho adds any more to my skin, I will be completely covered.</p><p>My breasts and my face is the only area of my skin that is not covered in the emerald green jewels that sparkle brightly if the light hits at them.</p><p>Believe me, I shine like the sun right now.</p><p>I look down and all I see is emerald green.</p><p>Emerald green.</p><p>"But.. " I silently cringe inside as I am getting cold feet.</p><p>The coldness seeps inside my bones, causing a phantom breeze to roll up the back of my spine.</p><p>Cho has been talking me into it.</p><p>Talking me into staying. To complete my job and then...</p><p>Leave.</p><p>But-</p><p>What if I see somebody I know?</p><p>What if who I am dancing for doesn't enjoy or even like my performance, and wants a refund?</p><p>"Hush. I am almost done." Said Cho. "Time is money."</p><p>I roll my eyes and sigh. "At least I am getting paid for this shit."</p><p>Cho chuckles and nods her head in agreement.</p><p>"I have a feeling the gentleman will not be disappointed." Said Cho with a smile as she puts the last of the emerald green jewels on my ankle area.</p><p>~*X0X0*~</p><p>I am inside a real Birthday Cake. It is huge.</p><p>It is strawberry flavored. I can tell. The air is filled up with the strawberry aroma.</p><p>I hear piano music playing off in the distance. It is a slow, joyous beat.</p><p>Then, Cho's voice speaks.</p><p>She is loud and clear.</p><p>"Okay, ya'll let's take off our Birthday Mans blindfold."</p><p>I hear loud laughing and cheering in the background. Then all of a sudden, the top of the strawberry cake lifts up, and the metal floor I am standing on drives up into the air.</p><p>I look around the crowd with a fake smile on my face as I am revealed. I am helped out of the strawberry cake by a body guard named Regulus.</p><p>"Thank you, Reggie." Whispered I to my old friend.</p><p>"You will be quite surprised, Hermione." I look at him, and his face is dead serious. Reggie glances over to the side and nods to-</p><p>I squint my eyes. Is that-</p><p>"Professor Snape?" Whispered I to Reggie. "What is he doing here?"</p><p>He whispers back to me, "Cho didn't tell you? He is who you are to perform for."</p><p>~*X0X0*~</p><p>I slowly walk towards my old potions professor when I was in the Wizarding World like I am in a runway model show.</p><p>Cho gave me the microphone. So I sing. As best as I could sing without sounding like a dying cow.</p><p>"Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear Severus. Happy Birthday to you."</p><p>Just when I am before him, he roams my body attire.</p><p>He seems to accept what he sees. Perhaps he even likes what he sees.</p><p>Does he recognize me?</p><p>They cheer after I sing happy birthday to him, and a moment after Cho takes the microphone away from me, Severus is there standing before me and he grabs my upper arm and is pushing me out towards the hallway.</p><p>"What the hell do you think you are doing?" He spat angrily in my face, pressing my back against the brick wall. The emerald jewels digging deeper into the back of my skin.</p><p>"Oh, this must be a new side to you. I like it." Said I in what I could make out as a flirty and vivacious manner.</p><p>"No... this is not you." Said he.</p><p>"A lot of things happen and a girl can change over the years,<em> Professor</em>. This is my job." Said I, as I look right into his black eyes.</p><p>He seems angry, but I am shocked he even recognized me.</p><p>He stays silent and just stares at me. I sigh.</p><p>"Don't tell me you want a refund, do you?"</p><p>He blinks as if clearing fog. "No. I don't want a refund."</p><p>I sigh and smile at him.</p><p>"We should head back to your birthday party."</p><p>After all, his friends paid for him to have a dancer on his birthday.</p><p>This is his party.</p><p>Here I am.</p><p>"I think you and I are going to have a long chat when my birthday party is over." Said he, and he looks a little less tense.</p><p>"I will definitely look forward to it." Said I with a genuine smile on my face.</p><p>He nods his head in understanding and then he takes me by my hand and leads me back to his birthday party where I dance on his lap as he watches me.</p></div>
