    <p>There were new shoes that pinched terribly on the feet of Hermione Granger. They were red with a dangerous heel and looked glamorous and definitely oozed power. They’d been purchased by Hermione three days early in a fit of excess on the basis of the aforementioned promise of glamour, power and a sense of impractical adult-ness that seemed to shout ‘this woman doesn’t give a fuck’. Plus, a sign in the store had given strong assurances that the beautiful red shoes also had been charmed to never pinch or rub.</p>
<p>They pinched <i>and</i> rubbed. And they made her calves ache.</p>
<p>In fact, they were pretty uncomfortable all round. Hermione frowned a little at the mirror in the Ministry bathroom. The shoes looked great, and her new robe was professional, fitted, and navy. It was all a bit boring, but then again she was a bit boring too. </p>
<p>That was where the shoes came in. They added colour and life, declared to the world that, navy robe aside, <i>she</i> was not boring and in fact under all the intellect and academic accolades was a Glamorous Powerful Witch who Did Not Give a Fuck.</p>
<p>That’s what they were supposed to do.</p>
<p>But in actuality they just hurt her feet and reminded her that she <i>wasn’t</i> the type of witch that wore tiny, unstable, patent red heels at all. Arriving finally at a decision, she took her heels off one at a time and shoved them in the shoulder bag she was carrying. Thrusting her arm deep inside she pulled out a pair of flat-soled boots. She stepped into them and immediately felt better.</p>
<p>Hermione looked back at her reflection. She was shorter and looked a bit frumpy. And definitely like she had run out of fucks.</p>
<p>
  <i>Right.</i>
</p>
<p>She grinned at herself. <i>This</i> was more the Hermione she was. Under all the intellect and academic accolades was a frumpy witch who preferred comfort, and rejected the foot-torturing instruments of the patriarchy. Red shoes be damned.</p>
<p>A far happier Hermione made her way towards the Floo, checking her watch (still ticking despite the anti-muggle charms thank you very much) to see whether she was on time for her meeting. She was precisely three minutes early, which was pretty much perfect as far as she was concerned. At the Floo, she tossed in some powder, declared her intentions to visit the Floo of the Headmaster of Hogwarts, and stepped into the green flames.</p>
<p>“Hermione!” she heard a voice call with a tone of delight as she stepped out onto a muted, beautifully woven rug.</p>
<p>“Hello, Professor McGonagall,” Hermione greeted the familiar witch, who had walked towards her from behind the large walnut desk. The desk had a strange, twisted appearance with bowed, ornate legs and lifelike carvings of the heads of a lion, eagle, snake and a badger on the front. It was hideous and Hermione loved it on sight.</p>
<p>“Minerva, please,” said Minerva (please).</p>
<p>“Thank you for the opportunity,” said Hermione. “I’m looking forward to what I can do to assist.”</p>
<p>“I am as well,” said Minerva. “Tea?”</p>
<p>“Yes please,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>As Minerva floated a rather lovely tea service onto the desk, Hermione spotted a stack of three books on the shelf behind her former professor.</p>
<p>
  <i>Hogwarts: A Haunted History - An Exploration of The Ghostly Inhabitants</i><br/>Poltergeists: Instruments of Chaos or Misunderstood Non-Beings?<br/>Beyond the Veil
</p>
<p>All bore the author’s name in gold lettering: <i>H. J. Granger. </i></p>
<p>“Oh, I see you’ve spotted my background reading,” said Minerva. “They really are excellent.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Hermione. “I enjoyed writing them. I was thinking of doing a new one covering  some of my case studies from work.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps you’ll find some inspiration here,” said Minerva as she poured two cups of the steaming, fragrant liquid.</p>
<p>“Lovely,” said Hermione as she took her cup. She raised it to her lips and took a sip, which turned into a small choke.</p>
<p>She glanced up at Minerva in surprise to meet the unamused gaze of her former Head of House.</p>
<p>“I thought you were making tea?” Hermione asked, looking into the cup. It was filled to the bone-china brim with eye-wateringly strong black coffee.</p>
<p>“I did,” said Minerva. “That’s what happens to tea here. And pumpkin juice. And, most annoyingly, my single-malt scotch.”</p>
<p>Hermione took another experimental sip from his cup. It was perishingly strong but good. “So all those drinks turn into coffee?” she summarised.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Minerva.</p>
<p>“Is Peeves doing it?” asked Hermione. “Or one of the ghosts? Is that why you needed the Spirit Division?”</p>
<p>“We think it’s another poltergeist,” sighed Minerva. “It turned up about a year and a half after the fall of Voldemort.”</p>
<p>“Interesting,” said Hermione. “Is Peeves still here?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Minerva. “Still creating havoc.”</p>
<p>“Well that’s even more interesting,” said Hermione. “Poltergeists are generally quite territorial. I’ve only had a few rare cases when an established one will allow another to remain on its territory.”</p>
<p>“Peeves is impossible,” said Minerva. “We cant get anything out of him at the best of times. And on this situation he is worse than usual.”</p>
<p>“So if this new non-being has been here, well, almost ten years, then, what is the issue?” Hermione asked.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t so bad initially,” said Minerva. “A few things here and there. Mostly silly, some more mean spirited, but nothing we weren’t already accustomed to with Peeves. Over the past six months, as we’ve neared the ten year anniversary of Voldemort’s defeat, it has got completely out of hand. The staff are threatening to leave Hogwarts if I don’t deal with the situation.”</p>
<p>“All right,” said Hermione. “I’ll see what I can do.”</p>
<p>She downed the rest of the coffee. No point wasting it.</p>
<p>“Let me show you the modifications to the castle since you were last here. And I understand you wish to stay at the castle overnight?” said Minerva as a flick of the hand cleared away the china.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Hermione. “They’re less active at night, and much easier to reason with.”</p>
<p>“I have spare rooms in the Ravenclaw tower if that suits,” said Minerva.</p>
<p>“That’s fine,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>They began to walk down the staircase and past the same old gargoyle. Hermione was amazed it had survived the battle, but as they walked nearer she could see the spidery-thin cracks running across its head and torso. It was a good repair, but a repair none the less.</p>
<p>She oohed and aahed appropriately at the refurbished sections of the castle, particularly the Great Hall and<i> sigh</i> the quidditch field. The last location had dashed the spark of real excitement that had bloomed when she’d had been taken past the library. That particular area had doubled in size since Hermione had seen it and she was dying to go inside. As they walked past a Hermione noticed Mrs Pince still perched at the desk, the witch’s mouth set in a stern line despite the well-appointed surroundings. </p>
<p>“Now<i> this</i> is a beautiful addition,” said Minerva as she entered the castle grounds and led Hermione to the eastern section. “Only opened last month.”</p>
<p>Hermione followed Minerva along a white, cobblestone path towards a traditional walled garden.</p>
<p>“The Garden of Heroes,” Minerva announced.</p>
<p>“I see,” said Hermione.</p>
<p>There were statues. Everywhere.</p>
<p>“Is this Lavender Brown?” asked Hermione as she stopped to examine nearest statue. It was a good likeness of Lavender, who appeared to have been caught mid-spell and of course her carved hair was perfect. </p>
<p>“This section of the garden has the brave souls, students and other, who died the the battle,” said Minerva. </p>
<p>They continued to walk, threading across the grass and around the figure of Colin Creevey and his ubiquitous camera. </p>
<p>“In this section,” Minerva said, gesticulating, “we have the heroes of the Order.”</p>
<p>Hermione was startled briefly when she turned to the left and was face to face with Alastor Moody. He had been carved with his standard fierce expression—the artist had perfectly captured the slight turn of his magical eye.</p>
<p>There was Fred in this garden, too, and Remus and Tonks. Hermione watched Minerva gently touch each statue as they made their way to the final section of the garden,</p>
<p>“This is slightly unexpected,” said Hermione upon catching side of the two statues, facing away from each other and surrounded by roses.</p>
<p>“So sad,” sighed Minerva as she turned to gaze at the statue of Severus Snape.</p>
<p>“It <i>is </i>a bit tragic,” said Hermione in a restrained manner. </p>
<p>Minerva bent over the roses to take in their fragrance. “Indeed,” she said. “And such a loss for wizarding Britain.”</p>
<p>Hermione had wandered over and stood in front of the statue of Snape.</p>
<p>“To be honest, looking at this statue it was a bloody loss for the witches of Britain too,” she said.</p>
<p>“What?” said Minerva and left the roses to go and stand next to Hermione. “Oh! For Merlin’s sake is <i>nothing</i> sacred?” </p>
<p>“I take it the statue doesn’t normally look like that,” drawled Hermione. “Shame really.”</p>
<p>Both witches looked at the figure.</p>
<p>The figure stared directly ahead, with a devilish looking smile, but the stone frock coat had been rendered as open and half falling off what was indeed a chiseled (literally <i>and</i> figuratively) chest. Between the quite magnificent pectoral muscles, as the eye followed down (yes please), was a hint of an impressive six-pack. </p>
<p>“Professor Snape was shredded,” said Hermione. “And kinda hot.”</p>
<p>“This is not Severus,” said Minerva primly. </p>
<p>“Don’t look at his pants then,” Hermione ordered. “At least let me keep the fantasy alive that it was based on reality.”</p>
<p>“Oh my!” exclaimed Minerva.</p>
<p>There was a carefully sculptured, and prominent bulge in the stone trousers of the statue.</p>
<p>“I’m impressed he could walk,” said Hermione. “Let along undertake a perilous life as a spy. He must have charmed it so he didn’t get a back ache.” </p>
<p>“I’ll have it covered up until I can deal with the situation,” said Minerva. “This is <i>exactly</i> what I was talking about with the poltergeist.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I’d count this one as mean spirited,” said Hermione. “If he was alive Professor Snape would probably have secretly loved it.”</p>
<p>“Well...Maybe,” admitted Minerva.</p>
<p>They walked around to the statue of Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“At least they’ve left his groin alone,” said Minerva in a relieved tone. “And his robes.”</p>
<p>“He has a cock on his face,” Hermione stayed baldly.</p>
<p>And he did.</p>
<p>There was a perfectly carved flaccid penis nestled atop a pair of slightly low hanging testicles right in the middle of the statue’s forehead. The stature appeared to be completely at ease with this, staring out across the beautiful garden with a noble expression. </p>
<p>“It’s not as impressive as the one on the other statue,” said Hermione. “Perhaps they ran out of stone.” </p>
<p>Minerva’s mouth worked silently as she processed what was in front of her eyes.</p>
<p>“Right,” the older witch finally said. “I’m going to close off this part of the garden until we can deal with. </p>
<p>“I should take some photographs of these statues first,” said Hermione as she pulled he camera out of her bag. “For my records,” she said defensively upon catching sight of the powerful side-eye that Minerva had sent her way.</p>
<p>She took a few snaps of the Dumbledore statue, and a few of the Snape statue, and a few of the Snape’s statue’s muscular torso. And one close-up of the enormous bulge....for her records.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Hermione said. “That’s all I need here.”</p>
<p>They left the garden with the unnerving phallus artistic expression and walked back towards Hogwarts. Hermione could hear the rustling behind her as the hedges moved together, cutting all access off to the Snape and Dumbledore statues.</p>
<p>“Let’s take you to your room,” said Minerva. “If it hasn’t vanished or turned into a toilet or something.”</p>
<p>“Sounds exciting,” said Hermione. “I don’t think I’ve encountered such a prolific non-being before.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Minerva grimly, “<i>Prolific</i>.”</p>
<p>Their walk to the tower took slightly longer than expected as one staircase turned into a slide while they were halfway up, and only a fast-thinking feet sticking charm prevented them from hurtling back down into a wall. Some of the portraits looked glum as Hermione passed them, as most of them apparently had also felt the wrath of the poltergeist. </p>
<p>“Amazing,” Hermione murmured as she saw the portrait of Sir Cadogan. He was astride an ostrich, and sporting a glorious blue mohawk hairstyle. He winced ruefully at her as she walked under his frame.</p>
<p>“And here we are,” Minerva said as they finally arrive at a door. Minerva turned the handle and opened the door slightly to peek in. Hermione heard her let out a breath.</p>
<p>“Fantastic,” said Minerva. “It’s still a bedroom.”</p>
<p>“Is it likely to <i>stay</i> a bedroom?” asked Hermione as she stepped into the room.</p>
<p>“I honestly have no idea,” said Minerva, and promptly closed the door.</p>
<p><i>Well</i>, thought Hermione, this was turning out to be a <i>very </i>interesting case.</p>
