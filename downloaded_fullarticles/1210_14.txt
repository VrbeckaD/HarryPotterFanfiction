          <div class="userstuff"><p>From the point of view of an outsider, there was a battlefield, bodies, blood, violence, War. </p><p>From the point of view of a warrior, there was that but much more. There was grief, sadness, anger, loss, all directed to him and most importantly, Death. </p><p>The outsider would see the end of a violent war with a wave of relief crashing over the suffering population.</p><p>The warrior saw that too but no relief because the war was his fault, or so he thought and what any grief-ridden veteran would put into his head. </p><p>Really, it wasn't his fault. </p><p>The war was finished.</p><p>For the warrior, he had ended the fight to late.</p><p>He could feel the glares, the scowls and tears.</p><p>He could feel the looks of hate given to him by a group of redheads and a bushy-haired brunette because of the death of another half and a loved on. </p><p>It was his fault.</p><p>He should have ended it earlier, he repeated to himself.</p><p>He entered an antique castle, not missing the hateful looks sent his way.</p><p>He was refused a place to rest in the castle.</p><p>He was refused food from the kitchens.</p><p>He was refused treatment by the infirmary. </p><p>He was refused help because of the chaos he had caused.</p><p>He heard all the thoughts of loathing from the population.</p><p>People were treating him with maligne scorn,</p><p>Frosty repulsion,</p><p>Cold hostility, </p><p>Disgusted aversion,</p><p>Painful venom.</p><p>He heard all the abominable rumours and words spread by the ones he thought as family, </p><p>Friends, </p><p>Acquaintances, </p><p>Classmates.</p><p>"It's your fault"</p><p>"You did this"</p><p>"You are not welcome anymore"</p><p>"Get out and don't come back"</p><p>"Kill yourself, you don't deserve to live"</p><p>"Why didn't you die, my family didn't deserve this"</p><p>"You caused this"</p><p>"Blame yourself"</p><p>"I hate you"</p><p>Loss, grief, hate, sadness, chaos, pain, death. </p><p>The warrior apparated from the castle to his home. </p><p>He slept, rested and healed, physically, </p><p>But not emotionally,</p><p>Would he ever really heal ?</p><p>Nightmares still plagued his sleep.</p><p>Would peace ever reign his dreams ?</p><p>Malevolence was like a venom entering his veins.</p><p>Hate still ran around.</p><p>Months later, he was still blamed for something he did not do.</p><p>He could not go out in public.</p><p>He was detested for loss,</p><p>Blamed for death.</p><p>The press was publishing everybody's hate.</p><p>His once family hated him.</p><p>Everybody blamed him.</p><p>He was dying inside.</p><p>Another month later, his body was found by the person he loved and held onto.</p><p>He had committed suicide.</p><p>He wasn't able to live anymore,</p><p>It wasn't the answer, </p><p>It never was,</p><p>But he could not do it anymore.</p><p>He left a note for his beloved</p><p>"I love you, Luna. You are my everything and you will always be. I am now in a better place but at the cost of leaving you. I ask one thing, remember and love me, Always."</p><p>He left a note for the public.</p><p>"You love to hate, You love to hate me. I am the bait to your loss. I was to blame because you needed someone to blame. Your hate will end you, it ended me. Hate is horrible, it kill, it hurts. Stop spreading it."</p><p>And it was only after seeing the note and hearing the heartbreaking cries and scream of, one, Luna Lovegood, </p><p>That the Wizarding world realized that they had blamed a warrior for nothing,</p><p>That they had used and abused a broken human being,</p><p>That they were spreading monstrous hate,</p><p>That they had destroyed their saviour who had made their world safe and peaceful, </p><p>The chosen one, </p><p>An innocent boy,</p><p>Who was to young to have known the hardships of war,</p><p>A black-haired, pale-skinned, emerald-eyed youth,</p><p>Harry Potter.</p></div>
