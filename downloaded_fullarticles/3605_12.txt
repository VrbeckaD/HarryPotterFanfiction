<p><strong>Malfoy:</strong> <em>*grip tight on Potter’s hips as he tries valiantly to get him into some semblance of the downward dog pose*</em>  Potter, try to straighten your legs a bit more and drop your heels towards the mat.</p>
<p><strong>Potter:</strong> <em>*groans but does attempt to follow Malfoy's instructions although certain that it is impossible*</em></p>
<p><strong>Potter:</strong> <em>*fails miserably as his limbs shake and hips threaten to introduce themselves to the mat below*</em></p>
<p><strong>Malfoy:</strong> <em>*grunting at the sudden jerk of Potter’s body downwards*</em>  Stop trying to fight against me! Merlin help us all. How the hell can you be so agile on a bloody broomstick but so inflexible?! It is a miracle you can tie your trainers without charms.</p>
<p><strong>Potter:</strong> <em>*jaw clenched tight as his breath wheezes through his teeth from the not-so-normal angle of his body, now certain his lungs were about to come out his mouth from the angle*</em><strong>  </strong>I’d - <em>*wheeze*</em> - I’d like to see you do better, Malfoy.</p>
<p><strong>Malfoy:</strong> <em>*gives a somehow still dignified snort and lets go of Harry’s hips*</em></p>
<p><strong>Potter:</strong> <em>*falls to the floor in a lump, head snapping up to see what the fuck just happened*</em></p>
<p><strong>Malfoy:</strong> <em>*steps back over to his own mat and pulls his tank top off in one smooth motion for dramatic effect, throwing it somewhere over his shoulder, before gracefully getting into a version of reverse bind pose*</em></p>
<p><strong>Potter:</strong> <em>*brain free-falling into <strike>glorious</strike> <strike>kinky</strike> dangerous territory*</em> #$@%*!!!</p></div>
