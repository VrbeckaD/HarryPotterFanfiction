    <p>The cauldron started bubbling over as my potion was not brewed correctly.</p><p>Severus coughed, waving the smoke out of his face. "Meagan, you must pay a great deal of attention. Now, I shall brew the potion."</p><p>He coughed the smoke from his lungs deeply. "Allow me."</p><p>"Severus, are you alright?"</p><p>Severus coughed, nodding. "You need more practice, Meagan. Then hopefully, you will understand Potions."</p><p>He opened the door to let the smoke out. "You have improved on the written apparatus. We need to work on your brewing. Do not fret. You are learning from me."</p><p>I nodded. I watched as Severus began brewing the Draught of Peace himself.</p><p>My brewing was terrible and I was facing a failing grade in Potions. Severus had mercy on me, agreeing to tutor me.</p><p>It was my sixth year and I had been secretly meeting Severus in the dungeons for about a year now. It began when he found my drawings in class one day. He confiscated them of course. They were too obscene for him to show the class what I'd drawn. Basically him nude and his penis.</p><p>Severus read my mind and gave me veritaserum to better understand my feelings for him. I confessed that I liked him a lot but didn't love him yet. Our lessons began about six months later. Severus believed I would improve on my own but things took a turn for the worst.</p><p>Back to reality though.</p><p>He sighed as the potion turned silver. Satisfaction laced his features. Then he turned his gaze back to me. Severus did not seem enthusiastic at all with my bubbling cauldron and the thick black smoke I had caused. "You must master this potion to pass my class, Meagan. I can show you the procedure but you must brew it on your own eventually. Understand?"</p><p>I grimaced. I didn't like when he gave me that disappointed look. "I'm sorry."</p><p>Severus took in a deep breath and sighed loudly from his lungs. "I know you are intelligent enough to become proficient in potion making. You are not a dunderhead, Meagan."</p><p>"You're only saying that because of everything that's happened. Because of those pictures I drew!" I shouted.</p><p>Severus sighed again, deeper this time. He gave me a pleading look. "That is simply not true. I believe that you should know by now that I would never lie to you to hurt you or to give you false hope. I do not lie to others and I most certainly would not lie to you."</p><p>"I want to believe you." I stammered. "I'm just a piece of shit."</p><p>Severus sighed dramatically and came over to me. "You are very special to me, Meagan." He lifted my chin up to meet his eyes. "You have been very kind to an old soul who has never been loved in return."</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>Severus inhaled sharply and sighed heavily from his lungs. "I love you, Meagan."</p><p>He leaned down and planted a kiss on my lips. As we pulled apart Severus looked expectantly at me.</p><p>When I didn't respond to his words, Severus let out a deep sigh. "You do not have to say anything now, Meagan. I want you to realize how much you mean to me."</p><p>I was dumbfounded. I knew Severus cared about me. But love never crossed my mind.</p><p>"How could you love me?" I asked in shock. "I'm nothing."</p><p>Severus breathed in and sighed from his lungs. "You are everything to me."</p><p>"I-I have to go." I started for the door but Severus reached it before I could.</p><p>"Very well." He gave in. "We shall talk about this later, Miss Harper. I shall see you tomorrow evening after dinner."</p><p>I nodded, speechless as I hurried past him out the door.</p><p>Once alone, a loud, deep sigh echoed the walls as the breath left his lungs.</p><p>Perhaps another session of legilimency was needed.</p>
