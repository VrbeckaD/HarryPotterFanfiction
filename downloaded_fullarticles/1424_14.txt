    <p>
  <span>Harry knew he made bad decisions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>People told him that regularly enough. He was rash. He had a temper. He was reckless and had an uncanny lack of self-preservation. It didn’t matter if Ron had been the one to tell him to swish his wand counterclockwise instead of clockwise, because he’d done it anyway, and would you jump off a bridge, Mr. Potter, if Mr. Weasley asked you to?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry made bad decisions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But this was topping the list of idiotic choices he’d made in the last four years, because Snape had dropped a bottle of olive oil the night before and hadn’t bothered to do more than a halfhearted cleaning spell, and Harry—well. Here he was. And there was no Ron in sight to make excuses for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He took his socks off, squinting at the entryway between the living room and kitchen, gauging the distance between the sofa and doorframe. It would work, but only if he went at an angle. He’d seen this done on the telly during the times where he’d been free from his cupboard and left to tidy up the sitting room. Dudley always left the telly on. Logically, Harry knew it was only because Dudley didn’t want to put in the effort of turning the television back on and finding his channel again, but sometimes he couldn’t help but imagine his cousin had left it on as a gift to him. Some small kindness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Whether he knew it or not, Dudley’s kindness was about to bear fruit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He waited until Snape had turned away, back bent so far over his potion that his hair fell forward into his face, obscuring his view. And Harry made his move. Running towards the kitchen, he shifted sideways as he crossed the threshold, leaping onto the slick patch of linoleum. The soles of his feet caught in the oil, sending him shooting across the floor like a bullet. He was about to make contact—less than a foot—and Snape stepped out of the way so smoothly it was as if he’d known Harry’s plan all along.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He crashed into the counter, hips and knees throbbing from the impact. Bent double over the sink, Harry groaned pitifully and asked, “How’d you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hm?” Snape hummed, not bothering to look up from the monkshood he’d promptly done back to mincing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry dropped his head and groaned again. But before he did, he could have sworn he’d seen Snape smile, just a little.</span>
