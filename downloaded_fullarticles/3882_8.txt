    <p>Tears, nothing but warm, salty tears. Tears that clouded the young girl’s eyes, tears that made her head pound. </p><p>Briar Zahara Black-Potter never thought that she would cry over a man that was supposed to be her professor, a professor that hated her before she even was 11. A professor that was at least 20 years her senior.</p><p>How could she even be upset at such a thing. She’s been beaten, starved, and mentally abused. Not once did she cry, she hid her emotions better than Salazar hid his chambers.</p><p>But who would’ve of thought, the girl who was to save the Wizarding world was crying because of the man destined for her. The man who fitted her perfectly. Who would have thought when they were close, their magic sang a beautiful melody, waiting for the completion of body, soul, and magic.</p><p>Who would have thought that the girl-who-lived-and-wouldn’t-die was a creature that took on feline attributes. Who would have thought that the man Lady Magic, Fate, and Destiny picked for her was her adopted mother’s best friend. Who would have thought that her fathers hated this man for years before they compromised.</p><p>But who would’ve thought this man rejected his one and only soulmate both unintentionally and intentionally. How could such a man that had a horrible life reject such a female that could mend not only his body, but his mind and soul with a flick of her wrist and a slip of the tongue.</p><p>How? how had this ended so poorly. How could she live with heavy weight of rejection on her shoulders. How did she manage to live such a life based on lies and betrayal.</p><p>But why should she let this small problem destroy the mask she built.</p><p>Why when she’d kept this act up since the day she met the red family. She’d kept this act up since the day she’d been sorted into the lion’s den. She’d kept this act up for 6 years.<br/>
She’d kept the fake smiles that hid her hatred and animosity. She’d kept the secrets she learned from the walls. </p><p>She’d kept the facade long enough. </p><p>She learned their faults and she wouldn’t let that sour man ruin her plans.<br/>
She had a destiny to fulfill, whether he’s willing or not. She will not take no for an answer.<br/>
Her stubbornness will not penetrated. </p><p>Nor will she lose.</p><p>She was Briar Zahara Black-Potter.</p><p>And she will not let Severus Tobias Atticus-Snape ruin her or her plans, not now, not ever. </p>
