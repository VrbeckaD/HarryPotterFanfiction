</center>“I’m done with him,” Charlie commented as he stepped out of the bedroom, a threadbare towel wrapped loosely around his waist, rubbing a hand over the curled hair on his chest as he turned to walk down the hallway. His hair was still wet from his morning shower, and his prick was still going soft after his morning fuck.<p>Harry was leaning against the wall opposite the bedroom door, arms crossed over his chest and looking very put out, though his cheeks were gently flushed. “Sure took your time this morning, didn't you? I have a meeting at 9, and I can't afford to be late.” </p><p>Charlie licked his lips, shaking his head and letting out a chuckle, “When someone sucks a prick as good as that lad does…” He let out a low whistle, glancing back towards the bedroom as though fully considering going back inside, “...It just seems like a crime to stop him.” </p><p>Rolling his eyes, Harry brushed past Charlie, “Yeah, well, maybe I'll just have to have him tonight as well, to make up for my lost time.” </p><p>“Fine fine,” Charlie called as he headed over to the staircase, “Although, he might be a bit sore by tonight. I have <i>big</i> plans for today.”</p><p>“Merlin, you're insatiable,” Harry muttered, closing the bedroom door behind him as Charlie's footsteps faded.</p><p>When Harry turned around, he was greeted by an image that made every hair on his arms stand up, a flush spreading through his body. Every inch of him filled with an electric kind of warmth. He never got tired of this.</p><p>Draco Malfoy was stark naked and laid out in the middle of the bed, cheek pressed into the mattress, his spine arching beautifully so that his arse was on display. Though he was facing the door, his eyes were closed. Draco looked blissful.</p><p>Harry walked forward, running his fingers over the thin sheen of sweat covering Draco’s forehead. He spoke in a soft voice, crouching down next to the bed so he was eye-level with Draco, “Are you up for another round? You look pretty sleepy. We can wait till later if you'd like.”</p><p>“No, I'm just relaxing.” He wiggled his arse, a small smile on his delicate lips. “Fuck me, Harry.”</p><p>“Yeah?” </p><p>Draco cracked open his eyes, looking at Harry with exasperation, “Well if you don't, I will. I have a pretty extensive collection of dildos.” Draco seemed to hesitate for a moment before continuing. “And there's always Charlie. He’s insatiable, as you rightly stated. He’ll fuck me anytime I ask.”</p><p>Something painful clenched in Harry's gut, his jaw tightening and gaze hardening at Draco’s words.</p><p>He needed no further motivation. Harry stood up, considering how he wanted to fuck Draco.</p><p>Harry unbuckled the belt of his trousers, pulling it out from the loops in one swift motion. The click of metal as it fell to the ground seemed to be all Draco needed; he knew that he was about to get fucked. He shifted his knees wider on the bed, his arse spreading in a way that was obscenely hot.</p><p>When Harry walked around to the foot of the bed, pulling his rapidly hardening prick out of his trousers, he noticed that Draco’s hole was gently pulsing. Harry swallowed roughly. </p><p>God, there was just something about Draco that never failed to rip Harry to shreds, to turn him inside out until he felt completely vulnerable as though he was the one naked and waiting on the bed. </p><p>“On your back.”</p><p>Draco turned over instantly, lying flat on his back so that his sleek blonde hair fanned out behind him, surrounding him in a light halo. Harry stroked his prick as he let his eyes trail freely over Draco’s body, from the dip of his long neck to the rosy pink of his nipples, all the way down to his lengthy cock and slim ankles. Harry wanted nothing more than to spend hours exploring every inch of him, but his time was limited this morning. </p><p>Harry got onto the bed, kneeling at Draco’s feet. He couldn’t help but skim his fingers over the arch of Draco’s foot, following it past the heel and over the toned muscles of his calves. “Scoot forward, knees to your chest.” </p><p>As Draco got into position, Harry leaned over and reached behind him, grabbing a pillow and tapping lightly on Draco’s hip. Draco understood without needing words, lifting his hips so that Harry could place a pillow beneath him, his arse now served to Harry on a silver platter. His body was Harry’s to use. </p><p>Trailing a finger down past Draco’s balls, Harry touched the furl of his arsehole, dipping his finger inside. He found it lightly slick, though Harry knew from the texture that it was not lubricant. It was Charlie’s come. </p><p>Harry pulled his finger out a little roughly, feeling a fire rising up inside him. He almost felt torn in half. Part of him wanted to plunge his cock into Draco’s arse and fuck him without mercy, filling his arse up with Harry’s own come. Meanwhile, the other part of him wanted just the opposite. He thought about taking the day off from work, bringing Draco into his bathroom and taking his time cleaning Draco inside and out, erasing all traces of Charlie from his body.</p><p>He felt something brush against his hand, and shook himself, refocusing on the current moment. Draco’s fingers were wrapped around his wrist, a question looming in his gaze, although he didn't ask. But Harry sensed that Draco knew. </p><p>He always knew.</p><p>Harry muttered a lubrication spell, covering his cock with the cool slick and then rubbing the remainder between his fingers, warming it up before pushing a finger back inside Draco. As Harry worked his fingers inside, he reveled in the breathy sighs and gasps spilling out of Draco’s lips. </p><p>After a moment, Harry pulled his fingers out and curled a hand under one of Draco’s knees, guiding his leg up onto Harry’s shoulder, his body so pliant and willing, bending to Harry’s every touch. </p><p>Not a second later, Harry was pushing his cock inside, watching as Draco’s body opened around him, adjusting for the girth of Harry’s cock. When Harry was finally all the way inside, hips pressed against arse, Draco let out a pleased moan and his hole clenched around Harry. </p><p>Harry’s heartbeat stuttered in his chest.</p><p>He rubbed over the soft hair on Draco’s thigh with one hand while he steadied himself on Draco’s chest with the other. Harry began thrusting in deeply, listening carefully to Draco’s breathing, angling his hips <i>just so</i>…</p><p>“Fuck, Harry.” Draco let out a moan, biting his lip as Harry hit his prostate. </p><p>Harry continued to thrust his hips, hitting that same spot each time. </p><p>With each thrust, a flush spread slowly, methodically from Draco’s sharp cheekbones and down his lean neck, all of his pale skin becoming tinged with a pearlescent pink, his body shining with sweat. </p><p>Draco’s eyes shut and his face scrunched up in an expression that nearly looked pained, his hands grasping at the bedsheets strewn around them. Something dawned on Harry.</p><p>“Draco… Draco, did he let you come yet today?”</p><p>A whimper rumbled up from Draco’s chest, the flush deepening on his face, even the tips of his ears turning pink. He shook his head from side to side against the bed, back arching and cock twitching when Harry slowed his thrust, pushing in deep and staying there.</p><p>“Is that a no, Draco?” Harry reached forward and ran shaky fingers through the hair framing Draco’s face, “Use your words.”</p><p>“No, no, no, no,” Draco gasped out, his voice rough and quiet, though the words were like a <i>Reducto</i> going off in Harry’s ears.</p><p>“What about last night?”</p><p>“Not last night either.”</p><p>Every muscle in Harry’s body clenched, his heart racing uncomfortably. He had the sudden primal urge to go hex Charlie, magic sparking at his fingertips. </p><p>Draco let out a hiss, Harry’s magic skittering across his abdomen. “It’s… It’s okay though. I like being denied. I just - <i>shit</i> - I obviously would like to come at some point.”</p><p>Harry let his eyes run over Draco for a moment, taking in the feverish sweat covering his skin and the moisture gathering in the corners of his eyes. He almost looked broken. Broken and yet so stunning that it caused Harry physical pain as he pulled his cock out of Draco’s arse.</p><p>“Wait, don’t -” Draco began, eyes wide and glistening as Harry’s slick cock flopped down against Draco’s balls, a dribble of precome clinging to the tip. </p><p>“Shhh, I’m not done yet. Be patient.”</p><p>Harry glanced at the time on his Muggle watch, grimacing as he realized that he only had a few minutes before he needed to leave. </p><p>“You can go, you know? I can finish myself off…or something.” Draco commented, looking between Harry’s watch and his face.</p><p>Harry leaned down over Draco’s body, removing the pillow from beneath his hips and then curling an arm around around his back, shifting his body up towards the head of the mattress. When Draco was in the position Harry wanted, he leaned down, lips brushing Draco’s ear as he whispered, “<i>Not a chance.</i>”</p><p>As Harry fully unbuttoned his dress shirt, discarding it onto the floor without a care in the world, he knew in the back of his mind that he was going to be in deep shit with Kringwold when he showed up to work 30 minutes - or possibly an hour - late. </p><p>Somehow as he looked down at Draco, admiring the desperation on his face and the cruel jut of his hard cock, Harry simply couldn’t be bothered to worry about Kringwold. </p><p>Once Harry was fully naked, he settled back in front of Draco, silently casting a wandless lubrication charm and slicking up his fingers just as he had earlier. </p><p>“Fucking show-off,” Draco muttered, though when Harry glanced up he found a smirk on Draco’s face. </p><p>“Don’t sass me or I might just change my mind and head to work.”</p><p>This only silenced Draco for a moment, and then Harry was pressing his fingers back inside him, Draco letting out a grateful sigh at the intrusion. </p><p>“Merlin, you really like to be filled, don’t you?”</p><p>Draco merely nodded, hands trailing leisurely down his own chest, clearly on a path towards his cock.</p><p>“Hands off.” </p><p>When Harry received a glare in reply, he continued, “I want you to enjoy this. Focus only on this. Focus on how my fingers feel inside you, yeah?”</p><p>Harry pressed his two fingers in further, feeling the delicious resistance of Draco’s arse around him. There was no part of Draco that was free of that attitude, that enticing rebellion. Even when Draco was begging for cock, begging to be fucked into the mattress, something about him still made it feel forbidden.</p><p>When Harry noticed that Draco’s hands were twitching restlessly at his sides, he made a decision. He glanced at the headboard, noticing the wide vertical slats in the wood. Harry cast <i>Accio</i>, catching the slate grey tie he had discarded when he first entered the room with his free hand, “Put your hands up near the headboard for me - Cross your wrists over - Yeah, just like that.”</p><p>He paused for a moment and glanced down at Draco, fingers still buried in his arse, “Is this okay?”</p><p>One of Draco’s thin eyebrows lifted, his expression somewhere between surprised and fond. “Are you really asking me if I’m okay with light bondage? You do know that Charlie once left me hanging upside-down in the kitchen with a vibrator in my arse, right?”</p><p>Harry swallowed around a lump his throat, feeling as though someone had just doused him in ice water, the shock hitting his system painfully before it faded, “I’m well aware of that. But I’m not asking what you’ve done before… Right here, right now, are you okay with this?” </p><p>Draco looked taken-aback for an instant, but then his expression hardened. A mask took over his face, “Yeah. It’s okay.”</p><p>Nodding his understanding, Harry removed his fingers as gently as possible, shushing Draco’s whine of protest. He then grabbed for his wand and cast a spell that weaved his tie into an intricate pattern around Draco’s wrists, binding them together and then fastening them to the headboard. </p><p>When Harry glanced at Draco, there was a strange expression on his face. “Does that feel alright, if it’s too tight I can -” Harry began, lifting the wand once more.</p><p>Draco’s gaze followed Harry’s arm closely. “You’re using my wand.”</p><p>“What?” Harry glanced down, and saw that he was indeed using Draco’s wand. He ran a thumb over the smooth Hawthorn, feeling the warmth of it beneath his fingertips. “Sorry, I didn’t even notice.”</p><p>Harry placed it back on the bed, but Draco’s expression faltered, a fleeting look of horror followed by one of hope. He was going to ask, but Draco’s naked body, his tied wrists… it was too much for Harry to resist. </p><p>“Fuck, you look amazing like that.”</p><p>Draco let out a hum, “Well, if I look so fantastic, why don’t you get back to fucking my arse?”</p><p>Harry pinched one of Draco’s nipples, rubbing the hardened nub between his fingers. “Cheeky bastard.”</p><p>The next several minutes Harry took his time pushing his fingers inside Draco’s arse, pressing and spreading, moving them in and out in time to Draco’s sighs and moans. </p><p>As Draco’s arse relaxed, allowing Harry’s fingers to sink in deeper, Harry began to change the angle of his fingers. Curling and twisting them inside Draco, feeling around inside until Draco let out a telling hiss, dropping his head back heavily onto the pillow behind him. </p><p>Harry rubbed over Draco’s prostate, alternating his pressure and rhythm, sometimes pulling his fingers away entirely. He basked in Draco’s groans of frustration, the choked breaths and desperate sighs. Every sound was like a heated kiss against Harry’s body.  </p><p>Draco’s abdomen was clenching, his body vibrating with each purposeful stroke of Harry’s fingers. Each movement tested the bonds around Draco’s wrists and the boundaries of Harry’s willpower, his body fighting against the instinct to ram his cock into Draco’s arse. </p><p>After teasing Draco for a while, Harry decided to take pity on him. He curled his fingers in just the right spot, finding Draco’s prostate and rubbing over it continuously, the pressure unrelenting. Draco was thrashing against the restraints around his wrists in response, arching off the sheets and turning his head restlessly against the pillow, his chest moving visibly in time with his labored breathing.</p><p>“Do you want to come, Draco?”</p><p>“Yes - <i>Fuck</i> - God, yes.”</p><p>Harry smiled, not stopping his assault on Draco’s prostate. He was determined to keep going until Draco came. </p><p>“My cock… please,” Draco gasped out. Harry watched as Draco’s cock twitched at his words, the tip flushed darkly, the whole length of it stretching towards Harry as though begging for release.</p><p>“What about your cock, Draco?” Harry asked with feigned innocence. </p><p>“Touch it! Lick it - bloody fuck - <i>anything</i>.”</p><p>Harry merely hummed. He pressed his fingers deeper inside Draco, drawing patterns on Draco’s prostate and ignoring all of Draco’s beautifully pitiful whines. “I have no intention of touching your cock, Draco. I want you to come just from this... just from my fingers.”</p><p>Draco’s eyes were pressed shut, as he grit out a reply, “You are the <i>devil</i> - shit shitttt - Spawn of Satan, you are.”</p><p>“On the contrary, Draco, most people call me the Saviour, or the Chosen One.” Harry replied, chuckling as he gave a particularly hard press inside Draco’s arse, and Draco let out a squeal.</p><p>“Clearly those people weren’t having sex with y - <i>Ahhh</i>!” </p><p>Harry could tell Draco was getting close. With every touch he was tearing Draco further apart, pulling at each loose thread until Draco was about to unravel in front of him.</p><p>“I want you to come for me, can you do that?” </p><p>Draco’s breath shook and he opened his mouth as if about to reply, before he simply nodded instead.</p><p>“Good. I want you to let yourself go. When you feel yourself about to come, just let it happen. Don’t hold back.” </p><p>Harry continued his movements inside Draco, coaxing him into orgasm. When it finally happened, Harry felt as if time had slowed, each sound amplified and each bright spot of flush on Draco’s body seeming brighter than usual. Harry became hyper-aware of everything around him, each of his senses becoming overcome with the sights, scents, and sounds of Draco’s orgasm. He watched the come spill from Draco’s cock, captivated as it twitched from the aftershocks, Draco’s whole body still thrumming with the electricity of it all. </p><p>Watching Draco Malfoy come was nothing short of exhilarating, and Harry’s own cock was responding in earnest, throbbing heavily between his legs, balls drawn up tight. </p><p>Before Harry released Draco from his bonds, he decided to get a release of his own. Harry pulled his fingers from Draco’s arse, stroking his cock while he pet over Draco’s body. He skimmed fingers over Draco’s hip bones, the smooth skin of his inner thigh, and the soft curve of his waist. Draco was watching him closely, following his every movement. His grey eyes were dark and stormy.</p><p>It took hardly more than a minute before Harry was coming, letting his come mix with Draco’s as it fell, barely resisting the urge to spread their come around with the tip of his cock. </p><p>When Harry looked up, there was something different about Draco’s expression. Something Harry couldn’t quite place. It almost looked… pleased? Thankful? Harry pushed those thoughts out of his mind, reaching for his own wand and removing Draco from the tie that was binding him. He couldn’t help but feel a rush of pride when he saw the marks on Draco’s wrists. A physical reminder of what they had done this morning.</p><p>They cleaned up in silence, Harry grabbing a warm towel from the closet to wipe down Draco’s stomach and taking care to move gently over his softened cock. As Harry got redressed he thought about the day ahead of him, dreading work after such a wonderful morning. He had half a mind to call in sick altogether, but he knew it was a risky move considering that his caseload at the Ministry was so high these days.</p><p>Harry reluctantly laced up his shoes, grabbing his wand and turning to leave the room.</p><p>A quiet voice called after Harry. It was so quiet that he barely heard it, “Thank you.”</p><p>Harry turned back toward the bed. His heart jolted at Draco’s words and his whole body tensed, though he wasn’t quite sure why.</p><p>Harry couldn’t think of a response that didn’t make him sound like a numpty, so he settled for nodding in reply. Then he walked out of the room and down to the Floo, heading off to work without even saying goodbye to Charlie.</p>
