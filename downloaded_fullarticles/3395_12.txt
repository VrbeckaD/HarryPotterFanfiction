  <p>Through the frost and condensation from his breath on the window, the world almost seems to have a greenish-grey tint to it, discolouring the true white of the tumbling flecks of snow falling past the window. Albus Potter crosses his legs in the figure four and stirs his peppermint tea pensively. He gazes out at the green-grey world with little awe, being so used to the castle and its grounds after five years.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Then the door swings open. He jumps in the armchair, nearly spilling his tea all over its burgundy fabric.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>    “Steady on,” he mutters to a flushed Scorpius, who subsequently swings the door behind himself with equally little thought, slamming it shut. Albus jumps again.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>    “Sweet, merciful Dumbledore,” cries Scorpius, collapsing on the conveniently placed chaise lounge. “Have I got a corker for you, Al.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
<p></p><div><p>    “You could have the forethought not to go round slamming doors.”</p></div><div><p> </p></div></div><div>
  <p>    “Oh, shut up, you queen. Listen,” he sits up and yanks off his scarf. “I talked to Rose. About the thing.”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Albus stops blowing on his tea for a moment, pausing with his lips still pursed. “… Oh?”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
<p></p><div><p>Clearly relishing in the drama of it all, Scorpius grins madly. “Well… Guess what she said!”</p></div><div><p> </p></div></div><div>
  <p>    “I don’t know,” Albus says with a pleasant smile, allowing Scorpius to deliver the answer.</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
  <p>Scorpius makes a strange squeaking sound, rather like a mouse, and he almost consumes his whole bottom lip. “… She said yes!”</p>
</div><div>
  <p> </p>
</div><div>
<p></p><div><p>    “Oh, that’s brilliant, Scorpius,” Albus replies, grinning reassuringly. “That’s absolutely wonderful.”</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>    “I know! And we’re going to the Three Broomsticks on Saturday! Isn’t it wonderful?”</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>    “Yes. As I said.” Albus clears his throat. “But, um, isn’t the fourteenth on Tuesday?”</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>Scorpius thinks about this. “Oh… Oh, piss.”</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>Waving a hand dismissively, Albus says, “oh, well,” and places his tea to one side. “At least you’re going out at all.”</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>    “Yeah. Exactly.”</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>    “And it’s Rose. It’s the big one. Future wife, and all that.”</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>Scorpius blushes profusely. “Oh, stop.”</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>    “It’ll be nice to have you in the family.”</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>   “Don’t you talk about ‘family’ with me,” he says, raising an eyebrow dangerously. Albus backs down.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>Then, they go silent for a moment, as the wind crescendos to a wail outside.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>Albus clears his throat again. “Well, you have nothing to worry about. You’re well prepared.”</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>    “Oh, yeah,” Scorpius starts up again, still grinning almost insanely. “She is going to be very impressed.”</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>    “I’m sure that she is,” says Albus, picking his mug back up and making for the door. He stops before turning the handle and bends down, patting Scorpius on the hand. “Well done. And good luck.” Scorpius smiles stupidly back it him, and he leaves.</p></div><div><p> </p></div><div><p>Once out in the corridor, Albus relieves himself of his own painful smile and walks back up to the dorms, no longer bothered about how much tea he spills.</p></div></div>
