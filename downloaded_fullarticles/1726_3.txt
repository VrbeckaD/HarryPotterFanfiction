    <p>Here is the sketch/drawing that started me on all of this. A mid-transformation pic of Harry becoming a toon!</p>

<p>It was surprisingly hard to find stills of a Disney transformation to use as a reference for this. At the time, the easiest one that I could find that actually focused on the character's transformation and not on a pretty light-show was the one from Brother Bear. Which was still pretty darn hard to find.</p>
<p>Anyways, this was the drawing that set me on my insanity.</p>
