    <p>“They what?”</p><p>“They’ve frozen our accounts, Draco, do keep up.”</p><p>Draco looked from his father back to his mother, whose lips were pursed.</p><p>“Mama, tell me he’s exaggerating.”</p><p>“How, exactly, could I exaggerate this, Draco? The accounts are either frozen or they’re not!”</p><p>“But, Papa! I have needs!”</p><p>Lucius curled his lip. “Yes, Draco. Your mother and I, and the entirety of Wizarding Britain, are well aware of your <em>needs</em>. How, at only sixteen, you have managed to create such a thoroughly debauched reputation”—</p><p>“Pure force of charisma,” Draco said cheerfully. “All learned from you, I’m sure.”</p><p>“I certainly hope not.”</p><p>“Perhaps not,” Draco agreed, looking at his father with a challenge in his eyes.</p><p>After a long moment, Narcissa cleared her throat. “If you’re both quite finished.” Both men looked at the floor sheepishly. “There is the small matter of how to go on from here.”</p><p>“I’m not going to <em>work</em>, if that’s what you’re implying,” said Draco.</p><p>“Of course not,” said Narcissa placidly.</p><p>“You will both do whatever is required,” Lucius snapped, “and the Dark Lord will provide.”</p><p>Both Draco and Narcissa snorted at that. Narcissa raised her eyebrows and looked as if about to speak, but Draco shook his head minutely.</p><p>“Look, Papa,” he said gently, “I know we can’t exactly go crying to Dumbledore over this, or--well, anyway. It was probably his idea to seize our assets in the first place. But if you trust me for just a little while, I can see this through so that we come out on top without getting dragged down by the pesky life-or-death conflict of it all. Family first, right? You trust me?”</p><p>“I do not trust you,” said Lucius.</p><p>“Your wisdom is infinite, Papa.”</p><p>“However,” Lucius continued, “trustworthiness has never been a trait particularly valued in this family. I am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and believe you competent, as long as we enact a failsafe for your plan.”</p><p>Draco grinned. “Oh, certainly, Papa. Two failsafes, as a matter of fact.”</p><p align="center">***</p><p>“My Lord,” Draco said, greeting Voldemort with an exaggerated courtly bow.</p><p>“You may approach,” said Voldemort.</p><p>“Thank you, My Lord. And may I say you look resplendent with serpentine, er, splendor, today.”</p><p>There was a snort from the shadows beside Voldemort’s throne.</p><p>“Wormtail,” said Voldemort coldly, “do you disagree with the young man?”</p><p>“No, oh, no, My Lord, I had just—I had merely—wondered about his <em>phrasing</em>, My Lord.”</p><p>“In the future,” Voldemort said, “you will restrain your rudeness.”</p><p>“Yes, My Lord,” said Pettigrew, quickly retreating back into the shadows.</p><p>Draco examined his manicured nails. “No living with the middle classes, is there, My Lord?”</p><p>“They have their uses.”</p><p>“Of course, yes,” said Draco lazily. “You would, of course, know better about people’s uses than I. You being a Lord and all, or rather, <em>the</em> Lord, I should say.”</p><p>“It is my vocation,” Voldemort agreed solemnly.</p><p>“Vocation,” said Draco, “Exactly. That’s what I’m here about, My Lord.”</p><p>“My vocation?”</p><p>“No, My Lord, <em>my</em> vocation.”</p><p>“Your vocation, young Draco? Are you not still in school?”</p><p>Draco laughed. “Rather, My Lord. But I mean vocation not in the sense of career, but of <em>calling</em>. A life purpose, as it were. One does not take a vacation from one’s vocation. And <em>my</em> vocation is survival, but in a certain, dare I say glamorous, idiom. To grasp with panache. To claw with aplomb. It is rather a specialty of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Malfoy. An intergenerational calling, if you will.”</p><p>Voldemort gestured with his hand, as if to say, “all right, I will.” Draco went on.</p><p>“We Malfoys seek our own highest good, My Lord, and serving you is, as we see it, the highest good of all.” Draco just barely kept a straight face, seeing how pleased Voldemort looked. Merlin, this was too easy. “The Malfoy family has, I am sorry to say, recently run into a little snag that may affect the cause as well.” This with a sombre tone and sad face.</p><p>“Has it?” said Voldemort with interest.</p><p>“Yes, My Lord. Our accounts at Gringotts have been frozen.”</p><p>Voldemort hissed. He knew where his best interests lay. “This is most unfortunate.”</p><p>“Yes, indeed, My Lord,” Draco agreed, trying not to sound too eager. “It was in contemplating possible bridges over these troubled waters that I came across a plan that would, I believe, be of further use to you than simply restoring the Malfoy ability to...<em>donate.</em>..to the noble cause.”</p><p>“You have my attention,” said Voldemort.</p><p><em>I know I do</em>, Draco thought gleefully. What he said was, “Thank you, My Lord. Your time and patience are much appreciated. Luckily, the plan is simple enough, so I will be brief.”</p><p>There was another snort from behind Voldemort’s chair.</p><p>“Something to share, Wormtail?” Voldemort asked.</p><p>“No, My Lord,” said Pettigrew hurriedly. “I merely worry that the boy is being irresponsible with your valuable time, My Lord.”</p><p>“I will be the judge of that,” said Voldemort.</p><p>“Yes, My Lord.” Pettigrew retreated, and Voldemort waved his hand for Draco to go on.</p><p>“Thank you, My Lord,” said Draco. “As for the plan—simply put, I would like to offer myself as a spy. I would go to Dumbledore, proclaim to him that I want to go over to the goody-two-shoes side of things, express remorse or, well, whatever it is Gryffindor types experience when they’re overcome with their emotions.” Pettigrew gave an offended squeak, and Voldemort an appreciative laugh. Draco went on. “So I tell him I want in on his little game in exchange for the safety and security of myself and my family. We’re known to be self-serving cowards, so he’ll believe this easily enough, if my hunch is correct. Thus, our funds are restored. If I’m right in thinking he is unaware that you reside here, My Lord, then that will be that. Of course, if he is aware, then my parents will unfortunately have to be removed to Salazar knows what dreadful safe house until our vaults can be wrested out from Dumbledore’s influence. As far as I can see it, that would be the only real disadvantage of the plan.”</p><p>“Perhaps it would be an allowable inconvenience,” Voldemort mused, “if we could be certain that Dumbledore would not discover the ruse.”</p><p>“I’ve pondered that,” said Draco, “and I found a solution in what I must admit was one of my secondary motives for proposing this plan.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“Well, yes, you see,” said Draco smoothly, “I can use this apparent change of heart to my advantage and worm my way into the inner circle of Gryffindors at school. Within a month, I plan to be fucking Dumbledore’s golden boy. This will establish Dumbledore’s trust, while that trust itself will be my in with Potter. You get a crafty intelligencer established amongst people close to Dumbledore, plus renewed funding, and I get the finest arse in—well, in all of Scotland, at least, I think that’s fair to say.”</p><p>“Your plan,” said Voldemort thoughtfully, “seems to rely rather heavily on your charms and Potter’s predilections.”</p><p>“You doubt my charms, My Lord?” Draco asked neutrally. Voldemort looked him up and down, which, Draco thought, felt very much like the time he had been wanking in the Slytherin dorms only to look out the window and find the Giant Squid watching.</p><p>“No,” Voldemort admitted, “But what about Potter?”</p><p>There was a snort from behind the chair yet again, and this time Pettigrew emerged of his own accord.</p><p>“Potter’s definitely queer.”</p><p>“How would you know?” Draco asked, looking at Pettigrew with distantly disgusted interest.</p><p>“I slept in his dormitory for three years,” said Pettigrew.</p><p>“You <em>what</em>?” said Draco.</p><p>“When I was disguised.”</p><p>Draco looked to Voldemort for an explanation.</p><p>“He was in hiding in his animagus form,” the Dark Lord explained.</p><p>“I was the Weasley boy’s pet rat,” said Pettigrew, sounding almost proud.</p><p>“How horrible,” said Draco.</p><p>Pettigrew ignored this. “Anyway, I saw Potter looking at the other boys, especially Weasley. In the unlikely event that he has interest in women, it is not an exclusive interest.”</p><p>“That is good news,” said Voldemort.</p><p>“Yes, yes,” said Draco, still looking at Pettigrew with loathing. “I don’t suppose, My Lord, that we could have Weasley killed?”</p><p>Voldemort chuckled indulgently. “Patience, Draco,” he said. “Perhaps, in time, as a reward for a well-executed mission.”</p><p>“Thank you, My Lord,” said Draco, pleased with the notion.</p><p align="center">***</p><p>“Hermione,” said Harry, “D’you think I’ll ever fall in love?”</p><p>“What?” replied Hermione with frank astonishment, looking up from her book.</p><p>“I just...I dunno, it’s stupid.”</p><p>“What’s on your mind?” Hermione prompted, accepting that she was now on an official break from her homework.</p><p>“Well, I mean, I just don’t know when I’d have the chance. What with Voldemort and the war and all. Plus I seem to run into a dragon or a troll or something every second Tuesday. I’ve a lot on my plate. Sure I’ve had crushes, but...love? All-consuming, distracting, intoxicating, wanting-to-snog-in-corridors stuff? I’m starting to think it’s not real, or if it is, that it’ll never be for me.”</p><p>Hermione blushed. “It’s real.”</p><p>Harry raised an eyebrow, but didn’t comment.</p><p>“What brought this on?” Hermione asked him.</p><p>“I dunno,” Harry sighed. “I just...I don’t know if I’ll live through the end of the year, I’m never sure, and I’ve been thinking about what I’ve done, and what I still want to do.”</p><p>“Oh Harry.”</p><p>“I’m starting to think I’ll never get my chance to just be normal, y’know? Read about someone else’s life in the newspaper...plan out names for my future children...have somebody I like buy me jewelry...that sort of thing.”</p><p>“Jewelry?” Hermione inquired.</p><p>“Men can wear jewelry,” said Harry defensively.</p><p>“I know that,” she responded, rolling her eyes. “You just don’t strike me as the type to want to. You’re not flashy, and you usually hate being given things.”</p><p>“Well,” said Harry thoughtfully, “You never know. My mind could change. Maybe if I met the right person, I’d want them to buy me jewelry.”</p><p>“Maybe,” agreed Hermione, exasperated.</p><p>“I’d like to have sex, too,” Harry added as an afterthought. “That's something I haven't done.  I'd like to try it.  Preferably as many times as possible, before old Snakeface gets me.”</p><p align="center">***</p><p>“And that is why you have come to me?” Dumbledore asked. Draco was wracked with another fit of sobs. “Now, now, dear boy, now, now, none of that. You will be all right. You have made the right choice.”</p><p>Draco looked up with watery eyes. “And my p-p-”</p><p>“Your parents will be protected,” the professor assured him.</p><p>Draco leapt out of his seat, springing up and sliding on his belly across the Headmaster’s desk to wrap the old man in his arms.</p><p>“<em>TH-THANK YOU</em>,” he sobbed into the old man's shoulder.</p><p>“No need for that,” said Dumbledore, patting the boy’s back awkwardly and firmly reminding himself that, while there is no appropriate time to notice a student’s attractiveness, it is especially inappropriate to do so when that student is sobbing into one’s arms.</p><p>“Oh, but there is, Professor,” Draco enthused. “You’re my savior! How can I ever thank you?”</p><p>“Well,” said Dumbledore. “I do have one idea.” The Headmaster was, in fact, proud of himself for thinking of it. It was an excellent rationalization for why he was unable to tear his eyes off the Malfoy boy.</p><p>“Name it,” said Draco earnestly.</p><p>“Young Harry has a lot on his shoulders,” said Dumbledore. “He needs all the friends he can get. Keep an eye on him, would you?”</p><p>Draco looked down and bit back a grin. “Of course, Headmaster.”</p><p align="center">***</p><p>“It’s a good plan, Draco,” said Lucius after his son wrapped up the explanation of his scheme. “I have only one follow-up question.”</p><p>“Yes, Father?” Draco shifted in an attempt to get comfortable. He was on his knees in Professor Snape’s office, his head in the fireplace so he could speak with his father.</p><p>Not that there weren’t plenty of other circumstances in which he wouldn’t mind being on his knees in Severus’ office. But those were thoughts for another day. A rainy Sunday, perhaps.</p><p>“I wonder,” said Lucius, bringing Draco’s attention back to the matter at hand. “You mentioned a failsafe for the plan. Two failsafes, as a matter of fact. What are they?”</p><p>“Oh!” Draco grinned. “Well, that’s the particularly clever bit. The failsafe, should the Dark Lord turn on us, is that we really can run into the arms of the Order of the Phoenix and no one will be the wiser as to our duplicity. And in the reverse, should the old bat grow suspicious, we can high-tail it back to Voldy’s side. So either way, there’s a failsafe. Two failsafes, yes?”</p><p>Lucius pinched the bridge of his nose.</p><p>“Get out of my sight,” he said.</p>
