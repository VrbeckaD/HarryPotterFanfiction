    <p>Chocolate. </p><p>For Draco, that was the answer to everything.</p><p>"What about love?" his mother asked one evening, as she did most evenings, when Draco sat with Pansy and Blaise in the sitting room of their new home for tea.</p><p>"I don't <i>need</i> love," Draco replied. "All I need is chocolate."</p><p>"Actually," Pansy said, placing his empty cup of tea carefully down on the table in front of her, and picking up whatever gossip magazine she'd brought over. "I believe the saying is, <i>All you need is love. But a little bit of chocolate now and then doesn't hurt</i>."</p><p>Draco resisted rolling his eyes, but he did laugh when Blaise rolled his. Pansy glared at both of them and returned to her magazine.</p><p>"Then I shall say the opposite, as I've always said: All I need is chocolate. And for that bit of love from now and then? That's what the clubs are for."</p><p>"Draco, you can't find a suitable man in those filthy places—"</p><p>"That's the point, Mother," Draco mumbled. "I'm not looking for a suitable man. They…" He paused then, because, it was one thing to <i>deny</i> his mother the joys of planning a wedding for her only son, and it was another to simply be crass about it. "It's too soon." He feigned sorrow instead. "After Jacob…"</p><p>"Oh, dear," Narcissa said, nodding sympathetically.</p><p>Draco's ex-boyfriend <i>Jacob</i>—who never actually existed—had left him for another man six months ago. And since then, Draco'd been telling his mother he wasn't ready to date again. This was all because his mother had offered to set him up. After Jacob was created, the lies kept coming in, and his mother continued to eat them up.</p><p>Sort of how Draco ate his chocolate.</p><p>Honestly, it wasn't that Draco didn't want to date. He did. He liked dating a lot, but there was always the thrill of who he was going to meet next. He could never settle down with one bloke, not when he'd simply got bored with men so easily. He wasn't proud of being a tart, and his longest "dating" life had lasted for almost a month once, and that was because Sean travelled a lot for his work and he and Draco simply never got around to anything more than sex. At dinner, four weeks later, Draco realised Sean was a chatterbox. He never listened to anything Draco had to say and offered his advice without hesitation.</p><p>He simply had bad luck with men in anything more than a quick fuck. And love? Draco was far, far away from that.</p><center>

</center>"Did you hear about this new place in Amorato Village?" Pansy asked Draco as she came by his shop on Friday.<p>Pansy came over every Friday before Draco closed up shop for the weekend; they went to dinner before Draco would go out for the evening. It was their routine, and having dinner with Pansy also made it possible for Draco to lie to his mother. She never approved of him going to the gay clubs so frequently, so he'd say he was spending the weekend with Pansy and Blaise, and his friends were always kind enough to cover for him. After all, he knew all of <i>their</i> dirty secrets, as well.</p><p>"What new place?" Draco asked, taking a bite of the chocolate and cheese placed on the counter. He was the best florist in the wizarding London, and his customers not only returned to purchase more and more flowers from him, but also to sample the latest ensembles of desserts he'd have laid out for them.</p><p>The treats were free, and as Draco's customers enjoyed them, he'd chat them up about the flowers. Soon, they were buying bouquets for their loved ones, placing orders for fresh delivers for the next week, and taking down names of the new dessert place Draco had ordered from.</p><p>It was a good life, he thought. Flowers and chocolate. And a bit of sex on the side.</p><p>"There's a new lounge open for business in Amorato, it's relatively close to that bakery you like, 'Mocha Me Yours'."</p><p>"Ugh!" Draco groaned. </p><p>Mocha Me Yours. The bane of his existence. </p><p>Draco <i>loved</i> Mocha Me Yours, but after ordering via owl from that place for ages, he'd decided to stop by the shop. Biggest mistake ever. </p><p>He'd been so happy when he'd walked in, and then had immediately froze since he'd found half of Hogwarts sitting there. Or at least, half of the students from his year. Weasley and Granger were in one corner, with Granger holding her baby, and he thought he'd also spotted Thomas and Finnegan. </p><p>Initially, when he'd walked in, they hadn’t seen him. So, he'd thought he could avoid them by sitting in a booth on the opposite end, when, Parvati Patil had called out his name. The <i>entire</i> place had stopped what they were doing and gaped at him.</p><p>It had been the single most humiliating event of his twenties. And he'd only been twenty-five.</p><p>"If it isn't so," Neville Longbottom had said next, approaching him, with one of the Weasley brothers' arm wrapped around his shoulder. "How are you?"</p><p>"I…uh…fine," Draco had replied. The place was <i>huge</i> and there were plenty of empty tables and booths, but there were still enough faces he'd recognised to <i>never</i> return to that place again.</p><p>What had been <i>worse</i> was just in that bloody moment, Potter, of all people, had walked out of a door. Draco had assumed it was the loo since he hadn't had time to check the place out properly, and Potter was even wearing a Mocha Me Yours t-shirt. Great! Not only did his entire class of Hogwarts <i>hang out</i> at his favourite bakery shop, they even wore their attire like a little fan club.</p><p>If Draco hadn't been visiting the bakery café alone, he would've stayed, but he wasn't strong enough to be there surrounded by all those people. With Potter staring at him. "I have to go," was all he'd said, to no one in particular, and ran out as soon as possible. He'd thought he heard someone call after him, but he'd already midway Apparated by then.</p><p>He'd never told his friends about that incident. Whenever the shop had come up in conversation, Draco pretended to be too busy to visit it. He was certain his friends would only make fun of him, or find reasons to make him go back. They were cruel like that. </p><p>However, the biggest surprise of it all was that—that evening, Draco had received an owl from the Customer Service Manager of Mocha Me Yours. The owl carried a small package of their double chocolate eclairs (Draco's favourite) and a letter.</p><center>

</center>Draco had nearly dissolved into his sofa at the thought of eating a fresh-out-of-the-oven Molten Chocolate Cake from Mocha Me Yours, still, he'd not replied.<p>He'd decided to stay far, far away from the actual café, and continued to owl-shop.</p><p>"Pansy, you know I don't go to straight clubs," Draco said, annoyed he was being forced to revisit that awful memory of his mortifying experience.</p><p>"Well, lucky for you, they're having a queer night."</p><p>"A queer night?"</p><p>"Yeah, you know, a group of people—"</p><p>"Pans, I'm aware of what the definition of queer is."</p><p>"Then why do you look confused?"</p><p>"How did you even <i>hear</i> about this place?</p><p>She shrugged. "It was mentioned in the <i>Witch-Allure</i>."</p><p>"Oh!" Draco groaned again. "You need to stop reading those gossip magazines."</p><p>"Well…" she said glaring at him. "How else am I going to find out about bisexual events in the Wizarding world? It's not like there's a lot of bi-witches and wizards that are out or organise events, or—"</p><p>"And what about Blaise?"</p><p>"He's going to come with," she said smiling. "He said he has a date he can bring and they can be our 'straight ally of the queers'." She seemed far too excited for this.</p><p>"And <i>when</i> is this event?"</p><p>"It's second and fourth Saturday of every month, so there's one tomorrow—"</p><p>"Tomorrow?" Draco almost shrieked. "I need more time to process this, Pansy, I can't just—"</p><p>"Come on, Draco. You can't give up <i>one</i> night of anonymous alley-sex for something for me? What about all the times I—"</p><p>"For Merlin's sake!" He took another piece of chocolate and popped it into his mouth. "You are well aware I do not go out every Saturday. Tomorrow is my Saturday for the run. I have to stay in shape and keep my schedule if I'm going to enjoy my life as much as I do. Chocolate isn't forgiving on the thighs, Pans."</p><p>"Have you considered eating less of it?"</p><p>Draco gasped in horror at that. "Unheard of!" And this time he had shrieked.</p><center>
  <p>)-()-(</p>
</center>Later that evening, after his dinner with Pansy, Draco arrived at his regular Friday night club. It was half-ten, and Tonic was, as he'd expected, only half-full.<p>He made his way to the bar to order his usual when someone came by and pressed themselves against him. Draco didn't think anything of it, the bar area was almost always crowded and you had to push your way through to get the bartender's attention. Besides, it was also a great way to feel the bodies around you and get ready for the evening.</p><p>The body that'd pressed next to him was strong, and Draco felt the man's erection through his jeans firmly against his own leg. <i>Oh, it was going to be that kind of night already</i>?</p><p>He cocked his head and there was something <i>incredible</i> with the way the man smelled. It was as if his cologne was mixed in with…chocolate! Draco took in another whiff and pressed against the man, it was intoxicating. When the bartender, Sam, approached Draco, Draco placed his order.</p><p>With his drink in hand, Draco turned, to the biggest shock of his life. The man who'd been pressing against him was none other than, Harry Sodding Potter. Gods, was there really no escaping the man? Potter, who was about half-an-inch taller than Draco, looked down at him with his green eyes glistening, and the lenses of his glasses reflecting the flashing lights around them. His smile was wide, and if it weren't Potter, Draco would've thought the man was beautiful. </p><p>"What the bloody…" was all Draco had said before he threw some coins on the counter and walked away.</p><p>"Malfoy, wait…" Potter grabbed Draco by the elbow and bloody hell he was strong. "I thought you were enjoying…you know…"</p><p>"I hadn't realised it was <i>you</i>." </p><p>"And what's so wrong with me?"</p><p>"Honestly?" Draco asked, almost scoffing. "It's you."</p><p>"Is that what your problem was at the bakery? You saw me and left. Because it was me?"</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes. "I don't recall what you're talking about." It probably would've been more convincing if Draco had kept his face neutral, but he couldn't help it, he was caught off-guard.</p><p>"Come on, a few months ago? At Mocha Me Yours? You love that place…"</p><p>"How could you possibly know that?"</p><p>Potter shrugged. "I know the owner. He told me you're the reason they're still in business. That you buy all sorts of varieties and samples from them and you serve it in your flower-shop."</p><p>"You know I own a flower-shop?"</p><p>"Yes, Malfoy. I have friends who buy flowers you know." </p><p>Draco recalled seeing the Patil twins there from time-to-time and once or twice Luna Lovegood had stopped by. She'd gone off on a rant about how Moon Frogs only ate yellow tulips and tulips got their colour of yellow from the moon, as it was jealous of the sun. The Moon Frogs ate yellow tulips as they felt lonely and hopeless and wanted to return to their home.</p><p>Lovegood had also eaten half a plate of Algerian Dark Chocolate while she talked.</p><p>"Hey, Draco!" A man walked by them, patting Draco's shoulder as he kept walking, and yanked Draco out of his thoughts.</p><p>"Curtis," Draco said, smiling at him and giving him a nod. He didn't much like Curtis, but anything to get Potter to leave him alone would've sufficed right about now. </p><p>"How do you know him?" Potter asked, looking annoyed.</p><p>"Why do you know him?" Draco asked in return.</p><p>"No. He seemed awfully friendly—do you know everyone here?"</p><p>"So what if I do? I'm not under the Ministry's watch anymore, Potter, and as a matter-of-fact, I'm considered a distinguished member of society." Of course, it helped that Draco always donated flowers for all the funerals the Ministry held for Aurors they lost in action, and gave them a discount on their holiday galas. "I'll be going now…"</p><p>"Malfoy, please…" Potter pulled on Draco's arm again and this time, it was hard enough causing Draco to spill his drink. "Bloody hell. Let me get you another one…"</p><p>"What do you want, Potter?" Draco snapped. He grabbed for his wand and cleaned up the mess they'd just created.</p><p>"Let me buy you a drink."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Okay, come out with me tomorrow night."</p><p>"What? Why?"</p><p>"There's a place I want to take you—"</p><p>"I have plans tomorrow."</p><p>"When do you have plans? Early evening or late in the evening."</p><p>"All of the evening," said Draco.</p><p>He took a step back from Potter with his hands raised, and eventually turned around and walked away. This time Potter didn't come after him. Still, as Draco moved on the dancefloor, writhing between bodies, letting the men around him touch him, or kiss his neck, he felt a set of eyes on him. </p><p>He couldn't shake the feeling off.</p><p>Every time Draco closed his eyes, and a broad chest pressed against his back, he found himself wondering what Potter would feel like against him. Then, he'd swiftly open his eyes and frown at his own thought, inadvertently making his dance partner think Draco was cross with him.</p><p>Nothing about that evening felt right. Draco couldn't get the scent of melted chocolate out his senses. Bloody hell, Potter had smelled so good. He'd looked good too. He'd briefly noticed it several months ago when he'd seen Potter in the Mocha Me Yours t-shirt but that was from a distance. Tonight, Potter had been right in front of him. His muscles were all but ripping the t-shirt off him, and Draco was ready to all but slide into those arms. Well, he would've, if it wasn't Potter, that is. Of course.</p><p>Eventually, after dancing for a bit more with a few different blokes, Draco didn't feel he'd found the right fit for the evening. He decided to count his losses and head back home. It was early enough that he'd simply go home and sleep on his bed, rather than Apparate to Pansy's place and sleep on the sofa. He needed a good night's rest. Especially after having been tormented by Potter like that.</p><p>One thing that'd left Draco perplexed though was why was Potter there? Draco had never seen him at Tonic before, it was one of the reasons Draco frequented Tonic as much as he did. After Potter had come out, Draco had always worried about them running in the same social circle, but until seeing him at Mocha and now at Tonic, he'd been lucky enough to have stayed out of Potter's path, and Potter his.</p><center>
  <p>)-()-(</p>
</center>The next day after breakfast, the first thing Draco did was grab his parchment and quill, and summon his owl. He was going to have some words for Henry Evans of Mocha Me Yours.<center>
  <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
</center><i>Mr Evans, </i><p>
  <i>Although I will admit I'm quite the fan of the dessert delicacies Mocha Me Yours has to offer, I, as a paid customer, do not appreciate your staff members mentioning my business to any of your other patrons or friends. I recently came across an individual, who claims to be a friend of the owner—and stated he was fully aware of how much business I provide to your establishment. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>If you would like to continue keeping me on as your customer, please do not discuss our business dealings with anyone else. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>Sincerely, </i>
</p><p>
  <i>Draco Malfoy</i>
  <br/>
  <i>Owner</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Dances With The Daffodils</i>
  <br/>
  <i>Diagon Alley</i>
  <br/>
  <i>London</i>
</p><center>
  <p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
</center>Much to Draco's surprise, a reply arrived shortly before lunch. Draco had just returned from his run and had showered when his mother told him he had a letter waiting for him.<center>
  <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
</center><i>Dear Mr Malfoy,</i><p>
  <i>My sincerest apologies if you felt violated by, what I was told, was merely a passing comment regarding your love for chocolate. It is my understanding your devotion of sweets is not a secret. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>However, please allow me to make it up to you by offering you a private tour of our kitchens with our head baker, who would <u>love</u> to show you around. In fact, he quite insists on it. He's certain you'll be spellbound by all the delicacies and the scents of our kitchen. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>The offer stands for any day or evening you wish to grace us with your presence. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>Truly yours, </i>
</p><p>
  <i>Henry <s>Jam</s> Evans</i>
  <br/>
  <i>Mocha Me Yours</i>
</p><center>
  <p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
</center>Draco frowned at the letter that seemed borderline flirtatious. Who was this Henry Evans, anyway? How did he know Draco so well? Did he and Potter get on really well? Did they sit around making fun of Draco and his love for chocolate? Was that way Potter was donning a Mocha Me Yours t-shirt when Draco had first seen him there? <p>
  <i>How dare they?</i>
</p><p>No. He would not be taking up Henry Evans on his offer of a tour of the kitchen of his favourite, <i>former favourite</i> bakery. Thank you very much. They'd be lucky if he ordered from them ever again.</p><p>Draco summoned his order forms for all the other boulangeries he'd ordered from in the past, and placed the order for his home and work for the month! <i>That'll show them</i>, he thought. Once they realised their weekly order wasn't coming anymore, perhaps they'd learn more respect!</p>
