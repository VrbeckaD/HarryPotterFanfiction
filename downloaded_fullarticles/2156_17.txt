  <em> Dear Hogwarts Student, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> You are cordially invited to return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this September to complete a new Eighth Year offered to all previous seventh year students whose education was interrupted by the events of the war as an opportunity to finish your N.E.W.T.S.. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Please return the following form if you wish to return to Hogwarts. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Yours, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Professor Minerva McGonagall, </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Headmaster, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Pansy sighed, throwing the letter down on the table and passing a sausage to the large tawny owl now seated gracefully on the back of her chair. The owl hooted happily, devouring the sausage in one gulp before flying out the open window, leaving as though it had never been there. She ignored the single raised eyebrow she was receiving from her mother from across the table, resolving to instead continue with her breakfast, pretending the letter had never arrived.</p><p>The end of the wizarding war had spelt trouble for the Parkinson family. They had been ostracised completely by society, particularly following the conviction of the Lord Parkinson, leaving Pansy and her mother alone in what remained of Parkinson Park. The pair had a rocky relationship before the destruction of their entire family and livelihood, more than ever when Pansy expressed the opinion, on arriving home to the mansion, that she was <em> glad Voldemort was dead, because what good did he ever do for us? His whole fucking cause is bullshit. </em>Her mother had admonished her, criticising her for betraying the family name, putting scorn upon the hard work she and her father had put in to get Pansy a better life; neither had spoken to the other for weeks following, barely returning to civil conversation in late August.</p><p>“Are you going to tell me what this letter is, Pansy?” Her mother said, her usual sneer playing on her lips.</p><p>Pansy sighed, taking her time to sip her tea before responding, “I will be returning to Hogwarts this September,” She said, smiling internally at her mother’s shocked and scandalised expression on her mother’s face before it returned to her usual composed and unimpressed expression.</p><p>“And I expect you will be returning to Slytherin?”</p><p>“I assume so,” Pansy replied, trying not to roll her eyes at her mother’s barely concealed disapproval.</p><p>“Don’t disappoint me Pansy,” Her mother said simply, barely looking at the house elves gathering up her plates and rising from the table, “And <em> please</em> , remember the family name.” She finished, shooting Pansy a pointed look before turning away and leaving the room in the dramatic flurry of robes only truly achievable by a pureblood woman.</p><p>Pansy was, however she may try to dispute it, very much like her mother. The woman had been a role model to her as a child, a strong, independent, powerful woman who married for a title and nothing more. She had been the woman Pansy had wanted to grow up to be, the spitting image of the perfect pureblood woman with a generous dose of Parkinson sass. Pansy had idolised her, upholding this perfect image of the woman, until the war began. Druelle and Pascal Parkinson were some of the first to return to the Dark Lord’s ranks upon his return, encouraging Pansy to do the same as soon as she came of age. The couple became twisted with power lust, their once loving demeanour warped into something far uglier in the face of success at the right-hand of the Dark Lord. However hard she may have tried, Pansy couldn’t be what her parents had wanted, the girl could emulate the power lust and lack of empathy needed to be a death eater and the daughter her parents had wanted, but couldn’t deny how much it affected her.</p><p>“Fucking hell,” Pansy muttered under her breath before leaving the room in the opposite direction, deciding she needed to lie back down for a few hours.</p><p>Pansy had gotten through her seventh year with barely a kink. As a pureblood and a Slytherin, she had been safe from the Carrows despite the fear she felt whenever they entered a room, she knew how to transfigure a chair and how to brew some of the more difficult seventh year potions, she knew how to hide, and how to hide well. Pansy had learned more than just academic things from her years at Hogwarts; she knew more than anything how to hide her emotions and who she really was. There wasn’t much more Hogwarts could teach her. This new eighth year wouldn’t offer her anything, the very notion of it was ridiculous. There was nothing getting her N.E.W.T.S would give her that a few well chosen words and some not too subtle name dropping couldn’t in the world of work.</p><p>And yet Pansy felt that she owed it to herself to return for another year. That maybe it could be an opportunity, a chance for her to redeem herself and to be seen as something more than the two-faced, evil pureblood bitch she had become through her years at the school. To redeem herself, becoming more than the girl who tried to hand Harry Potter over to the Dark Lord. Pansy was terrified, and she was selfish, she refused to allow herself to be reduced to a horrible, heartless person, that would do her no good. She refused to allow herself to be judged by her actions in a moment of complete, all-consuming fear, especially when nobody really knew anything about her. She knew that Theo, Blaise, Draco and Daphne would be returning too, there was no way they would miss out on a chance to get their N.E.W.T.S, the eighth year offered them nothing but benefits, but Pansy didn’t care about that. For her, eighth year was a fresh start. A new opportunity.</p><p>“And maybe she’ll finally…” Pansy mused, neatly folding her dresses and robes and dress robes, placing magazines and muggle lipsticks and nail polishes into her trunk. Part of her felt far lighter at the idea of returning to Hogwarts. It was nice to finally have a purpose again.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>“No way,” Hermione said, not masking the excitement in her voice. The letter in her hand trembled under her firm grip, she turned, looking up at her boyfriend, who’s expression looked far less excited about the prospect of returning to school than Hermione was. “Ron, isn’t this amazing?” She grinned.</p><p>“Sure, Mione,” Ron replied, forcing enthusiasm into his voice and smiling down at his girlfriend. She intentionally tried to ignore Harry’s amused chuckles from the other side of the room, where the boy was reclining on the beaten up sofa that took centre stage in the small living room of the Burrow.</p><p>“No, really! Think about it, we can maybe <em> finally </em>have a single year of Hogwarts without having someone trying to kill us!” She was almost bouncing up and down in excitement, giddy at the idea of being able to go back to Hogwarts, finish her N.E.W.T.S and re-immerse herself into the wizarding world.</p><p>“Don’t you mean trying to kill Harry?” Ron laughed.</p><p>“Nahh, they were after you by extension,” Harry said, chipping into the conversation for the first time in the past thirty minutes. Hermione nodded in agreement, elbowing Ron in the rib when he started laughing at her over enthusiasm.</p><p>“Thank you, Harry,” Hermione said smugly, “You two <em> are </em>coming back in September, right?”</p><p>Ron and Harry nodded, each boy expressing varying degrees of enthusiasm, still not near matching Hermione’s excitement.</p><p>Hermione needed a hobby. She was desperately reaching for anything and everything to occupy her mind. Between helping in the mission to single handedly kill a dark lord, studying to get ahead at magic school and obliviating and then restoring the memories of her parents, she had never really learnt to relax. Her mind needed something to occupy it and the idleness of the summer following the Battle of Hogwarts had left her restless and unhappy. Being with Harry and Ron at the Burrow had been a small solace, the two boys were comforting to be around, but the atmosphere was heavy following the loss of Fred. George was almost never around, instead dedicating his attention to working on the shop in Hogsmeade; he, like Hermione, divulged to keep himself busy rather than truly come to terms with the after affects of the war.</p><p>The wizarding world was, it seemed, in a state of limbo following Voldemort’s defeat. It seemed the only real consistency was Harry’s popularity and time in the limelight, however even that had dwindled somewhat when the media realised that Harry had spent most of his time in the Burrow, rather than scandalising himself in the public eye. Everything that wizarding Britain had stood for was challenged, the Sacred Twenty Eight was in ruins, most of the families in the group had been directly involved in the war, more likely than not as active death eaters. The Ministry were finally reforming, removing it’s corrupt members and replacing them with far more competent, far less prejudiced members. Despite all this change, it seemed that very little was happening in Britain, it seemed the whole wizarding population were in a state of organised mourning. Hermione was grateful for the opportunity to return to Hogwarts, hoping it would offer some kind of eventfulness to the mundane and morbid tone the entire wizarding world had taken.</p><p>“It’ll be good, won’t it?” Hermione asked, hoping for some level of validation from her friends.</p><p>“It’ll be very good, Mione,” Ron said, kissing her on the top of her head before moving to the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea.</p><p>“Don’t worry too much,” Harry said, shooting a reassuring smile her way. Hermione smiled back, somewhere between giddy excitement and pure, undulating terror. Hogwarts wasn’t what it used to be; Hermione had grown sceptical of the school and it’s faculty, having long since abandoned her blind trust of the place. She hoped, silently to not have to spend the year in fear, instead having the chance to return to Hogwarts and be happy, to go to the magical, beautiful school she had always expected it to be. Hogwarts was her first introduction to the magical world, Hermione had been transfixed, eager to learn everything she possibly could about the world and everyone in it, the culture, the food, the history, whatever Hermione could learn, she would. But the magical world had turned out to be far less perfect than she had imagined, instead full of prejudices and injustices. Hermione had faced it all first hand, being a Muggle born, and hadn’t been prepared for it. She had thought it would be a reprise from all the prejudice she faced in the muggle world, she was bullied in school for her dark skin and frizzy, curly hair, she had grown up being called all kinds of names and had expected Hogwarts to be nothing like that but instead was constantly being picked on for being a ‘mudblood’. But maybe, she thought, this year would be different. Without Voldemort and the death eaters, people’s prejudices would maybe end, or at least not be as tolerated. She was excited to return to Hogwarts, not just to learn, but to have a chance to be really happy in the Wizarding world.</p>
