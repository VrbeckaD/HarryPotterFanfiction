  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Your wish would prove interesting, young one. Very well. It has been a year and you have fulfilled the contract. Go. You may take your wolf with you as well.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Robb let out a strangled gasp as he opened his eyes, blinking into the darkness. He heard shouts and startled yells all around him and his heart pounded away in his chest. He could still feel the points in his body where the arrows impaled themselves in his flesh and white hot pain echoed through him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Growling filled the air as sweat dripped down his forehead and he knelt there, breathing heavily. He reached out blindly and grabbed warm fur, anchoring himself to Grey Wind. The huge direwolf didn’t move from his side, growling ominously. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oi, who the fuck are you? Lord, it’s the Stark boy!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Robb flinched at the loud voice, at the yell that seemed to penetrate his ears. He could hear every little noise around him, from the sound of steel being drawn to gasps going around the hall. Scents filled his nose. Wet fur, warm stew, fruit and vegetables and the scent of sex. He slowly opened his eyes and a whimper tore itself from his throat at the sight before him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The hall at the Twins. The seat of Lord Walder Frey. And all the memories came rushing back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Robb.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Someone stepped in front of him and knelt before him, catching his eyes and holding them. He looked into green eyes and took in the wild black hair that was half way pulled back. The scar on the man’s forehead that was shaped as a lightning bolt. The cloak that the man wore and the sword at his waist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man put his fingers to his lips and Robb stayed silent, his heart still pounding and sweat rolling down his back. He shivered as the memories continued to flash and the man in front of him let out a soft noise and then reached out gently, curling an arm around his shoulder. Robb leaned into the fingers and burrowed into the man’s chest, more memories filling his mind. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>These were memories of the same man comforting him…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long…” His own voice was dry, hoarse, and Robb could scarcely recognize it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A year. The Wild Hunt’s rules as they are. Humans spend a year running with them. But you...” Harry trailed off quietly, wrapping an arm around Robb and dropping his head onto Robb’s shoulder at the same time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your Grace…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Robb stiffened at the mocking words but refused to counter them, feeling Harry’s fingers smooth circles into his back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry stayed quiet at the same time, all but wrapped around him. Grey Wind growled even louder beside him but did not move, with Robb’s fingers still curled tightly into his fur. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look at the boy. He wants his mother but he’ll never get her back, isn’t that right, boys?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s no king now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Robb felt Harry’s arms tighten around him and then something swirled about in the air in the hall. Howls filled the air and wolves stepped out of thin air, wolves whose coats shimmered with runes and whose eyes were glowing silver. Wolves who ran with magic in their blood and Robb shivered at the sight, watching as the pack of six fae wolves surrounded them. All of them bared their teeth and flanked Robb, Harry and Grey Wind, their fangs definitely bigger than anything Robb had ever seen in Westeros.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Robb withdrew his fingers from Grey Wind’s fur and nodded as the direwolf met his eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Growling echoed in the hall and soon enough screams joined them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grey Wind left their side and led the pack, pawing at the stone floor beneath them.</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Walder Frey stared out at the hall in front of him, at the various tables of Frey men and women that were gathered together. Howls filled the air and the sound of drums echoed throughout the hall and yet there were no wolves or musicians. Every man stood up abruptly, their hands going to their swords, just as two men and a direwolf appeared as if from thin air.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lord Walder’s eyes widened and his heart thumped in his chest loudly as he recognized one man. The auburn hair that fell down to the man’s shoulders, ending in loose curls, and his bright blue eyes that were haunted. The tunic that the man had worn at the wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Robb Stark, the king in the North. The king who had lost the north. The king who Walder Frey had seen killed last year.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And the grey direwolf with yellow eyes that was even impossibly bigger than when Walder had last seen it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grey Wind, direwolf of Robb Stark.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord, it’s Robb Stark!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Kill him!” Walder Frey exclaimed, paling and standing up immediately. He trembled and sneered down at the boy and met the boy king’s eyes, taking a step back at the almost inhuman look in them. The boy’s blue eyes flashed with fear for just a brief moment and then turned dark, filling with anger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grey Wind howled and blades were pulled out of sheaths. Men yelled and then six more wolves appeared from out of nowhere, shimmering into existence. Walder Frey gasped and backed up even more, his eyes widening at the sight before him. Each wolf had glowing silver eyes and marks glowing about their coats. Their coats were thick and their claws scratched the stone floor as they howled as one, flanking the boy king and the other man.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blood spilled and men shouted as they tried to kill the wolves but their blades broke as soon as they struck fur. Steel shattered upon impact and wolves growled, leaping on men and ripping out their throats. Their fangs grew red with blood but they unnervingly left the women alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Walder stared at the scene in front of him, blinking in dismay and horror, as his men died. His sons, his grandsons and his great grandsons died right in front of him. Heads rolled under tables and ladies shrieked and ran to the sides of the hall, trying to keep out of the violence. Shouts dwindled with every minute and Frey men lay dead in the hall. No one came in from outside the hall but the great doorway was still closed, a thin shimmering, green light laying across it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pack of six wolves and one direwolf finally quieted, standing over the carnage. A minute later, only two wolves remained, one a little different than the others. Walder Frey shuddered as Grey Wind leapt up onto the dais, his yellow eyes near glowing in the torchlight or was that… </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The North remembers, Lord Frey,” Robb Stark remarked, his voice cold and deep, as he stood up and faced him. His auburn curls swayed in an eerie wind, as a breeze wafted through the air. Walder thought he caught a glimpse of Robb’s ears and stared at them, bewildered at the slightly pointed tip. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>I remember.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grey Wind howled and leapt, fangs bared, and Walder Frey knew no more.</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>The body of Lord Walder Frey fell to the stone floor with a loud thump and Grey Wind licked his jaws before padding back over to Robb’s side. He stroked Grey Wind’s fur and idly realized he didn’t need to bend down much to reach his wolf’s back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked out over the great hall of the Twins, taking in the shocked and frightened women at the sides. Harry stood just a few feet behind him, his own wolf at his side. The alpha wolf of the Wild Hunt, his coat shimmering with magic and his eyes glowing silver. The wolf was about the size of a tall pony, mayhaps even taller, and Grey Wind was at the same height.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Robb met Harry’s eyes and then swayed, his knees buckling and his heart racing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry quickly ran over and caught him, slipping an arm around his waist to ease him down. “What now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Robb blinked and stared, took a deep breath and turned to look at the women. He stood up with shaking fingers and looked at the ladies in front of them. “Where is my uncle?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The women at the sides of the hall all shuddered, their faces pale, as they stared at him. It was silent for a few minutes before one stepped forward, coming out from the north corner. She looked to be 10 or 11 years old, the age Arya was the last time Robb saw her, and his heart ached at the thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s in the dungeons, your Grace. His wife is in the other tower with her ladies.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who are you?” Robb questioned, raising an eyebrow at the girl.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Name’s Walda. I was Ser Edwyn Frey’s daughter,” Walda spoke, her voice trembling a little. “That’s him there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Robb followed her pointing finger to the body in the far east side of the hall, as the smell of blood and fear wafted through the air. “Ser Edwyn was Walder’s great grandson, was he not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aye. They said I was heir after father.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then you shall be Lady of the Twins and head of House Frey,” Robb said, frowning in thought. “Where is Olyvar Frey? Is he away? I would like a squire again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I shall fetch him for you, your Grace.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord. Not a king anymore,” Robb muttered, as he walked over to the doorway. “Harry, go find my uncle.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry nodded, his eyes dark, and walked over bodies and dropped weapons. “You keep Grey Wind close.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aye, I will.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry waved his hand over to the door and the shimmering light across it vanished. “Oh, here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Robb took the offered sword from Harry and hefted it in his fingers, enjoying having steel once again in his hand.  </span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry walked out and into the courtyard of the Twins, taking in the flying banner that hung over the walls. It was dark out and the moon shone brightly down onto the stone courtyard. Flakes of snow drifted down onto every single surface and soon enough Harry felt droplets on his hair. The chill in the air didn’t particularly affect him but he did shiver at the sight of the dusting of snow on the ground. Men walked through the yard, unaware of the killings that had taken place. Men with the sigil of House Frey on their tunics and shields. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The huge wolf at his side howled, eerie and loud, and the men that walked outside yelled in surprise, their hands dropping to the weapons at their waists.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry smiled, just a little bit feral, and continued walking to what looked like the barracks and dungeons. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, stop!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fae wolf charged and took down the advancing guard, leaping up and tearing out the man’s throat. Harry watched as every Frey guard stopped at the sight, their faces paling considerably.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yield if you want to live,” Harry offered, raising his voice. His own magic carried his voice to every part of the two towers, to every guard and to every man. The men around him dropped their weapons immediately, strangled gasps leaving their throats. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The wolf took down three men who charged him and Harry took down four more, with one killing curse. Blood sprayed everywhere, entangling in the wolf’s fur, and soaking into Harry’s cloak. The remaining men bent the knee and Harry wove around them, enchanted rope following his fingers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He asked for directions to the dungeons and ended up at Edmure Tully’s cell. The man was sitting on the cold floor, shivering. Edmure had a week’s worth of beard on his face and a filthy cloak on that wasn’t even keeping him warm. The hair on his head matched Robb’s but Edmure’s was certainly not as wild as Robb’s was. Though it was filthy and tangled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Lord of Riverrun looked up at Harry as he opened the door, his eyes dull. “What does Walder want with me now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A shout echoed through the cells and then Harry turned to see his wolf trotting over towards him. He had yet to name the beast even though the animal had taken a liking to him the first day Harry had been swept up in the Wild Hunt. He didn’t even know if the wolf already had a name.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edmure’s eyes widened and he backed up, his face losing any color. “Who… What…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m here to free you,” Harry offered, yanking the door open even wider and looking Edmure over. “Your nephew is in the great hall and your wife is being delivered there as well.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nephew? I thought…” Edmure croaked, his voice dropping. “Bran… Rickon… They’re dead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know about Bran or Rickon but you’re safe now. Walder Frey is dead.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edmure’s eyes widened even more and he stood up, stumbling a little bit. Harry took a step into the cell and offered a hand. Edmure took it and Harry stood still as Edmure found his feet. They both walked out of the cell and out of the dungeons, with Edmure staring at the trail of dead bodies.</span>
</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Robb turned to look at the door to the great hall as it opened again, admitting Harry and Edmure Tully. Edmure looked filthy, his hair tangled, and a week’s worth of beard, and his eyes widened as he spotted Robb.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Robb?!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Edmure!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>From behind him came the new Lady of the Twins, Walda Frey, and Edmure’s wife, Roslin. Roslin’s eyes were red but as she saw the bodies on the floor of the hall, she paled. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My lady,” Edmure croaked out, reaching out an arm towards her. She was obviously pregnant, her stomach round with child, and her eyes widened even more. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Robb watched them close the distance between each other and embrace tightly, his own stomach rumbling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My lady, most men of your house are tied up outside,” Harry remarked, turning to look at Lady Walda Frey. “Their bonds will come undone once we are safely out of the Twins.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do you know that?” Walda questioned, looking to Robb and Edmure. Edmure was clearly overjoyed to see Roslin and Robb both but the man was just beginning to realize that Robb… had died. Harry could see Edmure blink in confusion as he looked his nephew over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry conjured some rope within his hands and then let it vanish again. Lady Walda Frey stared at him, her blue eyes widening a little. She was a girl of 10 years old and yet she wasn’t freaking out at the many bodies around them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We need horses,” Robb said, hooking the sword that Harry had given him to his waist. “Edmure, this is the new Lady of the Twins, Walda Frey. She is Stevron Frey’s great grandchild.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edmure turned to look at the girl and crossed his arms. “Did you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No. I am a girl,” Walda answered, her eyes wide. “Roslin knew.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can clean up too,” Harry offered, shrugging as everyone turned to look at him. “I’m offering, that’s all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know Roslin knew,” Edmure said, slipping an arm around his wife’s waist. “She told me. Will you stay loyal to your liege lord?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Walda Frey knelt, her arms visibly trembling, and nodded. “I will, my lord. Now and always. I’ll have horses saddled for you and Roslin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My friend and I won’t need horses,” Robb remarked, meeting the girl’s eyes gently. “Only two are needed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edmure stared at her and then dipped his head in a nod. “That is good enough for me. Roslin, would you like to--”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t stay here,” Roslin whispered, folding into Edmure’s arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Robb walked over and led the way out, Grey Wind at his heels. Harry swept his arms over the floor as he passed and bodies rose up from the floor and followed them, floating over tables and weapons. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Walder Frey and his sons and his grandsons and great grandsons hovered in the air and Harry waved the bodies on, dropping them in a pile outside. He heard horses whinnying at the smell and servants and hostlers hurried to do their new lady’s bidding. The guards of House Frey were still bound in the courtyard, their skin pale, and their eyes wide as they watched Robb Stark, Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey walk past them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Robb watched as two horses were saddled, as packs were filled for them, and turned to Grey Wind. His direwolf stood before him, tall and coat dribbled in blood, and walked over to his side. Robb met Grey Wind’s yellow eyes and then swung up onto his back. Grey Wind rumbled low in his throat but didn’t react otherwise. Robb curled his fingers into Grey Wind’s thick fur and watched as Harry do the same with his own wolf.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was dark but with the light of the moon, Edmure and Roslin mounted their borrowed horses, their eyes widening at the sight of Harry and Robb’s mounts. Every single men and woman of House Frey stared at the group, blinking at the sight of the men on wolves.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on. The Blackfish and Riverrun await us,” Robb spoke, raising his voice just a little, just enough for Edmure and Roslin to hear him. He locked eyes with Harry, seeing the other man’s eyes darken. “Will you follow me still?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes. I don’t know anyone here except you, Robb,” Harry whispered, as he steered his wolf closer to Robb and Grey Wind. “You make for a gorgeous sight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Robb blinked, his heart skipping a beat in his chest at Harry’s words, and his cheeks reddened. “What do you mean by that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Harry grinned a little bit, his eyes flashing with some emotion. “Every ghost and soul in the Wild Hunt was… They looked like skeletons, like people who were really, truly dead. You… Your soul was as bright as I’d ever seen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Robb felt his cheeks redden even further and Harry winked at him before loping off, his wolf’s claws loud on the stone underneath him. Robb swallowed and then turned back to Edmure and Roslin, who were both already ahorse. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Robb… How are you here?” Edmure questioned, as he urged his horse ahead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is a long story,” Robb answered, gesturing to the bridge ahead of them. “We need to get to Riverrun. How long has it been since… your wedding?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edmure closed his eyes at the memory, his stomach roiling in his chest. But he was… lighter than he had been. He was free and he had a wife and a soon to be born child. “It has been a year.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can fill me in on the way,” Robb said, his eyes darkening. “Let’s go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Edmure watched as Grey Wind began to walk and then trot, speeding up into a lope with Robb Stark on his back. The two men on their wolves led the way out of the Twins and Edmure sighed with relief as he left it behind.</span>
