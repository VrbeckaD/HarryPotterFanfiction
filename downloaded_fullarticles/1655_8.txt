    <p>Albus sat at his desk, eating breakfast and studying today’s newspaper. The biggest headline was of course about Gellert Grindelwald’s escape from MACUSA only one day after he had been arrested. Albus had to admit that didn’t really surprise him. After all, he knew just how ingenious Gellert could be. A certain part of him, one that the professor kept well hidden, was even glad that his former friend had managed to escape. MACUSA was not at all known for having the gentlest approach at interrogating prisoners.</p><p>Finishing his toast and putting aside the newspaper, Albus rose from his desk chair. He had classes to teach and the first one for today was due to start in 10 minutes. The professor went to a mirror and rightened his waistcoat before he put on his suit jacket. Before he left his office, he picked up some school books and his cup of tea.</p><p>Albus just managed to finish his tea when the students started to pour into the classroom, breaking the tranquil silence previously reigning in it. Albus set down his empty cup before he picked up one of the school books and started in on educating these young minds in the art of defending themselves against the dark arts.</p><p>He was in the middle of explaining to them that they had nothing to fear from the boggart he was planning to use in their next exercise, when the door to his classroom was thrown open. A bunch of aurors marched inside and quickly spread themselves strategically around the room. Their leader, head auror Torquil Travers, then arrogantly ordered the students to leave the room.</p><p>When the students uncertainly glanced to their professor, Albus asked them more gently to follow the auror’s request. When the last of the children had vacated the room, an auror closed the door and took up position before it. Albus simply stayed in front of his desk and discreetly studied his unwelcome guests. He put his hands in his trouser pockets and leaned back against the edge of his desk, schooling his face into a somewhat friendly expression. Going by the sour look on the head auror’s face, he had apparently managed to hide his displeasure of being so rudely interrupted quite well.</p><p>“What can I do for you, gentlemen?” Albus addressed the aurors nonchalantly.</p><p>“Well, I’m sure you’ve read today’s newspaper?” Travers asked, his mouth pinched in displeasure.</p><p>“Yes, indeed it did,” Albus replied calmly, appearing unfazed.</p><p>“Then you've heard of Grindelwald’s most recent stint and prison break,” the head auror continued. “Just so you know, the role your little henchman played in the arrest is currently being investigated. His timing had been rather suspicious and terribly convenient after all, don’t you think?”</p><p>Even though he knew exactly whom Travers was speaking of, Albus asked, “I’m afraid I don’t quite follow. I have no ‘henchmen’ as you call them and I have no further knowledge of what has transpired in New York than what I’ve read in today’s morning paper.”</p><p>“I’m speaking of Mr. Scamander, whom you’ve send to America of course,” Travers replied, noticeably peeved by the professor’s nonchalant behaviour.</p><p>“I have nothing to do with Mr. Scamander’s appearance in New York, nor did I have any influence on his travel plans,” Albus lied through his teeth. In truth, he had indeed nudged Newt into the right direction where he would eventually cross paths with Grindelwald. But the outcome of this encounter had been a mystery even to him.</p><p>Travers gnashed his teeth at Albus’ answer and changed the topic. “As much as it pains me to admit, we’re going to need you if we want to take on Grindelwald. Therefore, I demand that you join us and fight him.”</p><p>Albus lowered his eyes to his desk, hiding the conflicted expression that hushed over his face. “I can’t,” he said when he looked back up.</p><p>Fists clenched in anger, Travers came a few steps closer before he took out his wand and conjured up a hazy image for everyone in the room to see. “Is it because of this?” he asked, barely concealing his disgust at the depiction of a young Gellert Grindelwald.</p><p>A multitude of expressions flitted over Albus’ face when he was confronted with the image of a younger Gellert that soon started to shift into an image of how the other man currently looked. Dumbledore had expected that his connection to Grindelwald would be found out eventually, especially with all the digging in his past the aurors were doing. But still, Travers had managed to catch him off guard with this direct confrontation of his findings.</p><p>Fighting to maintain a calm composure, Albus glanced up at the image of the man that had once been his lover. He remembered the time he had spent with the other boy that summer in Godric’s Hollow very well. Those few months had simultaneously been the happiest and most painful ones of his life. To this day they had left him with many regrets and longings. Sometimes Albus couldn’t help himself but to ponder on how different things would be today if only he had done anything differently and didn’t split up with Gellert.</p><p>When he was lying all alone in his bed, unable to sleep, Albus had often caught himself imagining what it would be like to have someone by his side. Someone he could share his most intimate thoughts and secrets with. Someone who would understand and accept him for who he was. After Gellert, Albus had never met anyone who could come even close to the blonde boy. Gellert had and still has such a sharp intellect and an unmatched talent for cunning strategies.</p><p>It was fascinating, how the blonde had been the first and only person that could keep up with Albus. Over the many years they had been apart, Albus had come to accept that there would likely never be anyone like Gellert, so unique had that boy been. To this day the professor longed for that kind of connection as well as love he had shared with the blond delinquent. As a result the reasons for Albus’ self-inflicted isolation in Hogwarts had, over time, become weaker and weaker the longer he had questioned and evaluated them.</p><p>To this day the thought of Gellert being hurt by anyone pained him, no matter what kind of crimes the dark lord was now accused of.  Albus had followed his steady progress and rise in power closely, but had only managed to determine that Gellert still followed the plan they had worked out all those decades ago closely.</p><p>Albus was pulled out of his mind eventually by Travers’ next words. “It seemed you were as close as brothers,” the head auror stated snidely as he indicated the picture of Gellert he had conjured up. Travers also had a grin on his face, most likely feeling very smug that he had managed to puzzle out that much about the professor’s past.</p><p>Red hot anger welled up in Albus at the way the auror had spoken the last sentence with pure disgust in his voice. Albus was itching to throw the truth of the nature of his relationship with Gellert out into the open for everyone to see. It would surely be worth it just to see Travers’ reaction to that.</p><p>Albus had never felt ashamed of his relationship with Gellert even if it would cost him his job and his reputation if it was known that he was a homosexual. To this day society viewed those kind of predilections as something perverted, placing people like him and Gellert in the same category as rapists or child molesters and so on.</p><p>The consequences of someone finding out about his sexuality would leave Albus a shunned man that would most likely be facing destitution since he’d lose his job and no one would want to hire him after that. And that estimation was rather generous since he hadn’t even let the fact that he had at one point been in a relationship with a man that was considered a dark lord these days factor into his calculation.</p><p>Albus shook his head to get rid of his traitorous thoughts. He couldn’t allow himself to give something away, not when the aurors where watching him as closely as they currently did. The professor reigned in his anger and buried it deep inside himself where he kept the rest of his disdain for narrow minded people.</p><p>However, when Albus turned back to Travers, he couldn’t manage to hold back from commenting, “Oh, we were closer than brothers.”</p><p>By the blank looks on the aurors' faces Albus knew that they hadn’t gotten his meaning, which wasn’t really surprising. What was surprising however, was that he didn’t find himself feeling as worried as he should be by the possibility of the aurors figuring him out. Apparently he was more tired of hiding then he had thought. That was certainly a thought to contemplate later on, after he had dealt with the pesky aurors.</p><p>Travers fixed the professor with an angry frown. “Are you going to fight him or not?” he asked one last time, his patience running short.</p><p>Albus knew the only answer he could give. Even if he and Gellert had never made the blood pact, the fond regard that Albus still had for the blonde would have ensured the same answer. Once more, Albus replied, “I can’t.”</p><p>Travers let out a huff of breath. “Very well, you’ve chosen your side then,” he stated and not as second later a matching pair chunky bracelets snapped themselves around Albus’ wrists. This time Albus definitely failed to conceal his anger which caused Travers to sneer at him. “From now on, we’ll know every spell you cast and we’ll be able to follow you wherever you go,” he explained smugly. </p><p>Albus had nothing to reply to that because he feared he might accidently voice some of the thoughts that currently went through his mind if he didn’t keep his mouth shut. The professor also had his hands full with controlling his magic that desperately wanted to escape and lash out at the aurors.  With his magic feeling like icy insects crawling beneath his skin, Albus had to concentrate hard to keep a facsimile of a smile on his face. Only his eyes that were usually as blue as a summer sky gave some of his feelings away. They had lost their friendliness and a dangerous glimmer had entered them, their blueness now rather reminiscent of century old glacier ice than of an azure blue sky.</p><p>Having accomplished his goal one way or another, head auror Travers wished Albus a good day before he turned and stormed out of the classroom, his aurors following after him obediently. The fuming professor wanted nothing more than to storm off as well, but he still had one class to teach before he was done for today. So, Albus went and prepared himself another cup of tea and worked on reigning in his anger in the 15 minutes he still had before the next students would flood into his classroom.</p><p>Albus taught the next class as he usually did, but he was glad when it was over about an hour later. With as stack of papers that needed grading under his arm, the professor headed back to his office. Once there, he took off his suit jacket and started in on reading through his students’ homework from last week. Unfortunately, that didn’t manage to take his mind off of what had transpired in his classroom not 2 hours ago. Every time he moved to turn over a page the clunky monitoring bracelets came into his field of vision and caused another bubble of anger to well up inside him. But even though he felt restless and strangely unsettled, Albus finished grading his student’s papers and prepared what he needed for tomorrow’s lessons.</p>
