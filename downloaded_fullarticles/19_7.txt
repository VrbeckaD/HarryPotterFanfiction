    <p>Sirius Black was the best in his field of work. His job was to get in, get the needed person, and get out. </p><p>And he loved it. </p><p>Everyone knew that he did, which is what made him the best. It was Sirius who was given the hardest cases, Sirius who was in charge of the most time, situation, and people sensitive missions. He extracted those who went missing on top-secret, high profile government, double agent jobs.</p><p>Sirius didn’t let it go to his head, but that doesn’t mean he didn’t know and understand that he had the place wrapped around his finger. Needed a raise for some odd reason? Right away. Bigger house? No problem. Vacation between missions so he could fall off the map for a while? Already booked the flight. He could technically say or do practically anything and there would be little or no repercussions. It just so happened that Sirius Black was an honest man who doesn’t take advantage of things or of people.</p><p> </p><p>It was a cold day for November. Sirius had gone a few months since his last extraction job. He was in his living room, channel surfing, trying to figure out a programme worth watching. He had already seen most everything interesting, so he turned it off and went to his library, where shelves upon shelves of books sat. Sirius didn’t even have to look around for the book he wanted, he went directly to the back right shelf and pulled off his favourite book. He ran his hand over the cover, then opened it and thumbed through the pages. </p><p>Suddenly, his phone rang and pulled him from his thoughts. “Hullo, Sirius Black,” he answered, setting his book down on the desk under the window and leaning against it as his eyes followed along the wall. He really did have hundreds, maybe even a thousand, books. But he absolutely loved it. </p><p>“Black.” Sirius immediately recognized the voice as Addler’s, which he would have seen if he bothered to check who was calling. “K-one-O-D-four.”</p><p>“Must we go through these formalities, I have your number saved into my phone.”</p><p>“Yes, we must.” Sirius let out an exasperated sigh. </p><p>“L-two-yellow-E-five. ID number is seven-two-eight-six-nine-zero.” <em> Six-nine. Nice, </em> he chuckled to himself. It was an extraordinary tedious process in his opinion.</p><p>“We have a new case for you. We need you to come in as soon as possible, when can that be?”</p><p>“Well I’ll need a plane, I’m out of country.” He smirked to himself, very aware that they could see the location he was calling from. He could hear Addler’s exasperated sigh through the phone, which only made him smile more. </p><p>“Just get to the airport quick.” Addler hung up. <em> Airport? </em></p><p>Sirius picked up his book and slid it back into its original slot on the shelf, then dialed James and told him he was going to be leaving again as he got dressed and grabbed a quick breakfast, which ended up to be a thirty-minute conversation with Lily and baby Harry as well. </p><p>When he finally said goodbye and promised to go to theirs once he returned, he grabbed his keys and left his house. </p><p>It was about a thirty-minute commute to the airport, but Sirius always rode his bike and never went the speed limit. Even if he did get pulled over, it would be quickly resolved by his special identification card. He wasn’t sure how it worked, all he knew was that as soon as they returned with it they let him go. That, and the added fact that it was early in the morning on a Sunday meant that there were hardly any cars or police, so Sirius Black had gotten there in a record time of nineteen minutes.</p><p>The airport was always buzzing with life. People coming and going nonstop. It would have taken absolutely forever if his boss and the owner of the airport hadn’t built a backway with a <em> private </em>runway and a building with <em>private </em>offices that only people in his company had access to.</p><p>He rolled into the side garage and parked his motorcycle, then went around and into the main office. Addler was talking to the screen opposite the wall, where there were four other people.<br/>
“Ah, yes, Black.” He stood up and shook his hand, that was always his way of saying “behave.” “This is Sirius Black, our best man. Mr. Black, this is Harris, Johnson, and Adams.” Each man gave a little wave at the mention of their name. </p><p>“Yes, right. Quite nice to meet you.” Sirius stood extraordinary straight and held his hands behind his back.</p><p>“Well, men, I best be off. We shall continue this at the next meeting.” Before any of them could respond, he hung up. “I hate talking to them, so formal. We’ve been working with each other for nearly <em> twenty years</em>, they should learn a joke or two.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>“Well, Sirius, you must be wondering why I’ve called you here-”</p><p>“A bit, yeah.”</p><p>“But it’ll have to wait till we are on the plane.”</p><p>“Plane, sir?”</p><p>“Yes, on the plane.”</p><p>“Why-”</p><p>“We will talk on the plane.” He said firmly, darting his eyes to the security camera in the corner of the room.<br/>
“Yes, sir.” Addler gathered his things, which was just his computer and a few folders, and walked out the door opposite the one Sirius entered in and around the corner, low and behold, there was a very small plane waiting. He followed the man all the way to it and up the stairs, into the inside where it was cool and there was a minibar but with a small stove, a minifridge, small pantry, and <em>several </em>alcoholic drinks above it. Sirius immediately went behind the counter to make himself something. Before this career, he considered being a chef. “Want anything?” He asked casually.</p><p>“Whatever you're making is good.” He claimed as he took a seat.</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>“I have a case for you.”</p><p>“Do you? I thought this was a date. I guess I won’t be offering you any of this,” he picked up a random wine glass “Pinot Grigio.” </p><p>Addler sighed exasperatedly and took out a file from the stack he was holding and set it on the counter in front of him. </p><p>“Remus Lupin. Everyone thinks it’s a bad idea to pull him off it, but he’s missed the last three check in’s.” </p><p>“And? I’ve missed more than three before.”</p><p>“That’s what the council said, but I’m not sure. It’s not like Lu-”</p><p>“But, sir-”</p><p>“He’s an unspeakable.” Immediately Sirius stopped talking and looked up at Addler. Sirius has never been so much as allowed to think the word unspeakable. To be rescuing one…</p><p>He cleared his throat. </p><p>“Don’t… don’t unspeakables get other unspeakables?”</p><p>“No one gets the unspeakables. They either die or come back successful. With what they’re doing… there’s no in-between.” His tone was somber.</p><p>“Then why-”</p><p>“Why are we extracting one? He’s been found out.”</p><p>“Amateur.”</p><p>“He’s been working on this case for <em>four </em>years. This is his <em>fifth </em>case. His record time is one month. I <em> dare </em>you, Sirius Black. Say amateur again.” He all but snarled, but there was a distraught look in his eyes. A sadness.</p><p>“You know him, don’t you?”</p><p>“He’s my nephew,” Addler whispered. “Last of my family. Look we’re flying you to a private island where he is being held and supposedly tortured for information. I have no idea what shape you will find him in, so if you get to him, ask him this. ‘Who was little May and what did she love?’ his answer should be along the lines of 'June’s doll and tea parties with Chuck. Chuck was June’s bear.” He went quiet for a moment before Sirius moved on from this obviously uncomfortable conversation topic.</p><p>“So what’s his deal? What happened, what was he doing?”</p><p>“A certain group is rising to power, we sent him in to stop it.”</p><p>“What group?” </p><p>“You know what group. It’s the reason you are the only one who could do this. Why you're so good in your field.”</p><p>“<em> No </em>.”</p><p> </p>
