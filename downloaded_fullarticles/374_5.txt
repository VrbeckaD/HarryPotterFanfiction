    <p align="center">A/N: This story only takes in the events of the original seven Harry Potter books and no others. This is also the sequel to my story Step Back in Time. Enjoy.</p><p align="center">xXx</p><p>Ry jolted and rolled from his bed before he even realised he was awake. He crouched down with his eyes darting around the room as he looked for danger. When nothing jumped out at him he stood and focused on what had woken him. He looked down at the bracelet around his wrist and paled. His father.</p><p>He grabbed his phone off the bedside table and quickly pulled up Kingsley's number as he moved towards his cupboard.</p><p>"What!" Kingsley snapped, his voice rough from sleep.</p><p>"Dad," Ry replied quickly. "He's in danger. I'm getting ready now, I'll meet you at the Ministry."</p><p>Silence greeted him until he heard swearing across the line. His father was good at invoking that reaction.</p><p>"I'll call it in," Kingsley replied and hung up.</p><p>Ry quickly pulled out his vest and dragon hide pants. He dressed quickly before pulling his silver sword out and placing it on his belt next to his gun with his wand on the other hip. He pushed his worry to the side harshly and tried not to think in what state he was going to find his father in as he finished dressing. For his bracelet to flare like it did, his father wasn't going to be in a very good state but since the connection hadn't broken he knew his father hadn't been killed.</p><p>Once he was dressed, he stepped out his front door and apparated to the Auror Department. He slipped his phone out and tried to ring Severus but it just rang out and his worry increased.</p><p>"Potter!"</p><p>Ry turned to see Kingsley and Miller and rushed over to them.</p><p>"I can't get through to Severus," Ry reported quickly. "The bracelet flared about ten minutes ago. The connection is still active."</p><p>"It's two in the morning," Miller stated with a frown. "What could have happened?"</p><p>"I don't know," Ry replied. "We should move on their house first."</p><p>Kingsley and Miller nodded at his suggestion.</p><p>"Get your team," Kingsley ordered. "I've called them in, then apparate to Blake's house."</p><p>"Yes, sir." Ry said quickly and ran through to the Auror department.</p><p>Ron and Ginny were already waiting for him with Tom and Bayley making their way over.</p><p>"What's happening, mate?" Ron asked the moment he saw him.</p><p>"Dad," Ry explained in one word. "We have to move out now."</p><p>The team nodded and fell in with him as they moved up to the apparation point for the Auror department. Ron grabbed Bayley and Ginny apparated with Tom, since both Weasleys already knew where his father's house was.</p><p>Ry apparated and stepped towards the house his father and Severus had been living in for the last two years after leaving Hogwarts. He looked up at the plain looking two-story house and quickly moved forward. He placed his hand on the front gate and his father's wards brushed over his skin as he opened the wards up to his team.</p><p>The house was quiet as he signalled for Tom and Bayley to take the back as Ginny and Ron fell into step with him. He turned slightly as Miller and his team apparated in and signalled them back.</p><p>He silently rushed forward with Ginny and Ron covering. He placed his hand on the door and paled, something was wrong with the ward. He signalled for Ginny to hold as he crouched beside the door and pulled his wand. He flicked the doorhandle and stood to the side with Ron at beside him and Ginny on the other side. He pushed the door open and ducked back to the side.</p><p>When nothing happened, he quickly peeked around the doorway but the house was quiet and dark. He moved into the living room silently with Weasleys covering him. He moved through the silent room and glanced into the kitchen before heading down the hallway to his father's bedroom. He opened the door then froze as his stomach dropped.</p><p>Severus lay sprawled out, on his side, beside the bed, naked, bruised and bloody. Ry quickly fell to his knees beside him as Ron kept an eye out. The man was a mess and Ry quickly ran his wand down his body as he placed his fingers to his throat. He was still alive but the pulse was soft under his fingertips.</p><p>"Clear," Ginny called from doorway then moved around the bed. "One dead around here, not pretty."</p><p>Ry pushed Severus gently as he whispered healing charms under his breath. The man rolled limply onto his back under his hand. He could pick up the broken ribs, a concussion, a nasty bullet wound to the stomach and other minor injuries. Ry started with a bullet wound as he dived into healing, trusting Ginny and Ron to watch his back as he worked to save the man before him.</p><p>Ry could feel him slipping and grabbed the connection that Severus had with his father and pulled on it slightly. Magic responded to him and he sighed, his father was aware enough to help as magic moved across the connection but it felt sluggish and unlike his father's normal response.</p><p>He grabbed the added magic to boost Severus's reserves and his healing as he worked. Suddenly the magic from his father cut off and Ry paled but he didn't have time to think on that. He finished up with the bullet wound and pulled back as he slipped a couple of potion vials out of his potion's pouch. Ginny helped him as he forced Severus to take the potions. He gently pushed Severus's hair back from his pale face and felt his heart clench in his chest.</p><p>"Conjure a stretcher," Ry ordered as he looked down at the bloody potion master. "We need to get him to St Mungo's quickly."</p><p>"Will he make it?" Ginny asked quietly as Ron conjured the stretcher and Ry very carefully floated the man onto it, before flicking his wand and a blanket fell over his naked form.</p><p>"He has a better chance there then here," Ry answered sharply.</p><p>Ry had the stretcher floating down the hallway and out of the house. A medic team were waiting beside Miller and they quickly took over Severus's care as they passed over the wards. Ry watched them carefully as they quickly cast the containment charms and had him stable before using a portkey and disappearing.</p><p>"Blake?" Miller questioned quietly.</p><p>Ry turned to him as he pushed his feeling to the side. He would deal with them later as he focused on what was before them.</p><p>"Come on," Ry said quickly. "I'll key you to the wards."</p><p>Ry stepped forward with Miller's team behind him. He quickly had them keyed to the wards as they moved back into the house. They made their way slower through the house, checking each room before getting to the bedroom. There would have been no way that his father would have left Severus and the thought sent a bolt of fear through him. What could have happened to make his father leave the other man?</p><p>Ry took care to look around the room, from the blood, to the dead man, to his father's silver knife on the floor and a gun laying slightly under the bed. He paled as he took everything in. He was sure that his father hadn't had a choice when he'd left Severus behind.</p><p>"I'll call the vampire," Ry said softly. "He'll be able to sniff this out."</p><p>xXx</p><p>Dracka started awake when his phone rang. He moved the arm from around his waist as he wiggled to the side of the bed. He snagged up the phone as he glanced at the clock. He looked down at the screen and tensed.</p><p>"Do you know what time it is?" Dracka snarled into his phone.</p><p>"We need you here," Ry answered and the tone of his voice had Dracka on edge.</p><p>"What happened?" Dracka snapped, as his bedpartner woke up and looked over at him.</p><p>"Dad's been taken," Ry stated with steel in his voice. "Severus has been shot and beaten."</p><p>Dracka's eyes flashed as rage flooded into him.</p><p>"Will he make it?" Dracka asked softly as he crawled out of the bed.</p><p>"I'm not sure," Ry replied and Dracka felt a bolt of fear run through him at the man's words. "I did what I could and he's been moved to St Mungo's. I need you here to try and work out what happened and to try and sniff out Dad."</p><p>"Hold on," Dracka said into the phone, before placing a hand over the speaker. "Wake Bradon. I want you and Alice to gear up."</p><p>"Okay," Liam said softly as he pulled himself out of the bed, fully naked.</p><p>The man pulled on a pair of pants before dashing out the door.</p><p>"We're getting ready now," Dracka promised.</p><p>"I'll have Kingsley set up a portkey at the French Portkey Platform," Ry told him. "Thank you."</p><p>"No problems," Dracka replied and hung up.</p><p>It wasn't until he went to place the phone on the table that he noticed that his hands were shaking. He curled them into fists and took in a shaky breath before moving towards his cupboard to dress.</p><p>It had been over twenty years since the mess with Simpson and the wizarding world had settled down in that time with no whispers of a Dark Lord on the rising. Dracka had moved back to his Coven about two years ago after Severus and Blake had decided to leave Hogwarts. So, he didn't know what had changed now for Blake and Severus to be attacked and Blake to be captured.</p><p>Once he was dressed and ready, he moved towards the front doors of his mansion where Bradon, Liam and Alice were waiting for him on the front porch.</p><p>"Look after everything for me," Dracka said, as Bradon pulled him in for a hug. "Call me if you have any trouble."</p><p>"I will," Bradon promised, his own eyes shining red.</p><p>Dracka gave him a nod and moved out across the lawn with Liam and Alice falling in behind him. It was a good thing it was dark as his hellhounds kept close to them and he glanced over at Liam. The younger vampire gave him a grin and he felt concern. The other vampire didn't have the protection that he did for the sun and he rethought about the man coming, but he had a feeling he was going to need the support.</p><p>It took them over an hour to get to Blake's house and he glanced around as he apparated in with Alice and Liam beside him. The place was swarming with Aurors and members of the Department. Alice shifted nervously as she rubbed her left arm slightly, being an ex-death eater wouldn't get her any friends with the crowd around her. Liam stepped closer to her as his eyes darted around.</p><p>"Dracka!"</p><p>Dracka looked over to see Miller moving towards him from Blake's house and he shook the man's hand.</p><p>"Do we know anything more?" Dracka asked in greeting as they started towards the house.</p><p>The wards parted around Dracka but Alice and Liam were held back, much to the younger vampire's displeasure.</p><p>"Just wait here," Dracka told them softly and they nodded.</p><p>"That's what you are here for," Miller explained, looking pale. "There are two bodies, so they put up a fight. Potter is trying to narrow down his location, while he has the connection. He has only let my team and his over the wards to help you out."</p><p>Dracka grabbed Miller's arm and stopped him.</p><p>"He thinks he's going to lose the connection?" Dracka asked faintly.</p><p>"We're not sure of anything at the moment," Miller replied. "This has come out of nowhere."</p><p>"Severus?"</p><p>"Is at St Mungo's," Miller informed him. "It doesn't look good, we should know more soon. Draco has been informed."</p><p>Dracka felt coldness in his stomach as he looked around Blake's living room, Severus and Blake's scent strong in the room. He moved down the hallway smelling out the scents, he knew Miller's team and Potter's team and could pick out their scents easily.</p><p>"They didn't come in from this way," Dracka reported.</p><p>He glanced into the kitchen to see Ry seated at the dining table. He had maps spread out and the scent of his magic on the air, so much sweeter than Blake's but still similar. He didn't interrupt him as they moved passed.</p><p>He paused, knelt down and touched his fingers to a spot on the floor, blood. He sniffed his fingers and his demon growled, Severus's blood. He stood and moved further down the hallway and started to see more signs of a struggle and other scents he didn't know. He looked up to see the door to the bedroom open and steeled himself as he stepped closer.</p><p>He glanced over at Miller, the man stood further back down the hallway. He flinched back slightly, so he knew his eyes were shining red as the demon prowled near the surface of his mind. Miller knew when to give him space to work.</p><p>He steeled himself before stepping into the bedroom and couldn't stop the growl in the back of his throat as he looked around. The light brought up the red-brown stains of blood near the bed and he moved forward and crouched down. Paling when he saw how much blood Severus's had lost, before standing and looking down at the dead man on the other side of the bed. The man had been stabbed deeply and Dracka took note of his scent as he took in the rest of the room. He picked up Blake's scent closer to the bathroom and reached out a hand to touch the hole in the wall and the blood splatter around it.</p><p>"He's been shot," Dracka commented.</p><p>"Severus was shot as well," Miller added from the doorway. "The other body is outside."</p><p>Dracka nodded as he picked up Blake's scent and moved back out of the bedroom and through the door at the back of the house and into the yard.</p><p>"They got in through this door," Dracka reported. "Four came into the house and two stayed out here."</p><p>Dracka looked around the yard and moved towards the body sprawled out on the grass. He looked down at the body before moving further out into the large yard. He followed Blake's scent before kneeling down and touched his fingers to the ground. They came away wet and he took a sniff, it was Blake's blood and a lot of it. He frowned and cast a small light spell to give him a little more light to see the ground and he swallowed back bile.</p><p>"Looks like he was stabbed deeply. This is a lot of blood." Dracka uttered to Miller. "Why would they shoot him then drag him out here before stabbing him? But, not leave him here? This amount of blood would be fatal to anyone else."</p><p>"Maybe he gave them a fight here?" Miller asked as he crouched down near him and looked the blood over. "Potter says he still has the connection, so he's still alive. Perhaps they didn't intend to stab him so deep or they have a healer waiting."</p><p>"With this amount of blood," Dracka said softly. "They let him lie here for a while, you can see where it has pooled slightly."</p><p>Miller frowned and replied, "Ry had a team here within twenty minutes."</p><p>"They were quick to get him out here," Dracka replied. "Then for some reason they stopped here."</p><p>"I've lost the connection," Ry cut in from behind them.</p><p>Dracka stood as the younger man stepped closer. He pulled Ry into his arms and the man fell into them briefly before pulling back. Ry was pale but his green eyes blazed with rage as they looked around and Dracka kept his hand on his shoulder.</p><p>"Were you able to narrow it down?" Miller asked.</p><p>"Not as much as I was hoping," Ry replied and ran a hand over his head, ruffling up his hair and showing off the faint red line of the lightning bolt scar. "Hopefully you might be able to pick up his scent or Dad can pick up the connection again to help us."</p><p>"Were the wards broken?" Dracka asked.</p><p>"Not on the front gate," Ry responded. "I would say they had a curse breaker bend them out of the way, they would have to have great skills not to alert Dad. They did something to the wards on the house, though. I not sure what, Dad would have a better idea. Whatever they did, it didn't break them. They took great care to make sure that if there was an alarm built in that it wouldn't go off. They weren't counting on Dad having other ways of alerting us."</p><p>The three men didn't want to think what would have happened if Ry hadn't gotten there when he did. Dracka lifted his nose into the air and followed Blake's scent, made easier by the fact that he'd been bleeding. Dracka led them to the back of the yard where a section of the fence had been broken. He touched his fingers to the blood on the broken fence and sniffed them, confirming what he already knew.</p><p>"Blake's blood," Dracka reported softly.</p><p>They carefully stepped through the broken part of the fence and into the neighbour's yard, the wards passing over them at the fence line. Dracka took care to pick up Blake's scent and stepped forward.</p><p>"They dragged him through here," Dracka said as he followed the trail.</p><p>"Are we passed the apparation wards?" Miller asked with a frown.</p><p>"Yes, they stop at the fence line with the other wards." Ry replied. "Why would they not just apparate or portkey from here?"</p><p>Dracka frowned as the trail kept going towards the house, the back door was hanging opened. Ry and Miller pulled their wards as they moved into the house. A woman lay sprawled out across the floor and Dracka crouched down briefly.</p><p>"Dead," Dracka confirmed before moving on to the lounge room where a man was laying completely still on the lounge. "Also, dead."</p><p>Dracka followed Blake's scent to the fireplace where it stopped. He knelt down and touched his fingers to the blood on the fireplace tiles. He rubbed it between his fingers before bringing it to his nose. The demon in his mind growled and he pushed down on it, he had to focus.</p><p>"They used a floo?" Miller questioned with a frown. "Isn't this a muggle neighbourhood?"</p><p>"Yes," Ry confirmed and knelt down next to Dracka and took in the sight of the blood. "Dad would have hated that."</p><p>Ry's phone suddenly rang and he pulled it out.</p><p>"Potter."</p><p>"Hey, Potter." Draco Malfoy's voice came down the line. "Severus has gone in for surgery."</p><p>"Okay," Ry said softly. "How is he?"</p><p>"Touch and go at the moment," Draco replied. "I couldn't get a hold of Blake?"</p><p>Ry sighed and Dracka took the phone out of the other man's hand.</p><p>"We don't know where he is," Dracka told him.</p><p>"Do you need my griffin to help find him?" Draco asked and Dracka started.</p><p>"Yes," Ry cried as he snatched the phone back. "We're still at Dad's house. Do you know where that is?"</p><p>"Of course, Potter." Draco drawled. "I'll be there in about half an hour."</p><p>"Thanks," Ry replied and hung up.</p><p>Dracka pulled Ry into a side hug and he sighed as he slipped his phone away. Miller watched them as Dracka tightened his hold. He didn't offer any meaningless words as he offered him some kind of comfort.</p><p>"We should get back up to the house," Miller suggested. "Kingsley might be able to trace the floo at the Ministry."</p><p>The two men got to their feet and they made their way back to the house.</p><p>xXx</p><p>Ry looked around his father's bedroom again, what were they missing? They'd had no warning, nothing. He looked over at his father's bedside table and frowned, the cherry wood wand sat there but not the elder wand. He looked over and could see Severus's wand on his bedside table.</p><p>Whatever had happened, they both hadn't had time to grab their wands. It looked like Severus had been shot near the bed and also beaten but they were unsure which had happened first. His father had reacted quicker and had made it halfway between the bed and the bathroom before he was shot.</p><p>It would have been his father that had killed the man they had found beside the bed. They'd also found Blake's silver knife near the dead man as well as unknown gun. His father's sword was nowhere in the house, but he wasn't surprised by that. He reached out for the link with his father but it wasn't there as he looked around and his eyes caught on the wand again. They were missing something.</p><p>"You said they left him outside on the grass for a while?" Ry questioned.</p><p>"Yes," The vampire replied.</p><p>"Could they have come back in for the elder wand?" Ry contemplated as he turned to Dracka. "Leaving him outside?"</p><p>"Do you think they are after the Deathly Hallows?" Dracka countered.</p><p>The two men shared a look.</p><p>"They have tried before," Ry stated.</p><p>"And got nowhere," Dracka pointed out.</p><p>"They may have gotten further this time," Ry remarked. "They didn't seem to care if they killed him."</p><p>They both fell into silence for a few minutes before looking over when Kingsley arrived in the doorway.</p><p>"We couldn't get anything off the fireplace," Kingsley reported as he stepped into the room. "They had it connected yesterday and only for twelve hours. We have people looking into the paperwork and the Minister is breathing down their necks."</p><p>Ry snorted as he picked up his father's wand.</p><p>"Hey, Potter."</p><p>Ry looked up to see Draco standing in the doorway looking around, the room was starting to get crowded.</p><p>"Severus?" Ry asked.</p><p>"Going well so far," Draco answered as he looked down at the blood stain.</p><p>"Dad managed to send him some magic before it cut off," Ry reported.</p><p>"Probably saved his life," Draco replied mildly but his eyes gave him away as he rubbed a hand over his head, spiking up his short blonde hair. "He could do with some more magic?"</p><p>"That would mean finding Dad," Ry remarked as he placed his father's wand back down. "Let's get moving."</p><p>They filed out as Ry led them back to the kitchen and the maps he had spread out over the large table.</p><p>"I managed to narrow it down to a five Kilometre radius before the connection broke," Ry stated and pointed out the area.</p><p>"That's a large area, Potter." Draco sneered. "And he could have been moved since then."</p><p>"Unless Dad picks up the connection, it's the best I can do." Ry snapped at the blonde and the man sneered at him.</p><p>"You can't pick up the connection?" Dracka questioned.</p><p>"Dad needs to pick it up from his end which I'm sure he will do when he can." Ry said in frustration. "Severus would be able to know where he is."</p><p>The room fell quiet, with Severus out they were running blind.</p><p>"He would have had nothing on him," Dracka pointed out. "Nothing he could use or we could use to track him."</p><p>"He still has his sword," Ry retorted. "And the elder wand."</p><p>"He has to be aware enough to call those items to him," Dracka reminded him.</p><p>"If you have his blood, Leo should be able to pick up on him." Draco added.</p><p>Dracka flashed his fangs at the blonde and Draco raised an eyebrow. He looked down his nose at the vampire, unimpressed with the display.</p><p>"There's plenty of his blood outside," Ry snapped and Draco paled.</p><p>Dracka grabbed the blonde's shoulder and pushed him towards the back of the house. Draco pulled himself up and straightened his robes as glared over his shoulder at the vampire.</p><p>"Pushy," Draco sneered. "Manners, Mr Dracka."</p><p>Dracka growled at the other man but Draco just stalked down the hallway and outside, leading the way. The man pulled out the small gold glass griffin and it shook itself before it looked around with shining red eyes.</p><p>"Blake Sun," Draco purred and the griffin squeaked and took to the air.</p><p>Draco and Dracka watched the little gold figurine as it glided over to where Blake's blood was on the grass. Draco pulled himself up to his full height before striding out onto the lawn after his griffin. His white dress shirt standing out from his tailored black pants and robes.</p><p>"It will be dawn soon." Draco purred as he glanced over at Dracka.</p><p>Dracka cursed and turned on his heels with Draco's mocking snigger behind him.</p><p>Dracka moved to the front of the house to see that the press had arrived and the Aurors were keeping them back. He spotted Alice easily and moved towards the woman as the press started yelling questions and flashes of the cameras went off. Anything to do with Harry Potter or Blake Sun always drew a crowd and a legal case if Blake wasn't happy with the article.</p><p>Dracka waved Alice through the Aurors and got close to her.</p><p>"Head back to the Coven with Liam," Dracka whispered in the woman's ear.</p><p>"You don't want us to stay?" Alice offered, looking him over.</p><p>"Nothing we can do until we find him and the sun will be up soon," Dracka answered.</p><p>Alice kissed him on the cheek before quickly turning on her heels and disappearing into the crowd. He sneered at the press before heading back to the house.</p><p>xXx</p><p>Severus woke to pain and hissed a breath. Instinctively he reached out to his link with Blake and his blood ran cold when he didn't find it. He reached out further, still feeling nothing and he panicked. He tried to roll over onto his side and the pain took his breath away. He tried to pull breath into his lungs as hands grabbed him.</p><p>"Just settled down, Mr Snape." A voice said softly to him. "You're at St Mungo's."</p><p>Severus kept trying to reach for Blake and the noise increased in volume and he felt those hands tighten as they held him back. He lashed out with his magic but that just took away what little energy he had as darkness claimed him.</p><p>xXx</p><p>"Malfoy," Draco answered his phone. "Okay…yes…I'll tell him."</p><p>Draco hung the phone up and looked around the kitchen.</p><p>"Severus woke up then panicked," Draco reported.</p><p>"He probably reached out to his link with Dad," Ry said softly.</p><p>"Yes, Potter." Draco sneered, but the pain in the man's eyes took the bite out of it.</p><p>"What are you even doing here, ferret?" Ron snapped.</p><p>"Enough!" Dracka growled and the two men fell silent.</p><p>"Come on," Kingsley snapped, as he looked down at the map on the table. "Ron and Bayley, you apparate here. Ginny and Tom here. Miller take the east with your team. Dracka, Draco and Ry move on the north side. Spread out and see if you can pick up on any magic. Keep in contact."</p><p>"Yes, sir."</p><p>xXx</p><p>Harry jolted in pain and gasped.</p><p>"He's awake."</p><p>"String him up."</p><p>Hands were on his arms and he was pulled to his feet. He felt pain bolt through him as the Hallows burned in his blood faintly. He pulled against the people holding him, trying to struggle lose until a fist slammed into his side. He gasped as the breath was knocked out of him and he saw red.</p><p>"Struggle and we will kill you again!"</p><p>Harry went completely limp in their hands. Someone cursed to his left before he surged up taking the person by surprise. He smashed into the man with his shoulder, sending him stumbling back into the wall as he turned on the other man with a snarl. The man swung a fist at him but Harry ducked under his arm and called his sword to his hand. He rammed it into the other man with a yell.</p><p>Suddenly a cold hand grabbed the back of his neck and pulled him back before twisting him around. He was flung into the wall and his shoulder and head smashed into the cement wall. He cried out in pain as his sword clattered to the ground and his vision greyed out slightly.</p><p>"Kill him."</p><p>The gunshot deafened him as pain tore through his body and he slumped to the ground in a heap. Dark mists swirling around his thoughts, he didn't hear the second shot.</p><p>xXx</p><p>Ry watched the little gold griffin as it flew in front of them. They had been following it for the last three hours and Ry was starting to think that it was lost. It also didn't help that the streets were getting busier as morning started to settle in.</p><p>"This would be a lot easier if we could just use a tracking charm," Dracka muttered for the third time. "Is that bloody thing lost?"</p><p>Draco growled at him and Dracka raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"Well, Mr Malfoy?" Dracka questioned mildly. "Is it?"</p><p>xXx</p><p>Harry woke feeling groggy and heavy. Mists swirling around his thoughts as fire burned in his veins. The ground rocked under him as he curled up, he reached out to his link with Severus and picked it up. He had to help the man, since he couldn't help himself.</p><p>Pain came through the link and he pushed some of his magic down the line. His breath quickened and pain spiked in his chest but he kept pushing the magic along the link until he had to stop or pass out. He picked up the link with Ry but could feel the darkness gathering again and wasn't sure how long he could hold it.</p><p>xXx</p><p>Ry stumbled to a stop and Dracka ran into his back and wrapped his arms around him or the two men would have fallen.</p><p>"Dad," Ry gasped. "That way!"</p><p>They took off with Ry in the lead. Ry ran as fast as he could, while he still had the connection. Dracka on his heels as the Draco fell back. He ran blindly, he didn't need to know where he was going as he followed the thin link with his father. He knew it wouldn't hold.</p><p>"Watch out for the fucking cars!" Dracka yelled at him as he skipped around cars and people. "You can die, you know!"</p><p>Ry huffed a laugh as he pushed himself faster then, skidded to a stop. Dracka yelped as he slid into him and Ry grabbed his arm to stop them falling.</p><p>"Did it break?" Dracka huffed as Ry panted and fumbled with his phone.</p><p>"Kingsley!" Ry gasped. "Apparate to my badge."</p><p>Kingsley appeared next to them and looked at the two men as Ry released Dracka. The vampire just leered at him with a glint in his eye.</p><p>"That building," Ry stated with conviction.</p><p>"He picked up the link?" Kingsley said as he pulled his phone and threw down a marker for everyone to apparate to.</p><p>"Yes," Ry gasped. "It won't hold, I can already feel it getting fainter."</p><p>Dracka felt coldness in his stomach, that meant that Blake was close to dying. He growled and went to stalk towards the building when Ry grabbed his arm in a steel grip and he turned on him. Ry barred his teeth at him with glowing green eyes and Dracka settled.</p><p>"We'll take the back," Ry snapped.</p><p>"Move," Kingsley ordered at the same time.</p><p>Ry and Dracka took off.</p><p>xXx</p><p>Harry could feel himself slipping as the mists darkened his sight and the connection with Severus and Ry slipped from his fingers as his body went limp. He felt a hand grab his shoulder before giving him a push. He rolled limply onto his back as fingers were placed on his neck under his chin. He felt disconnected to everything around him except that fire in his blood.</p><p>"Dead?"</p><p>"Not yet."</p><p>"Do you have the wand?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"What about the other two parts?"</p><p>"We haven't seen any sign of them. They haven't appeared."</p><p>"What's that ring?"</p><p>Harry felt hands on his as the ring Severus gave him was pulled lose.</p><p>"Not that one, the other one."</p>
