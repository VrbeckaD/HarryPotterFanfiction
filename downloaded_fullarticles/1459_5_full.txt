<p></p><div class="storytext xcontrast_txt nocopy">
  <p>37-year-old Harry Potter sighed as he looked on at his eldest daughter, 17-year-old Lily Potter.</p>
  <p>She had mascara tracks running down her face as she took notes in her father's Defense Against the Dark Arts class, her lips trembling. Her (Harry now imagined 'ex') boyfriend, Scorpius Malfoy, was sitting next to another one of his female students who had hickeys peppering her neck. If Harry wasn't a Hogwarts Professor…suffice to say, Scorpius wouldn't have needed to worry about accidentally impregnating his new girlfriend.</p>
  <p>Harry took a moment to survey the rest of the class as they continued to copy what was on the board, not shocked at all to find the two gossip-queens of the school whispering about something. However, Harry had a ritual for instances such as these.</p>
  <p>He surreptitiously pointed his wand at them and whispered, 'Sonorous'.</p>
  <p>"He's so hot," the one on the left, Candice, whispered to Michelle. The rest of the class immediately stopped what they were doing and glanced back at the two girls in amusement.</p>
  <p>Michelle grinned at her and said, "He has three children, too. I'm sure he knows just what to do with his giant—"</p>
  <p>"Ladies!" Harry roared as the rest of the class laughed, knowing what the next word was going to be. Unfortunately, he also knew exactly who they had been talking about and tried not to let it show on his face. Only one male in all of Hogwarts had three children, and that was none other than himself.</p>
  <p>Candice and Michelle, realizing they had been sonoroused by their professor at some point in their conversation, promptly blushed profusely. Candice smiled flirtatiously at him anyway and said, "Sorry professor, we absolutely weren't talking about you."</p>
  <p>"Yeah," said Michelle nervously, not wishing to try her luck as much as her friend. "Why would we talk about our professor like that?"</p>
  <p>Harry arched an eyebrow at the pair and turned back to the board, intent on finishing the lesson. But the bell rang before he could get anything done, signaling the end of classes for the day.</p>
  <p>"Alright class, one foot on the Nundu due on Monday," he said as they filed out. He noticed his daughter rubbing her eyes as she slowly walked towards the door. "Have a good weekend! And could I ask Miss Potter to stay after class?"</p>
  <p>She hunched her shoulders as she stood still, letting the rest of the students file past her. As soon as the door was shut and they were the only two in the classroom, Lily turned around and faced him, her eyes downcast.</p>
  <p>Harry sighed and asked, "Lily, what happened?"</p>
  <p>"I don't want to talk about it," she said with a sniffle as she shifted to an even more defensive posture.</p>
  <p>It was moments like these that Harry wished Ginny hadn't left him for that younger bloke in Germany ten years ago. And just as it looked like Lily was going to leave the room without a further word, she whispered, "Am I not pretty enough?"</p>
  <p>She sounded heartbroken and vulnerable, the little girl that he had pushed on the swings countless times showing herself for a moment. He rarely got to see this side of her anymore and held each moment dear, though he would probably try and cast this one very far away. It pained him to see his daughter growing up so fast and already being subjected to the woes of adulthood. Harry walked up to his daughter and wrapped her in a hug, his heart breaking as she clutched the front of his robes and cried into them.</p>
  <p>"You're the most beautiful woman in the world, sweetheart," Harry said with sheer sincerity.</p>
  <p>Grown-up, angsty, teenage Lily would've said something like 'That's what parents are supposed to say. Nice try, dad.' But innocent, sweet, vulnerable Lily just asked, "More beautiful than mum?"</p>
  <p>Harry kissed the top of Lily's head and said, "Way more beautiful than your mother. Inner beauty is just as important as outer beauty, and you definitely beat her on both counts."</p>
  <p>"If it's not my looks," Lily muttered to herself with a thick voice. She was silent for a moment before asking, "D-do you think he cheated on me because I'm boring?"</p>
  <p>"Lily," said Harry strongly. "On top of your beauty you're both funny and vastly intelligent. I assure you that you are in no way boring."</p>
  <p>"Then what is it, dad?" Lily asked, her voice full of anguish. "Together for a year and he cheats on me for no reason?"</p>
  <p>Harry pondered this for a moment, truly wondering how Scorpius could've possibly cheated on his little princess. Harry hadn't lied to Lily at all—she truly was smart and funny and beautiful. She was about 5'5", had shiny dark-red hair pulled back into a ponytail, a fit body that wasn't lacking in the necessary area, long, pale legs, and a flawless face with gorgeous features and her father's emerald eyes accented by light make-up.</p>
  <p>Harry finally came to a possible solution and said, "Did you two ever have sex?"</p>
  <p>"Dad!" exclaimed Lily incredulously, looking up at him with wide eyes.</p>
  <p>Harry glanced at his daughter skeptically. "I know what sixteen and seventeen year-olds get up to, Lils. Did you two ever have sex?"</p>
  <p>Lily took a deep breath and looked away from her dad's face before mumbling, "Yes. But just once!"</p>
  <p>That gave Harry even more reason to gut Scorpius like a fish. He had deflowered his daughter and then proceeded to cheat on her! Something else caught his attention, though. "What do you mean, just once?"</p>
  <p>Lily, red in the face, said, "It was six months ago, in the summer. I was kind of hesitant, but he told me everything would be alright. He was rough, it hurt, and it didn't feel good. I was scared to do it with him again," she admitted.</p>
  <p>Harry, never one to lie to his children, said, "That may have very well been the reason."</p>
  <p>Lily's mouth fell open. "You're saying I should've just had sex with him whenever he wanted."</p>
  <p>"Of course not," said Harry, letting go of Lily and stepping back, needing room to pace as he always did when he was about to teach one of his children a life lesson. "If you didn't want to have sex and he truly liked or loved you, he wouldn't have given it a second thought and respected your wishes. This new girl must've been willing to have sex with him and he jumped at the chance. What I'm saying is, no matter how much you probably don't want to hear this, is that he only wanted to get in your pants. You didn't give it to him—as you very well shouldn't have; never change yourself for anybody—and he decided to move on."</p>
  <p>Lily looked at her dad with determination and self-confidence blazing in her eyes. "You're right. He's a vile piece of filth. I'm going to go teach him that you never mess with a Potter without regretting it."</p>
  <p>"Just make sure you don't do anything to get expelled!" Harry called after the retreating back of his daughter.</p>
  <p>Lily sighed as she sat in her room that night, tired after her long day of drama that had ended with Scorpius in the hospital wing, unwilling to tell anybody how a tattoo in the shape of a penis had ended up on his forehead. Or how he had ended up naked in the common room with a less-than-impressive erection. At least he felt the tiniest bit sorry if he didn't rat her out.</p>
  <p>But what Lily really couldn't get out of her mind was the feeling of her dad's body against hers as he had hugged her that day. Or how he had made her feel like she was the most amazing woman in the world as he complimented her. He had made her feel loved in her time of need, made her feel—if even the tiniest bit—wanted. And she couldn't deny what her classmates had pointed out earlier that day; her dad truly was hot.</p>
  <p>She found herself wondering if her dad really did have a giant cock. So she stripped him down in her head, delighting in the firm, unyielding muscles that were laid bare to her gaze. Her hand managed to find its way into her shirt to tease her stiffening nipples. He had that sexy smirk on his face as he removed his boxers, baring his no doubt larger-than-average, rigid cock to her. Her other hand slipped under the waistband of the boxers she liked to wear to bed, spreading her moist nether-lips. He began stroking his meat as she slipped two fingers into herself, simultaneously pressing her palm down on her clit.</p>
  <p>The sound of the dorm's door opening scared the crap out of her, shattering her vision. She hurriedly dried her fingers on her sheets as her heart pounded in her ribcage, and she scrambled for a book to hide what she had been doing. What would her friends think if they caught her masturbating to the mental image of her own dad masturbating?</p>
  <p>Then she scolded herself. There was no way they could know that she was masturbating to the thought of her own dad naked. Nevertheless, she was a pretty vocal masturbator and would rather avoid the awkwardness of accidentally saying his name in the process.</p>
  <p>But she could feel her pussy leaking onto her thighs, could feel the terrible, pleasurable heat radiating from her core and attempting to overwhelm her body as she fidgeted underneath the covers, the urge to touch herself almost unbearable.</p>
  <p>And that's when she decided that she'd need to fuck her dad. He was the only man who had ever made her this hot, had made the urge to have a thick cock filling her and stretching her out this unbearable. He understood her completely, and she knew she would never trust her second time with anyone else.</p>
  <p>So she carefully pulled her dad's cloak from under her mattress and threw it on before quietly slipping out of the room.</p>
  <p>The feeling of shame almost overpowered the feeling of how good it felt to stroke his throbbing cock to the image of him buried to the hilt in his daughter…almost. He had pondered her question about Scorpius long and hard and his own response, realizing that he really did think his daughter was unbelievably hot. He could imagine her pert, teenage C-cups bouncing as he impaled her again and again, her young face in an image of ecstasy as he showed her what a real man could do, and the feeling of her tight, slick quim greedily gripping his rigid pole.</p>
  <p>There was a knock on the door, causing Harry's hand to cease its movement. He reluctantly let go and threw on some clothes, making sure his aching erection was well-hidden before opening the door…to nothing. But his daughter's head suddenly appeared, the rest of her body invisible.</p>
  <p>"Dad, can I come in?" she asked innocently, too innocently for Harry's liking.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, he stepped aside and shut the door behind her, and when he turned his around his jaw almost dropped. Lily had dropped the cloak and was standing in the middle of his room dressed in nothing but a pair of boxers and a large T-shirt he recognized as one of his own.</p>
  <p>Somehow he managed to choke out, "What do you need?"</p>
  <p>Lily knew she would have to be subtle in her seduction of her dad; if she was too straightforward she would scare him off. So she put on her best somber expression and cast her eyes down to the floor. "I feel lonely. Can I sleep with you tonight?"</p>
  <p>Harry's pants tightened and he swallowed hard, wishing now that he really hadn't let her into the room. "I don't know, Lils," he said warily. "You're seventeen."</p>
  <p>"You're my dad," said Lily back, hands on her hips. "If I say I'm lonely it means I'm vulnerable, and if you deny me then my self-confidence will really plummet and I'll get depressed. So you're going to let me sleep in your bed without any complaints and you're going to like it, god dammit."</p>
  <p>Harry had to suppress his grin at the amount of fire his daughter showed. "You're right, Lily."</p>
  <p>"Of course I am," she huffed, sliding under his covers.</p>
  <p>When he got in—after a shake of his head at her antics, of course—beside her the first thing she noticed was how much space he was keeping between them. She scowled at the darkness and scooted back so her butt was pressing up against his hip. "Dad, I'm cold," she said quietly.</p>
  <p>Now, had Harry been thinking straight, he would've used a heating charm on her. However, he was not, and rolled over on his side so he was spooning his daughter, his arm wrapped around her stomach. "Better?" he asked.</p>
  <p>Lily could feel the length of his hardness nestled between her arse-cheeks and whispered, "Marvelous."</p>
  <p>"Good night, Lily. Love you," said Harry before giving her head a lingering kiss.</p>
  <p>"'Night, dad. Love you too," replied Lily.</p>
  <p>She squirmed in a fake attempt to get more comfortable, pressing her arse harder against his crotch in the process. She almost didn't catch the breath Harry sucked in at the feeling. She smirked into the pillow, knowing that miraculously, he seemed to be physically attracted to her.</p>
  <p>"Dad?" she whispered huskily.</p>
  <p>"Yes, Lily?" Harry asked.</p>
  <p>"If you were a teenager, would you fuck me?" she asked, a seductive edge to her voice.</p>
  <p>She felt his cock strain against her body and knew that no matter what he said next the true answer was yes.</p>
  <p>"Er…" was the eloquent response Harry came up with.</p>
  <p>"I mean, you said I was beautiful, right?" she asked, now subtly grinding against him, feeling her pussy moisten.</p>
  <p>"I did," breathed Harry, trying to hold back a moan. "I think…I think I would fuck you so hard you'd scream my name."</p>
  <p>"Really?" she asked flirtatiously, turning around and looking up at him through her lashes.</p>
  <p>"Really," said Harry, licking his lips as his eyes darkened with unsuppressed lust.</p>
  <p>"Would your cock fill me up?" she asked, her pussy clenching at the thought. "Would it stretch me out?"</p>
  <p>"There would be so much cock you wouldn't know what to do with it," Harry said huskily.</p>
  <p>By now Lily was panting, her nipples straining against the fabric of her shirt. "Dad…" was all she managed to say, her thoughts in disarray.</p>
  <p>Harry smirked at her. "Of course, this is all hypothetical."</p>
  <p>"Dad, stop teasing me," she whimpered, pressing the heel of her hand against his erection, making his breath leave him in a whoosh.</p>
  <p>"Oh my god, Lily," he moaned, gripping her smooth upper arms.</p>
  <p>"Do you want me?" she panted against his ear.</p>
  <p>He responded by crushing his lips against hers, causing her to moan and respond enthusiastically. Their tongues danced around each other's for a few seconds, teasing and coaxing. She pulled his shirt over his head as he did the same to her, exposing her firm breasts to his eager eyes.</p>
  <p>Harry's panting grew as he lit the candles in the room with his wand and cast the contraceptive charm on his daughter, unable to believe that he was going to be fucking her young, tight body any second now. They stripped completely, Harry's raging boner being exposed along with his daughter's bald pussy lips.</p>
  <p>The girls in Lily's class were right, her dad's cock was much larger than average. She wrapped her hand around it and began lightly stroking his shaft, delighting in the way his hips bucked at the contact. She pushed her dad back so he was sitting against the headboard and lowered her mouth on his throbbing cock, earning a grunt from him as she went all the way down on him, allowing him to penetrate her throat.</p>
  <p>"Fuck, Lils," panted Harry. "You suck cock like a pro."</p>
  <p>This was only the third time she had ever sucked anyone's cock and she blushed at the compliment as she began bobbing her head on his shaft, working him with her tongue. He gently grabbed her head and massaged her scalp as she looked up at him through her eyelashes, making sure she was still doing well.</p>
  <p>And Harry almost came undone at the sight of his daughter's mouth full of his dick. She would deepthroat him every once in a while, her throat gripping his cock as she focused on keeping it relaxed. She pulled her mouth off of him to catch her breath as she stroked him quickly, helping him fuck her soft hand.</p>
  <p>"Turn around, Lily," Harry commanded his daughter, grabbing her hips and pulling her soaking pussy to his mouth when she did so too slowly for his liking.</p>
  <p>He gave her lips a firm stroke with his tongue as she let his cock impale her throat again, her resulting moan sending jolts of pleasure through his shaft and balls. He teased her clit as her head bobbed on his rock-hard meat at a noticeably slower pace, her concentration broken.</p>
  <p>He wordlessly and wandlessly lubed his finger up before teasing his daughter's puckered anus, delighted as a small bit of her sweet cum shot into his mouth. She had pulled her mouth off his cock and was now stroking it distractedly as she grinded her pussy against his face, drool escaping her mouth and wetting her father's crown.</p>
  <p>"Dad…" she panted. "Need…cum…"</p>
  <p>Harry pushed his finger into his daughter's rear entrance, moaning against her pussy as he felt her anus clench around his finger.</p>
  <p>"Oh, Dad!" Lily screamed as she came hard, squirting her sweet nectar into Harry's mouth and all over his face as her hips bucked.</p>
  <p>His cock was twitching in her hand as she continued to stroke it. She used her soft hand to gently play with his balls as she lowered her mouth back on him, his hips thrusting up into her as she continued to bob on his shaft. Now he was the one lazily licking her pussy as he moaned against it, fucking his daughter's throat.</p>
  <p>"Lily," he mumbled against her core. "I'm gonna come."</p>
  <p>Lily lowered her mouth halfway down on him and stroked the remaining bit of his shaft hard and fast, drawing a loud moan from him. His cum rocketed through his shaft and exploded into her waiting mouth, stream after stream of the hot, sticky liquid shooting down her throat. A small, leftover bit of her own cum was expelled from her body as her pussy clenched hard, and Harry moaned as he tasted his daughter again.</p>
  <p>Lily swallowed quickly, trying to get every last drop, but couldn't quite handle it all. It dribbled down her chin and threatened to drip off, so she quickly sat up and caught it with her finger as she continued to stroke her father's cock. It gave a twitch and shot out one last sticky rope of cum that hit her square on the chest, right between her breasts.</p>
  <p>He was still rock hard, how Lily didn't know and she gaped at it as Harry gently pushed her off his face and said, "Fuck, Lils. That's the hardest I've come in years."</p>
  <p>Lily grinned at him seductively and said, "My pleasure."</p>
  <p>"How's your pussy?" Harry asked.</p>
  <p>"Pretty sensitive," Lily replied, rubbing it absentmindedly.</p>
  <p>"Alrighty then," said Harry, grabbing her hips and gently turning her over. "I still have quite a bit of cum left. You want your arse full of it?"</p>
  <p>"Oh god, Dad. Please," she moaned, pressing her firm arse against his lower stomach.</p>
  <p>Harry lubed his cock with a spell again and gently pushed against his daughter's anus, delighting in her moan. She started panting as his crown stretched her out and slipped in before he slowly pushed into her body until he was buried to the hilt. She gently rubbed her clit in circles as her dad grabbed her hips and began slowly fucking her, the ridges and bumps on his cock sending waves of pleasure radiating from her core. One of his hands snaked around her and gently tweaked her nipple, causing her arse to squeeze his cock.</p>
  <p>He began fucking her hard and fast, the sound of slapping skin filling the room as their bodies met. Lily was moaning into the pillow she was clutching with one hand as the other worked her clit, her pussy clenching rhythmically along with each of her father's thrusts into her tight body.</p>
  <p>Harry was grunting and panting as he looked at his daughter's elegant and sweaty back while fucking her, the feel of her anus clenching with each of his thrusts driving him wild.</p>
  <p>"Dad," she moaned loudly, sending a shiver down his spine. "Your cock…it feels…so GOOD! Fuck me!"</p>
  <p>Harry moaned as he slammed into his daughter one more time, his hips twitching with the first shot of his hot cum into her body. He pulled out and stroked his cock as he came, his hand squeezing his daughter's hip in time with his cum shooting from his tip to hit his daughter's upper back and shoulder blades.</p>
  <p>Lily hadn't come, and as she felt her dad's hot, sticky seed hitting her back she whimpered out of frustration. She had been so close!</p>
  <p>She sat up and turned around to look at her dad with almost feral eyes. She noticed that his cock was (miraculously) still hard—it must've been quite a while since he had come before this—and licked her lips before pinning him down on the bed, holding his arms against the mattress.</p>
  <p>She gave him a short, yet incredibly hot, kiss, before relaxing back and letting herself slam down onto his raging erection, the feeling of him stretching her out making her moan. She rode his cock hard and fast, moaning and panting as he repeatedly filled her up.</p>
  <p>He was gripping her hips, helping her ride him, immensely enjoying the view of her firm tits bouncing as she fucked him senseless, her tight pussy gripping his cock like a glove.</p>
  <p>"Fuck, Lils," panted Harry. "You're doing great. Keep it up."</p>
  <p>"Shut up…" she panted, "…and fill me with your cum already."</p>
  <p>Harry groaned and his cock twitched. He just barely managed to hold back his orgasm, panting as his daughter continued to bounce on him.</p>
  <p>"Come for me, Lils!" cried Harry. "I need you to come for me!"</p>
  <p>She grunted and slammed herself down on him, crying out as her orgasm tore through her. The intensity of it hit her full force, and she felt her pussy walls convulsively gripping her dad's cock as she did her best to continue to ride him. She eventually gave up and let him fuck her, only having enough concentration to stay upright as her glistening cum shot all over her dad's dick and balls.</p>
  <p>Harry was gasping as he slammed into his daughter's tight pussy, his balls tightening at the sight of her head thrown back and her tits thrust out as she came hard, her pussy gripping him like a vice. He pumped into her tight, slick sheath twice more before shooting his load deep into her young, eager body, his hot, ropy cum filling her completely.</p>
  <p>Her convulsing pussy milked every last drop from him and she collapsed on top of him, her firm, delicious tits pressing against his chest.</p>
  <p>"Dad," she moaned into his neck and he felt his cock stir again, doing its best to stand to attention. "I can't…I can't move."</p>
  <p>Harry's cock instantly gave up, glad for the excuse to stay limp. He flipped them over, his flaccid cock still inside her, before pulling out and watching a mixture of their cum run down to her asscrack and pool on the sheets.</p>
  <p>He non-verbally casted a cleaning charm so they didn't wake up to the sticky mess and turned off the lights before spooning his naked daughter and pulling the blankets over them.</p>
  <p>"Love you, dad…thanks," said Lily quietly, sleep already threatening to overcome her.</p>
  <p>"Love you too, Lils," said Harry, kissing her naked shoulder. "Anytime."</p>
  <p>"Tomorrow," Lily mumbled, snuggling further into his warmth.</p>
  <p>"Tomorrow," Harry agreed, glad that it was going to be a Saturday.</p>
