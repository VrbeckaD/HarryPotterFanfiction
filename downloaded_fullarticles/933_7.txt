    <p>"They think I did it, they think I killed one of theirs." Harry put his head in his hands.</p><p>"I don't know what to do Ginny." </p><p>Ginny looked at him, worry and sympathy on her face. "I know you didn't kill Derek. They don't know that. Isn't one of them in your class?" </p><p>Harry nodded. "Yeah, her name is Annabeth. She's one of Scott's. What do you suggest I do?"</p><p>Ginny sat opposite him at their dining room table in Surrey. Their daughter, Lily Luna had just gone to bed, unaware of the dangers her father was facing. It was about nine in the evening. Harry was shaking a little. He knew about how werewolves got revenge. It wasn't a happy ending. </p><p>Ginny thought for a moment. "arrange a meeting with the alpha. With Scott. Tell them. Convince them, it wasn't you. You have to tell them Harry. The rest of the pack won't stop hunting you until you give proof." </p><p>"How?" Harry shouted angrily. "How am I supposed to give proof? Derek was already dead when I got there. I was trying to save him!"</p><p>He zoned out, remembering.....</p><p> ________________________</p><p>Werewolves and wizards have been at war for months now. Harry and the Weasleys had to earn Scotts and the rest of his packs trust. It was difficult. But they managed it. Harry and the McCall pack had become allies. </p><p>One night, one Harry  could remember oh so clearly, The night he found Derek dead in the darkness of the barn that he and Harry were hiding in to ambush some enemies. the night he found Derek with the knife in his chest that went in deep. He had been  firing his wand hoping to hit the running target with multiple spells, appalled and filled with grief. He stopped, and pulled it out. Poor timing, Scott and his pack came in just as Harry pulled out the silver knife. </p><p>Scott eyed glowed red as blood, Harry looked into the eyes of the alpha, and his blood ran cold.</p><p>"Scott." Harry said. "Let me explain." </p><p>Scott's once friendly eyes turned sinister. "I'm giving you five seconds to run." He said in a low, dangerous voice. His girlfriend, Malia had already shifted her brown eyes glowed blue, that of a werecoyote. </p><p>Harry disapperated. He went back to the Weasley house were everyone was waiting in the dining room. When they saw Harry covered in blood, they knew something went wrong. Ron and Hermione. His best friends. As well as his wife. Comforted him all through the night. No longer allies with the McCall pack. He gripped the table he was leaning against and screamed in frustration. </p><p> </p><p> </p>
