  <em>
    <span>“Angel duck!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Duck?”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Goose!”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Before he can figure out whether or not he wants to laugh at his sister’s incredibly stupid but impeccably timed joke, Angel is skidding across the floor and landing in a not so graceful heap against the wall.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ouch.” He says.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry!” Karen says, jogging over and not looking sorry at all, “Overshot it I guess.” She shrugs with a grin. Definitely not sorry then.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>His better sister, y’know the one who </span>
  <em>
    <span>doesn’t </span>
  </em>
  <span>slam into him using brute force (sometimes), offers him a hand that yanks him up quickly, “I mean she was right there,” Nina says, brushing off imaginary dirt from his shoulders, “Maybe your observation skills need more work than your combat skills.” She muses with a poorly concealed smile.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Angel narrows his eyes at the both of them. Damn, maybe he doesn’t have a better sister. The only two that he has apparently like to throw him across rooms and laugh about it. Maybe he should get Cozmo to wear that dumpster wig from last halloween and make him his new sister. </span>
  <em>
    <span>He</span>
  </em>
  <span> probably wouldn’t throw his brother into walls and then laugh. Yeah. Good plan.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“You distracted me with the whole duck thing,” Angel says walking over to where his water bottle is placed, “Why the hell would you say duck? Just say move.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Literally the same thing but alright.” Nina states, stretching her arms back.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s okay if you’re getting a little rusty dude,” Karen says bouncing over to him to claim the water bottle beside his, “You know when people get older, they say that eyesight is the first thing to go.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re six months older than me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Details.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Angel snorts as he takes a swig of his water, “Also, I’m like, eighty-two percent sure you cheated just now,” He sends a pointed look at her hands, “Pretty sure disillusion charms aren’t allowed during PT.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Karen scoffs in annoyance, “That’s such bullshit! I worked hard trying to get that spell down, you know how much I was struggling. Why can’t I use it during combat?”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because those kind of spells are used for simulation and strategy practice Karen, there’s a time and place for it.” Nina says while continuing her stretching, “You know that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, but I had a good reason for it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Nina raises an eyebrow, “Yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“I really wanted to win.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Nina nods solemnly, “Understandable.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh no,” Angel cuts in glaring at both girls, because honestly </span>
  <em>
    <span>what the fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span>, “Not understandable. I got slammed into a wall because Karen decided to break a rule that she definitely knew she was breaking. Karen loses, I win by default.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s lame.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah don’t be a sore loser Angel.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not a- wha- you threw me into a fucking wall!” Angel exclaims, gesturing to Karen wildly.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Man you’re really hung up on that wall part.” Nina hums.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” The boy says clutching his bottle and heading towards the door, “I’m gonna go to my room and pretend that the last fifteen minutes didn’t actually happen, and that I actually have sisters that don’t throw me into walls because they cheat in combat.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“What a boring scenario.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Goodbye!” Angel calls before exiting out of the gym’s double doors.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Heaving a heavy sigh, the boy begins the never ending trek down the compound hallways, feet moving on autopilot. He remembers a time where these hallways seemed like endless loops, incredibly confusing to his four-year-old brain. He was a different person then. Not quite Angel but not really his original self. Caught in the middle of feeling grateful for being rescued from his old living situation, and angry at the whole world by default.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Angel only has a few memories left from those times when he was first brought to the compound, and none of them particularly vivid. He remembers things like snapshots; his first time eating with his new siblings, his first time meditating with them, his first time being named.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“You look like an Angel y’know,” Karen said, spilling juice everywhere in her attempt to talk and drink at the same time, “Did you know that’s a boy’s name? Well sometimes.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>And Angel, only four and with no memory of ever being called anything other than ‘kid’ or ‘bastard’, had thought it was the greatest name he had ever heard.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>So suddenly he was Angel, a boy with seven loud siblings, a soft bed to sleep in, a never ending supply of food, and a brand new label to live with.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Obscurial.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course he knew he was never a regular wizard to begin with, he’s known that since he was little and first felt that rushing dark sensation in his veins. He just never really had a name for it until Doctor DaBora came to his broken down foster house, sat him down on the old moth eaten couch that he was never allowed to sit on, and offered him a better alternative.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>At the time he wasn’t too worried about being an Obscurial. To be fair, he still wasn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>entirely</span>
  </em>
  <span> sure what it meant. He just knew that he was one, and so was Doctor DaBora, and so was almost everyone at her compound. But the Doctor was offering him a place to stay, and she hadn’t tried to hit him not one time during the whole conversation. So he said ok.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Now that he’s older he knows better. Knows the difference between being a regular wizard and being an Obscurial. Knows that just saying that word can still a conversation and make people go ridgid with fear. But he also knows that there’s a lot of misconceptions surrounding it, and that he and his siblings are some of the </span>
  <em>
    <span>least </span>
  </em>
  <span>threatening people that this world has to offer. So if his shitty childhood has taught him anything, it’s that he’d be damned before he lets bad people make him feel like a monster.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Angel comes to a stop before looking around for the source of the voice, “Brick?”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shush shu shu shuh,” The voice hushes quickly, “They can’t know I’m up here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Yeah definitely Brick, “Are you in the vents again? Coach is gonna kill you.” Angel says leaning his head back, “Who’re hiding from?”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Coach is in a meeting with the Doc, she’ll be occupied for a while,” There’s a shift from above him, “I put shaving cream in Cozmo’s pillowcase, like a lot of it, and I’m chilling up here ‘cause I know he’s gonna kick my ass.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know you’re going to have to see him later anyway right?” Angel asks, crossing his arms, “We have training at six.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>The sound of an elbow hitting metal echoes through the hallway. “Shit, I forgot.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Angel snorts, “We literally do it everyday.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up I was distracted! Hey are you going to the kitchen?”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“No I was heading up to my room, sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aw I was gonna ask you to grab me some chips while you’re out in the open,” Brick says, “But it’s chill. My body can withstand the test of hunger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Angel raises an eyebrow that he knows won’t be seen by the other boy, “What are you going to do when you have to pee?”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let nature take its course. Duh.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gross,” Angel states unfurling from his stance and continuing down the hallway, “See you at six.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bye Angel!” Brick yells, seemingly forgetting about his situation, “Aw shit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Before he makes it past the doorway that leads into the communal living room, the last thing Angel hears is a very loud </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Found you bitch!” </span>
  </em>
  <span>followed by muffled screeches.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p>
  <span>It’s easy to forget just how big the compound really is. Once when he was younger, he would curl up in the safest corner he could find, put his head between his knees, and pretend that he was in a sealed up box. Not afraid of the open space but of the many angles that someone could come at him from.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>He remembers when his brother Homer had the same kind of problem. He wouldn’t find a corner though, he would hide under the bed they all shared when they were younger and wrap himself up in every blanket available, convinced that the cloth would protect him from harm. It took them a long time to get him to come out when he got like that, but he always eventually came out. It was around that time that Angel and his siblings really started to learn how to lean on each other.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>He stopped once again on his journey to his room when he spotted his remaining three brothers seated around the coffee table in the living room, “What are you guys doing?”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Three heads whipped up to look at him, “You know how Doctor Finkler is giving out extra credit for an extra curricular assignment of our choice?” Po asks, shuffling cards around, “Well I’ve decided to use my natural talent and give tarot reading a try.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s really bad at it.” Homer states.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay hater, you’re getting a free card reading </span>
  <em>
    <span>and </span>
  </em>
  <span>a free palm reading so keep talking shit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Issac, who is probably the biggest instigator Angel has ever met, cackles, “It’s ok Po, you’re doing great. Tell Angel what you saw in my cards.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Po pulls a face, “I don’t wanna.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“He said,” Issac laughs, dodging Po’s fist, “He said “be careful with future romantic endeavors” and I was like, with who?”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Homer laughed too, “And then he was like-”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up!”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“This man really said-”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Angel!” Po says, grabbing the boy’s wrist and pulling him down, “I’ve just decided that you’re my new favorite brother and you should totally let me read your cards.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow okay, fuck you.” Issac says.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Angel shrugs as he situates himself on the carpeted floor, “Sure, just don’t like, predict my death or anything. I want it to be a surprise.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Po snorts, “No promises.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Angel watches as his brother shuffles the deck once more, and his brain starts thinking about names again. Po and Nina are the only ones in the family who had a birth name to keep. Angel supposes it’s because they’re the only ones that Doctor DeBorah found still living with their birth parents. He remembers asking them once why they kept their old names instead of making new ones. Nina said she wanted her old self to be her better self. Po didn’t answer. Angel still wonders why.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>The boy lays out his freshly shuffled card deck on the table and starts drawing cards. He lays them flat against the tabletop in straight neat rows before looking back up at Angel, “Alright flip ‘em.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Angel does. There’s a Ten of Swords, Nine of Swords, The Moon, Ace of Cups, and Death.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey,” Angel says, narrowing his eyes at the cards, “I thought I said no death.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“No no no no wait, maybe this is a good thing,” Issac says squinting at the cards, “See all this water? Maybe it’s saying you’re gonna drown in pussy. And then die.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow, amazing.” Angel says drily.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Death doesn’t actually mean death anyways,” Po states, fingering through his reference book, “It just means like, death of a phase or whatever.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Homer laughs, “Is that your professional opinion?”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why is this one upside down?” Angel asks, pointing to The Moon.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Po looks at where Angel is pointing and lights up, “Oh! That means like, release of fear and stuff, and uh,” He flips through his book again, “Repressed emotion.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“So what’s it all mean then?” Homer asks.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Po sets his book down and peers at the cards once more. After a minute or so he looks back up at Angel with a smirk, “Are you ready for my official prognosis?”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Angel rolls his eyes, “Lay it on me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay so,” Po says pointing to the first card in line. Ten of Swords. “This is your past. It basically just means that something big and crazy hit you in the past and kinda effed you up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, it’s called foster care.” Angel says.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Facts.” Says Issac.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“This one,” Po continues, “Is your present. And like I said, death doesn’t just mean death, it’s just the end of a situation.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Angel just nods.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right here is your future, which is just that release of fear stuff,” Po says before tapping on the next two cards, “And these are your reasoning and potential.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“That one’s upside down too.” Angel points out.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, so that basically just means that the reasoning for all of this is because of your inner turmoil and deep-seated fears.” Po says.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you psychoanalyzing me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“No the cards are,” Po grins and taps on the last card, “This one is your potential like I said. It just means you’ll let go of baggage and start living your best life,” He says waving a hand in the air, “It can also represent a miracle.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“So basically,” Issac says, leaning back against the couch, “Because Angel had a messed up childhood, he’s finally gonna go through his emo phase and release all of his negative energy by letting go of his past and becoming a nun.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Homer hums thoughtfully, “I’d watch that movie.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I’ll keep you guys updated,” Angel says, rising from his seat on the floor and walking toward the stairs.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please do!” Homer calls, “Alright Po, my turn. I’d also like to drown in pussy, please and thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Angel huffs out a laugh before trekking up the staircase leading to the bedrooms.</span>
</p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t exactly expect the upstairs living quarters to be occupied, so when he reaches the top and sees Doctor DaBora, perched on a chair with her ankles crossed, he’s surprised. </span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t often that anyone but him and his siblings were found upstairs in the bedrooms. Doctor DaBora had always had a very unconventional way of raising them. They could basically say what they want, do what they want, and ask whatever is on their minds, so long as they did their school work and did well in training. This turned out to be a win win situation for everyone, since the children loved being allowed independence, and in turn, excelled in everything they were expected to do.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>Angel knew that he and his siblings were allowed certain liberties that other children did not. After all, not many children were allowed to name themselves. One of the biggest advantages they had was having the upstairs rooms to themselves. Doctor DaBora was very firm on her belief that he and his siblings needed an area away from the rest of the compound that only they could enter. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Personal space</span>
  </em>
  <span>, she had said, </span>
  <em>
    <span>I would never seek you out if you didn’t want to be found.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>So if Doctor DaBora is up here, breaking her own rules, something’s up.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello Angel.” She says in that beautiful raspy voice of hers, “Will you sit down?”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>He does. He sits in the chair closest to hers and searches for anything in her expression that could clue him in to what this conversation is about. Like every time, he finds nothing. “Is something wrong Doctor?”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>The Doctor’s smile is faint but fond, “Not exactly. I suppose it all depends on how you take this news.” She hums.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>

  <span>Angel used to think the Doctor was part of the Divine. Everything about her, since the first time he met her, has always been so graceful and unyielding. He used to think that it was only because he was young, and she was the first kind person he met, but even now, nearing the age of sixteen, Angel knows that it’s just her.</span>

  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s heard lots of stereotypes about Obscurials being ugly monsters with no real defining features or personality, and thinks that Doctor DaBora, with her stunning beauty and all encompassing spirit, proves all of those rumors wrong.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>“What is it?” He asks.</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>In a slow deliberate movement, the Doctor pulls an already opened envelope from the inside of her robes, “I have no reason to put this off any further,” She presses the envelope into his awaiting hand, “Take a look.”</span>
</p><p>
  <strong>
    <strong> </strong>
  </strong>
</p><p>
  <span>With one last curious glance in her direction, Angel pulls the letter out of the envelope and begins to unfurl it. The first thing he sees is three names, then their birthdates, some numbers, and then his eyes trail up to the big bold letters on the top of the page.</span>

  <span>Angel stiffens and his eyes bypass the rest of the words on the document to settle on the last few lines.</span>
