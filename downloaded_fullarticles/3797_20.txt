Please Mr. Potter sit we have a lot to discuss." walking towards the chair and his brother said brother stood up and hugged him.</p><p>"Brother! It's so nice to see you again." Harry said as he sat down next to his older brother. Men and women swoon over him, but how could anyone not. Standing at 6'2 with black hair, piercing red eyes, sharp check bones. He was wearing dark gray robs with black dragon hide boots, a dark green dragon hide wand holster was strapped around his bicep. This man was his family and his name alone have people fear him. His name is Thomas Marvolo Riddle all so known as The Dark Lord Voldemort.</p><p>Tom smiled at Malik and pulled out a small box and handed it to his little brother. "It's nice to see you to little brother don't open tell you get back, how's School?" Malik scoffed and and folded his arms over his chest. "It's a joke, the old man is still on my case about trying to 'defeat you' honestly if he wanted a hero he should be trying to end this war himself and to stop involving kids. I can't wait to graduate tomorrow so I can go to New York with Draco and someone our American friends." Malik said; Tom just smiles and turns back to BloodFang looking amused but then frowned when he turned back towed Bloodfang who had a serious and worried look on the Goblins face.</p><p>"Bloodfang what is, it what's wrong?" Asked Malik worriedly "It would seam Mr. Potter that Dumbledore has been writing up a marriage contract between you and one Miss. Ginny Weasley. Your godfathers Remus Lupin and Sirius Black have been trying to stop him but there was nothing they could do." As he said that the room got darker and colder as the shadows in the room started to move slowly. Shadowy hands were reaching out of the ground trying to crawl out, Malik's eyes were now pitch black his skin was going to a even more pale color. Tom bolted out of his chair and was now kneeling in front of Malik.</p><p>"Malik (A/n: Mal for short) calm down please, we don't need to release the dead." Tom said in a calming voice, but Malik wasn't listening and the shadowy hands became more skeleton. About ten minutes of Tom trying to calm down his brother the room was now in a disarray the chairs were floating in the air skeleton soldiers were now standing around Bloodfang's desk. The door reopens and two people came walking in looking around the room in shock. Tom and Malik look up to see the door open and his two godfathers walked in, Malik calmed down as he saw them ordering the shadows back. Once calmed down Mal raced to Sirius and wrapped his arms around his waist.</p><p>"Don't make me marry her Siri. She's my sister in all but blood it'll be wired." As he said this said red head comes rushing in. "Malik, oh thank Merlin your ok." She said hugging him, Fred and George came in right behind her right behind her along with Bill, Charlie, Neville, Luna and Draco and they were all smiling at him. "Oh pup you won't have to do you know why?" Mal shook his head "Your creature inheritance, remember when we had your purge in 5th year, your shadow Demon felt the marriage bind starting to wrap around you. Kieran your demon half may have sensed it forming and snapped it." Said Sirius</p><p>"Demons or any other creature for that matter have predestine mates. When you find your's Malik and trust me you will; you'll go through your first heating cycle your Dom will go feral and said Dom will take you to a separate room and well they'll fuck you in a sense." Said Remus with a sheepish smile. Malik sighed and rested his head on his older brothers shoulders.</p><p>Tom smiled and ran his fingers threw Malik's black hair. He looked up and asked "What now? There is now way Albus and the golden duo are going to let Harry and Draco leave the country." Ginny cleared her throat everyone looked towards the red head. "I think a certain metal band might be able to help with that." Malik sat straight up and grinned as did Draco, Fred and George; "Ginny Weasley you are a bloody genius!" Exclaimed Malik.</p><p>"Um what are you guys talking about?" asked Tom "BloodFang can you send letter to Morgan and Beck BlackWest and one for Enos Atlas." "Of course." Said BloodFang getting up and walking out the door. Everyone but Draco, Malik, Luna and the twins looked confused. About five minutes latter three people walked in behind BloodFang. "Tom, Remus, Sirius, Bill and Neville I would like you to meet Moragan and Beck or as we like to call them The BlackWest Twins, and Enos Atlas."</p><p>The twins both had tan skin with matching high cheek bones and dimples. They were both wearing white tank-tops black skinny jeans and a black leather jackets. They were so identical that you couldn't even tell them apart, well almost. Artemis and long black hair, with forest green eyes and freckles, while Pluto had navy blue hair with icy blue eyes and freckles. "Hi I'm Moragan, and this is my brother Beck ." Said the black haired girl as she pointed to her twin who in which said twin waved.</p><p>Now Enos was was a little different.
