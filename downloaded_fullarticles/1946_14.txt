    <p>Before he knew it, it was morning. He blinked at the sun shining through his window, a bit surprised, as he was completely unsure as to when he fell asleep, and surprise to find that he was not sleeping alone. In front of him was a splash of red hair, bright and distracting; behind him was… someone holding him, someone male, if only judging by what was pressing against him. He didn’t dare move, afraid that he would wake them up, unwilling to let go of the bliss of last night. And it was a wonderful night –</p>
<p>Behind him, Draco shifted in his sleep, pushing himself up against Harry. What a strange experience. What a bizarre, unexpected, wonderful experience. He wondered if Draco and Ginny would mind if he asked them to stay here forever. He never wanted to leave this bed. He never wanted to exist in a world where he wasn’t in Draco’s embrace, where he couldn’t smell Ginny’s hair, where their warm, bare bodies pressed against him from both sides.</p>
<p>Draco groaned, a deep, guttural sound that did things to Harry he couldn’t quite express. Then, he nuzzled against Harry in a way that seemed deliberate, almost as if…</p>
<p>“You awake?” Harry whispered.</p>
<p>With his nose rubbing against his neck, Harry could tell that Draco was shaking his head. “No,” he murmured, and pressed a kiss against Harry’s back. “Never.”</p>
<p>“Will you keep it down?” Ginny hissed. “<em>Some</em> of us are trying to sleep here.”</p>
<p>Harry mimicked Draco and pressed a kiss to the back of the neck. “Sorry,” he said, right by her ear. She squirmed, which was less than ideal, because he was remembering the way she felt against him last night –</p>
<p>“Don’t get too excited there,” Ginny said, raising her voice a little. “I haven’t even brushed my teeth yet.”</p>
<p>“Are we getting out of bed, then?” Draco asked. “Because I’m entirely unprepared for that.”</p>
<p>Ginny laughed, a sound that never failed to bring a smile to Harry’s face. “I’m going to wash a little,” she said anyway. “I’ll be right back.”</p>
<p>She slipped out of Harry’s embrace, and he made a small sound of shock at the sudden lack of warmth against him. He watched her as she walked into the adjacent bathroom. Her body was gorgeous, the athletic body that comes with her job as a professional Quidditch player, and as much as it pained him, he did love to watch her go.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” Draco murmured. “I’m still here.”</p>
<p>Harry wriggled, struggling to turn around to face him. Draco relented, loosening his grip on Harry just a bit. When he was finally facing him, he kissed him, long and deep. Draco had just a bit of stubble, which, although rough on his skin, was surprisingly pleasant to kiss. He couldn’t believe he’d wasted his youth hating this man. Well, he could. But he was very glad they did not hate each other anymore.</p>
<p>“Having fun, are you?” Ginny said sarcastically from behind Harry.</p>
<p>He flashed a shy grin in her direction. “You could always join us, you know.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I plan to,” she said brightly, “but first – “ She hesitated. “Don’t you think we should… talk? About last night?”</p>
<p>Harry groaned. “I guess we should,” he agreed,” I just wished we needn’t.”</p>
<p>He disentangled himself from Draco embrace and sat up in the bed. “Are you at least going to sit down?” <em>Not that I mind if you stay up, as long as I can watch you</em>, he thought. Maybe in private he would’ve said that. Ginny and him had been together a long time, and were very comfortable with each other. But Draco… he was definitely attracted to him, but it was new, very new, and he didn’t want to risk making him uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Ginny did decide to sit, but at the edge of the bed, far too far away from Harry for his tastes. He didn’t complain.</p>
<p>“Last night…” she began.</p>
<p>“Was incredible,” Draco finished, sitting up as well. “Maybe the best night in my life.”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?” Harry said. He took Draco’s hand. “In all 25 years of your life?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Draco said adamantly.</p>
<p>“Me too,” Harry admitted.</p>
<p>They both looked at Ginny expectantly. She sighed. “Yeah, fine, me too.”</p>
<p>“I never, in my wildest dreams – “ Harry started. He took a deep breath. “Honestly, this is far better than anything I could’ve thought possible. I…” He trailed off, hoping his meaning was clear nonetheless.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Ginny said, pulling her feet under her.</p>
<p>“So…” Draco said. “What now?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Draco wished he wasn’t the one who asked the question, because now it felt somewhat like his responsibility. He loved being with Harry; he liked Ginny. He knew Harry loved her, and would probably keep loving her, and he didn’t really mind sharing. <em>Is that what’s going to happen now? Are we going to share?</em></p>
<p>“I would like to,” Harry said shyly, and only then did Draco realize he had said the last part out loud. “In fact… I would love to.”</p>
<p>Draco felt himself smile. He looked over Harry, appreciating his naked form, at least from the waist up. Harry may not play Quidditch that often anymore, but he still had a Seeker’s build, tall and lean. His hair was an even worse mess than it usually was, a truly horrifying case of bed hair, and Draco could only just barely stop himself from leaning over and running his hands through it.</p>
<p>“I…” Draco said, and stopped himself. He didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>“Are we doing this?” Ginny said.</p>
<p>“I think so.” Harry’s smile dazzled him. Harry took the hand that wasn’t busy holding Draco’s and reached for Ginny. “Come here.”</p>
<p>Ginny did, this time seating herself between Draco and Harry, who stopped holding hands in order to let her in. Then, she reached out to both of them. Draco took her hand immediately, and so did Harry.</p>
<p>“I’ll admit that I’m a bit jealous,” Draco said. “The two of you already live together.”</p>
<p>“Well…” Ginny said. “You could always move in.”</p>
<p>“We only just had one night, Ginny,” Harry said. “He doesn’t have to be ready to move in if he doesn’t want to.”</p>
<p>“But I do,” Draco said. “And yet, also, you’re right. It’s so early.”</p>
<p>Ginny pondered this for a moment. “What about a drawer?” she said. “That way, you can stay, or not stay. It’ll be your choice every night.”</p>
<p>“I like it,” Harry said. He looked at Draco, and Draco could’ve sworn that they were a brighter green this morning than they had ever been before. “Draco? What do you think?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Yes,” Draco amended. “I would love to.”</p>
<p>“And a toothbrush,” Ginny added. “Don’t forget the toothbrush.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Draco said, and then he leaned in to kiss her, a light kiss than only lasted a few seconds. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome,” she said breathily. Suddenly, she looked… hungry. “Kiss me again.”</p>
<p>Draco obliged.</p>
