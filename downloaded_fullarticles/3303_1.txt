          <div class="userstuff"><p>He isn't going to. He knows what they'll say. And he deserves it. Every bit. </p>
<p>He isn't going to. Pansy won't be there, or Blaise or Greg .... or Vince. </p>
<p>He isn't going to. What's the point. Even if he gets his N.E.W.T.S, who's going to hire a tattood fuckup with Malfoy for a last name?</p>
<p>He isn't going to ... no matter how much he longs for the normality, for the chance at a do over, for the one place where he'd felt like his father's eyes weren't watching his every move. Hogwarts won't be the same. It can't be. Can it?</p>
<p>He isn't going to. Even if he has his wand back now, after Potter owled it to him. Even if his thank you note somehow ended up in a dozen letters between the two of them. Even if they'd started out light and somehow his latest one had mentioned the fact that certain creaks in the hall or smells in the corridor transported him straight back to the occupation. </p>
<p>He isn't going to ... until he unfolds the parchment to see the familar untidy scrawl. </p>
<p>
  <i>Are you coming back to Hogwarts?</i>
