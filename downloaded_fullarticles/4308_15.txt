  <span>It Happened One Midsummer Night </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>She sat there in the library of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, trying her hardest to pay attention to the words on the pages of one her favorite plays, but her mind wandered elsewhere. It had been two months since the Final Battle—where her best friend had been victorious over Lord Voldemort—and since then, she felt restless. Since age eleven, she had thwarted every single obstacle that had come at her. Whether it was Dementors, trolls, or Death Eaters, she always had a strategy of getting her and her friends out of the toughest of situations. “The Brightest Witch of Her Age,” they called her. And damn, did she try to live up to that name. Even in the midst of impending doom, she managed to stay ahead in her school work. As it turns out, the older she got, the more she realized that her excessive studying was just a distraction from the evils of the wizarding world. But now that those evils have been vanquished, the drive to complete her studies felt so trivial. Hermione Granger, for the first time in recent memory, felt useless.</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite her feelings, she decided to return to Hogwarts to complete her seventh year. Unlike her two best friends, who were rushed into Auror training not 24 hours after Voldemort’s defeat. Hermione wondered if maybe she spent her time figuring out how make a difference in the world by herself, instead of as a part of the Golden Trio, maybe she could finally rid herself of that useless feeling. And the place she felt that she could accomplish that is the one place that she considered her home. She still planned on taking her NEWTS, so she wasn't completely letting go of her studious endeavors, but would it be so wrong for others to see her for her who she was and not just "the brains"? </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>She needed a distraction, to occupy herself from the onslaught of negative thoughts, and Shakespeare always provided that for her. Ever since she was a little girl—even before she knew she was a witch—the stories of Shakespeare were her only escape from her seemingly mundane life.  </span>
  <em>
    <span>If only one could Occlude against their own thoughts…</span>
  </em>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Just as she was about to continue getting lost in the words of the Bard, she heard the pounding of feet coming from the staircase.  A flurry of red hair rushed into the room moments later.</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hermione, there you are! I’ve been looking everywhere for you!” </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione closed her book for the moment to give her friend her undivided attention. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I guess Hermia and Lysander will just have to wait.</span>
  </em>
  <span>  “Ginny, are you alright? You seemed to be in a hurry.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, an owl from Hogwarts just arrived, and you might be interested in what they dropped by.” Ginny wiggled an envelope addressed to Hermione in front of her face, the seal of which had already been broken. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ginevra Weasley! Why are you going through my post?”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I’m nosy, and you know it. Now, would you just look inside already?!” </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Shaking her head but smiling, Hermione lifted the flap of the envelope, and she almost dropped it right there. She could only see it slightly, but she knew that badge better than anyone. She had been striving for it since she started at Hogwarts. She was going to be Head Girl. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh my goodness...I can’t believe it…” Hermione was in shock. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, right! I’m pretty sure as soon as you decided to come back, they were already engraving your name on it!”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione playfully pushed her friend. “Oh, hush! You know as well as I know it's embroidered, not engraved.” They both erupted into a fit of giggles. But their gleeful moment was interrupted by the slamming of the front door. Two familiar voices echoed in the nearby hallways, so Ginny called out to them. “Harry, Ron, come here!”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Two pairs of thunderous footfalls got louder and louder as the boys rushed into the library. They were adorned in their black Auror robes, still with the word “trainee” plastered on the back. Ron was the first to speak. “What’s up, Gin? You called?”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Beaming at her brother and Harry, she announced, “Hermione has some wonderful news!”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not going back to school after all?” Ron asked.</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“You invented a spell to finally make me remember how to fix my glasses?” Harry asked. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harry, even I’m not that talented,” Hermione joked. “Gentleman, you’re looking at the new Head Girl!!” </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Both Harry and Ron came in for a hug and they shouted for joy. “That’s brilliant, Hermione! But I mean, it’s not like you weren’t going to get it…” Ron started. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ronald!”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“What? I mean, you’re bloody brilliant!” </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“What have I told you about cursing, Ron?” she exclaimed. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s it’s undignified, and not the way a gentleman should speak…”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Exactly. Now, I appreciate all of you being excited for me, I really do…”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“We interrupted you reading again, didn’t we?” Harry finished for her. “Come on, you lot. I think we should leave the Head Girl alone to celebrate. Besides, your Mum is cooking here tonight, Ron.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, she invited George, too. He's been having a hard time as of late. Thanks for letting them do this, by the way.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“No trouble at all. We will just go see if she and Kreacher need any help setting up, and leave Hermione alone for a bit more,” Harry said. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“You mean, she wouldn’t want to join us in a celebratory game of Exploding Snap?” Ginny joked. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know I’m rubbish at that game, Ginny.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Exactly, so I would be the one celebrating,” she winked at Hermione. They all started laughing uncontrollably. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Their laughter was once again halted by the front door opening and slamming shut. Hermione was fairly certain that they weren’t expecting someone else that evening, other than George and Arthur, but the sound of the boots connecting with the wooden floor was all too familiar. There was a tightening in her chest, and her heartbeat escalated. There was only one person who made her feel that way, and the scent of sandalwood and rosemary that permeated the library even before he stepped into view only confirmed her suspicions. The entry of the room was soon blocked by a towering figure dressed in black. His dark, shoulder-length hair fell down around his face. Some people might call his nose “hooked,” but the older she got, the more she realized how distinguished it was on his face. His almost-black eyes scanned the room, and the moment they connected with hers, her breath hitched. She couldn’t remember when it happened, but she had known for a while that she felt more than just respect for her Potions professor. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Ever since she found out that he had survived Nagini’s bite, she had thought about when she would see him again. A not-so-small part of her knew that he was another reason why she was going back to Hogwarts. She knew that even before then, her affections towards him morphed from respect, to admiration, to more than just a “schoolgirl crush.” But considering their positions and the considerable age difference (not the she personally cared about it), Hermione kept her feelings to herself. She was aware that nothing would ever happen, simply because they had known each other for so long, and she knew how he felt about her: she was the “over-achieving Muggle-born with a penchant for reciting texts word-for-word without actually using her brain to think on her own.” Despite his constant barrage of berating remarks, she felt a mysterious pull to be around him. She could see in his sunken eyes a tortured soul, and it pained her. She spent most of her life feeling belittled by him, when the entire time she had known him, he was just trying to survive. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His eyes landed on hers one again, and she stood stock still, not knowing what to do or say. Luckily, he did so for her. “I hear congratulations are in order, Miss Granger. Professor McGonagall just gave me the news that our resident know-it-all has achieved one of her life-long goals.” He still couldn’t dole out compliments with some back-handed insult towards her. Hermione’s head dipped low, embarrassed. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Snape, why are you here?  Did you come here to ridicule Hermione or did you have another reason for being here?” Harry griped. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“I may not be your professor anymore, Potter, but that does not mean that you are allowed to speak to me in such a manner. And as to my reason visiting, I do believe I was invited by your surrogate mother. Apparently she felt the need to extend an invitation to dinner this evening, and I accepted. But it was quite convenient, considering I actually have something to discuss with Miss Granger.” All four of them waited for him to start talking, but he emphasized, “Alone.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>The other three huffed, as they made their way out of the library. Ginny stood behind, clasping her hand on Hermione’s shoulder and walked out. Ginny, much like her brother and Harry, were very protective of each other. Ginny saw first-hand the nights that Hermione cried herself to sleep over Snape’s cutting remarks. Ginny gave Snape a look as if to say, “You mess with her, you mess with me,” she walked passed him, leaving Hermione alone with the dark, brooding professor.  </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Snape stood there, gazing down at the woman before him. Yes, he admitted to himself that the know-it-all had grown from a constant thorn in his side as a child to brave, intelligent, and―most unsettling for him―beautiful woman. He hadn’t seen her since the night of the Final Battle, as he lay there in the Shrieking Shack, the poison from Nagini’s bite travelling through his bloodstream. He wanted to let the venom take him; he wanted to finally be greeted by death. His eyes were on the verge of closing for good, when an image formed behind his lids: chestnut curls flowing the breeze; hazel eyes brightening as the gazed upon him; and the most dazzling smile that he had ever laid his eyes on. He wasn’t sure why he thought of her in his final moments, but before he knew it, he was reaching for the bezoar hidden in his robe and placing it under his tongue. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Two months had gone by since that day, and that same vision has haunted him. Seeing her every night in his dreams—she was like a siren calling out to him. He was being driven mad with the need to see her, but how? </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>A few weeks after the battle, Minerva called him back to Hogwarts and asked him about his future. Minerva started off by apologizing to him, which he emphasized that she was already forgiven. He then told her in no uncertain terms that the position of Headmaster (or, Headmistress, as it were) was hers. He told her that he would be more than happy to take back the position as Potions professor. When she asked him about the DADA position, he responded, “I’ve seen enough Dark Arts to last me multiple lifetimes.” She smiled, but she insisted that he take the position of Deputy Headmaster, if only to appease an aging woman. He laughed, and they fell back into their usual banter, talking of everything and nothing. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>When the  topic of Head Boy and Girl came up, Minerva brought up the fact that Hermione would be returning to finish her seventh year, and all color drained from his face. The person who has been haunting his dreams for the past month would be back in his classroom, unknowingly taunting him every time she bit her lip as she asked a question, or when her eyes lit up at his reluctantly awarding house points. Any semblance of control he had would be tested each and every lesson, and he wasn’t sure how long he would be able to keep up the facade. That was when inspiration struck, and he talked to Minerva about teaching assistant positions. It had been years since they had been implemented, but considering his dilemma, it seemed the perfect solution. Either that, or he just sped up his downfall. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Seeing her now, the rosy flush on her cheeks and the way her navy blue jumper accentuated her womanly curves—he knew that the girl who he taught for so many years was gone, replaced by the goddess in front him. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“May I sit down?” he asked, the question almost straining from his lips. The tight blue jeans she wore did little to hide her shapely hips; he thanked each and every god that his robes hid his obvious infatuation. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione nodded, and Snape swept through the room, his robe billowing without wind. He sat beside her on the chaise lounge. She refused to look at him, no doubt still feeling the affect of his stinging barb at her as he entered the room. He hated himself for doing so immediately after, but he had to keep up the image in front of her friends for now. But like this, just the two of them, he wanted to change how she saw him. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Miss Granger, look at me.” Hermione lifted her head, and he stared openly inter her stunning hazel eyes. “I regret to inform you that I will not be allowing to take seventh year Potions with me this year...”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione’s eyes widened in shock. She had gone from the high of being named Head Girl to the low of having the professor whom she was admittedly infatuated with calling her his awful nickname and subsequently kicking her out of his class. She had to find some way to amend the situation. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Professor, there has to be a way for me to be included in this course. You know I will work harder than any student has! I’ll do any extra work you require of me…” Hermione’s hands were flying all over the place in her animated state. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Snape couldn’t concentrate with her limbs in constant state of motion, so he took his hand and placed them on her wrists, trapping them in his grip. “Will you desist?”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>The feeling of his hands on her skin caused the butterflies in her stomach to flutter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Touching the delicate flesh of her hand if only for a moment caused his body to stiffen all over. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Neither were aware of affect of the other’s touch. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now that I have your undivided attention, may I continue?” All Hermione could do was nod. Her brain couldn’t form a coherent sentence, even if it wanted to at that moment. “Before I was interrupted, I was saying that I will not be allowing you in my class this year...as a student.” Her eyebrows crinkled in confusion. “I brought this up to the new Headmistress, and she agreed that you wouldn’t benefit from sitting in class, but to actually apply your knowledge in a more meaningful manner. So, Miss Granger, should you wish to accept it, I am offering you the position of teaching assistant.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>When the information finally reached her brain, she couldn’t help the smile that formed. “Trust me when I say this will not be easy. I will work you harder than any of my students, because I will require you to not only help with grading assignments, but you will also be assisting me in brewing for Madam Pomfrey to keep the infirmary well-supplied. If you show exemplary progress, I might even allow you assist on personal projects as well.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>She couldn’t believe her ears. She went with her gut instinct. “Yes.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now, Miss Granger, I need you to be certain…”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I am absolutely certain!” She couldn’t tamper her excitement. This was just what she was looking for, and it was gift-wrapped to her in the form of her Potions professor. “Do I need to sign anything?”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>He waved his hand, saying, “Unnecessary. I just need to inform the Headmistress of your decision, and she will adjust your schedule accordingly. She was very excited at the thought of having you under my own personal tutelage.” </span>
  <em>
    <span>And so was I...</span>
  </em>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course. I don’t know what to say other than thank you.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are most welcome. I will be in contact with you soon about your schedule and the duties I will require of you.” Snape lifted himself up from the chaise lounge, but before making his leave to head to the dining room, he noticed the book Hermione had sitting on the window sill. “Shakespeare?”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione looked to the book, and back to her professor. “‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream. It’s my favorite comedy.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Lord, what fools these mortals be!</span>
  </em>
  <span>” he quoted. </span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione couldn’t believe that the words of Shakespeare were coming from her professor’s lips. It was bad enough that she could listen to him recite potion ingredients and it would make her swoon, but Shakespeare? Just one line, and she was a mess. “You know it?”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>An actual smiled appeared on his face. “You forget that my father was a Muggle. There was a place for Shakespeare even in our home. That particular comedy was my first introduction to magic, until I began to show signs of having it.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>Hermione was amazed that she was actually getting a glimpse of the man behind the mysterious facade, and so willingly. She wondered if agreeing to be his teaching assistant will make him open up to her more. She had a feeling they would be spending much more time together, which made her both excited and nervous. On a whim, she delivered one of her favorite lines. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind…</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>And therefore is winged cupid painted blind</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” As he spoke the words, he looked directly into her eyes, pinning her there under his steely gaze. She couldn’t move, only stare in the black pools of his eyes, hidden behind the curtain of black hair. For some reason, she thought he did so deliberately, so that she couldn’t gauge his reaction. But that would mean that she was affecting him in some way, and that was just preposterous...</span>
  <em>
    <span>wasn’t it?</span>
  </em>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
  <span>He cleared his throat, backing up towards the entrance. “I believe dinner is going to be served soon. Will you be gracing us with your presence?”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<span>“Yes, Professor. I’ll be just a moment,” Hermione answered, and then was shocked to see the professor do something she had never seen before: he smiled. And not just smiled, he smiled at her. She sat on the chaise lounge for a while after he left, playing out their conversation over and over again in her mind. What she didn’t hear was as he was just outside of the library, he looked back to the library and whispered to himself, “</span><em><span>And though she be but little, she is fierce.</span></em><span>”</span></p>
