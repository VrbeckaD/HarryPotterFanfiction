    <p>I needed to get out. The memories were drowning us. My name is Thia Potter and this is how I found my  Soulmate.</p><hr/><p> THIA'S P.O.V </p><p>I walk into the bullpen just as hotch calls the team to the round table. I set my stuff by my desk and walk up to the meeting room. A I'm sitting down J.J. stands up and turns on the television.</p><p>"Looks like we have six rape/murders in as many weeks." J.J explains.</p><p>"Why are we just hearing about this now. Six in as many weeks w should have been called in allot sooner, w e could have saved lives." Morgan says, and he's right but he doesn't all ways have to point it out.</p><p>"Settle down Morgan" hotch snaps.</p><p>"Garcia, what do the locals have so far?"he asks our tech analyst, and one of the brightest people I have ever known.</p><p>"Well sir, honestly they don't have much, this guy doesn't leave any thing behind, no hair, no DNA, nothing. Though so far he has struck every Sunday right after three in the afternoon." She says. </p><p>"Where are we going?" I ask.</p><p>"Springfield Missouri" hotch answers. </p><p>"Let's roll." Hotch says a few seconds later. "Wheels up in thirty." He walks out of the room.</p><hr/><p> We get to the air strip ten minutes to take off and get settled in. Thirty minutes into the flight my laptop pings I open it and see the face of one Penelope Garcia technical analyst. I turn the computer so that it faces the cabin.</p><p>"Garcia do you have anything new for us?" Morgan asks.</p><p>"The only thing that I've been able to find is he attacks between three and six, like clockwork every sunday. The locals think he stalks these women because they're all married but he attacks when he knows that no one will be around to disturb him, and no one's around to save these women." She sighs.</p><p>"Sorry, sugar."</p><p>Morgan tells her its fine, but I can see the stress lining his face. After the vid-chat ends all turn so were in the parody of a circle, Hotch speaks first. "I know we don't have much to go on, but we at least have a timeline and we have three days to find this Fucker before he strikes again."</p><p>We all nod. "I think we should have a backup operation just in case we don't meet that deadline." I say grimly, receiving grim nods from my team members.</p><p>Hotch nods, telling me to continue with my train of thought. I take a deep breath, letting it out slowly, before continuing "I think we should talk to the chief in Springfield how abject he would be too two of us going undercover as potential targets l, and looking at the M.O the women are all black haired, green eyed, with porcelain skin tones and the men are around 6"9' with brown hair and eyes, with lightly tanned skin. It's almost like he's trying to find one particular couple." </p><p>Everyone's staring at me I awe and I can feel a blush creeping onto my face and down my chest. </p><p>Suddenly morgan starts laughing "you do realise the only two people that fit that description are you and hotch right?" He asks still laughing. </p><p>Hotch and I just nod while looking completely serious.</p><p>When the plane lands we all get into the two black suvs that the locals had sent for us and drive to the police station. The station is right near downtown, and right down the street from the high school, and library. As we enter the building the chief of police comes up to us and J.J starts introducing us.</p><p>"Hi, you must be detective Monroe. I'm special agent Jareau, this so Supervisory Special Agents Hotchner, Potter, Morgan, Rossi, and Prentiss, and this is Doctor Reid."</p><p>She gestures to each of us a she says our names. "Thank you all for coming down. We have two rooms that connect to each other for you to use. Anything you need just tell one of the officers or myself and we can try to accommodate." Detective Monroe says with a slight southern accent. I smile at him</p><p>"thank you and your department for your hospitality, what we need right now is to get a feel for the couples that the unsub killed, your report says that all the woman are short in stature, have long black hair, green eyes, and a very pale skin tone. While the men are fairly tall, with dark brown hair and eyes, a slightly tanned complexion, with a solid build. Correct?"</p><p>He looks a little shocked, but nods just the same.</p><p>"Well we better get started." Hotch says from beside me. I forcedown the shiver that tries to show. Here we go.</p><p> </p>
