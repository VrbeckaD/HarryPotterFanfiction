    <p><b><em>Earthly Meaning:</em></b> Chance; <em>Gambling;</em> Secrets; <em>Windfall; Synchronicity; Birth</em><br/> <em><b>Spiritual Meaning:</b> </em>Fate; <em>the Feminine;</em> Uncertainty<br/> <em><b>Reversed Meaning:</b></em> <em>Don’t take a chance, the outcome won’t be good;</em> Embarrassing or Unpleasant revelations are about to come to light.<br/> <b><em>We cannot always know the results of our actions, which have an alchemy of their own.</em></b></p>
<p>Colonnello, contrary to popular belief, <em>was</em> able to keep secrets from his superiors. There were things about him that not even Lal, his teacher (and longtime crush), knew about him.</p>
<p>Some were simple things, like a few foods he liked that were never brought up (He had a special fondness for Jambalaya, ever since one particular mission brought him to Louisiana in the US), activities outside of his job (He actually had a fondness for tinkering with car engines, though he was no-where near Skull’s skills. Even he had to admit the lackey was <em>good</em> at his job), and other small things that rarely cropped up in his work area enough to make people notice.</p>
<p>Some secrets, however, were not so innocently missed. Or Small for that matter. But he still managed to keep them.</p>
<p>The biggest was that he <em>did</em>, in fact, have a sky.</p>
<p>With his status as the Rain Arcobolaeno, everyone simply <em>assumed</em> that he’d Harmonized with Luce. This was not true. As he had come in unofficially due to his worry for Lal’s safety (Everything had felt so wrong with those jobs, how could she have not noticed?), and had taken the curse in her place, he had never had the chance to bond with Luce. In fact, he hadn’t bonded with <em>any</em> of them. He had been an outsider who’d come running in when he wasn’t supposed too. He didn’t regret it, but that didn’t change the facts. The others never brought that fact up, simply letting people believe what they wanted.</p>
<p>But he hadn’t Harmonized with Aria, Luce’s daughter, either. He had hung around for a while, making sure she was okay after her mother’s passing, but he had never truly connected with her (The girl had lost her mother, had her Familia’s problems dropped on her lap and saddled with a curse that would drain away <em>her life</em> all in one go. She needed at least one person to be there for her). Admittedly the others hadn’t Harmonized with her either, simply coming by <em>just often enough</em> to say they hadn’t cut contact from her. But no more than that.</p>
<p>Colonnello's Sky was young (barely fifteen) and had been living with him in Mafia Land for nearly seven years. Many of the workers had assumed the teen was a relative or a charge left in his care before becoming an Arcobolaeno. The were kind-of right about that.</p>
<p>That black-haired, green-eyed teen was his young, wonderful, <em>unaligned</em> Sky. And he would gladly move mountains to keep him happy.</p>
<p><em>But sometimes,</em> he thought to himself while staring at the veritable flood of owls from his Sky's school friends, all of them probably demanding to know why he wasn't at his “Relatives” house. <em>Even <b>I</b> have to wonder how I've managed to keep this a secret for so long.</em></p>
