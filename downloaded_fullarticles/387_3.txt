    <p>December 25th 1994- Hogwarts</p><p>What a rubbish night. </p><p>The sound of someone clearing their throat made Hermione look up from where she had been slumped over on the staircase. A pale hand was holding out a shortbread biscuit to her, she looked up to find the face of a Weasley. Even through her tears she could tell it was not the Weasley that she had hoped to see. She supposed any kind of apology from Ron was out of the question.</p><p>“I saw you crying and I thought to myself, what does Granger love more than anything else, and I thought well, a book, but I couldn’t bring you that right now, we are at a ball after all. And I know Ginny went to such great efforts to convince you not to bring one. So, I thought perhaps a sweet treat would work just as well. Always works on Georgie.” He added hopefully, she smiled up at the young man and took the biscuit, as soon as it was in her hand she saw the familiar stamp of her favorite brand.</p><p>“Thanks, they're my-“</p><p>“Favorite. I know, I do pay attention. Sometimes, just not in class” Fred smirked down at her. She wiped at her cheeks with the back of her hand. “What’s the matter Granger?”</p><p>“Oh, you know, just being a silly girl.”</p><p>“In all the years I’ve known you ‘Mione, you’ve never once just been a silly girl.” For some reason, the kindness in his voice broke her down again. Then his face changed to a sneer.</p><p>“Alright he’s a right good quidditch player so I sure wouldn’t be able to beat him in a fight, but I’m sure Georgie and I could think of a creative way to jinx him.”</p><p>"What?" she asked, looking up at him. "Oh, no, it’s not-- no, Victor has been a perfect gentleman all evening. He’s just turned in for the night. They have been keeping him on a tight training schedule. I didn’t get to dance as much as I wanted to, the night was rather ruined wasn’t it."</p><p>"So, it’s the usual culprit then? Tell me, Granger, what did my dear prat of a brother do this time?"</p><p>“I didn’t say anything about Ronald,” she replied a bit too fast. He raised an eyebrow and Hemione knew she had been caught, “He said I was getting cozy with the enemy, betraying Harry.” she looked down at her hands, “I think he was just jealous.” Fred seemed surprised that she had finally realized his little brother liked her, until she said, “You know being in love with an international Quidditch star will make people do daft things, I’m sure he thinks that he and Krum were meant to be.”</p><p>“Did you just make a joke?” Fred’s eyes started twinkling with mirth,  “Merlin, Granger, didn’t know you had it in you.”</p><p>“I didn’t know you knew how to be nice. So at least we both are surprised this evening.” Hermione said in a playful manner and added a smile to ensure he know she was kidding, but quickly it faded back to her previous grimace. He slumped down next to her on the cold stone steps. Then quieter and lacking the humor from before she asked, “Fred, why are you being nice to me?”</p><p>“How do you always do that? Tell us apart.”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>“We're very similar. Even our own mother gets us mixed up."</p><p>"She gets you all mixed up, she called me Ginny once on accident, so I don’t really fault her for that and you're really not, similar. You’re not that similar," she repeated.</p><p>"No?"</p><p>“No.” she smiled at him, “your eyes are brighter, your laugh is a bit deeper and you raise this eyebrow when you're being cheeky,” she lifted up to touch his left eyebrow then brought it away after the brief contact that shot lightning through her fingers.</p><p>“Well, since George is busy dancing with Angelina, mind if I join you?”</p><p>“George is dancing with Angelina? But I thought you asked her?”</p><p>“I was just trying to push Georgie into it, they’ve liked each other for ages,” he paused for a moment. “Also, the girl I was thinking about asking already agreed to go with someone else, I decided I’d better prevent the same thing from happening to my equally daft brother. Then I got Alicia in on it, it didn't take long. I’m sorry you didn’t get to dance the whole night,” he said with his usual charming smirk missing.</p><p><br/>A serious face on Fred Weasley was both alarming and engrossing to Hermione. She was staring at his face so intensely she almost missed him reaching out to her.</p><p><br/>“Fancy one last dance?” She looked up at him as he stood hand still extended to her, “the night is still young."</p><p>How could she ever say no to that smile. Really, she thought one of those smiles and she could be convinced to do just about anything. She gently put her hand in his and he pulled her up gracefully into his arms. Hermione laughed as he spun her around, her bare feet on the cold stone floor, the silk fabric of her dress kissing her bare legs. They were alone in the Entrance Hall, dancing to the faint sound of music trying its best to make its way through the thick doors of the great hall.</p><p>Not speaking the two just grinned at each other, and Fred smoothly led them through the dance that they had been taught the previous week. Then the song faded into a much slower one and he brought her even closer to his body.</p><p>Hermione didn’t know how long they danced for only that she eventually realized there was no more music to dance to. Fred pulled away and kissed her hand. Then his eyes snapped up to her face as his head was still bowed to her hand.</p><p>He looked at her oddly. Like he was trying to figure out a particularly hard potion solution. He slowly pulled her in close, never breaking eye contact and pressed his lips onto her cheek. He pulled away his face lingering an inch from hers, his breath ghosting her face his lips brushing hers briefly before he pulled away fully.</p><p>Then he quietly led them back to the Gryffindor common room carrying her shoes by the straps in one hand and her hand firmly grasped in the other. Once in the common room, he gave her shoes back, bid her a quiet ‘night ‘mione’ and headed up the stairs to the boys dormitories.</p><p>They never talked about the kiss, or almost kiss, and they wouldn't acknowledge the it for many years, in fact nothing seemed to change between the two of them, except for she seemed to see Fred more often. Or maybe he was around the same as before and now she was just hyper aware of his existence, he would smile at her now whenever they saw each other, in a very comforting familiar way. She sometimes would see him in the great hall, occasionally he would take her Rita Skeeter induced hate mail away and tell her not to read it. George would always join in saying that they would gladly send replies to some of them on her behalf, perhaps sneak in a surprise.</p><p>Sometimes, Hermione would drive herself crazy by the memory of that kiss ghosting over her lips. Had he just been nice to her to cheer her up?  Because his brother had ruined her night and he felt he had to make up for it? Or because she looked nice in her dress with all the sleaking potions in her hair? It wasn’t overly romantic or passionate. Just a soft sweet peck, not like the rough rushed hot kisses she had received from Victor. It had left her uncertain and confused. It also meant that when Victor asked her to come visit him, she said no, not wanting to encourage anything romantic with him. After knowing that one small kiss could affect her so, it was confirmed to her that Victor was not the one.</p><p>The rest of the year passed quickly. The second task passed followed by the third.</p><p>Fred was next to her when Harry arrived back with Cedric’s body. All of the Weasleys were in a section waiting for Harry to exit the maze. The brief joy and exhilaration of seeing his red jersey was soon sucked dry with dread and terror at the sound of Mr. Diggory’s screams. She felt Ginny lean into her and she wrapped her arms around the younger girl as if to shield her from the world. Her teary eyes caught Freds.</p>
