<p>
  <span>A few words on the historical background: </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>I’ve taken some creative liberties here. Like A LOT. This story plays a few years after 27 b.C., the year Octavian was given the honorary title ‘Augustus’. Aside from many ahistorical details, the Isis cult (Isis being one of the most important gods and the goddess of magic and fertility) was more popular among the women of lower standing and the female slaves, though even Augustus’ infamous daughter is (vaguely) said to be a follower to annoy her father. He tried to forbid it in Rome, but wasn’t exactly successful with it. Draco and Theo’s mission is, of course, made up, as is their position within the Roman military. Though, a position among the </span>
  <em>
    <span>Vigintisexviri</span>
  </em>
  <span> was considered the final position for Senators’ offspring before entering the cursus honorum (the sequence of higher, public offices). The position they have is an equivalent to that, answers directly to the Emperor. The words Caesar, Octavian, Emperor all refer to Augustus.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>“This would never have happened in Rome,” Draco wheezed, his weight heavily supported by his fellow officer and friend, Theo. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No,” Theo laughed, “in Rome they would have attacked you with a knife, stabbing at your back.” Draco knew he was right. “And if you can’t cope with a cobra being thrown at you, you shouldn’t have insulted that fruit vendor’s daughter.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“She offered her ‘ripe, round fruits’ to me and was ugly as the night!” he tried to defend himself, his speech starting to slur due to the venom spreading through his body. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You are an idiot,” Theo commented and dragged Draco through a stone arch. “I don’t like what this snake bite is doing to you. Just let me get you away from the street so I can seep the venom from you with—” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco’s companion stopped dead in his tracks upon discovering that the atrium opening behind the archway was not only occupied by plants and fountains, but also by a woman. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What do you want here, </span>
  <em>
    <span>milites</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“My friend was bitten by a snake, an Egyptian cobra.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco, who had tried to focus on one of the nearby benches, now looked at the woman. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I only require a bit of privacy, and I’ll heal him myself.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco knew Theo wanted to take his wand out and work his magic, but the woman didn’t budge.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>”You don’t plan on sucking it out with your mouth, do you?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Because neither Theo nor Draco knew how to answer that one, the woman flipped her dark brown curls back and walked over to them. She wore a gown Draco knew to associate with the daughters of Isis. He prayed his sluggish brain would keep this important information for later.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>The woman impatiently gestured for Theo to lower him down on a nearby stone bench. Not daring to expose their true intention to the Egyptian woman, Draco’s companion followed her orders. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s too dangerous to suck out the venom but very effective to seep it out.” She removed the part of Draco’s uniform where he had been bitten and ran her hand over the bite marks, murmuring to herself. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A warm feeling spread first through his arm, then through the rest of him. The pressure on his lungs every time he tried to inhale lessened instantly and the sparks in front of his eyes vanished. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Like magic. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>A firm hand pushed him down when he tried to get up. “Stay like this.” The woman, the witch he was now sure, stepped away from the bench only to return quickly. He felt a hand cupping the back of his head, and her, commanding him, “Drink this!” without any further explanation.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Why he trusted her not to poison him was beyond his capacity, but honestly, had she wanted to kill him because he was a member of the Roman military, she could have spared her energy healing him. Right? So he swallowed the vile tasting liquid. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“This counters the effects of the snake venom. You should be good soon.” She held his gaze when it cleared fully. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco’s first, sober view was that of two brown eyes looking intently at him. What followed was a wave of her scent: the earthy nature of Egypt mixed with parchment. He blinked the remains of the dizziness away, focusing on the admittedly very pretty face of the helpful woman — though the frown on it slightly impaired the beauty. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“How many fingers?” Theo now held his hand between her and him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Three.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Correct.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Isis and Osiris, the Roman can count.” She didn’t even try to hide the derision in her voice. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Grabbing Theo’s hand for support, Draco slowly got up, expecting some effects on his balance, but there were none. He felt better, exhilarated even. Whatever she had given him had worked wonders. Reaching into a hidden pouch under his clothes, he intended to give the woman some coins as a reward. After all, he was a Roman </span>
  <em>
    <span>civil</span>
  </em>
  <span> and was used to paying for services. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When his movement caught her attention, the woman’s face showed nothing but disgust. “Who do you think I am that you want to pay me like some peasant?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She stood proud, and with the sun rays hitting her person, she made quite the impression, Draco thought to himself. The cotton of her robes not hiding, but emphasizing her femininity in the most subtle ways, she was the perfect picture of a proud Egyptian priestess. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t know who you are, as you didn’t bother to tell me your name,” he chastised lightly.  “But where I come from, it is customary to pay for excellent services such as yours. After all, the ingredients of the draught you gave me must be paid for.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>She seemed to hesitate for a second, eyeing the coins with another frown. “The face of your Caesar is of no relevance here, nor is it of any worth.” The witch made a graceful movement with her hand, leading the rings on her wrists into a slight tingle, and pointed at the archway. “You should thank your </span>
  <em>
    <span>Penates </span>
  </em>
  <span>that I am quite familiar with the snake you’ve been bitten by. And now go.” Her curls swinging, she turned on her heel and left for the building. There was a subtle movement of her fingers and a slight shimmer around the woman that told Draco she had thrown up a shield before turning her back on them. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He glanced at Theo, who merely shrugged and walked towards the street again. Not knowing what to do except follow him, Draco stepped onto the busy street again, the sudden noise almost startling him after the peace of the garden. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They passed the short way to Theo’s quarters in silence.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p>
  <span>Pouring himself another wine, Draco reclined back on the settee. Finally, he could share his thoughts with his best friend, away from the prying eyes and ears of the other people.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Alright, Theo. What is your impression of the encounter with the Egyptian we had today?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Theo grinned. “You found a liking in the woman?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco shrugged. “She surely is a sweet grape I wouldn’t say no to sampling. But that’s not what I meant. She was… special, wasn’t she?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You don’t need to choose such cryptic words, my friend. Everyone a bit sensitive to it could practically taste the magic she exuded. She belonged to the Isis priestesses; I am almost certain of it. She may be the opportunity we’re looking for.” Theo’s grin faded. “We’re supposed to investigate the area so that the Emperor can assure the old men in the </span>
  <em>
    <span>senatus</span>
  </em>
  <span> that the cult their bored wives and mistresses are finding so posh is totally harmless.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“He doesn’t only want to mollify the Senate,” Draco corrected, thoughtful. “He wants us to explore the true magical potential for Him and the real danger in the powerful magic some of them are supposed to reign. And the witch we saw today is a sure proof of that theory.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“The men in Rome feel threatened by the power this religion ascribes to women and the sexuality that is a part of their practices. And with us, he could have sent two capable magicians that are loyal to him and the Empire. Two young, virile men.” Theo threw the woman serving them fruits a lecherous wink. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco rolled his eyes, being used to his friend’s flirty ways. He, himself, of course enjoyed the nightly company of women from time to time, but also knew his father wanted him to find a wife soon; he was already in his twenties, after all. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Though, Theo hadn’t finished his say. “But here’s the thing. This woman, this witch - she means trouble, that I would bet on Iulius’ cold grave. Look for some other opportunity to start the investigation, Draco. From the little I saw of her, she is independent, headstrong, and says what she thinks. Nothing like the docile little birds in Rome. She means fire, and you are going to get burnt if you aren’t careful.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Draco snorted, every bit the arrogant patrician sire he knew he was. “Dragons can stand a bit of fire. And she healed me; she can’t hate me, right?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Theo laughed. “I wouldn’t bet on it.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
