<hr/><p align="center"> </p><p>Harry was staring again; he gave his head a small shake and tried to look interested as Kingsley spoke, attempting to refocus on what the Minister was saying. After all, that had been his promise, at the beginning of the end. He had sworn that they would be able to work together. That they could carry on as normal.</p><p>He was pretty sure that working together did not include staring in desperation during interdepartmental meetings. It also probably did not involve watching for the familiar, beautiful, impossibly small adjustments everyone made: checking for changes in the set of his jaw, or the crinkle of eyes when he thought something was stupid. The unconscious brush of a hand against silvery blond hair, pushing it out of his eyes, just as Harry had once done for him. These things that he noticed were not something he was allowed to be doing anymore. They were not part of the amicable co-worker pact he had agreed to many months ago.</p><p>He sighed loudly, forgetting he was mid-meeting. To his great fortune, Kingsley met his eyes and simply nodded.</p><p>"Harry is right,” he decided. “We're talking in circles. Let's break now and reconvene tomorrow instead. In the meantime… Andrew, can you see if you can get that paperwork filed? And Draco, I trust you are still looking into the appointment of a new liaison?"</p><p>Draco nodded, still looking decidedly at the table rather than his co-workers. Kingsley handed out tasks to a few more people then dismissed them. Draco seemed to vanish the second the meeting ended. Harry just caught sight of him ducking out of the room, and immediately screamed internally at himself for noticing.</p><p>"Alright, Potter? You said you needed to speak to me?" Kingsley asked, dragging Harry’s attention back to the room.</p><p>He nodded, glancing around to check that the room had fully emptied. "I wonder if we might discuss… a shift. In my appointment,” he murmured pathetically. “I, er, miss the field."</p><p>Kingsley gazed down at him appraisingly but nodded shortly before replying, "Yes, I've been expecting that. I can move you, obviously, but the field?” he asked, sceptical. “Really? I seem to recall a desperate plea to have a desk job just one year ago. I could put you in a different office, perhaps?"</p><p>Harry shook his head vehemently. He cleared his throat and forced himself to make eye contact. "Please, Kingsley,” he begged. “A lot can change in a year. It isn't what you think. I miss the action. I… this was never what <em>I </em>wanted."</p><p>He tried not to let the bitterness he felt edge into his voice, but he suspected he had failed, given Kingsley's short intake of breath and another clipped incline of the head.</p><p>Regardless, by the end of the day, he had a new assignment. He had also inherited a new partner — a young recruit whose voice reminded him unpleasantly of Winky's, but who was otherwise tolerable — and a rotation of surveillance in Hogsmeade. He hadn't lied to Kingsley, not really. He <em>had </em>been missing the action of the field. He had just failed to remember how boring it really was at the end of the day. He'd forgotten how much of his time was actually spent <em>sitting, </em>uncomfortably, in cold, dark, cramped places, <em>waiting </em>for something to happen.</p><p>He had forgotten how much time he was going to have with his own thoughts.</p><p>That had made the sleeping potions his only real option if he planned to continue to survive. For the next few weeks, he spent most nights avoiding going to bed; dozing unhappily on the couch until he conceded the point and, most often, slept in the guest room. Even that bed wasn't free of fantastic heated memory, not the way they had used the house, but at least it had rarely been seen for sleep alone.</p><p>It’s not that it actually helped him sleep, but at least he didn’t feel phantom arms encircling him when he curled his aching joints into those uncomfortable sheets.</p><p>Ginny, of course, noticed first. Over drinks at the bar, a decision he had regretted the minute he had walked in, she took him by the hand and forced him to look at her.</p><p>"Harry," she began for the fifteenth time. "Have you <em>still </em>not heard me? Merlin, you're really not doing well… Ron said, but then he always exaggerates everything, especially when it comes to you or Hermione, or the kids."</p><p>"I'm fine," Harry muttered in response.</p><p>But he heard his own voice, knew he sounded nothing like himself. And even <em>he </em>didn't believe the words he was muttering. He felt her gentle hand on his cheek; her knuckle brushing the dark circles beneath his eyes as she clucked quietly.</p><p>"How many nights a week are you taking that stuff?" she demanded, harshness sharpening her normally honeyed tone.</p><p>He blurted a short, dark sound, which may have been construed as a laugh in another world, one that wasn’t as broken and twisted as it was now.</p><p>"Oh," replied Ginny, understanding. She inhaled deeply, hesitating before she continued. Harry gestured for her to go on. "Would you consider...you know, back on the horse, other fish in the sea, and all that?"</p><p>Harry looked at her darkly and took a swig of his whiskey.</p><p>"Right. Okay. So not yet,” Ginny conceded with a small smile. “Well, fine, but I'm not going to sit around and watch you become some sort of strung out potion addict because you’re sad about a boy. You'd never allow it of <em>me</em>."</p><p>He smiled a very small smile at this. She was right, after all. He wouldn't. He knew what was coming, the patented Weasley Intervention. He wasn't sure what she planned to do, but he knew would let her do it. He was well aware that he was fucked no matter what, so there was no point in worrying his friends further by refusing to accept their help and patience.</p><p>As time went on, however, he became more and more exhausted by the decision to let her help him.</p><p>Confusingly, Ginny's plan seemed to be an annoyingly regular presence in his life. She started by making small, bizarre requests for help. It started with mundane tasks that she obviously did not actually need help with; she would show up at the house requesting company while she went to the bank, or help to babysit Rose and baby Hugo, or to be her buddy on adventures into muggle London.</p><p>At first, he was exhausted every time she left him alone again. The emotional pain would throw itself back on him as soon as he Apparated home. Since he'd been robbed of his wallowing time and his despondency for the day, he would take it late into the evening before passing out wherever he was from pure exhaustion.</p><p>Eventually, though, these things turned into a routine. He would work forever during the week, only leaving early when he had dinner plans with Nev and Luna, or when Hermione insisted he come over for movie nights with the kids. On the weekends, Ginny would fill his time; he wasn't sure how she was convincing her relatively new boyfriend that this was okay, but Ginny wasn't generally one to be trifled with once she had decided on something.</p><p>He would know.</p><p>With this regular, insistent help, Harry cobbled out a new sort of life for himself; a new normal, where he sometimes managed to stop his mind from going over and over the endless litany of things he'd messed up. Where occasionally, he <em>laughed</em>. He got himself to a point where Rose stopped fake whispering <em>'what's wrong with uncle Harry?' </em>every time she thought he couldn’t hear him. He could play with them and laugh and joke, and it almost looked like he was himself again.</p><p>For two months, it all worked quite well.</p><p>But then Ginny decided she wanted to go grocery shopping. On <em>Saturday</em>. He hated the shops on Saturdays with very good reason. Ginny, as usual, had refused his refusal. She had talked him into coming through the strategic use of pointed glares over actual words. In another time, he'd have risked being punched for the chance to tell her how much she looked like her mother at that moment.</p><p>They’d wandered the aisles, with Harry only half listening to the stories from her week, leaning heavily on the trolly and trying to stay awake. The night before had not been a particularly good one in terms of sleep, and he was sure he looked exhausted.</p><p>Which is, inevitably, when it happened.</p><p>He’d turned a corner instead of waiting for her; waiting for Ginny to choose a brand of crumpet was an exhausting process. He was looking back at her to say he’d be near the eggs, meaning he ran straight into them.</p><p>The first thing Harry noticed was the laughing; he was laughing that lighthearted laugh that made Harry's heart leap appreciatively despite the many months of distance, despite the pain and fear. The laugh was accompanied by the touching. He his hand on the arm of a very tall, relatively handsome bloke, who was smiling and teasing, continuing a story he was obviously midway through.</p><p>When Draco finally looked up, his lips formed a comically slow <em>'oh'</em>, before he nonchalantly withdrew his arm as though it wasn't far too late for that action. He didn't speak directly to Harry. He nodded at him vaguely but didn't look him in the eye as he turned to the tall man.</p><p>"Sorry,” Draco murmured. “Er, Ed. This is Harry. My...my..."</p><p>Ed's mouth opened in surprise as well and, in the back of his awareness, Harry heard him start exclaiming things about his identity as <em>Harry Potter,</em> but Harry definitely wasn't listening. He was instead boring a hole into the side of Draco's head, silently screaming and cursing and willing Draco to continue to speak.</p><p><em>Your what</em>, his brain demanded. <em>Your WHAT? Your ex? Your old friend? Archrival? Acquaintance? Co-worker? Latest victim?</em></p><p>He desperately needed to hear how Draco categorised him now, in the <em>After</em>. But it was clear that Draco did not plan on finishing his sentence. He was smiling a large, frighteningly fake grin, listening as 'Ed' made a fool of himself, and trying to delicately extract them both from the situation. Harry made it easier for them and fled first, leaving the cart behind just as Ginny came round the corner, visibly baulking at the scene before her.</p><p>By the time he reached the outside of the shop, Harry was barely breathing, the hyperventilating feeling familiar and unsurprising. He was stuck, like the murky water at the bottom of a rain barrel. He wanted to run, to fly, escape. He didn’t want to face Ginny — or even more horrifying, Draco — and yet his body was unable to move. He clawed at the collar of his coat, dragging it away from his body until his neck was bare. He ripped his hands through his hair, trying to slow his breathing. Suddenly, Ginny was in front of him, directing him to sit on a bench, crouching at his feet, muttering soothing sounds until his gasps subsided a bit and he could actually see her, hear her words.</p><p>"Oh, Harry,” she soothed once she noticed his attention shift to her. “You've got to tell me what happened. Seriously. You have to."</p><p> </p>
