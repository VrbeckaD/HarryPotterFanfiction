    <p>He moved with purpose now.</p>
<p>That was new.</p>
<p>Every step was careful and measured. Every breath geared towards his survival. He was a man of war now.</p>
<p>“What...is that on his shoulder?” Ron whispered, leaning forward.</p>
<p>Harry’s eyes burned with something violent and he was hissing, softly at the scaled beast that sat coiled on his shoulder. The Dark Lord stood at his side, his expression still, leading his horse behind them. Harry seemed to be staring far away. Tonks couldn’t look away from the beast lounging over his shoulder.</p>
<p>A <em>dragon</em>.</p>
<p>“Boy, where did you disappear off to? Still a child that you can’t wait for a simple debrief before you go off to sulk for a night and half a day,” Moody snarled with derision.</p>
<p>Tonks watched as the older wizard faltered after he heard the dragonet shriek, its little wings stretching, slim neck darting out with aggression. Harry cooed softly at the monstrous creature and immediately, it settled, sliding over his shoulder, its long tail thrown around Harry's neck. Tonks shivered as those poisonous yellow eyes settled on her. She glanced to the Dark Lord. His crimson eyes glinted with amusement.</p>
<p>“Kill the boy, Harry Potter, and let the man live,” Harry murmured to himself. He mouthed the words, tasting them on his tongue. They echoed, prophetic in some way that Tonks couldn’t quite comprehend.</p>
<p>It felt like a prayer, something holy. But, also, so very damning. Harry looked to the Dark Lord once. The Dark Lord looked back at him and nodded. Tonks rocked from her heels to the balls of her feet, electric with nervous energy.</p>
<p>Something was happening.</p>
<p>The winds were different and, it no longer rained. No, instead the sun seemed to burn brighter than ever before. The mud from the morning had hardened, baked into brick by the heat of the day. Harry spun to face everyone and he drew his wand, a small smile spreading across his face.</p>
<p>“I am Harry Wildfyre of Houses Gryffindor and Potter, the First of His Name, Rightful Emperor of Albion, King of the Four Directions and Protector of the Realm,” he declared. Tonks shivered at the fire in his voice. “And you will <em>all </em>bend the knee.”</p>
<p>There was a long beat of silence. They stared. There wasn’t anything else they could do but stare. Harry watched each and every one of them with fire in his eyes. The dragonet on his shoulder shrieked as if in agreement with its master. Tonks looked around, wondering who would go first. Everyone was too frozen in shock. Tonks took a step forward and before she could sink to her knee, Voldemort swept his wand in front of his chest and fell to one knee.</p>
<p>Harry’s lips parted and he nodded.</p>
<p>Tonks hid her smirk behind her hand as she followed her uncle’s lead. The two Slytherins, the first to bow to the Prince of Gryffindor. The irony was not lost on her.</p>
<p>Tonks looked up and watched as the civilians fell to their knees, laying prostrate before Harry’s prone form. The dragonet shrieked upon his shoulder again and Tonks looked back at Remus. Remus was staring, wide-eyed, Teddy clutched tight to his chest. She caught his gaze and nodded. Remus slowly sunk to one knee, tucking Teddy closer to his side.</p>
<p>It was like a sudden wave. The Weasleys drew their wands in salute, bowing. Even Marlene McKinnon, Emmeline Vance, and Kingsley bent the knee before their King. Tonks felt giddy, pride rushing through her belly, thrumming in her veins. Even Cardaroc, a mess of creaky old bones, stooped as low as he could in his old age.</p>
<p>It was only Moody, Fendwick, and McGonagall standing.</p>
<p>“You want me to bow to you, boy?” Moody hissed, dangerously.</p>
<p>Harry’s lips quirked into a smile. “I am your King. You will bend the knee as the rest have done before you. Bend the knee, Alastor Moody.”</p>
<p>Moody’s gnarled face curled into a sneer. Tonks grit her teeth and looked down to the dirt ground. Fendwick stooped down, falling to a knee. McGonagall swept into a low curtsey, her skirts billowing out around her as she crossed her wand and saluted. Harry smiled, benevolent and oh so beautiful.</p>
<p>Tonks’ breath froze in her lungs. She waited. Everyone waited, with baited breath.</p>
<p>And slowly, Moody sunk to his knees.</p>

<p align="center"> <br/></p>
<p>Hermione walked, her hands clasped before her, eyes trained on the ground. She looked up with darting brown eyes, carefully keeping her gaze on Narcissa’s back as the woman walked, side by side with her sister. Andromeda was striking in chainmail, hard, where her sister looked soft in dark navy velvets and silks. But, Hermione knew better. She knew that <em>both </em>sisters were formidable.</p>
<p>“How far, Lord Dolohov?” Narcissa murmured to man on her left.</p>
<p>“They should be arriving soon, my Lady,” Dolohov insisted, his voice soft as they moved forward, their eyes trained on the gates to the Forbidden Forest.</p>
<p>"How could this happen? The Order...how could they have known that Draco was there?" Narcissa whispered to the air. Andromeda shifted, her chain mail clinking but, she didn't offer an answer.</p>
<p>Hermione had one—Draco was vain and a show-off. It would not be uncharacteristic for him to issue something that the Order would consider a challenge.</p>
<p>Hermione could hear the sounds of hooves hitting the ground. A thundering of them. Slowly, she straightened, rolling her shoulders back and cracking her neck. Her wand felt uncomfortable up her sleeve, and her eyes narrowed as she slowly let the tip peek out. A hand clamped on her wrist and Hermione adjusted herself, sliding her wand up her sleeve again. She looked down at Luna.</p>
<p>“My Lady,” Luna said, softly, her eyes trained on the gates as they creaked open.</p>
<p>Hermione hummed and watched with wide eyes as they rode forward.</p>
<p>Narcissa let out a gasp. “Draco,” she rasped in horror.</p>
<p>The King of Albion was covered in ash, his hair colored gray and his cheeks black. He looked haggard as if he had ridden after the battle and hadn't stopped. Her stepbrother didn't look in much better shape, his arm wrapped in a blood sling. The rest of the Aurors were in disarray, broken and burnt and covered in ashes. Far more had ridden out. Too few had returned.</p>
<p>Draco slipped from his horse and walked slowly towards the castle, his eyes narrowed in pain. Narcissa rushed to him, paying no mind to the blood crusted under Draco’s nose or the bruises on his pointy chin. She kissed him on both cheeks, roughly, before pulling him tight to her. His hands dangled at his side.</p>
<p>Andromeda raised an eyebrow. “Nephew, what has happened? How many men have you lost?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Too many,” Draco said, his voice rough from smoke inhalation. “Little Hangleton is in ashes. Muggle Aurors lost. Wizarding Aurors lost. Gregory Goyle is dead.”</p>
<p>Hermione frowned, looking between her stepbrother and her betrothed. They looked defeated, quivering with exhaustion. She was used to seeing them wreak havoc, terrorizing the people that came before them.</p>
<p>“Where is his body, your Grace? We must give it to his father,” Lord Dolohov said, softly.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think I know that,” Draco snarled, pulling away from his mother, his teeth bared. Even his mouth was crusted with dried blood. Dolohov nodded, attempting to keep the peace. “It is in the last wagon. Many wizarding bodies are, though some were reduced to ash. I know the burial rites. Greg is...he’s nearly in two pieces.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s eyes widened. He was grieving. Draco Malfoy was <em>grieving</em>.</p>
<p>“Someone severed him in half? How?” Andromeda barked. “How did this happen?”</p>
<p>Draco blinked at his aunt as if seeing her for the first time. "He was so beautiful, Aunt. The most beautiful person I'd ever seen. And he called fire as easy as he breathed air. I didn't...it was...Mother, I'm tired," he said, his voice cracking and Narcissa looked up at him, wounded, her eyes shiny with unshed tears.</p>
<p>“I know, my love. I know,” Narcissa whispered. “Lord Dolohov, if you’d please handle the Aurors while I see the King to his chambers. He has fought a long battle and lost many men. Andromeda, take the girl with you. Show her how we mourn the dead. When she is queen, she will need to know.”</p>
<p>Andromeda hadn’t taken her curiously dark gaze from the King’s face. “What did he call himself, Draco?” she asked, foregoing any sort of propriety.</p>
<p>“Dromeda,” Narcissa hissed, warningly.</p>
<p>“No, we must know,” Andromeda snarled. “The King took some of the best men and they return beaten and bloodied, with the heir of a <em>House</em> dead. We must know.”</p>
<p>“You mustn’t know anything. You aren’t part of the Council,” Narcissa snapped as she ushered Draco to Hogwarts Castle.</p>
<p>Luna and Hermione dutifully fell into low curtseys as the King and his mother passed them but, Draco barely paid Hermione any mind.</p>
<p>“I am the Warden of the West. I want to know if I have to worry about my <em>people</em>,” Andromeda retorted angrily. “I know Little Hangleton is in the North but, I must know.”</p>
<p>Narcissa spun around, ready to spit harsher words but, Draco turned, his gaze trained steadily on Andromeda. Hermione had never seen him grim. She had seen him smug and angry and disgusted but, never grim. He looked nearly like a man and that frightened Hermione more than anything. A boy-king she could learn to manipulate, to control, as his mother did. A man was a dangerous opponent to a woman, indeed.</p>
<p>Quietly, the King said, “He called him Harry Wildfyre of Houses Gryffindor and Potter. He called himself the Fairest of Them All.”</p>
<p>Hermione froze.</p>
<p>The <em>Fairest</em>.</p>
<p>She watched the King walk inside, accompanied by his mother. Andromeda cleared her throat and grabbed Hermione by her arm, whipping her around.</p>
<p>“Come, girl. There is work to be done,” Andromeda commanded.</p>
<p>Hermione jerked out of Andromeda's grasp but pulled her cloak tighter around herself and moved forward. It wasn't exactly cold though she could hear the wind whistling against the wards. She could see the gray skies beyond their bubble of summer.</p>
<p>Winter was coming.</p>
<p>“What kind of work?” Hermione asked.</p>
<p>“I will show you how we bury our dead here,” Andromeda said, her voice cold. She walked up to the wagon and looked farther out. Another wagon. She looked at the Aurors and cleared her throat. “You are dismissed. Lord Dolohov, you should see your men into barracks. They deserve their rest.”</p>
<p>Lord Dolohov looked at her, sourly. “As you wish, Lady Warden,” he drawled, and he ushered his men away, leaving the two women to inspect the wagons of the dead.</p>
<p>Hermione gagged at the smell of burnt flesh and she looked at the bubbling flesh, the bodies that looked nearly petrified. She wasn’t sure how she was supposed to be able to tell each face from another when they were all stretched into shades of agony.</p>
<p>“How could this be done?” Hermione whispered.</p>
<p>Andromeda looked at the bodies, stoically. She pulled out her wand and waved it over the bodies, murmuring softly. “It wasn’t Fiendfyre. That leaves traces of Dark magic. This was something else. Light.”</p>
<p>“How could this be Light magic? Bodies were turned into ash,” Hermione said, earnestly. “They set these men on fire. They <em>burned </em>them. Executed them.”</p>
<p>"And so goes war, Lady Granger," Andromeda said. She looked at the bodies, stopping when came across one man in particular, his middle caked with long dried blood. His black curls looked limp and dry yet stuck to his forehead with sweat. He was stiff.</p>
<p>“Gregory Goyle?” Hermione whispered.</p>
<p>“Yes. War makes monsters of us all,” Andromeda said, her voice soft.</p>
<p>Hermione looked at the woman, wide-eyed. “Do you...has the Dark Lord spoken to you about his plan? What will he do about Draco?” she whispered.</p>
<p>Andromeda laughed. “Why do you ask me? If he hasn’t told you, you aren’t meant to know.”</p>
<p>“He gave me back his wand. He said that he would not have Draco on the throne,” Hermione snapped, irritated.</p>
<p>“Tell me, Lady Granger, what do you want out of this war?” Andromeda asked.</p>
<p>“I want to go home,” she said, immediately. “I want to live.”</p>
<p>“Then, Lady Granger, you mustn’t shy from war,” Andromeda said, softly. “Embrace it.”</p>

<hr/>
<p align="center"> <br/></p>
<p>They stumbled into his room, breathing hard and wild like they had run a race. Voldemort drifted after the pair, rolling his eyes at their antics.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe I just did that,” Harry breathed, his eyes wild, cradling the unnamed dragonet in his hands. Tonks leaned back against the door, grinning madly.</p>
<p>“I can’t <em>believe </em>you just did that!” she hissed.</p>
<p>There was a long beat of silence before they both shrieked, shouting over each other, jumping up and down. The Dark Lord between the two with a raised eyebrow and triumph gleaming in his crimson eyes. The dragonet shrieked between them and Tonks immediately fell back, Harry turned his green eyes to the creature.</p>
<p>“A dragon, Harry. You come back with a dragon and demand that they all bend the knee,” Tonks said, shaking her head in awe. Harry slowly crossed to his bed, sitting on the edge, the dragonet slipping from his shoulder and tumbling into his lap. “How did this even happen? Where did you even <em>find </em>a dragon egg?”</p>
<p>“That would be my doing,” Voldemort drawled, crossing towards Harry. He kneeled, keeping his eyes trained on the creature, though he wasn’t unaware of the slight flush that spread high across Harry’s cheeks.</p>
<p>The Dark Lord examined the dragonet. It was lizard-like, with poisonous yellows eyes, as bright as his Nagini's. Its eyes were shaped like a cat and bronze nubs protrude from its head and smaller nubs, going down its back and tail. They would one day be spikes but they were no better than bumps at the moment.</p>
<p>“What kind of dragon is it?” Tonks whispered.</p>
<p>“A Horntail,” Voldemort said, decidedly. Cement-colored eggs, hard as stone. Definitely a Horntail. “And a girl at that.”</p>
<p>“What will you name her?” Tonks asked, excitedly.</p>
<p>Harry had not taken his eyes off the softly screeching dragonet, stroking her softly. The dragonet looked up at him and made a quiet purring noise of content. Harry’s lips spread into a wide smile.</p>
<p>“Her name is Freia.”</p>
<p>Voldemort nodded. “It is said that Horntails were the most vicious and aggressive breeds of dragon. You will have to tame her now. She is already taken by you. She will grow large and fast,” Voldemort warned as he watched the young man. Harry’s entire attention remained on the dragonet, Freia, that shrieked and squealed in his lap, hungry for all of the Prince’s attention. “If you’re done playing with the fire-breathing beast, there’s work to be done.”</p>
<p>Both Tonks and Harry looked up, irritated.</p>
<p>“She’s not a beast,” Harry snapped.</p>
<p>Voldemort rolled his eyes. “There’s a reason the Founders destroyed them all and sent them into extinction.”</p>
<p>“Well, you won’t touch her,” Harry hissed, threateningly and Voldemort raised his hands, surrendering with another dramatic roll of his eyes. “Freia is mine.”</p>
<p>“How did ‘Freia’ come into your possession again?” Tonks asked in wonder.</p>
<p>“A girl… there’s a servant girl at Hogwarts. I greatly respected her mother and she asked me to honor her mother by putting the stone in the mausoleum. It was only a stone then. It wasn’t hot. I had no idea that it could be a petrified dragon egg. And yet…” Voldemort trailed off, turning away, his eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>He should’ve known. Pandora had been closely affiliated with fire. And the Luna girl always knew things that she shouldn’t. She was a crafty witch, so very much like her mother.</p>
<p>“She knew,” Harry said with such certainty that the two Slytherins looked to him. His green eyes had not left Freia and he smiled as she gnawed at his finger.</p>
<p>“No more frivolous conversation about the dangerous beast that has imprinted on you,” Voldemort snapped. Harry glared at the Dark Lord but waited for him to finish. So, he recognized that Voldemort’s words were true. “There is work to be done.”</p>
<p>“Oh, am I included in this work now?” Tonks retorted.</p>
<p>“You’re as much of a threat to Moody and his faction as much as I am,” Voldemort spat.</p>
<p>Tonks reared back. “I’m an <em>Order member</em>—”</p>
<p>“You’re a Slytherin,” Voldemort snarled. Tonks fell silent, eyes wide. Harry reached for hand, squeezing, though he didn’t look away from the Dark Lord, waiting patiently for him to finish. “They don’t trust you. They know you’re powerful. I can tell that much. But, they don’t <em>trust </em>you. You encourage the Prince to be outspoken. You were the first to bend the knee, for Merlin’s sake. <em>You </em>are a <em>threat</em>. And so, you <em>must </em>work with us.”</p>
<p>Harry turned to look at Tonks, his eyes eager. “Please, Tonks. I couldn’t do this without you. You’ll be my advisor. You must,” Harry insisted.</p>
<p>Tonks bit her lower lip, nervously.</p>
<p>“Harry,” she began, “you want me to go up against the Madame? She practically saved me. You want me to betray her?”</p>
<p>“I’m your King,” Harry said, softly. “You bent the knee to me. You believe in me, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do,” Tonks said, immediately. “I imagine a lot of them believe in you. Especially after last night.”</p>
<p>Harry nodded then. “Then, you will work with us, right? You’ll be loyal to me and me alone, right?”</p>
<p>Tonks swallowed. She looked into her Uncle’s crimson eyes but, Voldemort stared at her, with all the expectation in the world. She looked back into Harry’s eyes and swallowed any doubt.</p>
<p>“Yes. Loyal to you and you alone.”</p>
<p>“Good,” Voldemort said. “Then, we plan.”</p>
<hr/>
<p align="center"> <strong>ON</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p align="center"> <br/></p>
<p>He strode from the stables fast, barely putting his stallion up. He could sense the buildup of magic. Something was happening. Something had happened without his presence. Voldemort</p>
<p>“Andromeda—” Voldemort began.</p>
<p>Andromeda jerked away from her brother, giving him a warning look.</p>
<p>“You’ve been gone too long, brother. The Houses are here. Surely you saw their carriages,” Andromeda said. Voldemort shook his head, looking around the court, only slightly alarmed.</p>
<p>Everyone wore their best, primped and groomed to the utmost. Narcissa, Draco, and his betrothed hadn't arrived just yet. That was all well and good. Voldemort didn't want Narcissa dissecting his conversations with their sister.</p>
<p>“I came from Karnaron. They must have arrived by way of the East. Who has she summoned?” Voldemort asked. He looked at the group. Lord Goyle leaned against the wall, draped in black, his own wife sobbing softly into black linen. “Is Heir Goyle dead?”</p>
<p>“Yes. You may thank your Fairest for that,” Andromeda said, her voice low and cold.</p>
<p>Voldemort hummed. “You didn’t answer my other question.”</p>
<p>“The great Houses Crouch, Parkinson...and Longbottom,” Andromeda said.</p>
<p>Voldemort let the name sit between them as the doors swung open and Narcissa emerged, bathed in navy. The court bowed to her and she smiled, their adoration giving them strength. She approached Voldemort and leaned in, brushing her lips against his cheek. Voldemort returned the gesture though his stomach turned with fury.</p>
<p>He took a step back and watched as Draco emerged and everyone fell before him murmuring ‘your Grace, your Grace’. Voldemort watched him carefully. The boy-king had a grimness to his eyes that he hadn’t possessed before. His first battle had been just as unkind to him as it had been to Harry.</p>
<p>The Lady Granger trailed behind him in robes of silver. She was still thin as a dementor but, she no longer had bruises on her jaw or her neck. She walked with a newfound confidence. Having her wand on hand had done her some good then. A quivering little girl would not be helpful in his future plans. Pandora’s girl, Luna, followed after her, her gaze wandering to Rodolphus.</p>
<p>Voldemort looked away. He would allow Rodolphus his privacy in that particular matter.</p>
<p>Hermione caught Voldemort’s gaze and nodded to him. He nodded back at her and Hermione turned away, settling at the bottom of the dais, waiting patiently and separate for the Houses to arrive. She lifted her chin, no longer afraid in the face of the court. She had her wand. She could protect herself in anyone dared lay a finger on her again.</p>
<p>She saw Blaise who stared at her with a smirk. His smirk faltered when she didn’t flinch, and her own lips twitched into a cool smile.</p>
<p>She looked discreetly at the Lord Voldemort again. He was whispering quietly to his sister but, Andromeda only had eyes for the House that entered first.</p>
<p>“Presenting Lord Webber of House Parkinson, and his lovely daughter, the Lady Pansy of Parkinson.”</p>
<p>Hermione watched as an older man and a young woman in bronze robes paraded through the doors. The older man was unassuming in the way all old men were unassuming. He was wise-looking but, ultimately, bathed in wealth and simmered in false power. Hermione looked at Pansy. She wasn’t a pretty woman but, she was attractive. Her nose was upturned, dark hair waved around her face, and she was smug-looking.</p>
<p>“Your Grace,” Pansy said, falling practically to her knees as they reached the dais. “It’s been so long, my dear, dear friend.”</p>
<p>Hermione stiffened, as she looked at Draco. Draco’s lips were pulled into a tight smile.</p>
<p>“Lady Pansy, my childhood friend, it was quite a shock to me, that your family didn’t swear immediate fealty to me,” Draco said in greeting.</p>
<p>Lord Webber flushed and cleared his throat. “Your Grace, we believed it best if we swore loyalty, to you, the great King-Emperor Draco, in person. We only want to continue our family’s long-term friendship.”</p>
<p>Draco watched him for a long while. Narcissa bent over to whisper into Draco’s ear. Draco nodded and waved her away, impatiently. Hermione had never seen him dismiss his mother so suddenly. Narcissa pulled back, her gaze cold.</p>
<p>“Thank you, my Lord, my Lady. Welcome to court,” Draco drawled.</p>
<p>Pansy stood, lifting her chin and she swept past Hermione, trodding heavily on her toes. Hermione swallowed her yelp of pain and frowned at Pansy. Pansy’s eyes narrowed on her, full of warning before she joined the court, immediately swept into a group of young women that hugged her and pressed kisses to her cheeks. Hermine flushed in humiliation.</p>
<p>“Presenting Lord Bartemius of House Crouch.”</p>
<p>A tall man with short gray hair emerged in pressed black robes. His hair was neatly parted, almost unnaturally straight with a narrow toothbrush mustache above his thin lips. In the strange lighting of the Great Hall, he took on a skull-like appearance. Hermione felt dread crawl up her spine.</p>
<p>“Your Grace,” Lord Crouch said, curtly.</p>
<p>“You have not sworn fealty either, my Lord,” Draco drawled. “Your son is here and hasn’t sworn fealty.”</p>
<p>Hermione’s eyes narrowed, searching for the man that would be Lord Crouch’s son. Her eyes widened when a man in black leather battle robes stepped forward. The robes were open, revealing a tunic that wasn’t laced up to his neck and thighs squeezed into tight leather trousers. He was a pale man with straw-colored hair and freckles, and he was so terribly handsome it made her ache.</p>
<p>“Your Grace, you know as well as I that may not swear fealty to any man but, the Dark Lord,” the son of Crouch said.</p>
<p>“Barty,” Lord Crouch barked.</p>
<p>“Your son is correct, my Lord. I apologize, your Grace, but Barty Crouch belongs to me through the bonds of blood and ink. You understand, don’t you?” Voldemort said, his voice terribly chilly. He practically dared Draco to speak against him in public.</p>
<p>Draco regarded his uncle for a long time before he turned to Lord Crouch. “Do <em>you</em>, Lord Crouch, swear fealty to me?”</p>
<p>“Of course, your Grace,” Lord Crouch said curtly.</p>
<p>Barty continued to stare at Draco, his eyes narrowed. Hermione swallowed hard, missing the King’s next words, as she looked into Barty’s eyes. He stared at her as if he wasn’t sure what to make of her, suspicious or otherwise. He melted back into the court, disappearing from her view and Hermione took a deep breath, focusing on what was to come.</p>
<p>“Presenting Lord Neville of House Longbottom and his sister-ward, Lady Daphne Greengrass.”</p>
<p>Narcissa bent her head, whispering into Draco’s ear. Hermione watched as Draco straightened, scooting forward to sit on the edge of his seat. Hermione swallowed as she watched the pair walk into the Great Hall, and court broke into a million whispers.</p>
<p>The first thing Hermione noticed was that they were both tall and towheaded. Second, she noticed how young they were, nearly her age. Neville was nervous looking in yellow and navy. Daphne Greengrass looked perfectly at ease, her strange eyes taking in all of the Great Hall.</p>
<p>“Lord Neville Longbottom, you came quickly to our request. How kind,” Draco drawled, his voice terribly cruel. He leaned forward. “Where is your lady grandmother?”</p>
<p>“My King,” Daphne began, her voice soft but carrying through the Great Hall. It sounded like music. “Our lady grandmother is an old woman. She is quite tired from the journey. Please excuse her.”</p>
<p>“The King did not address--” Narcissa began sharply.</p>
<p>“Mother,” Draco said, shortly, silencing her. He leaned forward, watching the two with shrewder eyes than Hermione believed he had. “Lady Daphne has never been to court. She’s been in Arcadia since she became the late Lord Longbottom’s ward.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do apologize, your Grace. You are very kind and fair,” Daphne said sweetly.</p>
<p>Neville lifted his chin and nodded. “Your Grace, we come here to swear fealty to you.”</p>
<p>“Your family has sworn fealty before and has broken it. How fair your mother and father?” Draco asked, sharply. Hermione knew it to be a cruel question. Both Daphne and Neville flinched at his words.</p>
<p>“Your Grace, I am not my parents,” Neville said, coolly. “We swear fealty to the true King-Emperor of Albion. We would not be here if we didn’t.”</p>
<p>“I suppose,” Draco said and his lips curled into a cold smile. “You may go back to your tents. We shall summon you when you earn your place at court.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, your Grace,” Neville said and he offered his arm to Daphne. She took it gently and they walked away, with all the dignity and grace that Draco had ripped away from them.</p>
<p>Hermione swallowed. She knew. This was only the beginning.</p>
<hr/>
<p align="center"> <strong>THE WALL</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p align="center"> <br/></p>
<p>“Harry,” Tonks said, rushing into his room, Teddy cradled against her side.</p>
<p>Harry looked up from his books, his green eyes round and glassy behind his glasses. Freia reared her head and let out a trilling shriek, startled. Teddy let out a tiny cry, surprised but, he didn’t burst into tears as Tonks had feared. Tonks settled on the bed, holding Teddy close to her chest as Freia lumbered forward, butting her head against Teddy’s side. Teddy giggled, reaching small fat fingers towards the dragonet.</p>
<p>Harry yanked Freia back. “Not safe yet. Freia doesn’t understand children,” he said, apologetically.</p>
<p>Tonks nodded, her eyes frantic. “Doesn’t matter. Not why I’m here.”</p>
<p>“Then, why are you here?” Harry asked, carefully shutting his books. He pulled out his wand, pointing it at the door. “<em>Muffliato</em>. <em>Repello Hominem.</em>”</p>
<p>“Where did you learn those?” Tonks asked, mildly impressed.</p>
<p>Harry laughed. “Your Uncle teaches me. He knows many things.”</p>
<p>“Many things,” Tonks drawled with a smirk. Harry flushed and elbowed her in the side, jostling Freia. Freia shrieked again.</p>
<p>“Shut up, Freia. I barely moved you,” Harry laughed. He picked up the dragonet and set her on the ground. Freia was only a week old and she was at least ten times the size she had been when she was born. He had been feeding her raw meat what felt like constantly, and she was never satisfied. She really was like a child. “Your Uncle hasn’t been in my bed since the first night.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I know that’s not true,” Tonks drawled. “It’s okay if you sleep with him, Harry. I won’t tell.”</p>
<p>“I would never, Tonks,” Harry said, though he wasn’t sure if he was lying or not. “He killed your father.”</p>
<p>“And he’s loyal to you. He swore his life, Harry. <em>Voldemort</em>, who is intent on staying alive <em>forever</em>, swore his life to you. You’re attracted to him, I know,” Tonks began.</p>
<p>“Who isn’t? He’s a beautiful man,” Harry said with pursed lips, looking away and Tonks laughed.</p>
<p>“I’m not. He’s my Uncle,” Tonks said.</p>
<p>Harry snorted. “Well, yes. I just...I can’t, Tonks. I did it once. For my people. And it’s no longer required of me. It’s finished.”</p>
<p>Tonks looked at him for a long time, as if she could see through him and his words. Harry looked away, looking down at Freia as she explored his room, her tail lazing behind her as she crawled forward. Teddy crawled to the edge of the bed, reaching fat baby hands towards the dragon. Harry grabbed Teddy and set him in the middle of the bed again.</p>
<p>“I’m not here to discuss Uncle, for once,” Tonks said, rolling her eyes. “I overheard something.”</p>
<p>“Gossip?” Harry asked, flatly.</p>
<p>Tonks hummed. “No. Plotting. Against you. Moody is trying to form your council for you.”</p>
<p>“My Council?” Harry asked, softly.</p>
<p>“Yes. Every King or Queen has a council. Draco’s Council consists of the Lady of the Coin, his mother, the Commander of the Archers, the commander of the Calvary, the Lord of Whispers, the General of the Aurors, and the Chancellor. Lord Chancellor Voldemort,” Tonks said, her gaze quite heavy.</p>
<p>“The Chancellor? What’s his job?” Harry asked, softly.</p>
<p>“Voldemort can help you the most because the Chancellor is the presider of Justice. He knows the law better than anyone. He executes justice on behalf of the ruler. As Chancellor to Bellatrix, he ruled. As Chancellor to Draco, I think his power has lessened. Narcissa has Draco’s ear,” Tonks explained softly and she sighed, falling back on the bed. Harry fell next to her, lying on his side, running his fingers up and down Teddy’s chubby legs.</p>
<p>“And Moody...Moody thinks he can control me. If he’s on my Council?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>Tonks nodded. “But, he can’t. We now know what he’s planning. You have the power in this situation, Harry. You.”</p>
<p>Harry swallowed. “Okay. Let’s get to work.”</p>

<p align="center"> <strong>WHO</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p align="center"> <br/></p>
<p>Gabrielle’s head was bent over the shredded shirt, painstakingly run the thread through the tatters of cotton. She smiled to herself as the cloth came together as if it had never been torn in the first place. Fleur watched. Gabrielle hadn’t even noticed her, so focused on her <em>work</em>. There was a half-trunk of mended clothing already. Fleur couldn’t remember a time when Gabrielle had been so dedicated to their work rather than a book.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Fleur asked, eyes narrowed in suspicion.</p>
<p>Gabrielle jumped at Fleur’s voice.</p>
<p>“Um...mending. Like I’m supposed to,” Gabrielle muttered. Fleur looked at her sister in disbelief.</p>
<p>“I see. When you’ve just spent coin on Master Binns’ new volume on the rise of the Slytherins?” Fleur asked, laughing softly.</p>
<p>Gabrielle flushed. “You’re always yelling at me for not helping so, I’m helping,” she grumbled under her breath. She let out a tiny yelp as she pricked her finger again, blood welling to the surface, beading on to the shirt.</p>
<p>Fleur hummed. Now that she looked carefully, there were tiny spots of blood on everything and Gabrielle’s fingers looked bright red, smeared with dried blood. She was putting <em>effort </em>in.</p>
<p>“You’re hurting yourself to do this. Do you wish to tell me why you haven’t given me this massive trunk of clothing? You’re smearing blood on everything,” Fleur said pointedly.</p>
<p>Gabrielle flushed. “I can do it by myself, <em>Fleur</em>,” she snapped. “A customer came in and he—”</p>
<p>Fleur laughed again, bright, like sound of pealing bells.</p>
<p>“Ah. <em>He</em>.”</p>
<p>Gabrielle dropped the shirt, needle, and thread into her lap. She glared.</p>
<p>“It’s not like that!” she protested. “He’s not...it’s not...he’s a creature, I think. Like us.”</p>
<p>Fleur shrugged and gave her sister a knowing smirk. “Perhaps. Or perhaps you find him attractive,” Fleur suggested. Gabrielle made another sound of protest. “Ah, ah. Why is this so hard for you to admit?”</p>
<p>Gabrielle huffed and shook her head as she picked up her mending. She intended to finish at least two more shirts before she went to bathe and curl up with her book. The day had been long and she was tired and tomorrow, she’d have to wash the shirts of her blood and get started on the trousers.</p>
<p>“He’s not...attractive. In the regular way. He’s odd. Intriguing. A mystery,” Gabrielle said.</p>
<p>Fleur frowned at her little sister’s insistence.</p>
<p>“If you’re not going to talk to me about it, fine. But just...don’t do anything stupid. His clothes are fine, though tattered. He is a wealthy man and wealth means power. We don’t want to attract the wrong sort of attention,” Fleur said, snippily.</p>
<p>“I <em>know</em>, Fleur,” Gabrielle groaned in exasperation.</p>
<p>She watched her sister's back as the beautiful woman danced away the back room, probably to continue up one of the many Independence Day ball commissions that she had been receiving over the past few weeks. Abrielle glared for a moment before her harsh expression softened into a pensive look.</p>
<p>She wondered what Mr. Greyback had been doing that had reduced his beautiful clothing into shreds. She wondered if he was a wealthy man, as her sister perceived. Perhaps he was one of the Dukes of the Council, a creature flying under the radar to make right the country. Or even an adventurer of sorts. He had the rugged look of a man who knew the woods well. Perhaps he’d even been to the most famous woods of all—the Forbidden Forest.</p>
<p>Gabrielle glanced at Master Binns’ new tome, all about the Slytherins. It almost called to her.</p>
<p>“No...got to finish the shirts like I said,” she muttered to herself before she let out a long sigh.</p>
<p>There was work to be done and the candles wouldn’t burn forever.</p>

  <strong>IS FAIREST</strong>

<p>“You have...a dragon,” Ron said, stupidly, looking at the dragonet curled into Harry’s lap. His lips were curled in disgust as Harry tried to coax the strips of cooked beef to the dragonet. It was shrieking is dislike, turning its head away.</p>
<p>“I’ve had a dragon for two weeks, Ron,” Harry said without looking up. “Freia, my love, you must eat.”</p>
<p>Charlie cleared his throat. Helpfully, he said, “Baby dragons should be fed a bucket of brandy mixed with chicken blood on a half-hour basis.” Harry looked up, sharply, his green eyes narrowed. “Uh, but meat is good too. Probably raw meat would be better.”</p>
<p>“Charlie...don’t piss him off. He’s got a <em>dragon</em>,” Fred hissed from the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>George snorted. “Yeah. You know the beast that was raised from <em>extinction</em>.”</p>
<p>“You’re not nearly as quiet as you think, my friends. Freia is not a <em>beast</em>,” Harry said, his eyes cold and Ginny cleared her throat, thinking better of her jests about the baby dragon in Harry’s lap. “Are you sure about this, Charlie?”</p>
<p>“Uh, yes, your Grace. I’m...I really like dragons,” Charlie said with pink in his cheeks.</p>
<p>Harry smiled, beautifully, making Charlie flush darker. "I do too. Charlie, will you do something for me? Take Fred and George and help the cooks prepare at least two vats for Freia. I want to know that I'm doing the right thing by her. And if you see me doing anything else wrong, correct me."</p>
<p>“Yes, your Grace,” Charlie said, bowing and taking a step back.</p>
<p>Fred and George mocked their brother, mouthing ‘your Grace, your Grace’, their faces twisted with amusement. Harry snorted behind his hand as the trio stepped out, leaving Ron, Ginny, and Bill. Percy was off, following after McGonagall, with notes in hand, as per usual.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you have a bloody dragon,” Ron said, shaking his head in disbelief as he sat on the edge of the table. He looked at the dragon, purring like a cat. “You reckon it can breathe fire?”</p>
<p>“Only smoke at the moment. She’s growing so fast,” Harry said, softly. “Just a week ago, she could fit into my hands. Now, she’s the size of a cat.”</p>
<p>“Her name is ‘Freia’. What does it mean?” Bill asked, curiously, pulling out a chair and sitting down, his eyes trained on Freia. Harry continued to stroke Freia’s head as if he didn’t notice the razor sharp teeth that were piercing through her gums, and the sharpening horns along her body.</p>
<p>"Freia means ‘lady' in one of the old, ancient languages. She was an old god of love, beauty, war, and death," Harry said, patiently.</p>
<p>Ginny’s eyes narrowed, shrewdly. “The embodiment of this war.”</p>
<p>Freia let out a screech, as if approving of Ginny’s words.</p>
<p>Harry’s lips curled into a tight smile. “Exactly.”</p>
<hr/>
<p align="center"> <strong>OF THEM</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p align="center"> <br/></p>
<p>Her eyes burned as waded through the ocean, her gown and cloak waterlogged. The only thing keeping her afloat was the selkie skin that she had stolen, wrapped around her to keep her as warm as she could be in the frigid icy waters. Bellatrix could smell it, taste it on her tongue—the salt bridge was near.</p>
<p>Bellatrix grit her teeth against the burning salt as she reached forward with her heavy arm. She curled her fingers into the churning sea and let out a sound of triumph as her fingers sunk into something hard and rocky. She ripped at it and saw little coral-colored crystals cutting into the hardened skin of her palm.</p>
<p>With effort, she pulled herself out of the ocean and crawled onto the hard surface. Bellatrix watched in wonder as the salt bridge rose from just beneath the surface, a long pink bridge that led farther and farther away from the shores of Albion.</p>
<p>Bellatrix looked over her shoulder. The mountains and beaches of Albion were lost to the night, formless shadows on a moonless horizon. Her Albion, her empire. It nearly made her want to weep. All of the things that she had lost in her sister's pursuit of power. Her throne, her Albion, her brother. <em>Tom</em>.</p>
<p>Tom who had the Fairest on his lap. Tom who had not come for her. Tom who had forgotten her.</p>
<p>Bellatrix let out a cry and slammed her fist into the salt bridge. The jagged edges cut into her skin, blood streaking. The cuts burned, the salt of the ocean still dripping off of her in puddles onto the salt bridge.</p>
<p>The crone pushed herself to her feet, a foul expression upon her face as she began to walk. She would walk until she found the end of this salt bridge until she found the Sea Warlock. He would help restore her to her former bliss. He would return her beauty and her magic. Bellatrix would not stop, though the soles of her feet were touch and streaked with red from broken blisters. She would not fail.</p>
<p>She would pay any price.</p>
<p>“We will seek and we will find. I wonder...I wonder...I wonder. So, so far, we shall have his heart. We shall have his heart. And his heart is ours...and his heart is <em>mine</em>,” Bellatrix promised herself and she closed her eyes against the salty winds, tears streaking down her wizened face.</p>
<p>She imagined that stupid boy’s glassy green eyes. How they would look when she had broken his heart out of his chest with her own bare hands.</p>
<p>Eyes wide with horror. Skin pale as death. Lips red with his own blood. Black hair strewn across the ground. Agony. She would keep him alive until the very end.</p>
<p>He had taken from her.</p>
<p>He had taken her beauty.</p>
<p>He had taken her brother.</p>
<p>She would take his heart.</p>
<hr/>
<p align="center"> <strong>ALL?</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p align="center"> <br/></p>
<p>She sat before the fragile pages of the old tome, unseeing. The words had blurred together on her page, becoming nothing more than nonsense, read a thousand times over. There was nothing in the book that she had not known, that she had not lived. Reading it all, her histories had once given her comfort. No longer. The old woman pushed the book from her desk, violently. It hit the floor with a heavy thud, dying in a small cloud of dust.</p>
<p>The old woman stood, abruptly, dark blue robes dragging across the rotting wooden floors. She gazed out of the window, her eyes caught on the Narrow Sea. If she looked far enough right, she could see the shapeless form of the Narrow Bridge. The great bridge had been one of the accomplishments she had been most proud of. If she looked far enough across the sea, she thought she might be able to see the coast to the mainland.</p>
<p>How she missed the mainland. How she missed Essetir, the East.</p>
<p>The tide was high, frothing, swirling blackness brushing across white stone, as if they were lovers. Really, it was only old cliffs, on which her little cottage teetered on the edge of.</p>
<p>Nothing more and nothing less.</p>
<p>The woman turned away from the window, her long silver mane swinging against her back. She walked as a queen should. She looked to the second bedroom. She wondered if her beloved friend was asleep or if he had been awakened by the knocking of magic too.</p>
<p>The Once Queen shook herself and sat her armchair, eyes sliding shut. When she stared at the black of her eyelids, she could remember Helena’s laughter—Helena who hurt to remember at all—and Lily running through the orchards, Fawkes soaring high above her. She could remember watching Lily scale trees like a small money and James crawling up after her.</p>
<p>“Rowena.”</p>
<p>The voice trembled with age. Rowena Ravenclaw remembered a time when Salazar’s voice inspired fear and respect, full of power.</p>
<p>“Salazar?” she asked.</p>
<p>“The blade burned.”</p>
<p>Rowena flinched.</p>
<p>“There’s...so, the rumors are true. Lily had a son...there’s an <em>Heir</em>,” Rowena whispered, her voice cracking with hope. She didn’t dare smile just yet, not when it felt so unreal.</p>
<p>Salazar nodded. “A Prince, Rowena. A Prince <em>lives</em>.”</p>
<p>Rowena stood from her seat so suddenly, her armchair rocked, scraping against the wooden floors. She went to Salazar, gripping his forearms tight. His emotions were hard to discern, as per usual, but Rowena saw a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>“Then, we must send for him. Collect him,” Rowena insisted.</p>
<p>Salazar shook his head. “No.”</p>
<p>“No?”</p>
<p>“No,” Salazar confirmed. “Not yet, at least. He must train. He must grow strong. The blade burns hot but, he is not ready to wield the Sword. Not yet.”</p>
<p>Rowena sagged within herself, disappointment stirring low in her body. Her ‘grand-nephew’ was not yet ready to assume his place. But, there was still hope that he would bring an end to the wars.</p>
<p>“Many years ago, your wife brought great evil into the world.”</p>
<p>Her words were blunt, harsh, and nothing but truth. Salazar did not flinch. She had spoken the words so many times before and every time, the words had hurt less and less than before. Every time, they felt more and more true.</p>
<p>Salazar was not blind nor was he a fool.</p>
<p>Four children. Four beautiful children. One was chaos, twitching with energy, so much that it ate her alive. One was diamond, unbreakable. One was iron, solid and heavy with grief. The last, his only son, was ice.</p>
<p>“Many years ago, my wife brought great evil into this world,” Salazar agreed, his voice soft.</p>
<p>Rowena looked at him, solemn. “And many years later, the Prince of Gryffindor shall rid this world of great evil.”</p>
<p>“And many years later, the Prince of Gryffindor shall rid this world of great evil,” Salazar confirmed.</p>
<p>Rowena smiled.</p>
<p>Before she died alone, before her time was gone, before the <em>world </em>was gone, she’d have her vengeance.</p>
<p>For her broken kingdom.</p>
<p>For her stolen life.</p>
<p>For her murdered Helena.</p>
