          <div class="userstuff"><p>In this moment, the world is a rainbow.</p><p>In this moment, the city stops and stares as people chant and sing and laugh together, a rush of bright colours, glitter and beauty.</p><p>In this moment, London is awash with people proclaiming themselves as who they truly are, supported by a union of strangers brought together for a cause.</p><p>In this moment, Remus could not be more joyous. In this moment, he laughs more than he ever has, stripes of pink, purple and blue paint streaked across his cheeks. In this moment, he flashes back to the day this all began. When he met Sirius Orion Black, the man who showed him the world was theirs to live in, to love in - no matter who they were. The man who helped him accept himself and take pride in himself as a whole.</p><p>In this moment, he was beside Remus, a rainbow pride flag wrapped around his shoulders and glitter spread across his cheeks. He looked like he belonged. And he really did.</p><p>In this moment, Remus realised how much he truly loved this man. This ridiculous, obnoxious, completely and utterly wonderful man.</p><p>Remus took a gentle hold of his face and kissed him, in this moment unafraid of anything that might happen.</p><p>Sirius kissed him back without hesitation, pulling away to laugh after a moment. “What was that for?”</p><p>“Just because I love you.”</p><p>Sirius practically beamed, and Remus felt a lightness swell in his chest at the sight.</p><p>“I love you too, Remus.”</p><p>In this moment they held hands, fingers laced and knuckles white, holding onto each other for dear life. Sirius used his free hand to pull the flag from his shoulders and bandash it high above their heads. He started to sing along with the crowd <em>very off key</em> and Remus nearly died laughing.</p><p>In this moment it was just the two of them surrounded by chaotic celebrations, safe and together.</p><p>In this moment, they were free.</p></div>
