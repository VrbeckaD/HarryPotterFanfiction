          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Have you asked permission to sit at the Gryffindor table?”</p><p>Draco glared, slate grey and steadfast.</p><p>“No, Finnegan. I have not.”</p><p>“Then what the fuck are ya hangin’ about for?” Seamus pointed across the room. “Slytherins sit over there, <em> Malfoy </em>. Get your pointy arse gone.”</p><p>Harry squeezed Draco's hand tighter, dragging him into the seat next to him.</p><p>“Draco doesn't need to ask permission.” Harry’s voice was danger. “I <em> want </em> him here. He’s a fellow student, and he’s my boyfriend.”</p><p>Draco went completely pink and tried to hide the wide smile that had appeared on his face with a red Gryffindor napkin.</p><p>“Just because you’re snoggin’ him doesn’t mean he’s one of us.  Slytherins are mean, sly bastards. Every last one of ‘em.”</p><p>Draco sighed. “You see Potter, I <em> told </em>you.”</p><p>“No, Draco, it’s not right. The Sorting is bullshit. People don’t just have one of four possible personalities, nobody’s really like that. I was almost sorted Slytherin for fuck’s sake. I’m fed up with this crap, with all these house stereotypes. You—you’re anything but mean—”</p><p>At the word ‘stereotypes’, Hermione looked up, all bright-eyed and bushy-haired. “Harry’s right! It’s <em> wrong </em> that children are forced into artificially created groups and repeatedly told that they are reckless, or nerdy, or sneaky. Tell a child that they’re a particular thing over and over, they’ll eventually come to believe it, and act accordingly. It’s unhealthy, a self-fulfilling prophecy—”</p><p>“Granger, it’s okay. I'll go.” Draco moved to stand.</p><p>“Malfoy!” Ron pointed a fork at him. “You're a git.”  </p><p>Draco blanched.</p><p>Harry growled.</p><p>“Seamus,” Ron continued loftily, “is also a git. Therefore, as I see it, you have as much right to sit here as him.”</p><p>Seamus barked a laugh. “It's not like you to speak more sense than Hermione. Feck it. Welcome to the table, Ferret.”</p></div>
