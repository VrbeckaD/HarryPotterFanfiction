    <p><em><strong>Platform 9 and 3/4s:</strong></em><br/>Asteria Hekate Malfoy stood frozen behind her parents tugging at the long straight blonde lock hidden under her light brown wavy curls. She was glad Scorpius was talking lovingly with their parents and taking all of their attention. She cried out as a boy ran into her hard. She flinched away as his piercing blue eyes came to look at her.<br/>"I'm sorry," he called as her father turned.<br/>"Astra, sweetheart, are you all right?" he asked, helping her up.<br/>"I'm sorry, I really didn't mean to," the boy muttered, looking up at the tall man before him.<br/>"It's all right," Asteria whispered, burrowing into her father's robes.<br/>The boy smiled and ran off once more as Draco got down to her level. "What's wrong, sweetheart? You've been really quiet."<br/>"What if I'm not any good, Daddy?" she whispered.<br/>He chuckled, gently taking the blond lock out of her hand and tucking it back behind her ear, "The little girl who's magic voice makes the birds sing? And drives Minnie crazy when her magic pops around the house? I doubt that. You'll be the brightest witch of your age in no time. Just like Hermione Granger. Now, where's my strong girl? I don't usually have to reassure you."<br/>She smiled and hugged him tightly. "I love you, Daddy."<br/>"Is everything okay?" Astoria asked, smiling at their daughter, so much smaller than her brother, "Scorpius, remember to make sure Astra doesn't get into too much trouble."<br/>Asteria hugged her mother as Scorpius hugged their dad, "Of course, Mum. We're twins so you know I'll know exactly where she is at all times."<br/>"You?" Asteria laughed, "You can't even find me when we play hide and seek."<br/>He laughed taking her hand, "Come on, we better get on the train."<br/>"Please, be safe," Draco said, worrying deeply about what would happen to his only children. He'd spent over a decade trying to make amends for what he'd done. And the thought that his children would feel any of that backlash worried him.<br/>The two smirked back at their parents before disappearing onto the train.</p><p><strong><em>The Hogwarts Express:</em></strong><br/>Albus Severus Potter climbed onto the Hogwarts Express happily. Amused by the children all around him. He hurried down the corridors until he found an open compartment. He walked in and froze seeing two grey eyed children, a green eyed one, and a small girl with big brown eyes. The grey eyed girl had a book in her hand, completely ignoring the young boy as the other three stared at him.<br/>The grey eyed boy smiled up at him and Albus knew him instantly. He was a Malfoy. He'd grown up hearing horror stories of his father, but the younger Malfoy didn't seem to be that bad.<br/>"Hi!" the boy called, "I'm Scorpius Malfoy. This is my sister, Asteria. And this is Isadora Nott and Delilah Greengrass."<br/>"Hi..." he started slowly, "I'm Albus Potter.."<br/>The compartment seemed to freeze and eyes flew up to look at him.<br/>"I'll just find another..." he started.<br/>"Nonsense," Asteria called, clearly bolder than the rest, "Take a seat, Potter. Do you know how to play Euchre? Scorpius is completely useless at it."<br/>"Hey!" Scorpius called, but was grinning at his sister.<br/>Asteria winked playfully, "Am I wrong?"<br/>"Be nice!" Delilah sassed, "He isn't terrible at all. Want some gummy worms, Potter?"<br/>Albus smiled and nodded, taking a seat and taking some of the worms. "I've never actually played."<br/>Scorpius grinned, "We can be rubbish together then!"<br/>Asteria laughed as Isadora groaned, "He's so happy about losing. Sometimes I think he's adopted Astra."<br/>Asteria laughed, "Too bad he looks so much like Dad."<br/>"Why aren't you with your obscenely large family?" Isadora asked.<br/>"You are so rude!" Delilah cried, the compartment filling with laughter.<br/>Albus shrugged, "They wanted to hang out with their mates so I just wandered around I guess?"</p><p><strong><em>Sorting:</em></strong><br/>"Where were you?" Rose asked as she found Albus, "I saved you a seat with our cousins."<br/>Albus blushed slightly, "Sorry, I lost Jamie and then I just found an open compartment."<br/>"Oh," Rose said quietly, but before she could finish she was stopped by the deputy headmaster.<br/>Professor Longbottom smiled at the first years before going to through the spiel every first years go through. He led them into the Great Hall and grinned as he heard the collective gasps of all the first years. He remembered his first time to Hogwarts so long ago.<br/>He stood by the ancient Sorting Hat as it sang it's song before beginning the long round of calls.<br/>Albus and Rose stood together, nervously, as they listened.<br/>"Granger-Weasley, Rose."<br/>Rose looked at Albus who smiled encouragingly. She hurried up to the stool and sat, waiting nervously as Professor Longbottom placed the hat onto her head.<br/>The sorting hat instantly shouted, "GRYFFINDOR!"<br/>Albus's nerves grew dangerously as he waited for his name, but he paid attention when he knew the next person.<br/>"Greengrass, Delilah."<br/>Delilah's blonde curls sprung happily as she took her seat. "HUFFLEPUFF!"<br/>Albus smiled, wondering how his new friends would take that news, but slowly tuned out what was happening as he once again worried about his place at Hogwarts. What if he ended up in Hufflepuff? His cousins would never let him live it down.<br/>"Malfoy, Asteria."<br/>Albus stood nervously as he watched the girl barely sit and the hat to barely touch her before it shouted "SLYTHERIN!"<br/>She beamed, rising from her seat, walking to the table.<br/>"Malfoy, Scorpius."<br/>Scorpius took his seat, but the hat took a lot longer than before. They could barely hear it muttering about a heart his heart being warm and true, but also filled with kindness. It muttered for awhile before shouting about ambition.<br/>"IT'LL BE SLYTHERIN!" the hat shouted.<br/>Albus didn't miss the amusement on Asteria's face as her brother came to sit next to her, his cheeks had a slight pink tint to them as though he were embarrassed. The names kept being called and Albus fell into a lull and smiled when he saw their other companion, Isadora.<br/>"Nott, Isadora."<br/>Isadora sat and the hat took a while with her as well.<br/>"Hm...that'll be RAVENCLAW!"<br/>She smiled and shrugged over to the two Malfoy's who waved from their seats across from her. Albus tuned the world out then, trying to control his breathing. What if he ended up in Slytherin? What if he ended up in Ravenclaw? He didn't think he was smart enough for that house. And was he a dark wizard?<br/>"Potter, Albus."<br/>Albus swallowed hard as the hat was placed on his head and he instantly heard it.<br/>"Hm...a Potter. Just like your father and brother. So uncertain where to place you," it mused, "No real desire for knowledge. But, quite a lot of bravery. But, not reckless like your ancestors. Hm...where to put you? Ambition in bounds. A desire to prove yourself. Well, well, isn't that interesting?...SLYTHERIN!"<br/>The room filled with gasps and he could feel the eyes of every student on him. He froze and swallowed hard. He could handle this. He was Albus Severus Potter. He could deal with this. He rose seeing the sympathetic smile on Professor Longbottom's face. Albus stumbled over to the long table where Asteria and Scorpius gave him a sympathetic smile, letting him sit between them.</p>
