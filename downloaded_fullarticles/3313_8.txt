    <p>Percy’s heart dropped. His father was in the hospital, bitten by some kind of snake. The circumstances were suspicious, but he wanted to know his father was alright.<br/>“Lindsay?” he approached his coworker, a friend.<br/>“Percy?” she smiled politely, “Is something wrong?”<br/>“My father is in the hospital,” he said.<br/>“Oh, I’m so sorry.”<br/>“You know Arthur, right?”<br/>Stupid question. Of course, she knows Arthur, she’d worked with him before and knew about their family issues.<br/>“Yes.”<br/>“Would you…I mean, if it’s not too much of an inconvenience…”<br/>“Visit him?” she concluded.<br/>“Yes. If…if you would?”<br/>“I’ll go,” she agreed, “But, Percy, you have to speak to them eventually.”<br/>“Do I?” he shrugged.<br/>…<br/>Only Molly was present when Lindsay visited Arthur in the hospital room.<br/>“You must be Molly,” Lindsay spoke, “I’m Lindsay. I work with Arthur.”<br/>“Oh, hello, Lindsay,” Arthur greeted.<br/>“It’s good to meet you, Lindsay,” Molly said, “A few of Arthur’s coworkers have stopped by as well.”<br/>“I, uh…I’m also…Percy sent me.”<br/>“Is he alright?” Molly asked.<br/>“Percy is fine. He was worried about you, Arthur.”<br/>“Perhaps he should come and see me, then,” Arthur suggested.<br/>“I’ve told him to, but he won’t listen.”<br/>…<br/>“Is he okay?” Percy asked when Lindsay returned.<br/>“Fine,” she answered, “He’s stable, awake, should be released shortly.”<br/>Percy smiled.<br/>“Good.”</p>
