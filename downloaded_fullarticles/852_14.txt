    <p>The night was hot and the air was whistling with the wind as Oliver stepped onto the big ship. He was thrilled for the opportunity, sure, but he’d be the first to confess he didn’t exactly have sea legs. The only other time he’d been on a boat he capsized the whole thing, killing his father and little brother Harry Potter.</p><p>But I digress, Oliver was excited to be boarding the grand vessel. Without his boss Niall Horan paying for it he’d never be able to afford it. But with him paying for it he could, because he wasn’t the one forking up the cash. If it wasn’t money from his pocket, he was able to be aboard the beautiful vessel the news was calling the Ginormous.</p><p>It was a decorative, outrageously expensive vessel, one that Oliver never would have been able to afford without his boss Niall’s generous contribution. Still his room was on the lower levels. Still that was more than he would have been able to afford on his own salary, a meagre payment of averages wages.</p><p>Later that night after he had met a lot of people he went to bed. Lying in bed he thought about all the things that had led him to this moment. Did they matter?</p><p>…Wait, what was that sound?</p><p>The walls of his small room creaked in the night. Above his head, if her wasn’t mistaken about it, he had just heard a thud. Did someone fall out of bed?</p><p>Suddenly he heard more thuds. What was happening?</p><p>He decided to poke his head out of the doorway and into the hallway. Peering up and down, he saw no one. He crept out into the hallway and walked up the long hallway to a doorway, he went through the doorway and then he went up the stairs to the hallway upstairs. There was no one in the hallway. He counted the doors along until he hit the one that must be above his own room. He hesitated before he knocked.</p><p>The door opened very suddenly. A boy was standing there – no, a man. He had black hair and tattoos all over his skin and eyeliner – he looked like a goth. Oliver just gaped.</p><p>“Are you a goth?” He splurted out without thinking about it. The goth narrowed his eyeliner clad eyelids.</p><p>“Yes, my name’s Harry Styles, and I’m a goth, so what?Do you plan on doing something about that?”</p><p>“My name’s Oliver Wood,” said oliver. “I’m a magicial boy, we don’t really have goths where I come from. It’s nice to meet one.”</p><p>“Well here in my world of large ships goths aren’t spoken to so rudely.”</p><p>“How SHOULD I know how it works in the ship world? Id never be able to afford this place if my boss wasn’t payign me money to be here.”</p><p>“Youre poor?”</p><p>Oliver frowns deeply, a dark frown clouding his face. “I get average wages.”</p><p>Harry Styles the goth Scoffs. “Just average? MY wages are more.”</p><p>“Well not all of us  are goths.” Oliver barks.</p><p>“And not all of us deserve to be on this ship they call the Ginormous, or that’s what the news is calling it.”Scoffed Harry.</p><p>“You watch the news?”</p><p>Harry raises an eyebrow. “Don’t tell me you do as well?”</p><p>“Just because I get average wages doesn’t mean I don’t have money for a news TV,” scoffs Oliver.</p><p>“I’m impressed you can afford a news TV,” says Harry, “but that doesn’t excuse the average wahges. If you don’t mind me I’m off to bed.”</p><p>“Wait! I forgot, I wasn’t just knocking on your door for no reason. I wanted to ask – what were those thumbs?”</p><p>“Don’t ask me anymore questions, I’m busy. I’ll talk to you later. See me on the balcony. Midnight.”</p><p>With that he slams the door. Why, it was ten to ,midnigth now! Oliver started running in avle to gfet to the balcony as quick as he could good thing he was fast and good at Quidditch.</p><p>He arrives on the balcony and Harry is there swishing his jet black hair back and forth in the dark night winds.</p><p>“You heard the thumps?”Asked harry.</p><p>“Who’s to say I did or didn’t?”</p><p>“Don’t be coy wizard – those thumbs are bigger than what you know. I have to go to bed now. Don’t come knocking again unless you’re willing to accept the ultimate price.”</p><p>With that Harry was gone. Oliver started crying. He didn’t know what the thumps beant, but he knew it wasn’t good for him and this goth he met on a big boat.</p>
