Her Unspeakable robes were spread out around her, getting a thick layer of dust on them, but she’d pushed her hood back to better read the list in her hand.  </p><p>“No, Draco, I’m not being punished,” she huffed at him.</p><p>“Uh-huh.” Draco eyed the contents of the room and then turned back to her. “What did you do?”</p><p>“I didn’t <em>do</em> anything,” Hermione snapped. “I asked to be assigned here.”</p><p>At that Draco straightened, his arms dropping to his sides. He frowned at her.</p><p>“What happened?” He demanded. Stress lines bracketed his mouth. “Did someone—whose arse do I need to kick?”</p><p>“I asked for this so that we could all avoid any possible arse-kicking,” Hermione countered. She scowled up at him. “Which, if there were, I am completely capable of handling on my own, thanks.”</p><p>“You know that, and I know that, but Potter seems to have missed that memo,” Draco reminded her. He rolled his eyes and went back to lounging indolently against the stone wall. “You know how obnoxious he can be when he thinks you’re in danger.”</p><p>“That’s because he’s a Sentinel and a prat,” Hermione grumbled.</p><p>“Try being his Guide,” Draco drawled. He held up a hand and shook his head. “Don’t get me wrong. I love him with everything that I am, but there are times when I just want to--”</p><p>“Just want to what?” A very familiar voice asked drily.</p><p>Both Hermione and Draco turned to look at Harry who was standing in the doorway dressed in his full Auror gear. Hermione blinked at the sight of her best friend in form-fitting and <em>very</em> flattering basilisk-hide. As Draco liked to comment far too much for her peace of mind—Harry Potter made Auror tactical gear look <em>good</em>.</p><p>“Climb you like a tree?” Draco suggested with a leer and a waggle of his eyebrows.</p><p>“Later,” Harry promised his Guide with a smouldering glance.</p><p>“Right here!” Hermione protested, waving her hands in the air.</p><p>“Like you would mind the show,” Draco scoffed. He sent her a cheeky grin.</p><p>“Draco!” Hermione hissed. She waved at the open door where anyone could walk past at any time. “Really?”</p><p>“Sorry,” Draco winced.</p><p>Pulling the door shut behind him, Harry stepped into the room. He glanced around at the rows of dusty shelves and the piles of unlabelled boxes that filled the storage room, and then turned to frown at Hermione.</p><p>“Are you being punished?” He asked.</p><p>“Oh, for the love of—no. No, I am not being punished. They’re doing rotations, and this time I would have been partnered with Zacharias Smith.” She pointedly ignored the low growl that emanated from Harry. “In order to avoid Harry beating him half to death the first time he made some disgusting comment about Muggleborns, Guides, or my relationships with either or both of you—I begged Croaker to let me spend this rotation doing an inventory of this storage room.”</p><p>“What about your relationships with us?” Harry demanded with a frown.</p><p>“Love, you know the wizarding public has a fairly skewed understanding of how Sentinel/Guide relationships work,” Draco reminded him.</p><p>“It doesn’t help that there have been instances when a same-sex bonded pair will seek outside help to have children,” Hermione added. She shrugged. “They usually choose another pair, or an unbonded Guide. I think most people assume that I’ll act as a surrogate to your heirs.” She wrinkled her nose in disgust. “The <em>Prophet</em> certainly does.”</p><p>Harry’s mouth dropped open and he stared at Hermione with wide eyes. Then he turned to look at Draco who shrugged and shook his head.</p><p>“Hermione, love,” Harry began and then seemed to flounder for a moment. He sighed and knelt on the ground near her. “I…” He looked up at Draco for help.</p><p>“For Merlin’s sake,” Draco muttered. He turned to Hermione and gave her a gentle smile. “You already know we wouldn’t kick you out of bed.”</p><p>A dull flush spread over Hermione’s cheeks. It had been only the once, and that was mostly because being with both Harry and Draco just made the place inside her that belonged to <em>her</em> Sentinel ache with longing.</p><p>“I know that,” she muttered, averting her gaze.</p><p>“Hey.” Harry put one gloved finger under her chin and tilted her face up until she was looking him in the face. “Draco or I would never want to do anything that would upset you. If we come to a place where everyone is okay with that, then okay. If we don’t, there are other options. Magic is useful like that.”</p><p>“There’s always adoption,” Draco added. He smirked at Hermione. “Maybe a nice Muggleborn orphan.”</p><p>A startled laugh escaped Hermione. “There must be at least one pale, little, blond orphan out there,” she agreed.</p><p>“It wouldn’t matter if they were or not,” Draco said with an unbecoming smugness. “The adoption ritual would take care of all of that.”</p><p>“All right?” Harry asked watching her with a worried expression.</p><p>“Yes, fine,” Hermione sighed. She poked him in the shoulder. “Don’t you dare threaten Croaker. I have enough rumours flying about this place without you acting like you’re my Sentinel.”</p><p>“Sweetheart, you’re part of my pride. I’m your Alpha. How am I not your Sentinel?” Harry asked drily. Then he softened and tucked a stray curl behind her ear. “At least until the arsehole that belongs to you shows up, I’m going to do my damnedest to keep you safe for him. Not that he deserves you.”</p><p>“What if he is a she?” Hermione teased him.</p><p>“She’s still an arsehole,” Harry said stubbornly. “You’ve been online for seven years. You’ve bounced all over the place looking for her. Where is she?”</p><p>“I have every confidence that my Sentinel is kicking in the teeth of some arseholes that deserve it,” Hermione told him with a shrug.</p><p>It was the only thing that made sense to her because Harry was right. She had been online for seven years. As a witch, she was infinitely more mobile than most people. She had attended Sentinel/Guide meet &amp; greets all over the world—both muggle and magical. None of the many, many, <em>many</em> Sentinels that she had met had been hers. There had been a couple that had been close, but there was always that little something missing that made her shake her head and say ‘no.’</p><p>The only Sentinels that she hadn’t been able to meet were those in active military manoeuvres, or who were doing classified, secret work. There had been a couple of governments who had offered to pull in their Sentinels so that she could meet them, but that always felt wrong. Her Sentinel, wherever they were, was doing what they needed to do, and protecting the tribe. Hermione could wait.</p><p>“It would be pretty hard for her to be a bigger arsehole than my Sentinel,” Draco stated with a little grin in Hermione’s direction.</p><p>“True enough,” Hermione agreed over Harry’s sputtered protests. She made a little shooing motion at the both of them. “Take your arsehole and go. I’ve got an inventory to update.”</p><p>Draco looked around the room suspiciously. “When was the last time they did an inventory on this room?”</p><p>“1826,” Hermione replied. She shook her head at both wizards. “I chose this room <em>because</em> the records are shoddy and incomplete. Who knows what I might find in here?”</p><p>“Merlin only knows,” Draco muttered as he ran his finger through a thick layer of dust. He frowned at his finger and then turned to look at Hermione. “Make sure you use all the safety protocols when you open those boxes. Some of the really old artefacts will probably just have a scrap of parchment written in Old English or inscribed with Ancient Runes.”</p><p>“Yes, thank you, Draco,” Hermione retorted. She rolled her eyes at them. “I do know how to do my job. Top of my class at the International Academy. I won the Spellman Award for my translation work.”</p><p>“Right.” Harry leaned forward and kissed her cheek. “We trust you to be safe and do your job.”</p><p>“We’re still going to worry,” Draco added as he bent a knee to kiss her other cheek. “Dinner this Friday night?”</p><p>“Of course,” Hermione agreed.</p><p>“Good. See you then.” Draco grabbed Harry by the hand and pulled him from the room.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Storage room M18 was utterly fascinating. Slowly but surely, Hermione had spent the last few months cataloguing every item, updating the inventory list, and labelling the shelves and boxes. There one only one last shelf unit to go, and Hermione was filled with curiosity.</p><p>Most storage rooms had, at one point at least, attempted a basic theme. Intriguingly, this room had no listed theme or category. It had been left tantalizingly blank. However, there had been a prominent theme since she had opened the very first box.</p><p>Every artefact in storage room M18 was exceedingly old. In fact, several of them had been labelled “Ancient.” Hermione assumed that meant that they were at least 4<sup>th</sup> century CE or earlier, since that was the standard use of the word “ancient” when dealing with history or archaeology. Even more interesting was that the majority appeared to be linked to Merlin, which was slightly problematic. Merlin had supposedly attended Hogwarts, which wasn’t founded until the 11<sup>th</sup> century. How could he be considered <em>ancient</em>?</p><p>One of the more interesting things that she had noticed was that the items that were specifically labelled “ancient” would glow brightly when she drew near to them. She had conducted several experiments and had even forced Draco and Harry to help her.</p><p>“Can you feel that?” Hermione had asked Draco curiously one day. He had nodded with a slight frown on his face.</p><p>“Yeah. It… it wants us to touch it,” he’d muttered. “It feels like a… floor cleaner?”</p><p>“It’s a strange sort of interactive magic, as near as I can tell,” Hermione explained eagerly. She waved a hand in the artefact’s direction. “A whole field of magic that’s been completely forgotten!”</p><p>“Maybe there was a good reason for forgetting it, Hermione,” Draco warned her. He glanced around the room and then turned back to her. “You’re using all the protocols, right?”</p><p>“Yes, of course,” Hermione huffed at him.</p><p>“You’ve got your bag with you?” Draco continued with an air of determination. Hermione flinched and looked away from him. Draco sighed. “Love, the war changed everyone. We all have our little quirks. Harry always carries two wands—just in case. I carry an emergency portkey. You carry your little beaded bag. It’s okay, you know.”</p><p>“I’ve got my bag,” Hermione admitted. She touched it, taking off the disillusion spell that hid it from sight.</p><p>“Good.” Draco said with a nod. “Merlin knows you’ve got everything stuffed in there.”</p><p>“I’ll be fine, Draco,” Hermione said. She picked up the magical floor cleaner and set it down with a little pat. It began to move silently over the floor, hoovering up dust. “If this artefact escapes, the worst that will happen is that the Ministry will become tidier.”</p><p>“I suppose.” Doubt lingered heavily in Draco’s tone.</p><p>“I’m careful,” Hermione reminded him. She put her hands on her hips and frowned at him. “What’s bothering you?”</p><p>“Merlin was a Slytherin,” Draco explained. He paused and shook his head. “I’m not saying we’re all evil, because we’re not. Just… treat it like you found an entire room filled with Theo Nott’s special projects.”</p><p>“He wouldn’t mean for them to be dangerous, but the Arithmancy and Ancient Runes were too interesting to ignore?” Hermione suggested with a quirked eyebrow.</p><p>“Exactly,” Draco agreed.</p><p>“I have been,” Hermione said with a sigh. She frowned at him. “What’s really bothering you?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Draco replied. He ran a hand through his hair. “I just get a weird feeling in this room. Not anything negative—it isn’t like there’s a cursed object, or anything.”</p><p>“It’s all the stuff marked ‘Ancient.’ There’s a sort of—I can’t really describe it— an echo? There’s a sort of magical echo from all of it. I feel it when I enter the room, and I feel the lack when I leave,” Hermione explained.</p><p>“I don’t like it,” Draco muttered. “It feels like it’s trying to interact with my magic.”</p><p>“It is.” Hermione patted him on the shoulder. “I won’t ask you to help again, Draco. I’m sorry.”</p><p>“I’ll help,” Draco protested. “It just feels strange.”</p><p>“I’ve gotten used to it,” Hermione said with a shrug.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> “Huh.” Hermione opened the next box and blinked in surprise.</p><p>There was a stasis spell in place over the contents of the box. Cautiously, Hermione began to run through the full protection protocols. Pulling out her wand, she began to cast diagnostic spells on the stasis spell surrounding whatever was in the box. She frowned at the readouts.</p><p>“That can’t be right,” she muttered. “Janus Atlantii? 10,000 years?”</p><p>After several more diagnostics, Hermione reluctantly left the storage room and went to find one of her Department of Mystery co-workers. Theo Nott’s office was just down the hall from hers, and if anyone could help her figure out why her diagnostic spells were displaying erroneous information, it would be Theo.</p><p>“Hey Theo,” Hermione called as she poked her head into his office. “Do you have a moment?”</p><p>Theo scowled at her. “You! I’m still brassed off at you,” he informed her coolly.</p><p>“I had no way of knowing that you’d end up with Smith,” Hermione protested. Theo scoffed openly at that.</p><p>“I bet you bribed Croaker with some shiny whatsit from that storage room,” Theo grumbled.</p><p>“I did not!” Hermione rolled her eyes at him. “I’m prepared to bribe you with a shiny whatsit though.”</p><p>“Really?” Theo sat up in his chair. “What sort of shiny whatsit?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Hermione admitted. “It’s throwing off weird results to the diagnostics.”</p><p>“That sounds fascinating,” Theo murmured. He stood up and pulled on his Unspeakable robes. “Let’s go take a look at it.”</p><p>They spent the better part of the day running more and more obscure diagnostic spells and taking turns writing down careful notes of all the results. Finally, Theo threw his hands up in the air.</p><p>“I don’t know what to tell you, Hermione. According to everything we’ve run, this artefact, whatever it is, was put into stasis by a wizard named Janus of Atlantis about 10,000 years ago.” Theo tapped his wand against his hand. “As ridiculous as it may sound, I can’t think of any other explanation.”</p><p>Hermione frowned at the box. “Should we try to remove the stasis field?”</p><p>“I don’t know if that’s a good idea,” Theo hedged. He glanced around the room at all the boxes sitting neatly on their shelves. “Maybe we could do it in one of the warded rooms?”</p><p>Between the two of them, Hermione and Theo levitated the box out of storage room M18 and down the hall toward the rooms with containment wards. Unfortunately, they ran into Smith on their way there.</p><p>“There you are, Nott.” Smith eyed them with a frown. “I’m supposed to be your partner this rotation. What on earth are you doing with <em>Granger</em>?”</p><p>“He’s merely giving me a hand to the warded rooms. You can have him back in just a moment,” Hermione snapped as she tried to rein in her temper.</p><p>“Just going to remove a stasis spell,” Theo added. “Shan’t take more than a tick, old chap.”</p><p>“Is that all?” Smith sniffed condescendingly. “Since when do we need a warded room for a simple stasis spell? <em>Finite incantatem</em>.” He waved his wand and pointed it at the box, which was in front of Hermione.</p><p>“NO!” Theo and Hermione shouted together.</p><p>A brilliant white light filled the hallway, blinding her. Her eyes began to stream with tears, making it difficult for her to see. It felt as if all of her were being pulled apart, molecule by molecule. Gasping with pain, she curled in on herself. There was a crackling sound, like the sizzle of electricity and she could smell ozone burning. Something picked her up in the air and dropped her. Her magic made her bounce harmlessly before she landed on the ground.</p><p>Slowly, Hermione struggled to her feet, blinking away tears and weaving where she stood.</p><p>This was not the hallway for the Department of Mysteries.</p><p>Surrounding her was flat, scrubby ground. A few scattered bushes and trees off in the distance. In one direction, few hundred meters away there was a huge round circle. In another direction, she could see smoke rising from what looked to be an ancient village, or maybe an open-air museum.</p><p>Apparition didn’t work. Creating emergency portkeys didn’t work. Panic gnawed at Hermione, but she tried to stay calm. Panicking didn’t help anyone.</p><p>“Bloody hell,” Hermione muttered to herself. Had the shiny whatsit been a modified time-turner? Was this some ancient Britannic village? “I am not ready to be Boadicea,” she grumbled as she slowly made her way toward the village.</p><p>The villagers weren’t ready for her to be Boadicea, either. They eyed her suspiciously and seemed confused and upset when she couldn’t communicate with them. Knowing when to pick her battles, Hermione left the village. She hiked a fair distance away before she pulled her beaded bag out of her robes.</p><p>Maybe carrying it around for seven years after the War had ended <em>wasn’t</em> completely mental. Just setting up the tent and laying the wards made her tense up. With just those two things, she was already back—hiding out and on the run with Harry. In an attempt to calm herself, Hermione decided to meditate.</p><p>As the case with most Sentinels and Guides who were also magical beings, Hermione had developed a special relationship with her spirit animal. Many Muggle Sentinels and Guides struggled to accomplish what they called a Primal bond, but to magical beings—who could become Animagi—it was attainable with time and effort.</p><p>The first time Hermione had met her spirit animal, she had been confused. It was like no creature she’d ever seen in her life. She had combed through Scamander’s <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em>. She’d even called Luna over and begged her spirit animal to show itself to Luna. No one could figure out what it was.</p><p>With a deep breath, Hermione opened her eyes. Sitting in her tent across from her was a giant cat… thing—her spirit animal, Banrigh. Easily as big as a bear, and yet possessing obviously feline characteristics. She yawned widely, showing off an impressive array of teeth. She looked every inch the Queen of Cats that Harry claimed she was.</p><p>“Hey your majesty,” Hermione whispered. She glanced around the tent and sighed. “So, we’re in trouble.”</p><p>The cat-thing chuffed in agreement and rubbed her big head against Hermione’s shoulder. Hermione wrapped her arms around her spirit animal’s neck and cried. Her cat-thing made purring sorts of noises and Hermione hiccupped, pulling back and rubbing at her cheeks.</p><p>“Sorry. I just… I am going kill Smith when I get back,” Hermione grumbled. The cat-thing’s purring intensified.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The villagers were still not impressed with Hermione, but they seemed less suspicious of her. Children with watchful, wary eyes followed her all over the village. No one stopped her from getting water from the well. The children were useful. She tried to pick some type of berry, and one of the children had yelled and slapped the berry out of her hand. They dragged her to a different bush and pointed to a strange growth. The child picked the growth and ate it with exaggerated pleasure.</p><p>“Okay, so these are okay to eat,” she said with a smile and a nod. She picked one of the fruits and held it up. All the kids nodded. She took a cautious bite. “Oh! These are good!”</p><p>It was not quite a gooseberry. Delicious, but different. Hermione stripped the bush, filling a bowl from the tent. Berry-things were better than nothing.</p><p>As they neared the village, there was a strange sound, and all the children around her tensed up.</p><p>“What?” She demanded. “What is it?”</p><p>They all looked at one another and then faded into the bushes that surrounded the area.</p><p>“Hey!” She protested.</p><p>Hermione put down the bowl of berry-things and pulled out her wand. She crept closer to the village. There was an uncanny whining noise in the air, and she could hear the villagers scream something that sounded like <em>Larua</em> over and over.</p><p>Quickly, she pulled her Unspeakable hood over her head and ran toward the village. When she reached the break line in the trees, she stopped, completely stunned. Horrific pale monsters darted among the villagers, and when one of them attacked a villager, they appeared to drain them of life. For whatever reason, the monsters reminded her of dementors.</p><p>“<em>Expecto Patronum</em>!” She shrieked and a glowing white version of Banrigh exploded from the tip of her wand. “Stop them!” She ordered, pointing at the pale monsters.</p><p>Most spells didn’t really seem to slow the monsters down. Hermione wasn’t stupid enough to try stunning them, but bombarda and the leg-locker jinx didn’t seem to work all that well. Were they impervious to magic? Hermione bit her lip and tightened her grip on her wand.</p><p>Banrigh appeared next to her, almost completely solid. She roared so loudly that the pale monsters all reacted. They hissed in something that sounded almost like Latin or Ancient Runes.</p><p>“<em>Felis Satedis</em>,” one of the pale monsters snarled at Banrigh.</p><p>With another great roar, Banrigh began to attack the pale monsters. She managed to rip the head off one, and then she carried it over and dropped it on the ground at Hermione’s feet.</p><p>“Ew, Banrigh,” Hermione complained. Banrigh yowled and pawed at the head. “I have to take its head off?”</p><p>Another villager was sucked dry of life before Hermione managed to use <em>diffindo</em> to decapitate the monsters that were attacking the village. The villagers gathered around her in a loose circle—only held back by Banrigh who snarled at everyone. Hermione put a hand on Banrigh’s shoulder. One of the villagers tried to say something. There was some smiling and nodding, and then they turned away.</p><p>At that, the villagers scattered. Hermione realized that they were packing up everything. She ran to her tent and took it down as quickly as she could. She packed everything into her beaded bag, pulled up her Unspeakable hood, and chased after the villagers.</p><p>They were all headed toward the large circle that she had seen upon her arrival. Now it glowed and blue rippled over the circle. Hermione stopped and stared at it. It looked rather a lot like a pool of psionic energy, but she could tell that it was not.</p><p>The children that had helped her pick the not-gooseberries were running with the other villagers, headed straight for the blue circle. She watched in horror as they flung themselves one after another through the circle. The children motioned to her and shouted. Banrigh seemed to have no fear of the circle at all. She bounded up to it and yowled at Hermione to hurry up.</p><p>“Oh gods,” Hermione groaned. She looked at Banrigh. “Do we have to?”</p><p>Banrigh growled and headbutted Hermione.</p><p>“Right. Okay. You can do this,” she muttered to herself.</p><p>Hermione took a deep breath and leapt through the blue circle.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
