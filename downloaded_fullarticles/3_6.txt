    <p>
  <span>“Harry.” Lily said in the consciously calm voice she always used when she was about to go ballistic. </span>
  <span></span>
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry groaned. Hermione had </span>
  <em>
    <span>said </span>
  </em>
  <span>it was a bad idea to use the good linens as a goal, but he and Ron had </span>
  <em>
    <span>really </span>
  </em>
  <span>wanted to play muggle football last week and it wasn’t exactly Harry’s fault that adults insisted on making bedsheets out of materials that weren’t stain-proof...He set his fork down and looked up, waiting for his sentence. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>But his mother wasn’t meeting his gaze. Instead, her own fork was frozen halfway through the air, the alert green eyes Harry shared with her fixed on the slither of wrist exposed by her woolly jumper. She was pale. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Mum?” Harry questioned, tensing. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>At last, Lily looked up. But she didn’t relax. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Harry,” she said again, the same simmering something in her words “Come here.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He stood and padded over to her, stomach knotting even tighter as his mum, still sat on her high wooden dining chair, enveloped him in a tight hug. Her arms were shaking. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ve been poisoned.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry recoiled; Lily held him in place. A warm hand settled against the back of his head, ruffling his hair slightly as it went. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry didn’t understand. Lily was director of a Ministry potions lab, besides the one-woman operation she ran at home - surely she knew what to do in the event of a contamination, and surely that </span>
  <em>
    <span>didn’t </span>
  </em>
  <span>involve having a cuddle. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Mum what are you doing? Don’t you need to get an-” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“There’s no antidote, Harry.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>No anti- </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Lily pulled back, forcing Harry to look her in the eye and ploughing on before Harry even had a chance to parse the words  “If I’m right about why it’s happened, that’s soon going to be the least of your worries.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Least of my- </span>
  <em>
    <span>Mum</span>
  </em>
  <span>, what’s going on? You’re - You think you’re -You’re…” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Breathe, Harry.” Lily instructed, standing up herself to put some distance between them even as she held onto his hands. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Dying?</span>
  </em>
  <span>” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Soon, love. I’m sorry.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“How soon?” Harry choked. Tears burnt like acid in his eyes, blurring his view of his mother. He blinked them away. He didn’t have </span>
  <em>
    <span>time</span>
  </em>
  <span>, dammit. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“A few hours.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>They </span>
  </em>
  <span>didn’t have time. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I can’t- this can’t- This isn’t happening!” he burst, jerking away. Lily tipped forwards in his sudden absence, and his heart nearly cracked. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>But Lily didn’t fall. Instead, she caught his flailing arms and told him “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Later</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry started; he was fifteen but he wasn’t quite used to being talked to like an adult yet. Somehow, that realisation drained his broiling emotions clean away. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Maybe it was shock. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Wordlessly, Harry watched his mother watching him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Lily let go of his forearms and leant back against the table. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>After what seemed like an eon, she spoke. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I told you that your dad died helping to defeat Voldemort in the Wizarding War.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry nodded. The soft evening light filtering in from the kitchen window lit up the frizzled edges of Lily’s hair like golden sugar, but there was nothing sweet about the tightness around her eyes.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I told you that Voldemort was gone for good, and that he would never come back.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry nodded again. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I think I lied to you.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry paled. On the far wall a picture of his dad looked on in stony silence.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When Harry spoke again he had the strange sense that he was speaking for two. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“What.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It wasn’t a question. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Lily winced. Harry thought it might have been from regret- but it could just as well have been from pain. He didn’t fail to notice the way her fingers clenched against the floral tablecloth.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I promise you I didn’t do it on purpose. There was always a chance that he was gone for good, and it was easy to believe that; but at the same time there was always a chance that he wasn’t quite dead, or that his followers would return. This-” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Says they have.” Harry finished dully. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It was Lily’s turn to nod. Deftly, she began to roll up her sleeve. Then she stopped, eyed Harry appraisingly, pursed her lips, and carried on. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry wished she hadn’t. Lily’s skin, usually so peachy, had turned yellowish and sallow. Even worse, it looked almost as if her normal freckles had mutated, darkening, blotching over her skin in dull black oil spills that oozed into each other even as Harry watched. Unconsciously, he recoiled. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Lily jerked her sleeve down. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Don’t worry, it’s fast-acting but it isn’t contagious. And-” Lily hesitated again. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Tell me.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>To Harry’s horror, Lily’s lower lip wobbled. But she choked it down. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It only effects muggle-borns.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>For a second, the world whited out. Then Harry was back, and practically quivering in rage. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m going to kill them.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“No.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Bu-” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Lily cut him off again, more sternly this time “</span>
  <em>
    <span>No. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Harry James Potter, I did </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>show you that to rile you up for revenge. I showed you so you know you have to take this seriously. You will be prepared, Harry, and you will do what you can to keep yourself and others safe if and when this situation escalates. But you will </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>allow yourself to become a soldier. Not until you genuinely, completely, have </span>
  <em>
    <span>no other choice</span>
  </em>
  <span>. And if the adults around you do their job right, that will never happen.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“They obviously didn’t do their job right last time.” Harry whispered, a little scared. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Lily swallowed hard, face spasming. She looked a little bit of everything for a moment; then she stared at their sideboard, populated with neatly arranged relics from Harry and his parents’ Hogwarts days, and she just looked sad. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“We tried, Harry. I-” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Lily froze, stiff as a board. A small, pained whistle crawled its way out of her teeth. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Mum?!?” Harry cried, grabbing at her, too panicked to hate the way he sounded like a child. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Thankfully, Lily’s muscles relaxed. But she didn’t look at ease. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Wordlessly, she pulled Harry in to another hug. He inhaled, and Lily did too. He, trying desperately to pick out her perfume from the sulphurous smell she brought home from work, she...steadying herself, if the wetness against Harry’s neck was anything to go by.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Every bit of Harry wanted to freeze the moment for days, years - however long it took for him to be ready. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>But he reckoned he would never be ready to see his mum die. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>It made him cling tighter. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s time for you to go, Harry.” Lily rasped, even though she herself didn't release him. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t want to.” Harry squeaked, throat swelling with an oncoming sob. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Lily shook her head, hair tickling Harry’s jaw. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Neither do I, love. But you can’t watch this. I,” she corrected herself “Can’t let you watch this.”</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Mum-” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Please</span>
  </em>
  <span>, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Harry</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay.” Harry nodded, too fast. He felt like he was falling off a cliff, like he was about to get run over by a train, like his insides were being yanked out by an angry hippogriff. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>He stepped back. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Lily’s arms dropped, lead weights, to her sides.  </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Voice nearly shaking into non-existence, Lily asked “Have you got your wand?” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Harry nodded; he didn’t think he could open his mouth to speak. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay.” Lily breathed, screwing her eyes shut for two long seconds. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When she spoke again, Harry couldn’t help but feel oddly proud: she sounded strong, and kind, and not scared at all. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>And Harry listened. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I love you, Harry. Your dad does too; and we’ll both be up there together, looking down on you. I’ll make sure of that. So don’t you worry about me. And tell your uncles the same thing. Now keep your head up, okay? No matter how hard it gets, don’t give the darkness what it wants. Don’t become the kind of man you don’t want to be. And try to stay alive.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay.” Harry whispered “ And I love you, too.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Then that was it. Trembling, on the verge of vomiting himself inside out, he just walked to the fireplace, grabbed a handful of floo powder and, with one last look at his mother’s reassuring, watery smile, he was gone. </span>
