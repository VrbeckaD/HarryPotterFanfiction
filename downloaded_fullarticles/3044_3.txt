    <p>It took Albus three tries before he found the correct library corner where Scorpius was hunched over his work. He rushed to the bench-table and decided to skip the greeting and half-hurled his broomstick onto the seat opposite his boyfriend, opting for a needy hug instead.</p>
<p>Scorpius jumped, finally looking up from his parchment and around to see Albus. “Oh, hello! I thought you should be here soon. You’re still in your Quidditch uniform.”</p>
<p>Albus just tightened his hold around Scorpius’ shoulders and let out a contented sigh.</p>
<p>“Al? You okay?”</p>
<p>“More than okay.” Albus grinned, letting Scorpius go and settling quickly into the seat next to him. He scooted closer. “Happy to see you."</p>
<p>“I’m happy to see you, too.” Scorpius smiled, looking a little confused but pleased. He put down his quill and let Albus pull him into a kiss. “Anything special?” he asked, nevertheless.</p>
<p>“You’re special,” Albus murmured easily against his lips. Scorpius chuckled.</p>
<p>“You’re in a mood,” he concluded.</p>
<p>“In the mood to spoil my boyfriend rotten with my love,” Albus declared with a twinkle in his brilliant green eyes.</p>
