    <p>“Oh, that’s just absurd—”</p><p>She gasped, unable to contain the sound when a hand smoothed over the top of her thigh. It was hot, burning through the thin layer of her dress. The polished nails circled around the material, as if following some unseen pattern in on the fabric that Hermione had not noticed when she’d picked it out of her closet.</p><p>She glared at the owner of that hand, unable to mask her ire when he didn’t have the decency to look at her. His hand was tracing over her thigh, but his face looked empty of any guilt. No one would suspect that Tom Riddle had his hand on her leg, that underneath the table he was making her stomach quiver with nerves.</p><p>“Are you alright Hermione? You look a bit flushed,” a familiar voice said from across the table, and Hermione reluctantly turned her attention away from Tom to fix her gaze on the concerned gaze of her colleague, Blaise Zabini.</p><p>His eyes were fixated on her, lips turned into a frown as if trying to will Hermione to answer truthfully to his question. What he didn’t know was that she planned to avoid the question altogether. To lie outright because telling him that <em>Tom bloody Riddle</em> was feeling her up beneath the table in the middle of a political dinner was unacceptable.</p><p>There were politicians milling about. Women and men dressed to the nines. Their finery and their rich perfumes offensive to both her nose and eyes. It was a pissing contest of the worst variety, and to admit to something as scandalous as that. To call the <em>future prime minister</em> out for coping a feel of the newest MP was political suicide.</p><p>She was still young. She was new blood in a sea of political figures that were born into this. They understood the game better than anyone, thrived off the intrigue and scandals that erupted when things did not go in the direction that it should.</p><p>This was a snake den. Recklessness and honesty would get her nowhere here, especially when under the careful thumb of Tom Riddle himself. Or hand, considering his fingers were currently making her spine quiver in a way that it hadn’t for a long time now.</p><p>Her divorce had not left her with any desire to chase after her own pleasure. Not that politics left her with much room to do anything else, either. The double-standard, the inherent unfairness of being a woman in the political realm still left much to be desired.</p><p>It took everything within her not to drop her hand onto his and tug the offending appendage off.</p><p>“I’m fine, really. It’s a bit overwhelming, you see. To be sitting beside <em>Tom Riddle</em> of all people. I would imagine anyone would be a bit..out of sorts with that experience.”</p><p>The lie came smoothly, a surprising fact considering Riddle had not stopped in his light touches, still running long fingers against her leg as if memorizing the shape of her thigh.</p><p>If Blaise sensed any insincerity in her tone, he didn’t comment. He continued the conversation as if Hermione had not gasped earlier.</p><p>“I would imagine so. Is this not your first time at the Gala since being appointed?” Zabini asked, and Hermione bit on the inside of her cheek when Riddle chose in that instance to brush aside the fabric, slipping through the slit that started just at her knee, and caressed her bare leg.</p><p>Hermione wished she’d worn stockings that evening. If Riddle’s touch had been distracting before, than now, it was nearly impossible to focus on Zabini.</p><p>The hand crept higher on her leg, past her knee and over the top of her thigh, and Hermione wondered why Riddle was doing this. She didn’t even <em>know </em>him. Not really. She’d exchanged a brief conversation with the man and no more than that. Nothing at the time had even hinted at this sort of relationship.</p><p>Hermione’s heart raced, but she did not dare turn her attention to Riddle even when everything within her wanted to leap away. It was too much.</p><p>It had been <em>too </em>long.</p><p>“Y-yes, it is. I’ve been to these before, but now that I am a <em>member of parliament</em>, well, it certainly changes things,” Hermione said, a brittle smile on her lips. She hoped that Riddle caught the meaning of her words, noticed that <em>yes</em>, she wasn’t just anyone. She was a member of parliament, and although she was new, Riddle had to behave himself around her.</p><p>Riddle did not cease his touching, but the small laugh that escaped his lips was evidence enough that he caught on to her meaning, even if Zabini seemed oblivious.</p><p>Mercifully, Zabini turned his attention to Riddle and Hermione had a moment to collect herself before she slipped her hand beneath the table and gripped Riddle’s hand tightly within hers.</p><p>Zabini chuckled, lips twisted into a sly smile. “Indeed. To think we’d have the illustrious Hermione Granger in our house. My, it is quite a scandal, indeed. Your political party is already up in arms, future Minister Riddle.”</p><p>She tried to pry it off, but Riddle’s hand remained stubbornly in place. She’d have to make a show of ripping it off, apply more force than she was able in a public setting, to get it off. It would draw more attention than she wanted, and perhaps, that was Riddle’s intentions from the start.</p><p>She wasn’t necessarily a supporter of his politics. She had her own qualms with his conservative stance, so she could attribute this whole affair perhaps to a need to humiliate her. Perhaps, ruin her reputation to the governing body and shun her. It wouldn’t surprise her in the least if that was his intention.</p><p>Hermione wouldn’t give him the satisfaction. She had something else in mind, a plan that she never would have accepted before, but desperate moments called for desperate action.</p><p>“They are, but I am certain we could make the best out of this. Ms. Granger will certainly be a wonderful addition. Her stance is adverse to many of mine, but I am certain we could come to an understanding.”</p><p>Hermione removed her hand from Riddle’s fingers, but rather than move them back to the table, to finger her champagne flute as she had earlier, before Riddle had decided to harass her, she planted it on Riddle’s thigh instead.</p><p>A small smile curved on her lip when his muscles bunched beneath her palm, almost against his will. She could tell that he was surprised, that he hadn’t expected her to do something as bold as this in the middle of the party where anyone, and she did mean <em>anyone </em>could see them doing this.</p><p>It was fortunate, indeed, that they had a wall behind them and not the entirety of the hall.</p><p>“Yes, I do hope so, Minister Riddle. I’d much rather we all got along <em>well</em>,” Hermione said sweetly, wincing slightly when Riddle’s grip on her thigh tightened to the point of pain.</p><p>She’d have bruises the next day, but the knowledge that she’d one-upped him in this respect was <em>worth </em>it.</p><p>“Mr. Zabini!” Someone called, and Hermione turned her attention to the source of the disturbance.</p><p>Irritation curled within her belly at the sight of the last person she wished to see at the Gala. Not even the hand on her thigh could be as odious as the presence coming their way.</p><p>Draco Malfoy sauntered over to their end of the table, a wicked grin on his lips as he nodded respectfully to both Zabini and Riddle, completely ignoring Hermione’s presence in the same motion.</p><p>“I wasn’t aware that you would be in attendance. You rarely come to these things, or stay for very long,” Draco said, attention engrossed entirely on Zabini.</p><p>There was a pause, one that weighed heavily on her shoulders, before Zabini opened his mouth. Hermione’s stomach dropped when his gaze flickered in her direction, and she knew that Zabini would draw the blond’s unfortunate attention on her.</p><p>It was the last thing she needed, especially when Riddle’s grip loosened before slipping higher on her leg, fingertips now dreadfully close to her knickers. It took everything within her not to kick, instead deciding right then to trace the seam of Riddle’s trousers, edging close to where she assumed his cock rested.</p><p>Riddle’s leg flexed beneath her palm, but there was no shudder. The man did not suck in a sharp breath, did not make a single sound. It was as if Hermione had not touched him at all.</p><p>
  <em>Was the man made of stone?</em>
</p><p>“I was just welcoming our newest member to the house. Have you met?”</p><p>Hermione wanted to groan when Malfoy’s silvery gaze flickered to her, his disdain obvious in the furrow of his brow and the way his lip curled. It looked as if he’d smelled something foul, and Hermione could not help smiling sharply at him in response.</p><p>She didn’t give him a chance to answer Zabini’s question.</p><p>“Yes, we have. We attended the same university.”</p><p>Hermione did not say more, and Riddle seized that moment to hike her dress higher and tease at the seam of her knickers.</p><p>She flickered her gaze to his momentarily, eyes narrowed in irritation, and slid further down his thigh to trail her palm between his thighs.</p><p>The only indication that he’d felt that, the sudden flaring of his nostrils and the way his lips twitched slightly. There was amusement in his gaze and something else; an emotion she did not want to focus on, especially when Malfoy and Zabini were focused entirely on her.</p><p>“He is quite the intelligent man. Graduated second of his class, just after me.”</p><p>Malfoy’s lip curled in disgust, and Hermione would have laughed if not for Riddle choosing that moment to slide a single finger into her knickers, caressing just where her thigh met the juncture between her legs.</p><p>A shaky breath escaped her lips instead, and Hermione gripped Riddle’s cock, noticing only then that he was hard in his slacks.</p><p>She wished in that moment that she could touch him directly. To do more than just tease him from the outside of his pants. His belt made that impossible. The entire situation was clearly to her disadvantage.</p><p>“Not only politically affluent, but intelligent as well,” Riddle said then, cutting through the haze of hostility that settled around them.</p><p>Malfoy forced his attention away from Hermione, and smiled politely at Riddle, an undercurrent of something in his gaze that Hermione did not understand.</p><p>It looked like…fear? But why this was so, why Malfoy was afraid of the head of his party was strange to her. Everyone <em>loved </em>Riddle, even when his policies were not necessarily the best. And this was <em>Malfoy</em>, a conservative that had rallied for the conservative win.</p><p>It was only through Malfoy’s efforts that Riddle had made it where he was today. Aside from Riddle’s, otherwise, classically handsome face and charisma.</p><p>She herself never would have guessed how conniving Riddle was had he not shoved his hand under her dress.</p><p>But sure, humiliation was a common theme in politics. Everyone understood that. But <em>fear</em>. No one outright feared someone, not unless they were involved in some shady business. Not unless there was a reason.</p><p>Suspicion rose within her, but she didn’t say a word. She watched Malfoy carefully, feeling Riddle’s prick harden further between her fingers just as his own hand teased at her inner thigh, the promise of <em>more </em>like a phantom.</p><p>“Why have you not told me about Ms. Granger, Mr. Malfoy, why am I only now just learning that you are both acquainted?” Riddle asked, and Hermione ripped her gaze away from Malfoy to watch Zabini, the sound of his chair screeching on the floor drawing her attention.</p><p>Zabini slowly rose from his seat, eyes focused on his phone. “My apologies, it seems that I must step out.”</p><p>Zabini did not wait to be dismissed. He left without turning back, so engrossed by whatever was on his phone that it would be a miracle, indeed, if the man managed to make it out of the Gala without bumping into anyone.</p><p>There was an awkward pause before Draco spoke again, as if Zabini had not just stepped out.</p><p>“I-er, well, I didn’t expect that she’d make it so far. She’s not one of <em>us</em>, you know.”</p><p>Hermione bristled. <em>How dare he?</em></p><p>“Whether she is one of us is irrelevant, Mr. Malfoy. She has shown that she is quite capable. You attended Oxford, you said?” Riddle interrupted, and Hermione was startled out of her rage by the curious note in Riddle’s voice, unsettled by the fact that the question was now directed at her.</p><p>
  <em>Was he defending me?</em>
</p><p>Malfoy made a choking sound, but Hermione, interest piqued, did not spare the blond a glance. She turned her attention entirely on Riddle, unable to do much else now that he’d asked her a direct question.</p><p>His dark eyes were fixed on her, lips curved into a welcoming smile that made her want to simultaneously smack him and huff with embarrassment. His hand was still on her thigh, but it had stopped stroking her thigh for a moment.</p><p>As if he were waiting for her to answer.</p><p>She cleared her throat, mouth suddenly dry, when his eyes flickered low, just where her hand was on his thigh.</p><p>“Yes, I was top of my class.”</p><p>Riddle tilted his head to one side, a gesture that looked more suited for an animal than a man, before shifting his attention to Malfoy. There was something sly about the way his lips curled, eyes glittering with something mischievous.</p><p>Hermione only watched as Malfoy blanched, eyes widening momentarily before draining completely of expression. It had happened so fast that if Hermione had not been watching them both as closely as she was, she might have missed it.</p><p>It was fortunate that Riddle had not kept stroking her, that he had given her a moment to keep her head firmly on her shoulders to catch that break in Malfoy’s mask.</p><p>
  <em>Odd.</em>
</p><p>“We could use someone with your credentials in the house. Don’t you agree, Mr. Malfoy?”</p><p>Hermione’s lips pursed, unsure of what this was all about. There was an undercurrent of something in Riddle’s tone, and guessing from Malfoy’s almost frazzled expression, it had to be something serious.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, and she was just about to ask when all thought of speaking abruptly ended. Riddle’s hand slipped into her knickers, teasing at her slit in that same motion.</p><p>Her shoulders tensed and her spine nearly bowed from the contact. Heat like she’d never encountered before electrified her, jumbled her thoughts. Her insides clenched, and she squeezed Riddle so tightly in her palm that it was a miracle that she hadn’t crushed him from the force of her grip.</p><p>She hadn’t expected it. Hermione didn’t actually think he’d <em>do </em>it. Something in the back of her head had held onto the hope that he wouldn’t go that far, that he wouldn’t do that with fucking <em>Draco Malfoy</em> just inches away from them.</p><p>But she had been wrong, and now she was stuck. He had started this, but she would see this through. She would finish it, for both her pride and dignity.</p><p>“Gentlemen, you do realize I am right here?” Hermione said through clenched teeth, heat winding inside her when Riddle caressed the outer lips of her cunt. His touch was gentle, lighter than a feather. It shouldn’t have affected her as much as it did, but there was no stopping the arousal that awoke inside her.</p><p>Her insides clenched, and she found herself growing wet when Riddle shifted beside her, shoulder now brushing her bare shoulder.</p><p>No one would make anything of that gesture, not even Malfoy himself since these tables were awfully small. Packed tightly with seats that couldn’t possibly fit everyone on it.</p><p>Still, it was risky.</p><p>“Of course not, Ms. Granger, I have not forgotten you are here. It only seemed like Mr. Malfoy needed a reminder of the importance of qualifications rather than <em>lineage</em>.”</p><p>Hermione sucked in a sharp breath when a thumb slipped between her lips, the digit collecting the evidence of just how aroused she was. She was hyper aware of it, the way her moisture trickled down her parted legs, how his thumb felt stroking her lips.</p><p>She wanted to curse, she wanted to seem as unaffected as Riddle was, but the man was so <em>controlled</em>.</p><p>No one would think that Riddle was being stroked through his pants, that her hand was playing with his cock, teasing the head, thumb tracing over the underside, following where she imagined a thick vein lied. It was a place she learned could evoke pleasure in a man; a technique her ex-husband had favored in their lovemaking.</p><p>Ron had liked it, <em>loved </em>it, in fact. Whether Riddle enjoyed that technique, well, was a total mystery to her. He was a bloody robot. He looked perfectly at home there, as if he were enjoying the cool air inside the hall rather than being fondled beneath the table.</p><p>His cheeks were pale. There was no evidence that he was even aroused save for the hardness beneath her fingers and the wet spot bleeding through the fabric. His lips were set into a beatific smile, and his eyes were dark enough that she could not tell whether he was into this or not.</p><p>She couldn’t distinguish his pupils from the dark brown, not unless she was close enough to breathe in his air, and she’d rather not do something like that. The thought of getting closer than needed to Riddle, to being <em>alone </em>with him made her stomach clench in a way that wasn’t entirely from unease.</p><p>“Y-you’re right, of course, Prime Minister.”</p><p>Draco looked as if he might be ill. His cheeks were so pale that Hermione, had she not been engrossed in the feeling of Riddle’s fingers in her cunt, she might have asked if he was alright.</p><p>“I’m glad you understand. Why don’t you bring Ms. Granger a drink? Her glass looks awfully empty.”</p><p>Hermione jumped when that thumb slipped further inside, stopping just short of her clit. He didn’t move it, but just the threat that it was there was enough to make sweat bead low on her back.</p><p>It took her a second to realize what Riddle said, what the implications meant. Horror and something else she refused to acknowledge swelled inside her.</p><p><em>No</em>. She refused to be alone with him.</p><p>“N-no, really. It’s alright. I’m not much for drinks.”</p><p>Her words went unheard.</p><p>Malfoy did not wait for her to finish her phrase, didn’t seem to notice she had said anything at all, before he said something deferential to Riddle, turned on his heel and fled the scene. As if he couldn’t bear to be in their presence any longer.</p><p>Dread lodged itself in her throat, more aware than ever of the eyes staring intently at her face.</p><p>She couldn’t blame Malfoy for fleeing. If she didn’t have Riddle’s hand between her thighs, finger hovering over her clit, she might have run herself. Perhaps, had excused herself in a similar fashion and pretended that nothing had happened at all.</p><p>It wouldn’t go unnoticed, of course, but her losing this battle seemed less daunting now than it had earlier.</p><p>If only her pride hadn’t gotten her in this bloody mess.</p><p>Hermione stiffened when Riddle leaned in closer, lips stopping just centimeters from her ear, his warm breath fanning across her neck.</p><p>“Enjoying yourself this evening, <em>Hermione</em>?”</p><p>That thumb inched subtly closer to her clit, and Hermione bit so hard into her cheek to stop herself from gasping, hand squeezing Riddle’s cock in response.</p><p>“You’re a bloody bastard, Riddle,” Hermione retorted, ignoring the breathy laugh Riddle huffed against her neck. It made her spine tingle pleasantly, the husky note of it not as terrible as she had imagined it would sound.</p><p>
  <em>Get a grip, Hermione.</em>
</p><p>“That’s not appropriate language for an honourable member of the House of Commons, sweetheart.”</p><p>The hypocrisy of the phrase was not lost on her. Hermione bristled and twisted around to ask him exactly what <em>was </em>appropriate of a member of the government, if he thought it permissible to shove his hands down a stranger’s knickers, but she didn’t have a chance to.</p><p>Because, just as she parted her lips, Riddle’s thumb pressed roughly against her clit and began to circle the nub, his motions slow and methodical, as if he were trying to memorize the shape of her body through that single point of contact alone.</p><p>Hermione choked on her spit, and she forced a hand over her mouth to stop herself from moaning aloud, caught entirely off-guard. She stroked him, in spite of this. Her grip on his cock did not fall away nor did her touches peeter off, but it was through her force of will alone that she managed that.</p><p>She was merciless, arousal and shame evoking something that she believed had died along with her marriage. It was carnal, animalistic in its hunger to see this man <em>bend </em>beneath her hands.</p><p>Nothing would please the beast inside her more than to see Riddle crumble beneath her hands, to see him just as affected, just as aroused as she, but the man was cool. Collected.</p><p>There was so much restraint in that single circling motion over her clit that she might have feared Riddle was inhuman. But he wasn’t. He was only a man, even if he seemed unaffected. In spite of his restraint, she hadn’t missed the way his breaths had grown heavier, how it had slightly hitched before evening out seconds after.</p><p>He was not entirely unaffected, but it was obvious just who out of the two was most affected by this. And how she wished it wasn’t her; that <em>he </em>did not have the upper hand.</p><p>“S-shut up, you have no right to tell me what is appropriate when you're—”</p><p>Hermione could not finish her sentence, a choked sound escaping her lips instead of the rest of the insult she had crafted because Riddle chose that second to force a finger inside her, the ease with which it entered both mortifying and arousing.</p><p>“When I am what? You had all the opportunity to stop me. You could have simply left or moved to another seat. I wasn’t forcing you to stay,” Riddle purred into her ear, but Hermione could only focus on the sea of faces around her.</p><p>Men and women were chattering with one another. Drinks in hand and eyes dancing across the ballroom as nothing was amiss. She was terrified of being seen, at exposing herself, but this fear only made her insides tighter. She clenched around that finger, and it was only the teeth biting on the inside of her cheek that kept her from mewling aloud.</p><p>It didn’t matter that no one save for Riddle would hear it. That the hall was bustling with conversation and music. To her, all it would take was one lingering look from someone in the crowd and someone would uncover what they were doing. Her face was hot and sweaty, eyes glistening with tears that wanted to fall but couldn’t.</p><p>She was trembling beneath his touch, but Hermione did not buckle under the pressure. She glared at him, released her cheek from between her teeth and hissed angrily at him.</p><p>“You know very well you didn’t leave me with a choice, Riddle. This is all a bloody <em>game </em>to you. You <em>knew </em>I wouldn’t buckle under the pressure, that I wouldn’t let you humiliate me in front of your sycophants.”</p><p>A spasm racked through her when Riddle forced a second finger inside and curled them inside her, pressing against her g-spot with a precision not even Ron was capable of mimicking. Not without her help, at least.</p><p>Riddle knew what he was doing, and it was only the risk of being caught that kept her from undoing the man’s pants right there and shoving her hands down his trousers.</p><p>“You wanted me to break, to give you the satisfaction of running with my tail tucked between my legs,” Hermione said through shallow breaths, unable to stop the tremors running up her spine each time he fucked her on his fingers.</p><p>He pulled and pushed, twisted and curled, thumb merciless as it stroked her clit. She felt a pressure building low in her belly, the tell-tale sign that her orgasm was creeping steadily closer.</p><p>She was terrified and thrilled at the prospect of climaxing right there. She wasn’t the most quiet, the most composed. She and Ron had had multitude of complaints back when they lived in a flat about the noise. It would not go unnoticed if she did. A moan or two could be drowned out by the noise of the people milling about, but a <em>scream</em>?</p><p>That would be a problem.</p><p>“I’m not afraid of you, Riddle. I don’t care who you know and what you do. Whatever sordid business you’re conducting with Malfoy is none of my concern—”</p><p>The pressure building inside her, the heat and the pleasure, all of it came to a halt. It was so sudden that she didn’t have time to protest from the loss of the delicious friction or kick herself for feeling disappointed.</p><p>Riddle had pulled his fingers from between her thighs, and then, as if recalling just where his fingers had been, smeared her fluids over her thighs.</p><p>“Clever.”</p><p>Then, Riddle was hauling her up by the shoulder. She didn’t have time to catch her balance, nearly tripping on the dress and heels when he grabbed her wrist and led her through a throng of people toward a darkened hallway just at the far end of the ballroom.</p><p>“Where are we going?” Hermione asked between her breaths, heart racing when Riddle did not answer. He was moving so fast that it was a miracle she hadn’t fallen on her arse. His pace was brusque, long legs eating up more space than her shorter legs ever could.</p><p>It wasn’t until they were in the dark hallway that Riddle turned to her, hand slipping around her waist to haul her away from the brightly lit ballroom and into the first room he saw.</p><p>“Riddle, what do you think you’re <em>doing</em>? Why did you take me here?” She hissed, catching her breath to grab the hand wound tightly around her waist to yank it off. But she might as well have tried to move stone for all that did. Riddle’s grip was unyielding, and Hermione, incensed now, swatted at his chest to get him to bloody let go.</p><p>She wasn’t some doll he could manhandle. This was the bloody <em>21st century</em>.</p><p>“Tell me, Hermione. Just how much do you know?” Riddle said suddenly, ignoring all of her questions. She couldn’t see him though the darkness, the room shrouded entirely in shadows. There was no way for her to discern what sort of mood they’d fallen into, his voice her only basis for comparison.</p><p>Earlier, Riddle’s tone had been playful. There was that hint of danger there, always lurking from behind his thin smile, but now. There was an edge on his voice, a something that made her stomach flip in an entirely unpleasant way.</p><p>Something had changed and Hermione had no idea <em>why</em>.</p><p>“Know what exactly?” Hermione hedged, wincing when his grip tightened and his other hand—the one that wasn’t digging into her waist—trailed over her spine softly, fingertips teasing each bump all the way up to the nape of her neck to settle over the back of her head, hand hovering over the the bun she’d managed to wrangle her hair into.</p><p>It lingered there for a moment before he wrapped his hand around the back of her neck, the warning inherent in the gesture difficult to miss.</p><p>“My <em>sordid </em>business with Malfoy. Just what do you think you know? I’m curious,” Riddle’s tone sounded anything but curious. There was an undercurrent of danger that made adrenaline rush through her veins.</p><p>She didn’t know anything. She’d only said the first thing she’d thought of, drew the proper connections with the hints Malfoy’s shady behavior and Riddle’s conduct had hinted at. It wasn’t difficult to piece it all together. Malfoy was a <em>horrid </em>liar, or perhaps, she simply knew him enough to know just when he was trying to hide something.</p><p>“I don’t know anything,” Hermione denied immediately, but something about the way Riddle’s grip tightened convinced her that he hadn’t believed her. She wished more than ever that she could at least read his expression, that she could see through the dark and ascertain just how to tread this minefield.</p><p>Riddle from the ballroom was a different man from the one in this dark room. They were like two different persons, and Hermione didn’t know what to make of that. Her fear was so heady that she could almost choke on it, recalling in that second that no one had been paying them any mind. Everyone had been engrossed with their chatter, drunk with champagne and whisky.</p><p>They were alone. No one knew where they were. And even if they had been seen, they wouldn’t be missed at least until the festivities ended. It didn’t help that the Gala was notorious for dragging on for hours—ending only when everyone had passed out in one of the guestrooms of the hotel or took their cab back home.</p><p>“You’re not a very good liar, Hermione. Your heart betrays you,” Riddle whispered softly and Hermione’s stomach dropped when his fingers twitched against her neck. He was reading her pulse, somehow divining her honesty through the tips of his fingers.</p><p>“I don’t appreciate your lack of candor, if we are going to work together, you’re going to need to be honest with me.” Riddle leaned in to whisper into her ear, and Hermione shivered, his breath fanning across the nape of her neck.</p><p>She opened and closed her mouth several times before settling for the best answer she could think of in that situation.</p><p>“I honestly don’t know. Malfoy just looked so terrified of you.” Hermione squirmed within his arms, but Riddle refused to release her.</p><p>She fought against him for what felt like an eternity before she collapsed against him, exhausted. Her breaths were harsh, coming in sharp wheezes.</p><p>Then, they were moving once again, his body forcing her back until the backs of her knees hit something soft. It felt like the edge of a bed, but she couldn’t be sure when the room was as obscure as it was.</p><p>“Are you afraid of me, Hermione?” Riddle said and before Hermione could answer, Riddle pushed released her and pushed her over the edge. She yelped, falling back into the bed.</p><p>Riddle did not follow after her. He remained where he was, his shadow the only thing she could note in the room.</p><p>It took her longer than was permissible to reign in her nerves, to swallow her unease to answer his question. Everything about this situation was terrifying.</p><p>She could handle Riddle the politician, but she wasn’t sure she was prepared to handle the man looming over her now.</p><p>Clenching her hands around the sheets beneath her, Hermione hoisted herself up to her elbows before answering.</p><p>“With how you’re behaving, the question is who <em>wouldn’t </em>be afraid of you?” Hermione said, watching the man’s shoulders quiver for a moment before a low laugh rumbled from his chest. The sound was all wrong, too high and forced for it to be natural.</p><p>It was terrifying, unlike the smooth baritone from earlier.</p><p>“Well put,” Riddle said before turning on his heel, Hermione’s eyes following after his shadow as he crossed the room and stopped just inches from the door.</p><p>He hovered near it, unmoving. Lingered in front of the door; Hermione unable to do nothing more than stare. She did not move. Could scarcely breathe, both afraid and sickly curious to learn just what he would do.</p><p>Would he come back? Finish what they had both started? Would he leave and let her stay with only the terrifying moment between them in her thoughts?</p><p>Her mind was so engrossed with worry that she didn’t notice the door click open until the room was flooded with light from the hallway. She hissed, closing her eyes immediately to ease the sting.</p><p>It was several seconds before she could open her eyes again, black spots dancing along the corners of her eyes when she caught Riddle’s back, the black blazer perfectly pressed. Nothing was amiss. He looked the perfect gentlemen from the back.</p><p>A powerful man that would soon take the oath and lead Britain.</p><p>His hand was wrapped around the doorknob, and Hermione only watched as he slowly turned his head to regard her, a single curl falling away from his coiffed hair to look at her.</p><p>Hermione’s heart froze. Her body locked, unable to do nothing else but lay sprawled on the bed with horror.</p><p>Riddle’s eyes were trained on hers, but they were void of all emotion. There was no amusement. There was no joy or satisfaction at seeing her unsettled at she was. It was <em>empty</em>. These were the eyes of a dead man, and it was single handedly the most terrifying thing she had ever seen.</p><p>Not even the threat he’d whispered into her ear, the promise of pain should she lie, was as terrifying as this.</p><p>And that smile. It was small, just a subtle curve of his red lips. But it was all wrong. All of it was <em>wrong</em>.</p><p>“I look forward to working with you, <em>Hermione</em>. Have a good night, and do try to stay out of trouble.
