<p>Anniversary Celebration</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Scorpius raised an eyebrow as James led him towards the Leaky Cauldron. “What are we doing here, James?” </p>
<p>Tossing a smile over his shoulder, James said, “It’s our anniversary. We’re celebrating.” </p>
<p>Scorpius frowned as he was propelled inside. “Anniversary? We got married in June. It’s August.” </p>
<p>“Right, but this is where we fell in love.” </p>
<p>“I seem to recall our first romantic encounter was that beach holiday in Majorca.” Scorpius hummed. “Followed by an incredible weekend of sex.” </p>
<p>“Okay, yes, that’s true, too. But what I’m talking about is when we <i>really</i> fell in love.” James’ smile softened. “We encountered each other here while school shopping with our dads.” </p>
<p>Scorpius blinked. “James, we were…eleven. Or I was. You were—” </p>
<p>“Thirteen.” Pulling Scorpius aside, James embraced him. “And I remember it like it was yesterday. Dad, Al, and Lily were chattering away, and I looked and into your eyes, and that was it. I knew.” </p>
<p>“You did?” Scorpius shook his head. “But you never asked me out until we were out of school! If you knew that early—”</p>
<p>Grinning, James kissed him. “I waited until the timing was right. Anyway, happy anniversary, love.” </p>
<p>“You’re so ridiculously romantic. Happy anniversary, darling.” </p>
