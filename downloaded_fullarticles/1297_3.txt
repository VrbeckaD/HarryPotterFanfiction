  <u> <strong>Harry's P.O.V</strong> </u>
</p><p><u></u>Harry Potter was walking around the Hogwarts grounds after his Potions class, he no longer had Snape's old textbook, so he was not much better at it than he was before.</p><p>Harry was not sad about that, though, he did not want anything to do with that old shitty book anymore. Or you could say he did not want anything to do with <em>Snape</em> anymore, as if he ever did.</p><p>He understood that Snape was trying to protect him all these years. </p><p>He understood why Dumbledore trusted the guy.</p><p>He understood what had happened to Snape in his youth.</p><p>But he had not yet understood why Snape had to act so... so <em>selfishly</em> towards his students, just because they reminded him of his past.</p><p>Harry half respected, half hated his old Potions professor. He <em>had</em> done a few good things after all. Though Harry still did <em>not </em>want his textbook.</p><p>Harry did not want to surprise professor Slughorn by him suddenly becoming so terrible in the old man's classes, so Harry decided to tell him about the textbook before they had their first Potions class that year. It turned out Slughorn already knew about it, though Harry had no idea how. But he decided not to ask.</p><p>For some reasons, Harry wasn't as curious of a guy as he used to be before and during the wizarding war against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Harry's personality changed too much after that bloody war, or at least that's what he thought.</p><p>"Harry!" Hermione's yelling from inside the castle snapped him out of his long depressing thoughts, "Come in, it's freezing outside!! We're in the middle of December if you haven't noticed yet!"</p><p><em>That's right, </em>Harry thought, looking around him at the King's-Cross-of-death white ground, <em>it's December. Christams is next week.</em></p><p>That thought always excited Harry, but at that particular moment, it did not. Though it will later.</p><p>Harry just sighed and walked towards Hermione and into the Hogwarts castle.</p><p>"What's wrong with you Harry?!" Hermione asked him after they walked a few minutes in silence. "You've been acting so.. <em>emo</em> lately."</p><p>"What is that supposed to mean?" Harry asked back, even though he knew <em>exactly </em>what it was supposed to mean.  </p><p>"You're always alone," Hermione said. "You don't talk to us anymore, and you always have that <em>kill-me-right-now </em>expression on your face. I'm afraid you'll commit suicide next!"</p><p>"Was that sarcasm?" Harry asked stupidly, not knowing what else to say.</p><p>"The last part?" Hermione asked but didn't wait for an answer. "Yes it was. But the rest wasn't."</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>"So? Are you gonna tell me what's wrong with you now?"</p><p>"I don't know what you're talking about." Harry lied.</p><p>"Oh, you know <em>exactly </em>what I'm talking about!" Hermione almost yelled but she, fortunately, stopped herself.</p><p>"You said I don't talk to you anymore?" Harry said. "Well, I'm talking to you <em>right now!</em>" </p><p>"That's only because <em>I</em> started talking to you!" Hermione suddenly stopped walking. "And I don't believe this conversation is fun for neither of us!"</p><p>"Nothing is wrong with me, Hermione." Harry said calmly.</p><p>Hermione opened her mouth to say something, but no words came out.</p><p>Harry started walking again and Hermione followed him, neither of them said a word until they reached the Gryffindor Tower.</p><p>"I'm going to bed." Were the first and last words spoken (by Harry) between the two friends when they reached the Tower.</p><p>And that was how The Boy Who Lived went to bed that night. But he had no idea that he would not fall asleep, not before he goes on a small walk around the castle.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p>Half an hour after he went to bed, Harry still couldn't fall asleep.</p><p>He tried to count sheep. He tried to just close his eyes and think about pleasant things. He tried every single trick he knew to help him fall asleep, but none helped. He was still unable to fall asleep.</p><p>An hour later, he was still awake.</p><p>Two hours later, he was still awake.</p><p>It took 3 hours for The Boy Who Lived to realize that a little trip to the kitchen was not going to be of any harm.</p><p><em>The Boy Who Lived</em>, Harry thought, getting up from his bed. <em>More like The Boy Who Can't Sleep.</em></p><p>He looked at the clock, it was one in the morning. He decided that he would go out for about half an hour. He got out of the dormitory and went down the stairs to the common room, Ginny was asleep on one of the sofas, he decided not to wake her up. She probably hated him now, that he'd ended their relationship, which is just a fancy way of saying that he broke up with her.</p><p>Yes, he'd broken up with her. </p><p>But don't let that take your mind of what was really going on at that moment: the Trip To The Kitchen.</p><p>He finally turned his face away from Ginny as he walked towards the exit. The Fat Lady didn't move a finger when he pushed her painting open as he walked out, and closed once he got through the doorframe, or shall he say, hole-frame?</p><p>No, he probably shouldn't.</p><p>He walked down to the dungeons until he reached the fruitbowl painting, he raised his hand to tickle the pear (which sounded really stupid but was the only way to get inside the kitchen), but he hesitated as he heard a soft voice humming a song he didn't recognize. He wondered if it was one of the House Elves, or if he was not the only one having trouble sleeping at Hogwarts that night.</p><p>After a few seconds of listening to the soft beautiful humming, Harry finally tickled the pear. The painting opened, and the humming stopped at once. All Harry saw at first was a mop of blond hair spin until it revealed a face, the extremely tired face of Draco Malfoy.</p><p>"Potter." Malfoy greeted him awkwardly, he sounded even more tired than he looked.</p><p>"Malfoy." Harry nodded in greeting, pushing the painting closed.</p><p>Malfoy sighed and went to sit on one of the small chairs. </p><p>Harry looked around, he noticed that no House Elves were present. <em>They must be sleeping, </em>he thought.</p><p>"So," Harry said, trying to make a normal conversation with a person he'd never talked normally to. "I'm not the only one having sleeping problems.."</p><p>Malfoy sighed again, "That's what it looks like." </p><p>Harry searched though the kitchen until he found two good looking green apple, "Want one?" He showed the apples to Malfoy, who nodded tiredly. Harry handed him one of the apples, and they both took a bite at the same time.</p><p>Okay, maybe that was an unnecessary piece of information, but it's already there, so deal with it.</p><p>"You sing well, Malfoy." Harry commenetd after he finished his apple and threw it away.</p><p>Malfoy blushed as he took a last bite of his apple and also threw it away, "Uh, thanks, I guess."</p><p>Harry smiled tiredly at him. <em>God... he's cute with a blush. </em>He thought, <em>No, Harry, you are </em>not <em>thinking that. </em>He added to his thoughts as he realized what he was thinking.</p><p>"Well," Malfoy said, getting up. "I'm going back to the dungeons."</p><p>When Harry looked up, Malfoy was already out and closing the painting behind him. Harry sighed, and after about a minute he headed back to the his dorm and crashed on his bed, and in no time, he fell asleep.</p>
