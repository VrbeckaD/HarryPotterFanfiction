    <p>
  <span>Lily Evans was nothing if not resourceful, and Lily Potter found that now nothing stood in the way of her desires. The Potter family was well beyond wealthy, and she would utilize every knut if it meant keeping her new family safe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Potter family grimoire had been simple to obtain considering just how much information the tome contained. This was something else Lily was determined to fix: the lack of knowledge accessible to muggleborn or even half-blood students.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was so much she was </span>
  <em>
    <span>going </span>
  </em>
  <span>to fix in this world. As a muggleborn she had been exposed to the many injustices first-hand. But no more. Lily would take a leading role in the revolution she was designing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But, at the moment, her priorities were based around the infant sleeping next to her. Harry Potter was barely a year old, and Lily was running out of time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She could have cried of joy when she came across the exact pages she needed, but she had work to do before those tears were allowed to fall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily Potter refused to cry for the circumstances she was placed under.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A week later found Lily Potter on the floor of Harry’s nursery. Blood was streaked in her hair and across her cheek. Harry screamed for his mother behind her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily Potter did not allow her tears to fall. She had work to do.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She continued drawing careful lines across the floor in her own blood, her hand shaking despite her efforts. But she wouldn’t allow herself to dwell on the silence from downstairs or the lack of James’ magic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily Potter refused to cry for her dead husband.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily Potter didn’t recognize the man that crossed into the room, but she knew who he was. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. You-Know-Who. But Lily never liked those acronyms. To her he was always Voldemort. A man playing at God.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Step aside and hand me the child.” It was more hiss than speech, and Lily had to wonder just how much this man had toyed with his own magic and soul to take on such an appearance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a fire in her eyes. Not a raging inferno, but a cold fire. A fire that had been doused in water only to result in higher flames. “You won’t touch him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He opened his mouth again, and Lily truthfully wasn’t sure whether it was going to be another offer for her life or the curse to end it. But it didn’t matter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The moment she saw his wand move she slammed her bloodied palm against the ground. The final mark in the ritual. A ghastly green light traced along the lines of the floor before vanishing. For a moment Lily was worried the ritual wouldn’t work. Perhaps this Voldemort was sane enough to recognize the symbols and cease the attack.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was almost hoping he would, as every second felt as if the blood was being ripped from her body. Every nerve was alight with pain and every thought a cry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But, for once, Lily’s trust in Dumbledore’s words was not misplaced. As a second green light filled the room, this one headed towards her son, a blinding shield erupted from the runes Lily had drawn. It enveloped Harry, seeming to dance in the air around him, grabbing the light of the curse like a thrown stick and hurling it back towards its caster.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Voldemort collapsed. He was no god, and as far as Lily would concerned he wouldn’t even be regarded as a man. But, he was </span>
  <em>
    <span>something, </span>
  </em>
  <span>and as he fell she was horrified at the spark of magic that remained. It remained, and it launched towards the target of his spell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It collided with Harry in an anticlimactic whoosh, and Harry stopped crying. Lily forced her shaky limbs to move, dragging her to the side of his crib and pulling herself up. Her son was alive. His forehead was bleeding, but he was safe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily let out a sigh of relief, but knew she was not done fighting.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily Potter refused to cry for the pain she endured.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another week later, whispering to the doe before her, Lily resisted the urge to panic. No, it was what must be done. She knew this, yet still hesitated before telling the doe to seek out Bartemius Crouch, the current head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She would </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>allow her best friend to rot in Azkaban when she knew the truth. Even if it meant revealing to the world that she lived, she wouldn’t allow it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had been foolish to trust Dumbledore. For all the good intentions the man had, he was only a king unafraid to sacrifice his pawns. She could only wonder just how many unnecessary deaths were at that man’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>James Potter was the first name to come to mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lily Potter refused to cry for her misguided trust.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A month after running, Lily was finally home. Home being used to describe her new house in Eastern France. It was small, but no smaller than the previous had been. But here there was no chance of being discovered, and no risk to her son.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was all Lily could truly ask for. Sometimes she still imagined seeing the ties of magic the ritual wound between her and Harry, but she was comforted by it. Lily would do whatever it took to protect her child, no matter how much it cost her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She would take a new name, a new home, a new life. Nothing would ever again threaten their peace.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the doorstep of her home, alone and unafraid for the first time in nearly two years, Lily Bellmont allowed herself to cry.</span>
