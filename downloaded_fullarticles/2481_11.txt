Sorry. You can decide later. Or never,” he rambles, wishing he could for once just shut the fuck up. “Never’s fine. Even—”</p><p>“I just—” Malfoy clears his throat. He drums his fingers on his desktop. “I think I heard you wrong.”</p><p>“Uh,” Harry gulps down the nervous urge to laugh, “I’m guessing not.”</p><p>“As… fr— partners, though. You simply don’t want to go alone.”</p><p>Really, the disbelief on Malfoy’s face is a bit insulting. Harry squares his shoulders.
