    <p>Harry flips through the pages of the grimoire once more, the old script hard to read. Using his pointer finger he traced the instructional lines of the summoning ritual once more, before snapping the book closed roughly and leaving it down on the table. </p>
<p>He runs a hand over the leather cover – he’s pretty sure its human skin that has been sewn roughly together but the antique dealer had seemed reluctant to touch it.</p>
<p>Spinning around, he took sure and steady steps into the roughly drawn chalk shapes on the ground. He had drawn them first, referring to the pages constantly, the wonky outlines just about functional and able to do the job.</p>
<p>This ritual was his ticket to a good life, the low-level demon he knew he was summoning would help him get rich and all it needed was his soul or whatever. Harry couldn’t care less about what was after, he knew he needed the money <em>now</em> and if his hobby of the occult came in handy, then he was going to use any means he had to help himself.</p>
<p>The ritual itself was generic, blood, candles, some chanting. Easy. All he had to do was ensure that the demon didn’t try and trick him, to read the small print in the contract and everything would be <em>fine</em>.</p>
<p>But as the ritual finished, his hands soaked in goat’s blood, the black candles surrounded him flickered like a harsh wind was blowing on them, before extinguishing quickly one by one.</p>
<p>He sat up on his knees, finally breaking the prostrated position he had held on the floor while chanting. He watched in confusion and trepidation in the darkness of the room.</p>
<p>A sole candle flickered on, giving the smallest of illumination to the room. It cast long shadows, and Harry could only hear himself breath.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the wall in front of him started oozing.</p>
<p>Black sludge dripped from the centre. It was a thick sludge-like substance, that dripped like oil down the wall.</p>
<p>He watched in horror and fascination as a black tentacle lashed its way out of the wall swinging wildly in the air before latching onto the wall, pushing on it, heaving more of its mass out. </p>
<p>It was followed by more and more tentacles until a dark writhing mass was present on his wall. And just as he turned to run towards the book, to find out what the hell was happening, a single eye blinked open in the middle of it.</p>
<p>It swivelled around, a bright red iris taking in its new surroundings before it noticed him. It fixed on his form and Harry felt a wave of terror sweep down his spine.</p>
<p>"Hello summoner," rang in his mind, and before he knew it one of the tentacles wrapped tightly around his waist, hoisting him in the air and bringing him closer for inspection. He kicked his legs blindly, thrashing in the air.</p>
<p>Other tentacles set about tearing off his shirt and trousers, flinging the shreds to the side before winding up his legs, towards more private areas of his body making him scratch and flail in terror. He screamed, wriggling in the hold of the cold slimy tentacles, fists clenched around them as he tried to rip them off his body.</p>
<p>But whatever he summoned just seemed to laugh at the small mortal unperturbed by the struggling of his weak mortal body. Grabbing his wrists and ankles, using its hold to spread his legs and arm, leaving him spread eagle and unable to move.</p>
<p>The eye blinked lazily at the sight of him. </p>
<p>"I have not been summoned in a long time, but I think I am going to enjoy this."</p>
<p>A tentacle now wrapped around his cock, slowly pumping it to hardness. Harry tried to focus, to not allow himself to become erect – but oh, the tentacles were warm, and squeezed just right. His face and chest were turning red now in embarrassment as more tentacles came up to tease his nipples and rub gently at his inner thighs.</p>
<p>Another black tentacle wormed its way up his body, curling around his stomach and up his sternum before slowly pushing past his lips and into his mouth. At first, Harry choked at the taste of the slime that coated it, that covered his tongue. He swallowed around the black length, gulping down the copious amounts of ooze that had dripped from it, feeling sick at the thought of it. </p>
<p>But before he knew it, his throat started relaxing around the length. </p>
<p>His mind began to fill with haze and the strokes of the other tentacles on his body brought forth bursts of pleasure he didn’t think he would have felt before.</p>
<p>The more he swallowed, the hotter and more feverish he felt, the more the tentacles became his only salvation to the deep burning need and desire dwelling in his belly. </p>
<p>His cock stood erect and weeping, flushed a deep pink.</p>
<p>Around the girth of the tentacle in his mouth, he started moaning loudly, eyes rolling back in his head as his body was stimulated. </p>
<p>“My, my, you are a most eager mortal,” the being said in his mind, the deep voice echoing in the cloudy haze of his conscious. He barely registered what the being said, focused on the feeling of the thick slimy tentacles caressing his body.</p>
<p>The tentacle in his mouth slowly retracted, caressing his lips. Harry lunged his head forward trying to swallow the tentacle again.</p>
<p>The being gave a low chuckle, the bright red eye still lazily blinking. It continued to tease him with the tip of that tentacle, Harry’s lust-blown eyes following its tantalising movements in front of him as his mouth ached to be filled once more.</p>
<p>Only to be distracted by the sensation of the tip of a tentacle fondling him instead down below. </p>
<p>Harry arched his back, his aching body yearning for anything to fill him. It slithered into him slowly, the girth of the tentacle widening as it pressed into his body. He felt full, stuffed to the brim with black slippery tentacles.</p>
<p>“Oh fuck, oh god…” he yelled, as the tentacles on his cock, squeezed and played with him. Slow strokes up and down the shaft of his member.</p>
<p>The dark rumbling voice spoke once more, “There is no God, foolish mortal, there is only me now, only Voldemort.”</p>
<p>Voldemort – something deep within Harry’s head clicked, a page skimmed in the old grimoire. How had he summoned an ancient being of this calibre? Not to mention Voldemort had been known to be extremely picky about who he appeared to. And there had been nothing in the book about. . . this.</p>
<p>His thoughts stalled as pleasure surged through Harry’s body as the tentacle around his dick, opened at the end and swallowed his cock whole. </p>
<p>The divine feeling of being filled and pleasured in every way made Harry give a whining moan as he came, the tentacles still moving and squirming around him as his body tensed in his orgasm. The tentacle that engulfed his cock drank down his release greedily.</p>
<p>Harry’s overstimulated body was dropped to the floor as the tentacles released him and curled back into the black ooze on the wall. He weakly groaned, shifting on the cold ground.</p>
<p>The ooze on the wall got bigger and bigger, dripping down onto the floor where it expanded. Soon Harry was lying in a puddle of ooze that didn’t seem to be stopping. He could hear dark laughter, as <em>someone</em> started walking out of the sludge.</p>
<p>Harry gaped, the person who came out of the wall looked like him, even had the same mole on the collarbone. But looking closer, this person’s hair was tidier, his nose different and his eyes -</p>
<p>Red, a deep red. Just like Voldemort’s – that great eye that had watched him being used, now divided into two and staring at him from a familiar face.</p>
<p>It was as if he had replicated Harry’s body, only doing the most minor of changes. Voldemort grinned wickedly as he looked down at Harry’s form.</p>
<p>“The fun has only started mortal.”</p>
<p>From his back whipped out the same long black tendrils of tentacles, rushing towards Harry.</p>
