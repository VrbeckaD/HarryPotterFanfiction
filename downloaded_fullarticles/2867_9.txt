    <p>Spine outstretched, forearms stinging from repetitive motion, (Y/n) cleaned the fingerprints and dirt off the windows to the produce store. The wistful witch stared across the street at the gathering. A dumpy woman with a skinny neck declared, “Come, brothers and sisters; daughters and sons; friends, there is an evil in our city of New York.” (Y/n)’s brows twitched. At this point, she was used to the Second Salemers’ remarks. An overwhelming sense of witty, sarcastic humor fill her body.<br/>
“Okay, haha. Really funny.” She heatedly jested back to the feeling and turned to the pots of green mint and rosemary beside her. “I mean she really be talking about us like that.” (Y/n) subconscious spelled in her minds eye. “We keep her alive.” </p><p>(Y/n)’s square shaped head turned to face the window, staring back out into the crowd again. Her chartreuse eyes flickering past the people, searching for the boy she always kept tabs on. There was something about his gait and posture that struck pity in (Y/n)’s tender heart. She knows he is not treated sympathetically nor kindly in the dark, pitiliess hole he considered a home. </p><p>The boy had come in a number of times with his two other siblings, holding the little one’s hand with a deadpan gaze on his sharp face, not keeping eye contact with anything or anyone. The deadened globular organs that decorated his face so well were down cast, making him seem much smaller than he actually was. He would flatten down his charcoal hair in order to straighten himself, in a way, he “represents” the Second Salemers (without consent it seemed) so he tried to be deemed somewhat in order. “I don’t like it either, but they are one of our most common customers.” (Y/n) continued virtually inaudibly.</p><p>“Yeah, you get a kick from that boy.” “Shut up before I sell you to Mary Lou.” (Y/n) quipped wisely before turning her gaze to the fern that lay still next to the Phonograph that just fizzled to a crackly silence. “Victor Records” read along the spinning disk. Her eyes fixed on the little plant and moved the stems with only a focused thought.<br/>
Minute cracks and pops sounded from the movement of the thin, brittle stems, tiny leaves catching flight here and there; causing a little mess of them to collect at the wooden floor.<br/>
“Besides, that boy; Credence I heard; needs help. He’s always been so kind to the plants here.” (Y/n)’s fore arm rose to aid in her control of the fern. </p><p>Credence really was very tender to the plants, he did not want to harm the beauty of nature. The calloused hands that have been through much pain kindly extended a finger that ran across the delicate leaves of the exotic Mimosa Pudica, the little meek leaves closing in embarrassment; he ran a hand over all of the beautiful fruits; he cupped the soft milky petals of the decorative Calla placed peacefully at the cash register. </p><p>“You saw his hands, they were terribly hurt.” (Y/n) spoke aloud. </p><p>The stem inched towards the needle and tapped it back onto the record.</p><p>Pleasant music filled the shop, with a unified feeling of calm. The plants loved the music with such gentle gaieties and delights. </p><p>She looked back outside, looking to see Mary Lou and the sisters walking back into their building, the crowd still received the pamphlets from the tall shell of a boy that once was alive.</p><p>He never looked any of the men and women in the eyes. </p><p>(Y/n) took her eyes off the menacingly gentle boy to waltz over to her left and ran her hands across all of the plants that were lining the shelves. The buds bloomed and leaves brightened leaving still fireworks of green and purple plant matter glittering the store. Crisp air filled her lungs as she did a sweet little dance in her small shop, plants flourishing and swinging in the nature dance of beautiful growth. </p><p>Rosemary and Mint staring out onto the street, onto the boy, Credence, they witnessed a commotion that they tried to get the cute little witch’s attention. They tried calling to her, but she couldn’t hear over the other plants’ harmony. Both herbs called to her, “(Y/n)! (Y/n)! The boy!”</p><p>The others heard and began to look. All plants had taken a liking to Credence, hence, the others began trying to get (Y/n)’s attention and begain to wail, beautifully. Operaesque cries for (Y/n)’s attention caused her to drop the watering can she had just filled, water streaking the floor in an inaudible wave. “Credence,” they manically raved, yet silent in their prisons of still, unmoving, torture. </p><p>(Y/n) ran to the window to see what was happening across the street. Men- not men, cowards- were laughing and saying something (Y/n) could not read on their scowling bull lips. They pushed him around their group which had encircled Credence. Her ears grew hot and tears pricked her eyes as she saw Mary Lou looking down on the predicament her boy was in from the top window. Credence looked up at her for help, for savior in the mother he called his. The woman did nothing, but creep back into the shadows of the room.</p><p>“Ma.”</p><p>“He’s crying for his ma!”</p><p>(Y/n)’s heart pumped hard, she swore it would jump out of her breast, as they kicked him down, Credence’s pained hands catching him on the damp bricks that lined the sidewalk. Papers flew all around him on the ground, the men stepped on the papers, the water and mud collected on the paper, draining the ink away from the surface.</p><p>(Y/n), in one prompt motion, swung open the door and charged into oncoming traffic, cars’ horns blaring at her to “get the fuck off the road” as one man screamed out of his window as he rushed past. </p><p>Credence’s frightened, wide eyes met (Y/n)’s in a plead for safety. Her shoes clacked against the bricks and splashed in the puddles before getting close enough to pull one of the men off of Credence. Muddy water drops falling off her shin, left a grimy streak down her legs. </p><p>(Y/n) wrenched one of the man’s shoulder with all of the force she could muster from every emotion that she had ever felt, every plant she bonded with aided her with the strength of a thousand sun rises.</p><p>The man, not thinking, struck her off of him with the back of his hand, “This is no concern of yours.” A red mark welled up on her cheek before the scum of a human took a doubletake. “Miss (L/n).” He sputtered. </p><p>“Yes, ma’am.” </p><p>“What will your fathers say when they’ve heard their sons hit the produce lady?”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“Leave.”</p><p>Her eyes trailed them as they began to walk off. As one last “fuck you”, the tall one; Dan; flicked his cigarette at Credence’s slumped over frame. “Freaks.” Dan muttered as (Y/n) stomped out the cigarette and kicked it away. </p><p>As they were far away, (Y/n) softened her harsh demeanor and her face relaxed, crouching to coax the boy from his fear. As I came in closer, his face was stone, eyes downcast towards his grimy and muddy hands tears on the verge of falling, but not showing emotion, his lips quivering faintly. </p><p>(Y/n)’s voice was just a hair above a whisper, her eyes looking for his to give her’s contact.</p><p>“Credence.”</p><p>(Y/n) kindly put her hand on his shoulder, like the way he would touch her plants, with such a warm and compassionate way. </p><p>“Credence, you have to get up.” She considerately consoled</p><p>“It’s alright, Credence. Those nasty people are gone.” </p><p>Her eyes trailed down to his hands and realized he might not be able to get up, the way he was positioned was locked in his legs from the impact.</p><p>“Come on, Credence.”</p><p>(Y/n) said his name many times to hopefully get past the barrier he had put up around him and it was working. </p><p>The gears and cogs of his mind clank and the wheels turned as the metal fortress around his blue heart began to shake and crack at the foundation. Credence remembers her. She was very kind to him, unlike most, even those he held dear to him. Silently falling from his eyes were the tears that never dared to fall. </p><p>“Credence, hold on.” She soothed as she took his hand and with the support of her left hand on his shoulder she assisted him in standing. </p><p>“Come, I’ll help you up.”</p><p>“Credence, hold on.” She soothed as she took his hand and with the support of her left hand on his shoulder she assisted him in standing. (Y/n) pulled him up hard and his body came up with your power, mud and tiny pebbles stabbing both of their hands. Dirt particles and tiny bits of rock adorned the inside tumid red lashes. (Y/n) knew it was not her place to look at his scars, but he needed help for them or the pebbles would fester under his skin. She looked up at the window to see if Mary Lou was watching then she ran her hand over his pained scars.</p><p>A warmth spread in Credence’s hands as he watched as a miracle was right before his eyes. The warmth stitched back the torn skin as the papers around his feet flew in the wind like a whirlwind had twirled them up and back into a crinkly pile in his healing hands. </p><p>“Magic user.” He peeped as quiet as a church mouse.</p><p>“Here, I want you to have this.” (Y/n) sighed, digging into her pocket. She pulled out her hand with a little seed in her palm. </p><p>The seed split open in her hands revealing a small green stem and leaf bursting out and reaching for Credence. </p><p>Credence looked down at the little life (Y/n) was gifting to him. “I trust you will take good care of her.”</p><p>He nodded and in his soft, weary voice was a “Yes.”</p><p>“Talk to her and I will hear, Credence.”</p><p>She looked up at him and met his crow eyes, he looked back into theirs. His eyes haunted her, but also felt comfort in them knowing that she could save him from his cruelty and peril. </p><p>“If you need anything, you know how to get a hold of me.” She calmly chuckled and closed his hands over the seedling with care. </p><p>“Take care, Credence.” Her hand pat his back softly and then headed back to her shop. </p><p>His eyes fell down to the seedling and whispered, “Thank you,” he paused thinking of her name “Miss (L/n).”</p><p>A wide smile and a blush creeped onto her face as she had heard him say her name as she wiped up the spilled water. </p><p>“See you soon, Miss (Y/n).” </p><p>“See you soon, Credence.”</p>
