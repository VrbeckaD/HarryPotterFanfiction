    <p align="center"><em>I met you in the dark, you lit me up</em><br/> <em>You made me feel as though I was enough</em><br/> <em>We danced the night away, we drank too much</em><br/> <em>I held your hair back when</em><br/> <em>You were throwing up</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>Then you smiled over your shoulder</em><br/> <em>For a minute, I was stone-cold sober</em><br/> <em>I pulled you closer to my chest</em><br/> <em>And you asked me to stay over</em><br/> <em>I said, I already told ya</em><br/> <em> <em>I think that you should get some rest</em> </em></p>

<p>After the Battle of Hogwarts, and Voldemort was ultimately defeated, the Malfoys disappeared from the wizarding world for a while. The remaining Death Eaters were apprehended and sent to Azkaban, except for Lucius Malfoy, who lived out the rest of his days on his death bed, with his wife dutifully by his side until his very last breath. Draco never found out what his cause of death was, but gauging by his mother's reaction, he must have had it coming.</p>
<p>Draco and Narcissa decided to not return to Malfoy Manor, both agreeing that the property had too many dark memories, and quite frankly, Draco would not be able to sleep there, knowing the horrible things that had happened under that roof. Instead, they decided to re-do the layout of the whole Malfoy Estate, repurposing Malfoy Manor as an orphanage for the many children that became orphans from the war. Off to the side of the orphanage was a decent amount of land that was sectioned off by high bushes, and a small cottage in the middle, surrounded by flowers. They kept their life quiet, Draco only leaving the house to work at the Ministry while Narcissa stayed at home.</p>
<p>"Are you sure about this, Draco?" Narcissa asked, looking her son over and fixing his tie.</p>
<p>"Yes, mother. I'm tired of the owls coming in and dropping these invitations out, and people at work have been asking why I never come to these things." He looked at himself in the mirror again before picking up his formal robes. "I'll show up this once, say hello, have a few drinks, and hopefully they will get off my case about not having a social life."</p>
<p>Narcissa nodded, pecking him on the cheek before letting him through the floo and to the Ministry.</p>
<p>Bright green flames gave way to the familiar marble flooring of the Ministry, and Draco was greeted by a ministry worker he did not know. The young man looked like he had just graduated, barely starting his life and his career. He escorted Draco to the ballroom, already filled with familiar faces from his younger years. He stood at the front for a few pictures for the Prophet before entering through the double doors.</p>
<p>The room was dimly lit, and Draco could barely see where he was going.</p>
<p>"Mr. Malfoy, right this way," the young man said, showing him to his assigned seat.</p>
<p><em>'Great,' </em>he thought, scanning the faces that were also at his table.</p>
<p>The Golden Trio were obviously in attendance, and sitting at his table. Luna Lovegood and Neville Longbottom were also at the table, all with their dates for the night.</p>
<p>Except for Hermione Granger. On her left was Lavender, Ron's fiancée, and on her right was an empty chair with a table card that read Draco Malfoy. Hermione was laughing with Lavender as Draco nervously took his seat next to her.</p>
<p>
  <em>This was a mistake.</em>
</p>
<p>"What are you doing here, Malfoy?" Ron asked, bluntly.</p>
<p>"Ron!" Hermione hissed. "Draco has every right to be invited to these extravagant balls as we do!"</p>
<p>Draco pursed his lips at Ron. "I imagine I'm here for the same reasons you are: free food, free drinks, and publicity," he said, staring at the ginger. He took the napkin from his plate and set it on his lap, refusing to look at the rest of the table. He could feel Hermione looking at him, but he didn't want to acknowledge her stare.</p>
<p>The rest of the dinner was fairly quiet. Different conversations were going on around the table, but Draco didn't partake in any of it. He quietly sat there and ate his food and drank his wine, and counted how many times Hermione would look over at him.</p>
<p><em>Three</em> that he has noticed.</p>
<p>"Would you like to join me for a drink?" Hermione asked, shaking Draco from his thoughts.</p>
<p>"Sure, Granger," Draco said, quickly throwing his napkin on his plate. "At least you would be able to keep up with me during a conversation," he said, aiming the last part at Ron, who was too busy eating his second helping to notice.</p>
<p>There was a small bar towards the back of the room, where Hermione ordered a martini and Draco had another glass of wine. She led them to the outside balcony and into a dark corner.</p>
<p>"I never got a chance to tell you, but I really appreciate all of your efforts after the war," Hermione said, taking a sip of her drink. "I know we were never really on good terms with each other, but I do respect you, and I support everything you're doing now."</p>
<p>Draco's jaw dropped at her words. Even during their time at Hogwarts, he was always pegged as a Death Eater, always on Voldemort's side, always going against the light. He was only following in his father's footsteps because that's how he was raised, not because that's what he wanted to do. Before any of his family knew it, it was too late, and Voldemort had already used Draco again Lucius, they could not run away, because that would spell death for all three of them.</p>
<p>Even after calling her a <em>mudblood</em>…</p>
<p>"Wow, Granger. That… actually means a lot. Thank you," he managed to sputter, taking another swig of his wine.</p>
<p>In just a few sentences, Hermione was able to lift Draco up, reassuring himself that he really isn't a bad guy in all of this. A faint smile graced his lips as he lowered his wine glass. He felt her small hand squeeze his arm.</p>
<p>"I really do mean that, Draco, not just for tonight," she chuckled. "It's horrible, the light that's shining on you because of your father's alliances during the war, but I can see you're nothing like him. I'm sorry you have to be on the receiving end of all of that."</p>
<p>"It's what mother and I have been struggling with since the war ended. That's why we decided to use the Manor for the orphanage. At least that shows we have <em>some</em> heart." Draco looked off into the distance, taking another sip of wine. When did his glass become full again?</p>
<p>"You have a lot of heart. At least enough for me to see the good in you," Hermione said, blushing as she took another drink.</p>
<p>His heart started fluttering in ways he couldn't imagine. He never really had time for romances or silly school boy crushes during his early years. He was always being pulled into some secret agenda, which usually had something to do with Harry. There was a conversation he had with Narcissa one day, and she asked if Draco would ever find a young lady to settle down with. At the time, he laughed at the thought, only concerned about himself and his mother.</p>
<p>Now, another lady has stepped into the picture, a lady that he never took notice of in this way before. She was currently blushing as she attempted to gulp the rest of her drink down.</p>
<p>"Go on, finish your wine, and let's dance," she said, standing a little bit taller and grabbing his hand.</p>
<p>Draco laughed, downing the rest of his glass and setting it on the railing before being pulled in by Hermione. He could tell that the alcohol was affecting them both, had they not have been leaning on each other, they both could have fallen to the floor.</p>
<p>Hermione giggled as Draco swept her into his arms and into a waltz, following the rest of the attendees that were also on the dance floor. She wasn't sure how he was able to still dance as gracefully as he did after drinking so much. Her head was spinning, and everything around her was a blur. The only object that she was focused on was Draco.</p>
<p>His blonde hair was combed neatly to side, as it has always been since they had been students. His eyes, which used to be a piercing grey, were now a softer grey. They were eyes she was currently getting lost in on the dance floor. His smile was actually pretty charming, when he wasn't forcing it. She just experienced it for herself just a few minutes ago. His pale skin was flawless, even after all they have been through, and he still looked as young as ever.</p>
<p>As much as Hermione was staring at Draco, Draco was also drinking in the sight of Hermione. Gone were the days of the little girl with bushy hair, big teeth, and the insufferable know-it-all. She was now a fully grown woman. Her bushy hair settled into soft honey brown curls that framed her face, falling just below her elbows. Her brown eyes matched her hair, and her smile was radiant and infectious. She was wearing a simple red dress, one that accentuated her curves and flowed with her as they circled the dance floor.</p>
<p>They danced and drank for hours it seemed, until they finally they couldn't find the energy to leave the balcony, and stayed there, laughing at their yester-years. They were laughing so hard that at some point, Hermione started to feel a bit nauseous.</p>
<p>"Are you okay, Granger?" Draco asked, looking at her as Hermione's face began to pale.</p>
<p>She shook her head, holding her hand to her mouth. "Drank too much," she managed to get out, before turning to the side and vomiting.</p>
<p>"Merlin's beard, Hermione!" Draco said, standing to hold her hair. He ran his hand up and down her back, trying to calm her down as she started to dry heave.</p>
<p>When she was finally finished, he had her lean back against the bench they were sitting on, and waved his hand to vanish her vomit. He waved his hand again, and a small cup of water appeared, and he handed it to her. She gave him a look of thanks as she took the cup and drank from it.</p>
<p>"I am so sorry you had to see that. I got a little carried away," she said, embarrassed.</p>
<p>"I think we both got carried away," Draco said, standing up and presenting his hand to her. "Come now, it's only right that I see you home."</p>
<p>Holding the cup with both of her hands, she looked up at Draco. She seemed to be contemplating something before taking his proffered hand and standing up, walking in front of him.</p>
<p>"Are you sure you can walk on your own, Granger?" Draco teased.</p>
<p>Hermione looked back over her shoulder towards Draco and smiled.</p>
<p>Draco thought his heart would stop right there. He had never felt so sober in his life until this moment.</p>
<p>Hermione then proceeded to turn around fully and embrace Draco. Her small arms managed to fully hold him, her arms resting around his lower waist. Her head rested perfectly against his chest, and she inhaled, his scent grounding her to this moment.</p>
<p>Draco, without hesitation, wrapped his arms around Hermione. She felt so right, so perfect in that spot, and he didn't want to let her go. He brought one of his hands to cradle her head closer to his chest, resting his face on top of her curls.</p>
<p>"Would you like to come to my flat?" she asked, holding on a bit tighter.</p>
<p>He wanted to say yes, but he thought it was too soon, and he didn't want her to feel like he was taking advantage of her because of the state of consciousness she was in. He had to be the bigger and better person in this, at least to prove to her that he was worth it.</p>
<p>"I told you that it's only right that I see you home, and that's what I'm going to do. You need rest, Hermione," he said, his heart breaking but knowing it was the right thing to do. "May be some other time."</p>
<p>She had sadly agreed, and Draco brought her back to her flat. The minute that she had kissed him good night, he knew he was falling dangerously fast for Hermione Granger.</p>
<hr/>
<p align="center"><em>I knew I loved you then</em><br/> <em>But you'd never know</em><br/> <em>'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go</em><br/> <em>I know I needed you</em><br/> <em>But I never showed</em><br/> <em>But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old</em><br/> <em>Just say you won't let go</em><br/> <em>Just say you won't let go</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>It's been three years since that Ministry Ball, and Hermione and Draco had been having a steady relationship ever since. Narcissa was filled with joy to see Draco find happiness in someone else, and to see that the person he found happiness in can see past where they came from. She loved having Hermione over for tea, and always told her that she was welcome at any time.</p>
<p>The tabloids had also gotten wind of their unexpected romance, and tried to snap pictures of them at every opportunity. Their efforts were thwarted every time, either by Hermione throwing her infamous hexes, or by Draco who would flaunt his money to make sure they kept quiet. Harry was not surprised to hear about the couple, and was genuinely happy for them. He knew Hermione and Draco could match each other in intellect, and although he and Draco were enemies for most of their childhood, he could also see that a lot of what went on wasn't his choice, and his actions after the war showed that.</p>
<p>He also made it clear to Draco what would happen if he broke Hermione's heart.</p>
<p>Draco made it clear to Harry that that would never happen, he would never let her go.</p>
<p>Draco was pretty confident that there was no other woman out there for him. He was terrified, though, that there might be someone better for Hermione. That was why he always made it a point to make her say she won't let go. She always thought he was being silly, but she never missed the opportunity to tell him.</p>
<p>"I won't let go, I promise," she would always tell him before kissing him goodnight and retreating into her flat.</p>
<p>He always believed her, until one day.</p>
<p>Narcissa had fallen ill and was bed-ridden for a few weeks. Draco stayed by her side the whole time, only leaving her to go to the restroom or to make food for the both of them. Hermione would floo to the cottage after work to check on them both, staying through the night to help Draco take care of his mom.</p>
<p>Hermione was sitting at her desk when an owl randomly came swooping down, dropping a folded piece of paper.</p>
<p>
  <em>Hermione, please hurry. It's mother.</em>
</p>
<p>There was no name, but she knew who it was from. She quickly cleaned her desk before telling her boss she had an emergency, and will let him know when she can return to work. She ran out of her office and to the floo, throwing the powder in to take her to Malfoy Cottage.</p>
<p>"Draco?" she shouted, running out of the floo. She heard crying from upstairs, and climbed two steps at a time until she reached the second floor.</p>
<p>She opened the door and saw Draco hunched over, holding Narcissa's lifeless hand, crying so hard his body was shaking.</p>
<p>"Draco," she whispered, dropping her bags and wrapping her arms around him. He started to cry louder, and she could almost make out the word "mother". She held him like that for what seemed like hours, until he finally wasn't able to cry any longer.</p>
<p>"I tried to save her," he said, his voice cracking. His mother was his rock and his support, he felt so lost not having her anymore.</p>
<p>"She told me it was time to let go. She was tired, and I could see it, but I didn't want her to." Draco sobbed again. "I don't know what to do. My mother is gone."</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry, Draco," Hermione said, rubbing his back and holding back tears of her own. "Is there anything I can do?"</p>
<p>Immediately, Draco hoisted her onto his lap and held her tight. He buried his face into the crook of her neck, letting her hair cover his face. "Just say you won't let go," he sobbed.</p>
<p>"Never. I'll never let go, I promise you," she said.</p>
<p>"I love you," he blurted out, holding on tighter.</p>
<p>"I've loved you since the ball, but I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want you to think badly of me. I kept in contact with you, hoping we could get together again, and thank Merlin you did." Hermione chuckled as he went on. "I need you, Hermione. I may have never shown it before, but I want to stay with you until we're gray and old. I love you, Hermione," he said, his face still buried into her neck.</p>
<p>He felt her arms tighten around him, her hands gripping onto his shoulders and hair like her life depended on it. She reluctantly pulled back, and cradled his face in her hands, and kissed him. "I love you, too Draco. We will get through this, and I'll still be there. You'll never be alone as long as I am here."</p>
