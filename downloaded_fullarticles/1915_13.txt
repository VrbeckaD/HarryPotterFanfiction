    <p>Broom closets were maybe not the most practical of places, in any way, but Merlin were they ironic. They also didn't have much room, but Draco Malfoy thought that was more of a positive than anything. Anything to get closer to Harry Potter, right? And you couldn't get much closer than chest-to-chest, and mouth-to-mouth.</p><p>   This entire situation was not surprising though. It had been a long time coming, and when it had finally happened, it almost seemed like both boys were desperate. They probably were. After all, they'd spent so much of the previous year dancing around each other, sending flirty remarks, and glances, and smirks. Always dropping constant hints, but never doing anything to make anything official.</p><p>   "There's no way this isn't a scandal." Harry breathed, turning them so Draco's back was to the wall, and fiddling with the clasps of his robes.</p><p>   Draco bit his lip, one hand in Harry's arm, and the other at the back of his neck, "Where would the fun be if it wasn't?"</p><p>   Harry laughed, and kissed the blonde again, pushing the robes from his shoulders, and setting to work on the green and silver tie. With robes and ties discarded, hands roamed, trailing under shirts, while mouths reached necks and collarbones, leaving splashes of colour in their wake. Both were pleasantly exhausted before they decided that they should stop, and sat eith innocently unbuttoned shirts for a few moments.</p><p>   "Dinner will be starting soon." Draco murmured into Harry's shoulder.</p><p>   "Hm."</p><p>   "We should probably go."</p><p>   "Probably."</p><p>   But neither moved for another few minutes, until they heard the general hustle of students heading to dinner, though they took their time doing buttons, and clasps, and the knots, for they couldn't leave until the corridor was empty anyway. Draco went for the door handle first. Harry's voice stopped him.</p><p>   "You should date me."</p><p>   Draco turned back in shock, the weight of what Harry had just asked heavy on his mind, and not totally for a good reason. While he was in fact thrilled that Harry wanted to be with him, he wasn't entirely sure how hair it would be to the Gryffindor. In hindsight, this whole thing was probably unfair, because it gave them both hope.</p><p>   "I'm a Veela." He blurted out, his expression turning stony with the overwhelming onslaught of emotions.</p><p>   And he could see every matched emotion in Harry's eyes, and the realisation of what that three word sentence actually meant, and why it held so much heaviness that it had been blurted out in replace of a simple 'yes' or 'no' answer to Harry's question. The realisation that as a Veela, two years from now, when Draco turned sixteen, he would be gifted (or indeed, cursed) with the innate compulsion to find his mate. And if Draco said yes to Harry now, then what would happen if Harry wasn't his mate?</p><p>   But Harry's face softened into a lopsided grin.</p><p>   "Date me anyway."</p><p>   And who was Draco to refuse dedication like that? Especially when it led for some choice words and astonished stares from the majority of the Great Hall when the two entered hand in hand.</p>
