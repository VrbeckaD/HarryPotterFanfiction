  <span>Draco thought agreeing to spend half of their honeymoon at a Muggle-owned resort would disqualify such ridiculous travel arrangements. He was wrong.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What is it?” Draco asked, staring down at the slips of paper in Harry’s grasp.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Our tickets,” Harry answered, a grin on his face clued Draco into the fact he would not like where this conversation was heading.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“For?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The airport.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco did not need this right now. He was deep into their wedding planning, trying to make sure there would be enough</span>
  <em>
    <span> this</span>
  </em>
  <span> and enough</span>
  <em>
    <span> that</span>
  </em>
  <span> and not </span>
  <em>
    <span>too</span>
  </em>
  <span> much of Draco’s horrid extended family. Of course, Draco knew he’d brought it all on himself. Harry would be fine with a wedding in Hagrid’s Hut or the cramped cupboard he once called home.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco’s plans weren’t even extravagant, at least by Pureblood standards. But it was still stressful. And he did </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>want to fly in a metal tube with wings.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’d rather spend a day on our brooms than do </span>
  <em>
    <span>this,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Draco countered. He crossed his arms and glared at Harry, hoping Harry would </span>
  <em>
    <span>incendio</span>
  </em>
  <span> the offending slips of paper.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Harry rolled his eyes. “Yes, that would be </span>
  <em>
    <span>so</span>
  </em>
  <span> much safer.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Harry, dear, get rid of those tickets. I’m serious.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But I’ve never gotten to fly before! I always wanted to, as a kid. Just the way there, we can Floo the way home,” Harry pleaded. “And it’s not a long flight.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco pursed his lips. Harry was letting Draco make most of the decisions on their wedding and honeymoon, so…</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just the way there?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes. Promise.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Fine.”</span>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <span>---</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That wasn’t so bad, was it?” Harry questioned with a small smile.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Draco glanced down at their entangled hands, catching a glimpse of the ring on Harry’s finger. He smiled back. “I guess not.”</span>
