    <p>Donella Stirling, a little redheaded girl from Scotland, arrived at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on the first of September in 1990. She stood in the Great Hall amongst her new peers, fiddling uncomfortably with the seams on her new robes and adjusting her thin framed wire glasses. Her lips were probably red from the biting already. She couldn’t help it. She was just so nervous! Her mind was racing at a thousand miles a minute and there was no was she could possibly keep track of all the thoughts running rampant in her mind. That’s she finally heard it.</p><p>“Donella Stirling,” Professor McGonagall bellowed out to the Great Hall.</p><p>This was it. It was finally her turn to be sorted into her house. Her name had just been called by Professor McGonagall, soon after her closest friend actually. She truly had no idea which house she could possibly belong to. Ella had been told by her mother that it had always been hard to tell with her. She was as cunning as a Slytherin, as friendly as a Hufflepuff (most of the time), as creative as a Ravenclaw, and as bold as a Gryffindor. Ella had spent her whole life fantasizing about being sorted into her house at Hogwarts, and her father had constantly reminded her that any house should and would be grateful to have her in its graces. Her closest, friend, Juniper, had just been sorted into Slytherin house and it was at times like these where Ella was thankful that she was so versatile. Perhaps they would be in the same house after all!</p><p>She hesitantly made her way up towards the stool, McGonagall holding up the Sorting Hat like the prized possession that it was. She could feel the eyes of all her fellow schoolmates boring into her with each step she took. Especially the eyes of her older brother, Jackson from the Ravenclaw table. She drew in a deep breath as she settled herself upon the stool and Professor McGonagall settled the Sorting Hat upon her head.</p><p>“Oh, dear!” The Sorting Hat exclaimed rather obnoxiously, startling Ella and the professor. “What a difficult one you are, aren’t you? Hmmm,” The Sorting Hat hummed. “Really could fit in anywhere. Tut tut tut, what to do with you? What to do with you?” The hat kept mumbling to itself as Ella sat beneath it, gnawing on her bottom lip. “Brave, cunning, loyal, kind, bright, and charming. You really aren’t making this easy for me are you, girl?”</p><p>Ella was getting nervous. The Sorting Hat was taking quite a while to work out where it was she was to be placed. “Please put me in Slytherin,” She begged within her thoughts. “Please, please put me with Juni.”</p><p>The hat sensed her thoughts immediately. “Now, while I’d like to just lump you in with your friend, dearie, greater things await you elsewhere.” Ella’s heart sank. “Gryffindor!” The Sorting Hat erupted. The Gryffindor table began an uproar of cheering and clapping, excited to have another new student in their house. Ella, on the other hand, was not so thrilled. She shot a remorseful look at her best friend, now sitting at the Slytherin table. So much for the same houses. Not only were they placed in different houses, but the two houses with the longest and most foul rivalry in Hogwarts history.</p><p>Her brother wasn’t that happy either. Their mother had been a Ravenclaw, and so was he. All three of them were so similar, he was certain that she would be in Ravenclaw. And if it wasn’t Ravenclaw then he thought it would have been Hufflepuff. Their father had been a Hufflepuff, not that that mattered. But he never in a million years thought that his little baby sister would be in Gryffindor.</p><p>Ella picked out the first spot at the Gryffindor table that she laid her eyes on, across from a girl named Katie Bell, a fellow first year who she and Juni had sat with on the train, and beside two redheaded boys who seemed to be almost identical. Not much talking was done as the sorting ceremony went on. Aside from the occasional comments and snickering of the two boys beside her. After the sorting ceremony had ended Professor Dumbledore had risen from his throne-like seat to give his commencement speech. After which, the feast began.</p><p>Ella watched in absolute wonder as food magically appeared on the long table in front of her. Sure, she grew up in a pure-blooded family so she was exposed to magic her whole life, but it still never grew boring to her. She began to fill her plate with more than enough food as the Great Hall grew louder as the children began to chatter.</p><p>The first years around her began to introduce themselves and she made conversation with them but her eyes kept casting over to her best friend, Juniper, who had been doing the same at the Slytherin table. Oh, how she yearned to be sitting with her. She aimlessly shoved her food around her plate, her appetite dwindling as she dwelled on the situation.</p><p>“Hey,” Ella heard a voice across from her say. She looked up from her moping to see Katie Bell smiling at her. “It’ll be okay, Donella. If it makes you feel any better, you’ve got a friend in me.”</p><p>Ella found herself smiling back at Katie. “Thanks, Katie. I just wish Juniper was a Gryffindor too,” She said with a sigh.</p><p>“Juniper?” She heard a voice, or maybe two, say from beside her. “You friends with a spice?”</p><p>She turned her head and saw those two redheaded boys, second years by the looks of them, staring at her. Were they speaking in unison? She scoffed at them, “No, Juniper is my best friend. We grew up together. She’s sitting right over there.” She pointed out the skinny Asian girl with double braids at the Slytherin table who waved back at Ella.</p><p>“Best friend?” One of them said.</p><p>“Good luck with that one.” The other one finished.</p><p>Another redheaded boy who was sitting near the boys snapped at them, “Fred! George! That’s enough. Don’t you two have enough fun without worrying a first year?” He scolded them. He held out his hand for her to shake, which she did. “Hi. Percy Weasley,” He introduced himself. “These are my idiot brothers, Fred and George.”</p><p>“Hm.” She clicked her tongue cheekily and quirked one of her eyebrows. While yes, she was quite friendly most of the time, she still had an attitude on her. “Twins, I presume.”</p><p>“How’d you guess?” The twins asked her in unison, amused and intrigued by this new girl.</p><p>“And what was your name again?” George asked her.</p><p>“Donatello was it?” Fred asked.</p><p>Ella rolled her eyes and set her fork down. “No. Donella, it was. Donella Stirling.”</p><p>Sensing that Ella was getting a bit frustrated with the twins poking and prodding, Katie cut in again. “So Donella, not that I don’t find your name beautiful, but is it okay if I call you Ella?” She asked her.</p><p>Pleased to be talking to her new friend again, Ella’s tone changed. “Absolutely. Everyone already does.”</p><p>After her little tiff with the twins, dinner went by rather smoothly. Katie and Ella actually hit it off quite well and were having a rather nice time. Once dinner was finished all the students began to filter out of the great hall to find their house prefects in order to be led to the dormitories.</p><p>Immediately, Ella went to find Juniper in the crowd, and within a few minutes they sought each other out. They managed to get in a quick hug while standing near the edge of the hoard of students.</p><p>“Juni, I’m so sorry. I tried, I really did! I told that ratty old hat to put me in Slytherin but it didn’t listen!” Ella apologized profusely.</p><p>“Don’t be sorry” Juniper assured her. “I’m not upset with you at all. I kind of had the feeling that you wouldn’t be in my house anyways. And don’t worry, I know what people at dinner probably told you. I heard it from my house too. I promise we’ll still be best friends. Forever.” She offered Ella a smile and her pinky finger.</p><p>Ella returned her friend’s smile and hooked her pinky with Juniper’s. “So, Gryffindor,” Juni said. They began to shuffle slowly out of the great hall with the rest of the students. “That was quite a shock, I never saw that one coming. I thought you’d be a great match for Ravenclaw.” Even though Juni had been born to Muggle parents, she had done quite a bit of research about Hogwarts with Ella when she got her letter. She thought that Ravenclaw seemed like the perfect place for a smart girl like Ella.</p><p>“I know,” Ella groaned. “I don’t even want to talk about it. Let’s talk about you. Did you make any friends at dinner?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Juniper said. “Believe it or not, there are some nice people in Slytherin. They aren’t all bad you know.” She sighed and bit her lip. “I’m just nervous is all.” She lowered her voice to a faint whisper. “Slytherins have had a reputation for having it out for Muggle-borns. And nobody knows that I’m — that I’m a mudblood. At least not yet.” She uttered the word “mudblood” as if it was poison rolling off her tongue. She obviously had no problem with having muggle parents, but she had heard loads of all the bullying that went on. It troubled her terribly.</p><p>“Don’t say that!” Ella said to her sharply. “You know that’s a terrible thing to call anyone, especially yourself! That is a foul word and it has nothing to do with your worth? You understand me?”</p><p>Juniper nodded. “I know. I’m just preparing to have that word thrown at me when the others find out.”</p><p>Ella looked at her sympathetically. She wished she could just take Juni with her to the Gryffindor common room and have her switch houses, as easy as that. But unfortunately, that isn’t how things worked. She was separated from her best friend, that’s all she could think about. Gryffindor didn’t even run in her family. Ella came from two long lines of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. What “great things” could possibly await her in Gryffindor? Something just didn’t seem right about all this. She absolutely hated that she would be forced to spend her nights without Juni, so she resorted to the next best thing.</p><p>“You know that journal that I gave to you on the train?” Ella asked Juni. When Juni nodded she continued. “Write me a note in it when you get settled into your dormitory. It’ll come in handy for us.” She winked at Juni, which Juni returned with a coy smile. “I’m sorry, but I’ve got to go,” Ella said as they neared the main corridor. She embraced her lifelong friend tightly. “Good luck,” She whispered in her ear before letting her go off towards the other Slytherin children.</p><p>Ella watched her best friend up until the moment that she rounded the corner towards the dungeons. She then felt a hand on her and sure enough, when she turned, it was Jackson, her brother. “Hey, baby sister. Have fun at the Gryffindor table with Weasley?” There was a smug tone in his voice that made Ella want to push him down one of the marble staircases.</p><p>“Which one?” Ella said snarkily and blew a stray piece of hair out of her eyes. “There were three of them. The twins were annoying, but Percy seems nice.”</p><p>Jackson snorted. “Percy seems nice. Yeah, sure, sis. Just wait until you get to know him and then come and tell me he’s nice. And did you say Fred and George are annoying?” Ella nodded. “What? I love those guys. They’re hilarious!”</p><p>“They’re obnoxious.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, so are you,” Jackson said and ruffled Ella’s hair. Ella groaned and shoved his hand off of her.</p><p>She glanced around and realized that she had lost the rest of the Gryffindors. “Oh no, Jackson! Where did they go?”</p><p>Before she could panic Jackson put a hand on her shoulder and turned in the direction of the correct staircase. “Come on, Gryffindor common room is this way. We’ll catch them, don’t worry. I won’t let you get lost.” Jackson’s protective instincts over his litter sister kicked in and he ran with her up the staircases, being careful not to let her step on the spots where she might sink through. They made it just in time, right before none other than Percy Weasley himself was about to shut the portrait hole.</p><p>“Stirling,” Weasley said disapprovingly, which confused Ella, “you may want to avoid distracting my first years in the future so they don’t get separated.”</p><p>“<em> Your </em> first years?” Jackson said and laughed. “Don’t get too ahead of yourself, Percy. You aren’t a Prefect yet. And may I remind you that I’m a year older than you and a lot bigger than you so you may want to watch your tone.” He used to broad shoulders and his height to tower over Percy and Ella swore that she saw his eye twitch.</p><p>“Right, well,” Percy cleared his throat, “in you go, Ella.” Ella ducked into the common room and said goodbye to her brother over her shoulder. “I’ll be seeing you, Stirling,” Percy said to Jackson.</p><p>“Yes, you will.” He stuck his foot in the portrait hole right before Percy had swung it shut. He towered over him menacingly. “Oh and, Weasley, do make sure you take good care of my sister. Or you’ll have to answer to me.” He offered him a smile that seemed more like a wolf baring its teeth than anything. Jackson turned effortlessly and strode towards Ravenclaw tower. “Have a nice night!” He called to Percy and continued to walk away, humming happily to himself.</p>
