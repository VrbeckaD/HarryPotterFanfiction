    <p>It was shortly after Draco had left for Hogwarts. Lucius and Narcissa had enjoyed a delicious dinner and just finished their second bottle of wine.<br/>
<br/>
“How can this one be already empty, we’ve just started it. Bring us another bottle, Dobby!” Narcissa commanded.<br/>
<br/>
“You dismissed him after he served us dinner, darling.”<br/>
<br/>
“Well, then I shall go and fetch a bottle myself”, said Narcissa and stood up. She wavered slightly and held on to the table. Lucius laughed at that and stood up himself. He wasn’t standing more securely. Narcissa giggled and said:<br/>
<br/>
“Come with me, so I don’t have to walk two ways and the fourth bottle is nearer.”<br/>
<br/>
She winked, took his hand and dragged him out of the dining room. They staggered down the stairs and through the vast entrance hall towards the stairs to the cellar. They both had to hold on to each other to get save to the bottom of this steep set of stairs. They went a little further down the dimly lit corridor before Lucius opened a door to the left. The torches in the room lighted up and revealed not rows of wine bottles but a variety of ancient torture devices.<br/>
<br/>
“Lucius, this is the dungeon, not the wine cellar. Don’t you know the rooms in your own house?” Narcissa chuckled, gave him a quick kiss and dragged him into the room.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s been ages since I’ve last been here”, Narcissa said, while walking through the rows of tables and chairs and racks and other uncanny looking furniture. The room was filled with it for about two thirds; the other third at the back was empty save for some chains hanging from the ceiling and the walls. On the left, at the far side there was a blazing fireplace and all around the walls torches were burning. All the devices looked surprisingly well maintained, although they hadn’t been in use for a very long time. This was in some part due to magic and in some part to James, their eldest houself. He was very fond of these things and liked to oil the joints of shackles, sharpen spikes and blades and nourish the leather of whips and straps. Because he wasn’t much use anymore for other things and he kept Draco from going to the dungeon when he was younger, they let him do what he liked.<br/>
<br/>
Actually the last time Narcissa had been to the dungeon was when she had shown the room to Draco. As he had become old enough not to hurt himself in there, she had decided to show him the last room he didn’t know on their estate. Better than having him walk in there on his own she had thought. Draco hadn’t been too impressed by this conglomeration. He’d just asked:<br/>
<br/>
“Why do we keep all this muggle stuff?”<br/>
<br/>
For most of the devices were devised by muggles, although enhanced by magic.<br/>
<br/>
“We’d really like to get rid of all of this, but it isn’t possible to move any of these devices out of the room with the intention of throwing them away or selling them.” She had explained. Draco had just shrugged and left the room, obviously neither interested nor scared nor moved in any other fashion.<br/>
<br/>
Lucius followed Narcissa into the room, looking around. He had never seen a use for this room other than maybe scaring Draco’s friends. When it came to torturing the Crutiatus curse was way more effective and made far less of a mess. However, he had to admit that the muggles had found some very creative ways to hurt each other.<br/>
<br/>
They had reached the far end of the room when Narcissa turned to Lucius.<br/>
<br/>
“You really got the wrong door, you’ve lived here all your life and you choose the wrong door!” she laughed with tears in her eyes.<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t see why that’s so funny. I don’t come down here often.” Lucius said a little offended.<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, don’t be so grumpy. It’s just funny.” With that Narcissa gave Lucius a kiss, pushing him against the wall behind. As they deepened the kiss, Lucius pulled her closer and started to roam his hands over her body. On a sudden inspiration, Narcissa drew back and grabbed her wand. With a quick movement of her wand, a pair of shackles on a chain came rushing down from where they were hanging on the wall over their heads and closed around Lucius’ wrists. With another flourish of her wand, the chain moved up again, dragging Lucius’ hands high over his head. He had no time to complain as Narcissa covered his mouth with another deep kiss. She had laid a hand in his neck; with the other, she still held her wand. She now tugged lightly on the hair on the back of his head causing him to tilt his head back, allowing her to trail kisses down his throat. She was expecting that he would demand any moment now to be released. But as she reached the collar of his shirt she looked up and saw that Lucius had closed his eyes, quite obviously enjoying what she did and not really minding that he wasn’t able to move. This surprised her a little, but maybe he was just too drunk to care and glad he had some support that prevented him from toppling over. She decided she’d carry on with her little experiment. She smiled and with a wave of her wand his clothes were gone. He opened his eyes with a gasp and he seemed to become a lot soberer in an instant.<br/>
<br/>
“Narcissa, what…” He was cut short by another kiss. Narcissa had put her wand away and was now trailing her hands over his shoulders and down his back. She let one hand rest on the small of his back with the other she started to caress one of his nipples. This earned her a low moan against her lips and still no complaints about his confinement. She broke the kiss and moved her mouth to his other nipple. There she started licking and suckling. Lucius was now leaning heavily against the wall and sporting a generous hard-on. He apparently liked what she did and Narcissa found that she too enjoyed it more than she’d expected. It was quite thrilling having Lucius tied up like this with no possibility to interfere in her actions. Narcissa moved the hand from the small of his back to his erection. There she started gently stroking up and down his length. Whit her other hand and her mouth she was still caressing his nipples. As she clasped her hand around his shaft and started moving it, Lucius began to moan and rock his hips back and forth. He had closed his eyes, an expression of pure bliss on his face. He made no attempt to move his arms, although the chain was softly jingling from the movement of his body. Narcissa noticed he was close to climax and decided to make a bold move. She retrieved her hands and mouth and took a step back. Immediately he opened his eyes, looking quite a little bit hurt.<br/>
<br/>
“Why did you stop? Don’t stop now!” he cried out exasperated. He started tugging at the chains, trying to get his wrists free. Narcissa smiled at the fruitless attempt and wondered why he hadn’t just commanded to be set free. Although the thought was tempting she wouldn’t have denied him his wish, but he didn’t ask.<br/>
<br/>
“Because I’m feeling a little left out.” she said, “Just watch and enjoy the show.”<br/>
<br/>
He ceased tugging at the chains and watched her intently as she started to undress. First, she got rid of her elegant pair of black boots. Then she slowly started to unbutton her night blue silk blouse. She let it fall to the floor and slowly got out of her tight-fitting black pants. She was now standing in front of him in only her expensive black and dark green lace underwear. She unclasped her bra and let it fall on the pile of clothes beside her. She started to caress her already hard nipples while she let her gaze wander over Lucius’ body. From his hands high above his head, over his bound wrists, along his outstretched arms, to his face and from there over his breast and belly to his erection and down over his legs to his feet. He was lean and muscular and his ivory skin was only disrupted by the black skull and serpent on his left arm. She really enjoyed the sight in front of her and was quite pleased with her idea. This seemed to be one of the better ones she’d had while drunk. She was also very surprised that Lucius responded that well to the idea. She’d expected him to start complaining very soon and then putting an end to the whole affair. She also hadn’t expected to get so turned on by it. She returned her gaze to his face and locked eyes with him. His blue eyes had a hungry expression and it got even hungrier when she, at last, removed her panties and let her hand wander south. She held his gaze as she pushed two fingers between her legs and deep inside her. At that Lucius stirred and once again tugged at his chains.<br/>
<br/>
“Do you enjoy the show?” Narcissa asked with a grin.<br/>
<br/>
“I’d rather join”, Lucius answered his voice hoarse from arousal.<br/>
<br/>
“No, I want you to watch. You won't miss out, promise.” Narcissa said teasingly. Surprisingly Lucius was content with that answer and watched silently as she slowly started working herself. The stripping under Lucius’ watchful gaze and the sight of him chained to the wall had made her very wet and it wasn’t long before she reached climax.<br/>
<br/>
“Did you like the show?” She asked after she had recovered from her climax. She didn’t wait for an answer but walked up to him, pulled his body close against hers and kissed him tenderly. He answered her kiss eagerly and rocked his body against hers desperate for his own release. She reached between them and gripped his cock with her still wet hand; with the other she was holding him close to her. He immediately started rocking feverishly against her hand till he came with a groan. Afterwards, he slumped back to the wall panting heavily. It was plain that he’d enjoyed the whole affair greatly.</p>
