          <div class="userstuff"><p><em>Smack! Smack! Smack!</em><br/><br/>“Ouch! Watch it.”<br/><br/>“Shush. It’s <em>supposed</em> to hurt. It’s a spanking.”<br/><br/>“Oh, really? I had no idea.”<br/><br/><em>Smack!</em> A wince and a strangled whimper.<br/><br/>“Quiet. I’ve had enough of your smart mouth today.”<br/><br/>“I thought you liked my mouth and what it could do.”<br/><br/><em>Smack!</em> Much harder than before. <br/><br/>“Hey!”<br/><br/>“No complaints. Take your punishment like a good boy.”<br/><br/>A soft groan this time. “Fuck, why do you talk to me like that?”<br/><br/>“Don’t act like it doesn’t turn you on.”<br/><br/>“That’s the problem. It does.”<br/><br/><em>Smack! Smack! Smack!</em><br/><br/>A hitching of breath, accompanied by a gasping cry. <br/><br/>“Not such a smartass now, are you?”<br/><br/>“Don’t act so smug.”<br/><br/><em>Smack! Smack! Smack! Smack! Smack!</em><br/><br/>A choking sob, fists grasping desperately for purchase against the legs of a chair. <br/><br/>“Don’t tell me how to act. This is why you get punished so much.”<br/><br/>A huff that would have sounded angry and pouty if it wasn’t so shaky. “I should have never agreed when you asked me to stay tonight.”<br/><br/>“You wanted to stay tonight. These are the circumstances you wanted. You craved this. You craved <em>me</em>.”<br/><br/>Those words resulted in an unbidden moan. <br/><br/>“No smart retort this time?”<br/><br/>Another moan, this time more strained, more breathless. <br/><br/><em>Smack! Smack! Smack! Smack! Smack! Smack! Smack! Smack! Smack! Smack!</em><br/><br/>A keening, shuddering cry echoed through the small room. A final shivering sigh, then silence for a moment.<br/><br/>A low chuckle. “Did you just cum from being spanked?”<br/><br/>“Shut up!”<br/><br/>“That’s a first.”<br/><br/>“Mention that to anyone, Longbottom, and I’ll tell everyone you’re a sadistic, kinky bastard and ruin your sweet, gentle reputation.”<br/><br/>The reply came in a deep, dangerous voice. “What was that, Zabini?”<br/><br/>A sudden change in demeanor, like shrinking backwards. “N-nothing.”<br/><br/>“Seems you haven’t learned your lesson yet. Bad news. Fortune isn’t on your side tonight.”<br/><br/>“I… I’m sorry, Neville. Please don’t -”<br/><br/>“Turn.”<br/><br/>“Neville -”<br/><br/>“Turn around and get back on my lap.”<br/><br/>“Neville, please don’t do this.”<br/><br/>No safeword was spoken. A smirk.<br/><br/>“Now. Don’t make me say it again.”<br/><br/>A pause. Then - <br/><br/><em>Smack! Smack! Smack!</em></p></div>
