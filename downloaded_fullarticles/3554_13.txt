  <b>i.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t a particularly bad day.</p><p>Granted, it was still miserable: it was drizzling outside and he was in a mildly foul mood when he got to the office, but it wasn’t that different from any ordinary day. He ran out of coffee at home, but he had had the chance to grab a cup before heading in, his morning headache soothed. He’d call that a win on worse days.</p><p>In retrospect, he still believed that morning to be nothing but plain. He had heard of people getting a sort of warning, a twinge, or at least a <i>feeling</i> when such things happened. Well. It seemed like he was mistaken, then.</p><p>It was half one when he heard a knock on the door.</p><p>“Mr Malfoy?”</p><p>The woman standing outside was in a plain dark blue robe, somewhat on the formal side, not a hair out of place. She carried herself with the air of someone who knew she could walk into any place and was simply asking out of courtesy, not of necessity.</p><p>“What can I help you, Ms…?”</p><p>“Deverill. Olivia Deverill. I am here on behalf of the Goblin Liaison Office. May I come in?”</p><p>One should never mess with goblins; he’d learnt that lesson early on. “Of course. Please, do have a sit.”</p><p>She sat down as he waved the door shut. Perplexed, his mind started racing; he couldn’t recall any misconduct that could possibly concern Gringotts. Not recently, at least. The goblins were understandably not too happy with his family after the war, and every trip to Gringotts since had been awkward, to say the least, but he had made a point to be cautious and cordial in every way, and if he was slightly more generous than before, no one saw the need to bring it up.</p><p>“I’ll be frank, Mr Malfoy. I see this may be difficult for you, and I fully understand that considering the circumstances, you would probably prefer to handle things… discreetly. I assure you, we will be most accommodating during the process of finalising certain legal issues, and no details will be revealed to a third party without your knowledge.” Her eyes were stern, but not malicious, and her tone was patient. The combination was almost always a bad sign.</p><p>He arched an eyebrow. “Dare I ask legal issues regarding what, exactly?”</p><p>“The will, Mr Malfoy.”</p><p>He could feel the blood drained from his face. The silence in the room was suddenly deafening. “What will? My mother — is she alright?”</p><p>“No, not your mother. The will of Mr Potter. You’re appointed as one of the executors, and I’m here to ask you to come with me for the reading of the will.”</p><p>“Wait, <i>Potter</i> is dead?”</p><p>She paused, a hint of surprise on her face for the first time after walking into the room. “Yes, I’m afraid so. You are not aware of this?”</p><p>“No, of course not — how would I know? What happened?”</p><p>“The news was in the Daily Prophet this morning. I assumed. My apologies, Mr Malfoy.”</p><p>He didn’t read the Prophet this morning; he hadn’t for years, only some glimpses here and there — not after — he could feel the racing in his mind stopping, his <i>brain</i> stopping. </p><p>Potter was dead.</p><p>The mere idea was too foreign and absurd that he couldn’t wrap his mind around it, he wanted to laugh and yell and demand whomever behind this to stop this joke because it simply couldn’t be true, but he did neither, sitting there frozen, blinking stupidly at the woman in front of him for a good ten seconds.</p><p>Deverill remained silent for a while; Draco hated that look in her eyes. It was alarmingly akin to pity, and he had never liked nor needed that. He wouldn’t start now. Something in his chest — heaved, and halted, leaving him strangely emptied, even though there wasn’t anything there to feel bereft of.</p><p>She cleared her throat. “I do have a copy with me, the Prophet, if you would like to take a look?”</p><p>He took the offered copy without thinking.</p><p>The title was so terrible he managed a snort: <i>The Boy Who Lived No More — Breaking News! Auror Potter revealed to have been killed in the line of duty</i>. There was no photograph of the case, only one candid shot from some Ministry event in the past, as if anyone needed a photo to recognise Harry Potter. Which. Right. Picture. He’d forgotten that there could be pictures. But it wasn’t like he was new to the sight of Potter covered in blood. Or in bruises and gashes. Or under some tricky curse that was set to break all of his limbs, taking turns, one at a time. Even refused to let it heal, too, for that matter. Or all of the above. Draco blinked again, tearing his eyes away from the photo to the article itself — but the words swirled and churned, refusing to grant him access.</p><p>He put the papers down after two tries, the once-familiar pang in his chest sliding right back in place, extending, expanding, filling his chest to the brim. He breathed out. All he needed to know was that it <i>did</i> happen; sure, the Prophet was full of rubbish, but with news of this scale, it couldn’t be wrong on the one fact that it did happen, could it? The <i>how</i> hardly mattered.</p><p>He took a deep breath. “What does this have to do with me?”</p><p>“Like I was saying, Mr Malfoy, you’re listed as one of the executors of Mr Potter’s estate. I am liaising with the goblins on behalf of Registry and Customs; a colleague of mine is notifying the other executors at this moment. Considering the specific nature of this case, the Auror Office has also sent a representative. He’ll be waiting for us at Gringotts.”</p><p>“What do you mean, ‘specific nature’?”</p><p>“I’m afraid I can’t tell you that at the moment. Everything will be clear at the reading, Mr Malfoy. Would you come with me?”</p><p>“Is there a... body?”</p><p>“Again, I’m afraid I’m not at liberty to reveal that. I’m sorry.”</p><p>“What? What <i>can</i> you tell me, then?”</p><p>Deverill paused, looking at him straight in the eye, “I understand that this came as a surprise and it’s rather a lot to process, but I’m just the liaison. We notify the executors to come in and read the will with everyone present; I have no knowledge of the content of the will, nor the reasons he had in mind when making any decisions, nor the details of Mr Potter’s work with the DMLE. So, if you would like to come with me?”</p><p>Draco didn’t answer immediately. He opened his mouth, paused, swallowed. His voice sounded stiff and distant to his own ears. “When did he confirm the will?”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“Aurors have to confirm their wills every year, correct?”</p><p>“Yes, I believe so. I take it you aren’t aware of the existence of the will?”</p><p>“No. We — he didn’t tell me.” He thought of that day when he walked out and never looked back. It felt like another lifetime. What were you doing, Potter? Why didn’t you take me off the list?</p><p>Deverill’s expression didn’t change, but her eyes seemed somehow gentler when she spoke.</p><p>“I’m not here to pass judgement or assume anything; it isn’t my place. I have no wish to overstep. But we really do need the will to determine our next step. If you require some space and time, I will be waiting outside.” She stood up. “I just want to say that the news came as a most frightful shock, and it is a great loss to the entire wizarding world. My condolences, Mr Malfoy.”</p><p>She gave him a curt nod before leaving. He couldn’t even say anything.</p><p>
  <i>Potter was dead.</i>
</p>
<hr/><p>Draco spent the next two minutes trying to pretend nothing had happened. Then the two after that, what course of action should he take. But he couldn’t shake the stone settling in his gut, couldn’t <i>not</i> think of that fucking headshot in the Prophet, in which Potter was glancing away from the camera, looking solemn and grim and so familiar, and, most of all, he couldn’t stop thinking about the last time they talked.</p><p>It was after one of the big cases, the one the papers had termed the Vetiver Incident (quite inadequately, as far as Draco was concerned; vetiver was completely innocent), involving dangerous potions illegally brewed and smuggled into the country. The case wasn’t particularly perilous, but it had dragged out for weeks, and Harry had been growing more and more stressed out, distant. Irritable. The arguments themselves weren’t anything new; they were already in place, more and more often this past year, recurring every time after any big case (accompanied by severe injuries, more often than not). But that had been the turning point.</p><p>Dinner turned into a screaming match with them accusing each other in turn of having a hero complex — Draco stood by his words to this day — and self-esteem issues, total lack of concern for one’s own safety, and other petty things like getting home drunk and forced attendance to boring parties. Much of it was old dirt; perhaps that should be telling. After all, they <i>were</i> always quite talented at getting under each other’s skin. At the end Draco had left Harry’s place furious, slamming the door right in his face with no intention to ever go back again.</p><p>That was the night before the capture.</p><p>The next evening, an owl knocked on Draco’s window right after he got home. He recognised the standard-issue St Mungo’s letter from practice, cold and formal, revealing absolutely no information whatsoever. </p><p>He Floo’d to the hospital right away, bumping one of his big toes on the fireplace wall in his haste. It was smarting dreadfully when he stumbled out of the fireplace; he limped slightly to the Inquiries, then to Harry’s ward on the fourth floor, cursing silently all the way.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Weasley was there, looking utterly miserable with his share of bandages, an ugly bruise covering almost half of his face, ginger hair dimmed and dusty. He flinched at the look on Draco’s face, then hissed painfully when the action pulled his split lips.</p><p>“They’re still working on him. We don’t know what happened exactly — no one saw — but he was hit with an Entrail-Expelling Curse, most definitely, mixed with several other stuff,” Weasley said in a low voice, rubbing his eye, the unhurt one, looking exhausted. “They said they’re putting him in a magically-induced coma to slow down the progression of the curses. It will give them time to heal surface wounds and figure out what he was drenched in.”</p><p>“How the hell did no one see?”</p><p>“Harry and I were the first to the scene, the detection charm came back with only three people inside and we heard a noise, we were afraid they were clearing out, so we decided to go in, erm, but backup wasn’t there yet — ”</p><p>“And it was a trap, I presume?”</p><p>“Well, sort of, I guess — ” Draco snorted, but Weasley went on. “Then everything exploded — the potion guys can fill you in on the details, I’m not sure what exactly happened there, somehow they set their lab exploding, and attacked us when we were blind-sighted. We realised our intel on the persons in the lab was wrong, there were too many of them, but we were surrounded, right, couldn’t draw back, and Harry was already in the midst of everything when the others arrived, so he took the most of it, and…” He gestured rather helplessly. “The team back at the Ministry are still identifying what ingredients were involved. They’ll let us know.”</p><p>“So, he’s got spell damage, possible poisoning from an unidentified potion, amongst other physical injuries?”</p><p>“That’s about it. Erm, and a couple of broken ribs from the explosion, I think,” he added helpfully.</p><p>“How could the Aurors allow this to happen time after time? Shouldn’t you all be dead by now if this is how you handle missions?” Draco sneered, not really expecting an answer. </p><p>Weasley opened his mouth, but he was stopped by a Healer coming over to check on his wounds. She cast a diagnostic spell with a disapproving look, got him a healing paste for the bleeding arm, but didn’t try to make him leave. They’d long given up on that.</p><p>As Draco really had been extremely tired and immensely worried, he didn’t push. He sat down with Weasley, a good fifteen inches between them, and stretched out his legs. He might as well make himself comfortable for the long wait ahead.</p><p>He was angry, of course, enraged at everything: the idiotic smuggler ring, the incompetent Aurors, the stupidity of Harry bloody Potter, and, above all else, just how familiar this scenario had become. He didn’t have it in him to yell at Weasley at the moment.</p><p>In fact, during all the long waits outside Harry’s room, Draco had reluctantly managed something more than a truce, an alliance of sorts, with Weasley. The same could be said for Granger, who had come by later, bringing food and tea with her, relieving Weasley for him to report back to the office. Those Aurors really were a fucking, lunatically demanding lot.</p><p>Harry had remained in coma for five days; those were the longest five days in his life, and he had survived with a Dark Lord living in his family home for a year. They were allowed to see Harry on the third day, still unconscious, but were rushed out again when some monitoring spell started beeping frantically; then the Healers finally cleared him on the sixth day, allowing the Aurors to speak with him before letting Draco and Granger in.</p><p>She’d hugged him while Draco stayed behind, muttered something in his ear and planted a quick kiss on his cheek before leaving with a promise to come back. She closed the door silently behind her, and the room was left to the two of them.</p><p>“Hey,” Harry said, rather weakly. “You look awful.”</p><p>Draco glared at him. “It’s easy for you to say, lying there doing nothing. You just <i>have</i> to get yourself injured, don’t you?”</p><p>They were both too familiar with this routine, really, it was pathetic; Harry didn’t say anything, knowing Draco’s need to rant out his frustration for the past few days, and he just <i>looked</i> at him the whole time, worse for wear with stubbles and dark circles under his eyes. Then his expression shifted, it wasn’t exactly a smile, but his eyes crinkled at the corners, and Draco stopped mid-tirade, suddenly short of breath, heart gripped by the terrible, terrible relief. He let out a sigh.</p><p>“I’m glad you’re fine, you know, you moron,” he said quietly, sitting down on the side of the bed, adrenaline drained, leaving him suddenly very tired. “But you’ve got to stop. You can’t do this to me again and again.”</p><p>Harry reached for his hand and gave it a little squeeze. “It’s just work, and they’ve always been able to patch me up, haven’t they? I’ll be careful next time, I promise. Have you been here all this time?”</p><p>“Someone’s got to be here to tell you how reckless and foolish you were, don’t they, and who knows when will you wake up?” </p><p>“Thank you,” Harry managed a smile and ignored what he said entirely. “I really am sorry. And I was sorry when I went to work that day. I hate that we left things that way.”</p><p>“Do you really, though? I can’t tell.”</p><p>And somehow that had led to them fighting again — thanks to the mandatory Muffliato on all active Aurors’ ward, none of the St Mungo’s staff had heard. Else they definitely would’ve been stopped, and everything that happened after… well, wouldn’t have happened. Probably. On one hand, Draco had come to think Harry and him were bound to have that showdown no matter what, and they had always proven to be good at fighting; but he still wondered, in the middle of the night, that if they had been stopped, whether things could’ve turned out differently.</p><p>“Being an Auror is who I am, you know this, Draco, you’re just being selfish — ”</p><p>“Selfish?” Draco raised his voice. “You’re doing this now? I’ve always been selfish, and you knew that when you got yourself into this mess, didn’t you? It’s not like I’m asking you to resign right this moment, just — ”</p><p>“And <i>I’ve</i> always wanted to be an Auror, which I’ve also told you from the beginning, and you were perfectly fine with it back then! This isn’t fair!”</p><p>“You know what isn’t fair? Try getting an owl every other month saying you’re in some new life-threatening danger <i>again</i>, and I can’t know any details of your injuries or your missions, because it’s all <i>confidential</i>, apparently, since I even have to wait outside every time for the Aurors to talk to you first when you wake up, don’t I — ”</p><p>“That’s the job! It’s the same for all rookie Aurors, we’ve got all the groundwork, but it’ll get better after the first couple of years — ”</p><p>“Couple of years? Do you even listen to yourself, Potter? At the rate you’re going, do you actually believe you’ll make it for another couple of <i>years</i>? Surely not even you can be that naïve? Have you not learnt anything? Do you know how many times you’ve ended up here? You were injured so badly that they had to put you in a coma!”</p><p>“It wasn’t as serious as it looked! Hermione doesn’t have this much problem with Ron being an Auror anyhow — ”</p><p>“That’s because Weasley doesn’t get himself <i>sliced up</i> every time he goes on a mission, unlike <i>you</i> — ”</p><p>“ — so why do I have to give up my career for you?”</p><p>Draco opened his mouth but suddenly found himself not quite sure what to say. He shut his mouth. His heart was pounding and blood was roaring in his ears, but he didn’t look away from Harry’s eyes. Harry had fallen silent.</p><p>“You don’t, I suppose.”</p><p>He gathered his things with his wand blindly, backing toward the door, fingers numb and cold. Harry was staring at him with an expression somewhere between panicking and raging, still impossibly pale. He uttered at last, “...that’s not what I mean.”</p><p>Draco forced himself to breathe out. “Then what did you mean, exactly?”</p><p>Harry didn’t seem to have an answer for that. Draco grabbed his coat tightly. “Fine. Don’t bother.”</p><p>“Draco,” Harry said, almost pleading. “Draco.”</p><p>“Fuck you, Potter. I’m done.”</p><p>He had cleared out of the house a day later. Harry hadn’t been released from St Mungo’s yet.</p><p>That wasn’t when they’d last crossed paths, but it was their last real interaction.</p><p>Their last <i>ever</i> interaction.</p>
