    <p>June 1<br/>School let out today. Mr Green gave me a journal to help me work out my problems but wouldn’t call CPS like I asked because he says there’s nothing to be done. At least I got a journal out of it? I just don’t want to spend all summer at home with them.<br/>Also I think I was sleep walking or something, ended up on the roof of school and don’t know how I got there.</p><p>June 3 <br/>Aunt Petunia shaved my head all except my fringe. Got in trouble with Vernon when it grew back. I think he’s mad he’s going a bit bald himself but that’s not my fault.</p><p>June 10<br/>P tried to make one of Dudley’s old sweaters fit me but even she can’t shrunk stuff unshrink, she’s not like a wizard or something.</p><p>June 15<br/>It’s D’s birthday. Wonder where they’re going this year? I’ll be at Miss Figg’s, bet you a million pounds.<br/>(later) <br/>They...let me go to the zoo with them? It was pretty great actually, loved the gorillas. The ice cream lady guilted V into letting me have a popsicle.<br/>Something was wrong with the boa constrictor’s cage. I guess the glass fell down or something and it got out and went after D, but it’s not like he was in any kind of danger, poor thing was probably frightened by the fuss. I can relate to that snake.<br/>Lives in a tiny box (check)<br/>V knocking on the wall all the time (check)<br/>Wants to crush D (check)<br/>Eats rats (che--well fine I don’t eat rats but let’s face it there have been times when I’ve considered it I mean who hasn’t)<br/>(most people probably)<br/>(most people probably get enough food, so sucks to them)<br/>I can just picture that snake going “Brazil here I come!” as it snaked off. I wonder what happened to it?<br/>Anyway I guess V blamed me for not diving to save D from the ferocious beast, or maybe he was bothered about the popsicle business because I’m back in the cupboard again for the forseeable future.<br/>Getting hungry. I wonder if I’ll get lucky and there will be a rat poking about in here?</p><p>July 25<br/>I got a letter addressed to me, but V and P wouldn’t let me read it. I guess we’re at that stage in the relationship.</p><p>July 27<br/>These letters are getting out of hand.</p><p>July 30<br/>V stuffed us all in the car and said we’re going on a road trip. I think he’s really bothered about the weird amount of mail. Maybe it’s CPS giving him notice finally. Cross fingers.</p><p>July 31 <br/>Happy birthday to me!<br/>Apparently the letters were about me getting into some fancy private school in Scotland. I never applied? But apparently my parents were alumni there, so I got automatically enrolled?<br/>Got all this from the school’s janitor, who somehow tracked us down during a thunderstorm to hand deliver the acceptance letter. <br/>Mr Hagrid roughed up Dudley and then we stole V’s boat. I’ll treasure that moment.<br/>We’re on our way to pick up school supplies now. I asked Mr Hagrid why he’s taking so much time on just one student. He said he was friends with my parents when he went there, but that he was expelled and never finished. Awesome!<br/>(later)<br/>Wow, what a day! Mr Hagrid got me all outfitted for these really intense-looking classes that make you bring your own equipment. Some of it had to be custom-fitted, and I got my first taste of a weird conspiracy theorist in the form of Mr Ollivander. He said something about comparing me to the psycho who killed my folks, and kind of implied said psycho is my dad. I didn’t say anything.<br/>Oh, did I mention my folks didn’t die in a car crash after all? Mr Hagrid told me they died because the leader of this fascist group targeted them, then I guess keeled over dead himself because he hadn’t expected there to be a baby (me) in the room. There’s people who study this stuff waaaaay too thoroughly. I’m famous amongst the conspiracy guys, so that’s fun.<br/>There was another kid getting his uniforms at the same time as me, heading toward the same school. He was kind of a douchebag. I hope they aren’t all like him or there will be trouble.<br/>Another fun fact about my family: they were loaded. P and V must not have known that fact, probably because it’s all in this private bank in the form of foreign currency, or they’d have had it in a heartbeat. I’ll bet the conspiracy whackoes just love the “offshore bank of Turkish lira” or whatever, that detail probably makes them sweat with glee. (gross)<br/>Mr Hagrid pointed out one of my future teachers while we were out. Professor Quirrell, kind of a nutter himself, but the harmless kind. Had a nervous breakdown over the summer, and it shows.<br/>Mr Hagrid also bought me an owl. An actual, live owl. Like, in a cage. He said they’re really popular at the school, some kind of falconry club? But I’ve never had a pet before, so I accepted the owl and will be looking up how to properly care for her soon as I’m able. I think they eat rats? Good, someone ought to.<br/>They almost didn’t let me take her on the train home, but they don’t have a policy against owls so they let it go so long as she behaved. She tried to bite the guard. I think I’ll name her Hedwig--every inch of her is angry.</p><p>September 1<br/>I didn’t realize the school was posh enough to have a private train. I also didn’t know that private trains have to be accessed by the private entrance, so it’s a good thing someone else was headed there or I’d never have found it.<br/>Hagrid was right about the owl thing. I’ll fit right in.<br/>Made a friend! His name is Ron and he’s 6th of seven siblings (youngest was the only girl and making cow eyes at me from the platform--awkward). He’s in my year and showed me his pet rat. We traded sandwiches.<br/>The douchebag from the uniform shop found me again, can confirm is def a douchebag. He made some classist jabs at Ron and then whipped around and tried to make friends with me, but that’s? Not how this works? They left when it turns out Hedwig’s not the only bitey pet around here. I wonder if Scabbers is rabid.<br/>Also met this bratty girl who made a point of showing off that she’d already memorized the entire reading list. She asked us how we thought we’d be scoring on the mandatory psych evaluation and we didn’t know. I didn’t know there’d be one? What happens if you fail?<br/>(later)<br/>The psych evaluation turned out to be a personality test that they use to divide students into compatible groups. All very new age but I guess it works, because they’ve been doing it for as long as the school has been open and never had a problem. I’m in Lion, and so is Ron and Brat Girl (real name: Hermione). Thankfully Douchebag and his toady friends are in Snake. (The other dorms are called Badger and Eagle. Which came first, the posh Scottish school or the American sleepaway camp?)<br/>(Try saying “posh Scottish school” ten times fast to experience a lot of spit.)<br/>One of Ron’s older brothers is prefect in Lion. I thought that’s meant he’d let us get away with stuff but nope, he’s an uptight nerd. Ron says he’s like at home too. Two more other brothers, twins Fred and George, are also in Lion and kind of make up for him by being total agents of chaos.<br/>I think I’m going to like it here.</p>
