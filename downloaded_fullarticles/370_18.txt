    <p>...When the spring came and the snow melted and the sun grew warm in the sky, something stirred beneath a rotten stump so powerfully, that the stump collapsed, and out of it crawled something that was neither dragon nor snake, neither fully limbed nor limbless, not flying, but crawling, not walking, but slithering, but very much venomous.</p>
<p>The thing, (Charlie Weasley and his co-workers called it a lindwurm, a cousin of the 'true' dragons at closest), crawled to a nearby rocky ridge, (yes, the Forbidden Forest had those as well - it had a lot of things, not just werewolves, centaurs, giant spiders, and the Weasleys' semi-sentient car turned feral), which it then entwined and fell to sleep - on the surface. Since it was Tom Riddle's reincarnation, (yes, he had one of those plans too), the Forbidden forest got even more Forbidden than before.</p>
<p>...Fortunately though, Harry Potter, whose job, apparently, was to off Voldemort in no matter what shape and/or incarnation the latter was, went to the Forbidden Forest and offed the Dark Lord once more - huzzah! And then he had a long discussion with many people, including a certain Delphie - but that is another story.</p>
