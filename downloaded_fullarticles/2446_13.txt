    <p>The knock on the door was loud and resonant in the small room.</p><p>Queenie groans. Closing her eyes tighter, burrowing deeper into Jacobs warm chest. Maybe slipping back into sleep will make it go away? Of course, it’s doubtful. Still, the last thing she wants is to head the call of the innkeeper- reminding her that the night they paid for was up. That they would have to leave before the hour was up or be forced too.</p><p>Jacob seemed to agree. Still half asleep, his arm curled around her loosely and his head turned to rest on hers. His waking thoughts were a mirror of her. A few more minutes, a few more hours or days.</p><p>It’s funny how excited she was last night. That she got more than a few hours with him. Grindelwald had been allowing her small meetings with Jacob, so long as he had nothing to do with Dumbledore(and of course he did, but Grindelwald didn’t need to know that). They had met up a handful of times, but never all night. Until now.</p><p>Perhaps she shouldn’t have spoiled herself.</p><p>Because leaving him got harder and harder each and every time she did it.</p>
