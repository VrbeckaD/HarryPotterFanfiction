  <b>May 20, 1966; Spinners End, Outside</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Aurora Nightshade was wandering around outside of Spinners End and was in her own world.</p><p> </p><p>“Crazy….cats... candy….oh! Cats! And funtime with fluffy, pink, bat, cotton candy dresses so that we can eat them!....Sing...No..that wouldn’t work..I’m not crazy you crazy are!”</p><p> </p><p>She paused. Now she really did sound crazy to herself. She saw something black out of the corner of her eye and turned around. She locked eyes with a boy. Killing-Curse green eyes met Onyx black eyes. The boy left his hiding place and ran. She followed.</p><p> </p><p>Looking back at this Aurora wondered why she had chased a potentially dangerous boy into a very dangerous neighborhood. After all, she knew that it was very dangerous world and that Spinners End was one of the more dangerous places, and so Aurora wondered why she had followed him without thinking.</p><p> </p><p>But she didn’t and, as far as she was concerned, that was one of the very best decisions that she had made in her entire life.</p><p> </p><p>Aurora had chased the boy and realized a few things about his appearance. One was that his hair was greasy. Another was that he was wearing oversized clothes, like they belonged to an adult.</p><p> </p><p>But with the exception of tracking the boy down, none of that mattered, all Aurora wanted to do was meet the boy and she was determined not to give up!</p><p> </p><p>The boy began to slow down. Apparently he wasn’t in good shape for running. Aurora ran faster to catch up with him. <em> She almost had him. </em></p><p> </p><p>She ran ever faster, but there was no need; the boy was panting and out of breath, breathing so hard that Aurora became concerned for him.</p><p> </p><p>When she finally, <em> finally </em> caught up with him she grabbed his left wrist. The greasy-haired boy froze. Then he slowly looked at her. Aurora stared right back.</p><p> </p><p>She blinked as she saw the boy’s face. His left cheek was purple and bruised and it looked very painful. His right wrist was a bit odd, it could be broken. He breathed a bit funnily too. Most importantly was his eyes. The boy had Onyx black eyes, a color that Aurora found fascinating, and they were alarmed and frozen and looking right into hers.</p><p> </p><p>Aurora opened her mouth to say something then she closed it. What could she say? She only had wanted...actually...Aurora wasn’t entirely sure why she had chased the boy. Was it because she was bored? She couldn’t say, she didn’t know herself.</p><p> </p><p>“...Uhhh...” She forced herself to speak. “Hi...um...who are you? Oh! And, uh, I’m Aurora...” She trailed off. She felt like an idiot. What was she thinking? Chasing after someone without any sort of reason? And now she was refusing to let him go in fear that he would run away! She didn’t know what she was doing.</p><p> </p><p>The boy stared at her, as though he thought that she was insane. And she wasn’t! Really! She didn’t even know why he was even looking at her like that!</p><p> </p><p>Finally the boy broke the silence and spoke, “Hi.” the boy said this slowly. Aurora somehow noted that he had an interesting voice. The boy spoke once more. “Could you please let me go?”</p><p> </p><p>Aurora blinked. Well, that was unexpected. “Um..well...I don’t think that I want to…because you might run away.” She felt the need to explain herself like she usually did. “And I don’t want you to.”</p><p> </p><p>The boy looked like he thought that she had reached new levels of insanity, which made her uncomfortable. <em> Why was he looking at her like that? </em></p><p>________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>Severus wondered how he got himself into this situation.</p><p> </p><p>It all started when he was wandering around Spinner End like he usually did to get out of the house. He didn’t like his father beating him or his mother telling his father to beat him instead of her.</p><p> </p><p>So he wandered around and wasn’t expecting anything out of the ordinary (women gossiping, the men and women sneering at him because of his looks even his theirs wasn’t much better, etc.) and so when he heard one voice, a girl’s voice, talking and couldn’t hear any sort of response, Severus had decided to see who the girl was talking to.</p><p> </p><p>Severus had spied on her and was utterly befuddled by what he saw. As it turned out, the girl wasn’t talking to anyone. She was talking outloud to <em> herself! </em></p><p> </p><p>After less than a minute of hearing her talk aloud to herself - about something <em> crazy </em> and <em> weird </em> and <em> didn’t understand </em> - he decided that he was <em> not </em> going to get involved with her. Severus did <em> not </em> want to become crazy. When she had stopped and they locked eyes, he had decided that, unless he wanted to get her craziness, he had to go - fast!</p><p> </p><p>And he had tried to run away, but two of his ribs were broken so it was difficult for him to breathe while walking, running just made it worse. And so the strange girl caught up with him and gripped his left wrist tightly whether she knew it or not.</p><p> </p><p>The girl - Aurora, she introduced herself - was strange. Severus had decided that he didn’t wanted her near him, but Severus’ magic had decided that the girl was trustworthy.</p><p> </p><p>And he <em> still </em> didn’t know <em> why! </em> Severus had tried to come into contact with his magic to find the answer, but his magic didn’t respond. He didn’t know if that meant that his magic was healing him - and so had no time to answer - or if his magic had just refused to answer.</p><p> </p><p>Severus wasn’t sure what he should do. The girl had him trapped and he couldn't see a way to get out without giving away his hiding places and where he lived. What was he going to do?</p><p> </p><p>Aurora spoke again. “So…how about..well..how about you come over to my house? You look like your hurt..” she trailed off hesitantly.</p><p> </p><p>Severus tugged his left arm, hoping that it would convey the message that, no, he most certainly did <em> not </em> want to go over to her house. Who knows what kind of horrors would be there?</p><p> </p><p>The girl looked conflicted for a moment before seeming to come to a decision. She glanced at Severus’ injuries and tightened her grip on his arm as she pulled him along to where her house would be.</p><p> </p>
