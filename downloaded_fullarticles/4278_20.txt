    <p>The first time Sirius Black kissed a boy, he felt his world fall apart. He found a new one in the other boy’s lips.</p>
<p>He told himself it was because he'd been dared to. He told himself it meant nothing. The other third year, a Ravenclaw boy, had laughed and agreed goodnaturedly when Marlene proposed the dare. His name was Simon.</p>
<p>None of them were supposed to be there, anyway. It was after hours, and Marlene had convinced the Marauders (as James affectionately called their little group) to join her and some friends for a late night game of Truth or Dare instead of planning another prank on Filch like they'd intended. Instead, the four of them had joined a small group of third years from all the houses (except Slytherin, Sirius was happy to see) to hide in an abandoned classroom at 1 in the morning, cleverly charmed to repel Mrs. Norris, and play the silly Muggle game Dorcas had told Marlene about once, a decision she later regretted because Marlene would not shut up about it until others had agreed to play it with her.</p>
<p>A part of him - a large part, judging by the bit of screaming going on inside his head - wished he could go back just a few seconds and pick truth instead. After all, he hadn’t picked truth at all tonight, because how could he turn down a perfectly good dare? No, he was on a roll, having already sung a dramatic ode to McGonagall’s glasses, transfigured his eyebrows a soft shade of gold, and given Peter a piggy-back ride around the classroom while wearing his socks on his ears (James had a strange sense of humor). He was ready for anything.</p>
<p>He thought.</p>
<p>But here he was, face to face with a boy he’d seen around the school and in class but never really spoken to before, so close he could feel Simon’s breath on his face, so nervous he thought he might vomit right on Simon’s unbelievably soft-looking face. His heart was quickening in a way he could not explain. Maybe because it was his first kiss. His first real one, anyway. Kissing girls on the cheek and quick pecks in play did not count in his book. This would be his first proper kiss.</p>
<p>And it was going to be with a boy.</p>
<p>Sirius was unnervingly aware of the eyes of everyone in the room on him and Simon. He could feel Marlene waiting smugly for him to make a move, Dorcas having tried her best to get Marlene to not enjoy this quite so much. He swore he could feel Peter and James vibrating across the circle from him, Peter wide-eyed and James trying not to crack up from how stupid this probably looked. Remus was, thankfully, not there. It was a full moon in a few days, and he had begged off tonight to get sleep while he still could. A pair of Hufflepuff girls were giggling a little.</p>
<p>But most of all, Sirius was aware of Simon’s eyes on him, expectant. He hadn’t been able to meet them yet; he was too nervous. Steeling himself, he looked at them now. He gasped involuntarily at how warm those eyes were, a soft brown flecked with bits of bronze. Simon smiled slightly at Sirius’s reaction.</p>
<p>“You know, there are unspoken time limits on these things,” Simon whispered, leaning even closer so now Sirius could feel each “s” on his lips. “And it is your dare. Either you kiss me soon or Marlene is gonna take the mickey out of you. I hear the penalties for not following through on these muggle games are pretty harsh.”</p>
<p>“She’s going to do that whether I kiss you or not,” Sirius mumbled tensely. Simon chuckled, and Sirius felt it in his gut.</p>
<p>“Then why not just kiss me and get it over with?”</p>
<p>“I...well…”</p>
<p>Simon leaned back just slightly. “Is it ‘cos I’m a boy?” Sirius hesitated, which seemed to tell Simon everything he needed to know. He nodded. “It’s alright, no one will hold it against you. It’s a dare, and everyone here knows it.” He leaned back in so their noses were almost touching. Sirius had to stop himself from leaning away. “Come on, Black. Where’s that Gryffindor courage we all know you have?”</p>
<p>That did it. Before he could stop himself, Sirius had closed his eyes and the short gap between him and Simon until their lips met with more force than he’d intended.</p>
<p>It was meant to just be a short, yet solid, kiss. That’s what Marlene had dared him to do. But when their lips met, albeit with some nervous rigidity, Sirius had felt a part of his chest crack open. That was the only way he could describe it. The feeling of Simon’s lips on his, of another boy’s lips on his, had broken through a barrier in him he hadn’t known was there. It hurt a little. He couldn’t get one thought out of his head. It was playing on repeat like a broken muggle record: I’m kissing a boy. I am kissing another boy. This is a boy I’m kissing. I’m kissing a boy. He was paralyzed with it.</p>
<p>It felt like the world was ending.</p>
<p>But Simon didn’t immediately pull away, either. In fact, if Sirius wasn’t mistaken, he could feel Simon’s lips moving slightly against his own, just softly, not pushing, just gently letting Sirius know Simon would stay here as long as Sirius wanted him to.</p>
<p>Did he want him to?</p>
<p>The crack got bigger, and still Sirius didn’t pull away. With his eyes closed like this, he could almost pretend no one else was here. The room was oddly silent. A part of Sirius was worried about this silence. Another part of him, the part shining slightly through the crack in his chest, didn’t want to worry about that, didn’t want to worry about the other people in the room.</p>
<p>It wanted to figure out what would happen if he moved his lips, too.</p>
<p>He didn’t get the chance. Before he’d made up his mind, Marlene said, “Okay, lovebirds, break it up. You did it. Dare completed. Let’s let somebody else go now, eh?”</p>
<p>Simon was the one who broke the kiss. Sirius was still a little dazed from the unexpectedly emotional experience. For a second, all he could do was stare at Simon, who gazed back with a soft smile that made Sirius want to try and kiss him again. But Simon moved back to his spot in the circle, and Sirius had to shake off what had just happened so he could continue the game. As he dared Dorcas to stand on her head for a minute straight, he briefly caught James’s eye. He was surprised to see that James looked more quizzical than anything else, like he was about to figure something out but hadn’t quite managed it yet. Sirius quickly looked away, his cheeks warm. There was nothing to figure out.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The small party broke up a short time later after Peter almost cried about being forced to admit he had a crush on Lacey, the Hufflepuff girl sitting next to him. In his defense, though, Sirius thought, it had been very rude of Lacey to laugh in his face about it. Dorcas had to declare the game over before either James or Sirius could step in on his behalf. Sirius had never punched a girl before, but nobody made his friends cry.</p>
<p>“Well that was a wild time,” James said on their way out of the classroom. The Marauders had hung back as everyone else left so they could slip out under James’s invisibility cloak, thus reducing their chances of being caught.</p>
<p>“No kidding,” Sirius said. He still hadn’t shaken the kiss.</p>
<p>Apparently, neither had James. “So. You kissed a bloke.” His tone, Sirius was sure, was meant to be nonchalant, but James was never any good at subtlety.</p>
<p>Sirius sighed heavily. “Okay, okay, get it out now, but keep in mind that it was a dare. I only did what any good Gryffindor would do.”</p>
<p>“Looked like more than that to me,” Peter mumbled. Sirius stamped on his foot hard. Peter squeaked.</p>
<p>“Quiet!” James hissed. “You’ll get us caught like that!”</p>
<p>“Sorry!” Peter whispered.</p>
<p>“It was just a dare,” Sirius insisted, residual stress making his voice defensive and harsh.</p>
<p>James held up his hands in surrender. “I know. I was just wondering...what was it like?”</p>
<p>A pang shot its way down the fresh fissure in Sirius’ chest. He hid it beneath a cocky smile he’d been trying to perfect. “Want to find out?”</p>
<p>James laughed it off, as he was meant to, but Sirius knew this was not the last he’d hear about this. Hee knew that James knew more than he was letting on. But Sirius wasn’t about to press the issue. The sooner he could forget about tonight, the better. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When people make plans, the universe laughs. Such was the case with Sirius Black when the next morning, on their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast, Sirius found himself being tapped on the shoulder by none other than Simon.</p>
<p>“Got a minute?” Simon asked quietly.</p>
<p>Sirius just stared at him for a second, a little dumbstruck. And a little nervous. Did Simon want to talk about the kiss? Had it been weird? Had he changed his mind and decided to be mad at Sirius?</p>
<p>“I don’t believe we’ve been introduced.” It was Remus, coming up behind Sirius like his knight in shining armor, intent on his mission to save Sirius from this awkward situation.</p>
<p>“Oh, right,” Sirius said. “Remus, this is Simon. He’s the Ravenclaw third year from the Truth or Dare game last night. Simon, this is our elusive fourth roommate, Remus.”</p>
<p>“It’s a pleasure,” Remus said, putting his hand out for Simon to shake. Sirius thought he heard a little tightness in Remus’s voice, but he chocked it up to the full moon.</p>
<p>“Likewise,” Simon said with a smile, returning the handshake. “Could I steal Sirius for a moment? I had a question to ask him about our Potions assignment.”</p>
<p>“Sure thing,” Remus said. Sirius’s heart fell. His knight in shining armor had betrayed him. “We’ll meet you in the Great Hall, yeah?” And with that he turned away and headed back to breakfast. James shot Sirius one last look as he followed, Peter in tow.</p>
<p>That left Sirius alone with Simon.</p>
<p>Alone with the boy he’d kissed.</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>“Can we go somewhere...I don’t know, more private?”</p>
<p>“W-why? What’s wrong with here?” Sirius asked quickly, looking around them at the mercifully thick stream of hungry students.</p>
<p>Simon looked at him until Sirius met his eyes again. “You know why. I want to talk about last night, if that’s alright with you.”</p>
<p>Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck.</p>
<p>Sirius gulped nervously. He could still feel the fissure in his chest as a dull ache, like a healing wound. If he could have stayed away from Simon, maybe it would have healed over and everything would have gone back to normal. Instead here Simon was, standing right in front of him, wanting to talk about...about...</p>
<p>“I-I don’t know if this is s-such a good idea,” Sirius stammered. “I-I mean--”</p>
<p>“Look, I’m not going to jump you or anything,” Simon said, throwing his hands up defensively. “I just want to talk. Because if I’m right, you may be feeling a little confused and upset right now. I get that.” He put his hands back down at the wary look on Sirius’s face. “I just want to talk. That’s all.”</p>
<p>The crack pulsed. His cheeks grew hot. “Just to talk?” Simon nodded. Well, what was the harm in talking, Sirius thought. Talking was fine. Talking could be harmless. He talked to people all the time. He found himself nodding slowly. “Okay. Yeah, okay. Sure. Where?”</p>
<p>“This way.”</p>
<p>Simon led Sirius to a tapestry hanging on the wall behind them. Before Sirius could ask what he was doing, Simon had seemingly passed through the tapestry. Intrigued, Sirius followed and found himself in a thin hall that had been invisible from the other side. “Whoa,” he said. “Secret passageway.”</p>
<p>Simon smiled at the look of wonder on Sirius’s face. “Don’t tell me the great Sirius Black, member of the infamous Marauders, didn’t know this was here?”</p>
<p>“Not this one,” Sirius said, then stopped. “You know about the Marauders?”</p>
<p>Simon laughed. “You blokes aren’t exactly subtle, you know that?”</p>
<p>Sirius paused, then decided to try and play it cool around the pounding in his chest. He shrugged, then said, “What’s the use in subtlety?”</p>
<p>His next breath caught in his throat as the look in Simon’s eyes grew more serious, more intense. “It has its merits.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t move. It was like the specks of bronze in Simon’s eyes had pinned him to the wall, like the needles you used to pin butterfly wings. Involuntarily, he found himself backing up against the wall. When he felt his back hit cold stone, he tried to play it off by purposefully leaning against it, crossing his arms in front of his chest and propping his foot against the wall in an attempt to look cool and collected. “So what did you want to talk about?”</p>
<p>Simon stayed where he was, letting Sirius have his space. He was grateful for that. Sirius didn’t think his heart could take it if Simon moved any closer. “It wasn’t just a dare. Not for me, anyway.”</p>
<p>An audible crack sounded in Sirius’s ears, perfectly in time with a further breaking in his chest. If this continued, Sirius wouldn’t have any chest left. “W-what? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I mean,” Simon said, putting his hands helplessly in the pockets of his robes, “that it wasn’t nothing. Not for me.” He looked at the floor, a soft blush coloring his cheeks, an effect Sirius couldn’t help but find endearing. “I mean, yeah, it was a dare, but it wasn’t...it wasn’t just, you know?” Sirius shook his head, trying to keep his breathing under control. He didn’t trust himself to speak. “I mean,” Simon said, taking his hands out of his pockets and running them over his face in exasperation before looking helplessly back at Sirius. “What I’m trying to say, Sirius, is that I like you. Like, that kiss was…” He trailed off for a second, trying to find the right word.</p>
<p>“Nice,” Sirius said. He stopped, shocked at the fact that he’d spoken at all. What had he just said?</p>
<p>Simon’s eyes shot from the ground back up to Sirius’s. It made his chest ache. “Exactly,” Simon said, a little astounded. “It was nice.” He took a step toward Sirius, who had to lower his foot back to the ground to stabilize himself. He pressed his back further into the wall. “Sirius, I’m gay.”</p>
<p>“What?” Sirius asked sharply.</p>
<p>“I...I’m gay, Sirius,” Simon said, seeing the quickening in Sirius’s breath and refusing to back down. Sirius felt his chest tighten, heard a slight roaring in his ears. “It means I like boys.”</p>
<p>“I know what gay means!” Sirius had to fight to bring his voice back down; the last thing he needed was for people to hear them. He crossed his arms tighter over his chest. Maybe if he just held them there, he could keep his heart inside where it belonged, and prevent his chest from breaking open.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Simon said softly, hesitantly. “Then do you know what kissing you felt like for me?”</p>
<p>Sirius shook his head. He couldn’t speak. He couldn’t move. He could only try and keep his breathing under control as his body heated up all over and his chest tried not to explode. The roaring was getting louder.</p>
<p>Simon took another step forward that Sirius barely registered. “I’ve kissed girls before. It never felt like that. Kissing you felt...nice. It felt right. Like…” Again, he was at a loss for words. Had he been feeling more like himself, Sirius would have thought that Simon really needed to figure out what he was going to say before he started speaking. As it was, he could barely keep himself upright.</p>
<p>Simon finally seemed to notice Sirius imploding. He rushed forward, face worried. Sirius wondered how he must look, clutching his chest, probably sweating a little, knees shaking with the effort of standing. “Sirius? Merlin, are you alright? I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to upset you, I just wanted to -”</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>Simon stopped. Sirius didn’t know what was happening. His chest was coming apart at the seams, there were waves in his ears, and he seemed to be falling slightly into the warmth of Simon’s eyes. Thinking had mostly stopped, leaving behind one simple thing.</p>
<p>Sirius really, really wanted to kiss Simon again.</p>
<p>So he did. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When your world falls apart around you, you can’t help but mourn for a minute. Sometimes you get lost in the wreckage of your old life. But sometimes you wipe away your tears and pick up the pieces, maybe building a new world from the old. If that’s not possible, then you set out for different lands, with foundations that won’t crumble so easily this time.</p>
<p>His old world was gone, shattered into pieces so small that Sirius wasn’t sure he’d ever remember how to put it back together. But he didn’t care. He was too busy building a new life from the taste of Simon’s tongue.</p>
