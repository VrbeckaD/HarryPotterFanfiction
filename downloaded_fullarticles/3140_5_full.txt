    <p>Professor McGonagall stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment. “When I call your name, you will put on a hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,” she said, then called out, ‘Abbott, Hannah!’</p><p>Harry swallowed, glancing at the other first years. Most looked eager, others frowning in determination, uncertainty fading from their faces as the hat continued to shout of houses from atop each new student's head.</p><p>“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry, “I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a Troll.”</p><p>Harry smiled weakly, inwardly wishing that they could have tried it on without all those people watching. He tried to surreptitiously wipe his sweaty palms on his robes, the chocolate frogs and pumpkin pasties from the train churning in his stomach. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or quick-witted or any of that other stuff at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt queasy, that would be the one for him. What if he was sick in front of the whole school? What if…? Harry’s stomach did an unpleasant flip as a horrible thought occurred to him. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake, and he had better get back on the train. He could still hear the Dursley’s laughter when they had dropped him off at King’s Cross - he couldn’t bear to imagine their reactions when he revealed he’d been kicked out because he couldn’t even impress a talking hat.</p><p>So caught up in imagining the Dursley’s cackling when he turned up at their doorstep again, he almost missed when Professor McGonagall called out, “Potter, Harry!” As he stumbled forwards, whispers broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.</p><p>The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the Hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second, he was looking at the black inside of the hat, the sounds from the hall strangely muffled despite the worn cloth. Heart thundering in his ears, he waited.</p><p>"Hmm," said a small voice in his ear. "Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh my goodness, yes – and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting … So where shall I put you?"</p><p>Then there was silence. Why wasn’t the hat saying anything? Harry gripped the edges of the stool, his stomach clenching with fear. This was it, the hat couldn’t place him, the voice would say he didn't belong anywhere, that there <em>was</em> a mistake; that he should go back, back to the Dursley's. Squeezing his eyes shut, he thought, ‘Please, just say a house, any at all.’</p><p>"Are you sure?" said the small voice. "Well, in that case – better be SLYTHERIN!"</p><p>Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. Relief washed over him as the hat was lifted from his head, until the words sunk in. Slytherin. The house everyone had scorned, the one Hagrid had told him had produced all the bad wizards. The relief was drowned by bitter disappointment as he hopped off the stool, dimly aware of the clapping that had erupted from the table second from the right. He had wanted a house, but Slytherin? The same house as Vol- as You-Know-Who? He chanced a look at Ron as he walked past and saw his gloomy look mirrored on the face of the first friend he'd ever made.</p><p>The Slytherin table were still clapping as he made his way over, several of them twisting in their seats to pat him on the back as he went by. A few whooped loudly, causing several other students to giggle. Despite his disappointment, Harry’s face began to burn as the enthusiastic clapping continued. His mood only further soured when he noticed the smirking face of Draco Malfoy further down the table next to the pearly figure of a dour-looking ghost. Harry scowled, and looked hurriedly for the closest gap far away from him, scrambling into a space between a lanky boy with a mop of blonde hair and, he noted with surprise, the bushy-haired girl from the train, Hermione Granger.</p><p>Trying to school his expression into something a little less miserable, Harry smiled weakly. "Hullo again. Guess we're in the same house."</p><p>Granger pursed her lips, nodding curtly before pointedly turning her back on him to watching the rest of the sorting. Ron had just stumbled up to the sorting hat looking slightly green, only for the hat to quickly shout "GRYFFINDOR!" Harry's stomach plummeted with the last small hope that Ron might also be in the same house as him as the final boy 'Zabini, Blaise' was also made a Slytherin. It’s good he’s in the same house as his brothers, Harry told himself firmly. How depressing that even the voice inside his own head didn’t sound convinced.</p><p>Albus Dumbledore had got to his feet. "Welcome!" he said. "Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you!"</p><p>This this odd pronouncement with claps and cheers, drawing Harry from his misery. "Is he – a bit mad?" he asked the older boy next to him uncertainly, nodding to Dumbledore.</p><p>The older boy shrugged. "Dumbledore's one of the greatest wizards of our time, or so they say. With great power comes great insanity. Mmm, Yorkshire pudding."</p><p>Harry's mouth fell open as the golden dishes suddenly filled with food from thin air.</p><p>Now that the feasting part had seemingly begun, the students around him broke into loud chatter, laughter and conversations ringing through the hall. Harry helped himself to a bit of everything, deciding to watch and listen to the other students as he ate. As far as he could see, the Slytherins all seemed normal enough, if a bit snooty.</p><p>Granger was quizzing the bored-looking Prefect opposite them about lessons. The hard-faced girl who had been sorted just before him was excitedly recounting her holiday in Monaco to her friend. A group of older boys was having a heated debate over the recent loss of their quidditch team. The squat boy across the table was busy wolfing down as much as he could eat, shovelling food into his mouth so fast he didn't seem to be chewing. The sallow girl next to Granger looked sick when a loud slurp from the boy caused gravy to spatter the table, the other students shooting filthy looks his way.</p><p>Harry's neighbour finally paused in his meal to snarl at the other boy. "For Merlin's sake Bole, slow down, you're embarrassing yourself, and more importantly, disgusting the rest of us."</p><p>With a giant effort, Bole swallowed his mouthful and shook his drumstick at the older boy. "I've got to eat more, build up my strength. I'm trying out for the team this year."</p><p>The older boy blinked slowly. "Blimey, I didn't know you knew how to ride a broom, Bole!" he exclaimed with mock surprise. "That'll be a sight; I've never seen a shaved gorilla on a broomstick before."</p><p>The hard-faced girl burst into laughter as Bole frowned, evidently confused. Smirking, the other boy turned to Harry. "Terrence Higgs" he said with a wink. "Seventh year. I play Seeker for Slytherin. And of course, you're Harry Potter."</p><p>"Er, y-yeah," said Harry, thrown by the sudden shift in attention. Higgs had a very snooty voice, like the posh boys that occasionally swanned through the London underground in their stupidly striped blazers and knee-high socks. It was a bit annoying that a toff like that was making him embarrassed, but Harry could feel his face begin to burn again as Higgs' eyes flittered over his forehead. "So, um, you play Seeker?" he said weakly. His fingers twitched, longing to smooth down his fringe.</p><p>Higgs hummed distractedly, eyes constantly flickering up to Harry’s forehead.</p><p>“Is the, um, the Quidditch team very good? The Slytherin one, I mean?” Harry asked desperately, hands balled into fists to resist the urge to flatten his fringe.</p><p>Higgs finally focused on his words, a smug smile curling his lips. “<em>Obviously. </em>We’ve been in the finals of the Inter-House <em>Quidditch</em> Cup for the past five years, <em>and</em> won the last two.”</p><p>Harry was pretty sure he didn’t quite disguise his automatic eye-roll at this boast, and Higgs’ sharp eyes didn’t miss it, narrowing dangerously, but Harry switched to his tried and true fall-back to dealing with vain idiots: overly bright flattery.</p><p>“Oh, <em>wow</em>! Slytherin must be really amazing!” Harry beamed. “I had <em>no</em> idea this House was so cool.” A bit much, but the way Higgs relaxed, smirk falling back into place, it seemed to do the job.</p><p>"Well now," the dark-skinned boy next to Higgs leaned over him, eyeing Harry. "Glad to hear The Boy-Who-Lived is happy to be in <em>our</em> House. I'd say this calls for a toast, but the other houses will only get jealous, I'm sure." He lifted his golden goblet anyway. Several of the nearby Slytherins chortled.</p><p>Harry’s smile slipped a little. "Oh, um… thank you? It’s nice how welcoming… you all… are." His forehead was itching now under so much unusual scrutiny. His hand jumped up to automatically flatten his fringe, trying at the last minute to disguise the movement by fiddling with his glasses, which of course did not draw attention to his scar <em>at</em> <em>all</em>.</p><p>"Ooooh, so <em>that's</em> it, the famous curse scar!" said the hard-faced girl, shamelessly leaning forward for a better look. Flushing at the attention, Harry gave up and ducked his head, flattening his fringe.</p><p>"Don't act all bashful," the dark-skinned boy reproachfully. "You are the famous Harry Potter. That mark on your head is of some notoriety. You would do well not to cover it, as if it’s something shameful!"</p><p>"Come now, Dewan" purred the Prefect, abruptly breaking off her conversation Granger to chime in. "His modesty is charming, it is not? That could work just as well. Too prideful and he might as well be a Lion. His blushes are far more enticing." Granger scowled at the swerve in conversation.</p><p>Unwillingly, Harry could feel his cheeks flush even more. The sallow girl beside Granger giggled.</p><p>“Steady on, Greengrass,” Dewan drawled, “He’s still a little first-year.”</p><p>The Prefect Greengrass’ smile was razor sharp. “Just an observation. Some of us were raised with a little decorum. Besides, Harry didn’t mind, <em>did</em> you, Harry dear?”</p><p>Mumbling indistinctly seemed good enough an answer, so Harry kept his head firmly down, face ablaze. Next time he wasn’t going to be so damn picky about his seating arrangements and just sit next to the Slytherin ghost – at least the Bloody Baron didn’t seem to chatty sort. Anything to save him from this unpleasant conversation.</p><p>On cue, Draco Malfoy elbowed his way onto the seat opposite Harry. "Having fun, Potter?" he sneered.</p><p>Even if the interruption to the conversation was welcome, Harry would rather eat his socks than admit he was grateful for Malfoy's presence. Harry tried to communicate this via glare, but this only seemed to please Malfoy, that insufferable smirk widening.</p><p>"What's the matter? Look at all the new friends you're making! Oh wait, I know. You don't want them. You already have friends, don't you?" He tipped his chin at the table on the opposite wall. Harry could see Ron sandwiched between his brothers, Percy the Prefect spooning a pile of greens onto Ron's plate with a frown. He was chatting with the other Gryffindor boys, a smile on his face. He looked <em>happy</em>.</p><p>Harry swallowed, staring determinedly down at his plate and tried not to feel miserable.</p><p>Malfoy leaned over the table, eyes glinting malevolently. "Bet you wished you hadn't chosen that riffraff before, eh? Bet you wished you knew who to choose as a friend earlier."</p><p>Harry bristled. "Better than ever choosing you," he hissed back.</p><p>Around them, the older students tittered. Malfoy's pale cheeks flushed, but already his mouth was twisting into a cruel smile. “Going to hang out with that blood traitor for the next seven years, then?”</p><p>"Just because we're in different houses now doesn't mean me and Ron can't be friends," Harry spat back.</p><p>At once both Bole and Higgs laughed, Bole spraying food across the table and onto the sallow girl, who howled with rage. Greengrass cleared the mess with a bored flick of her wand and a drawled, “Don’t make a such a fuss, little Queenie.”</p><p>"Ah bless him, first years are so naïve," Higgs chortled, patting Harry shoulder fondly. Harry stiffened at the condescending tone, the overly familiar touch. "Listen Potter, Slytherins and Gryffindors hate one another on principle. Our rivalry is practically traditional at this point, may as well be on the Hogwarts crest. Besides, we never associate with meatheads like them," he explained, disdainful gaze sweeping over the other house table.</p><p>"Ah, but Potter can ‘tell the wrong sort for himself’, can't he?" said Malfoy softly, cold malice in every word. "He just loves paling around with blood traitors and mudbloods."</p><p>Once again, a bunch of words and terms he’d never heard before; the day had been exhausting enough without Malfoy reminding Harry that he didn’t know squat about the magical world with new bloody words. "Yeah, well, I don't even know what a mudblood <em>is</em> Malfoy, but I’m guessing it’s a slimy git like you?"</p><p>This time the sallow girl answered, "That’s because he’s being crude, you shouldn’t use that word, Harry. But he means those who don’t have a drop of magical blood in their ancestry, you know, <em>muggleborn</em>." Her face twisted in disdain as if that too was some horrible swear.</p><p>Granger twisted in her seat, apparently now interested in the conversation. "For your information, <em>I</em> happen to be muggleborn" she snapped angrily.</p><p>Rather than appearing abashed, the other girl stiffened and leaned away from Granger as though she were diseased.</p><p>"A muggleborn?" hissed the hard-faced girl beside Bole, staring at Granger opened mouthed. "In Slytherin?" Her mouth began to curl into a cruel smile, as Malfoy openly snickered.</p><p>Granger’s self-righteous ire flickered uncertainly. "Well, yes. So what? The sorting hat <em>did</em> place me here, and <em>I </em>certainly think I’m ‘cunning’ enough or whatever it was the Hat said," she stated as defiantly as possible with everyone in the vicinity goggling at her. “So I’m here. Is- is that a problem?”</p><p>Higgs and Dewan shared a look, before Higgs shook his head. "Bloody hat, what was it thinking. As if we just take any old person in our great house.”</p><p>“What can you expect from a hat that belonged to old Godric Gryffindor?” Dewan spat, throwing a venomous glare at Granger. “Evidently it doesn’t give a shit about blood, the stupid thing. Now we’ve got the first damn mudblood in Slytherin. In our noble house!”</p><p>Both Harry and Granger drew back, shocked by the malice the older boys suddenly exuded. So this, Harry realised, was what Ron had meant about being in Slytherin – apparently the house of stuck-up wankers.</p><p>“Well,” said Higgs slowly, giving her a slow appraising look. “At least this’ll be <em>interesting</em>. And just to make it more sporting, I’ll give you some advice: You'd better learn some damn good counter-curses if you want any peace. Buuuut, that being said, it’ll be fun to see what gets past your guard. My money is on you waking up with tentacles. Or maybe green. Or in the Lake with the Giant Squid."</p><p>Granger looked horrified, "B-but no one would… surely that's against the rules!" she gasped, looking at the Prefect girl for reassurance. "I mean, no one will try and… <em>attack</em> me, will they? Just because my parents weren’t magical?"</p><p>It was a loud silence following her question, the other students suddenly becoming very interested in their dessert, but of course, it was Malfoy who answered her with glee.</p><p>"Oh, you don't have to worry about a thing," he said cheerily, Harry’s eyes narrowing at how amiable his tone was. Malfoy continued unperturbed. "Slytherins are masters at being subtle. If you <em>do</em> get jinxed, well, more correctly, <em>when</em> you get jinxed, you won't even know what hit you. It’ll be an accident, right? A silly mistake. It’s not like it would be on <em>purpose, </em>right? And of course, there’ll be no evidence, not like you’d have proof even if you did go cry to the teachers. Bet you would, too. Bet you’re the type to run off crying to the adults because you’re a weak little nobody who can’t take care of herself."</p><p>Malfoy grinned slyly and looked Harry in the eye as he continued, "And weak doesn't belong in Slytherin. Weak doesn't <em>survive</em> long in Slytherin."</p><p>The silence after this little speech was somehow even louder than before. Granger blinked rapidly, anger draining from her face as her eyes became glassy. She ducked her head, bushy hair falling in a thick curtain around her face. Harry glanced uncertainly around him, but the other students now seemed to be determinedly focused elsewhere.</p><p><em>Definitely</em> a house of stuck-up wankers.</p><p>Harry gritted his teeth, angry at the heavy lump of dread suddenly lodged in his stomach. They’re just bullies, he told himself firmly. No different from Dudley really. Squaring his shoulders, Harry put on his best glare. “Just shove off, Malfoy.”</p><p>“And why should I? This is <em>our </em>house table, after all, and at least I <em>know</em> I belong here,” Malfoy said slowly, vicious smile unflinchingly in place. “Besides, I think we’re getting along swimmingly, don’t you? I just know the next seven years will be <em>so</em> much fun.”</p><p>Harry had never really thought he could hate someone more than the Dursleys, but looking into Malfoy's pale grey eyes, he decided perhaps he'd been wrong. At least he’d had plenty of practising pushing down the furious words he longed to spit back, and there’s was some satisfaction to be had in ignoring everyone as Malfoy strutted off, choosing instead to spend the rest of the feast in stony silence.</p><p>By the time the feast ended Harry was exhausted, mentally and physically, stumbling over his feet as he followed Granger blindly through the castle as they trailed after the other first years. Clanging through his head was the single terrifying thought: Just how on earth was he supposed to deal with seven more years of this? And he’d been really looking forward to this. Leaving the Dursley’s, being a part of this weird new world, learning <em>actual</em> magic. It’d all been too good to be true.</p><p>He was only half aware that they were heading down, until at last they stopped before a blank patch of stone wall. The Prefect girl leading the first years stepped forward and said in an authoritative voice, "Aurum potestas est."</p><p>A stone door concealed in the wall slid open, revealing the Slytherin common room, a long underground room with stone walls and polished oak panelling from which round, greenish lamps glowed. Ornate armchairs with velvet cushions sat around an elaborately carved mantelpiece, where an enormous fire crackled, its warmth radiating throughout the room. It reminded Harry of his nosy Aunt Petunia’s favourite television show, the equally nosy female host wandering around the country houses of wealthy families looking unimpressed with their sumptuous surroundings.  The common room looked like what Uncle Vernon had always disdainfully deemed ‘Old Money’, ostentatious and remote, but despite the extravagant décor, Harry felt oddly at ease. The warmth of the fireplace combined with the green lamps made him feel like he was underwater in a very warm pool, which only served to make him sleepier than before.</p><p>The girls filed off to their dormitories, Granger trailing behind them without a word, face perfectly blank. Harry sighed, reluctantly shuffling away with the other boys. At the end of a low hall he at last found his room: five four-poster beds hung with emerald-green velvet curtains, their trunks lining the walls. Harry hurried to change into his pyjamas, almost too tired to be irritated that Malfoy had chosen the bed next to him. Almost.</p><p>He distractedly pulled his worn pyjama pants on, aware of the gaze burning into his back.</p><p>“So…” that drawling voice began, but Harry vaulted into the bed, pyjama shirt only half buttoned.</p><p>"Go ahead and try and ignore me all you want," Malfoy hissed as Harry yanked the velvet curtains closed, but the soft voice slithered through the fabric regardless. "But we'll be spending the next seven years together. Can you keep up this grudge for that long?"</p><p>"Only if you keep making it so easy, Malfoy" he growled back, letting his head sink into the sinfully soft pillow.</p><p>Sleep was already halfway to claiming him as a drawling voice muttered, "Just for you, Potter, just for you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Despite the breathtaking majesty a castle offered, looming over the sunny ground and perfect mirror of the lake, it wasn't, Harry mused, the best place to turn into a school. Particularly when that castle happened to be a <em>magic</em> castle, what with doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, vanishing steps, ghosts, and the resident poltergeist, Peeves. <em>And a hundred and forty-two staircases!</em></p><p>Of course, Harry loved all these magical things, and loved Hogwarts even more for it, despite its many eccentricities. However, when he was stuck up to his thigh in the trick step on one of the <em>hundred and forty-two staircases</em> with Malfoy roaring with laughter as various students openly goggled at him as they passed, his delight in these magical elements were, currently, rather low.</p><p>"Damn it Malfoy, either help me out or piss off!" he snarled, frantically yanking at his leg as a group of fourth year girls giggled loudly at him.</p><p>So far, his first day at Hogwarts had been a blur, a whirlwind of new classmates, teachers, and Malfoy’s snide remarks. Nervous about the classes themselves, about navigating to the classes, and the blatant stares that followed him between those classes were no less embarrassing as they’d been the night before, which meant Harry’s temper was running dangerously short. But Malfoy was proving to be exceptionally talented in pushing Harry to his limits. It was like dealing with Dudley, but one who didn’t have a brain made out of bricks, which made ignoring him all the harder, each nasty word pouring from Malfoy’s mouth making Harry bristle with fury, even when he needed his full attention on getting to his classes. Which was a task in of itself; it was difficult navigating an entire castle, but a magically castle made the task even harder, especially when most of Harry’s focus was constantly being redirected towards the arrogant little git swaggering along next to him.</p><p>Which of course made him forget all about the trick step.</p><p>"This is all <em>your</em> stupid, bloody fault!" Harry shouted as his leg sunk another inch.</p><p>Malfoy peered down at him owlishly. "How mean of you, blaming me!" He even pouted, although his face couldn’t seem to maintain that for more than a few seconds before the cruel smirk slid back into place. "But what did you say my options were? Help you or leave you? I think I'll go, and you can remain there until the weekend if you want."</p><p>He turned away and Harry swore furiously. The other students were already thinning out as they hurried to class, probably incorrectly assuming Malfoy would help him, and judging by last night, none of the older Slytherins that were passing by seemed the kind to lend a helping hand. It was time to swallow his pride, if only for a moment.</p><p>"Hang on, Malfoy!" he called out desperately, but Malfoy kept climbing the staircase. Harry began to panic – Malfoy wasn't really going to leave him there, was he? "Malfoy, don't go, I need your help!"</p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, Harry felt his face heat up, wishing the words back into his mouth. Damn it all, but he'd never felt so pathetic in his entire life. Thankfully, Malfoy had paused, then slowly turned around. He wore the biggest, smuggest grin, and cocking his head to the side, regarded Harry with unconcealed glee.</p><p>"What was that, Potter?" he asked innocently.</p><p>"You heard me the first time!" Harry snarled back.</p><p>"Yeah, I did," admitted Malfoy with a smirk, "But I want you to say it again."</p><p>Bollocks! Now Harry was more than literally stuck. To stay there or to beg? It was tempting to just stay there, especially with the way those grey eyes were glittering maliciously. But he needed to get to his class. Plus, his thigh had just gone numb. Gritting his teeth, he spat out with best facsimile of politeness, "Malfoy, I would really appreciate it if you helped me out of this step."</p><p>There was a long pause, long enough that Harry started wondering with horror if Malfoy expected him to say ‘Please’. At last, to his utter relief, Malfoy turned back, taking each stair with deliberate slowness. Locking his eyes with Harry's, he slowly stretched out a hand. Harry was irresistibly reminded of the train to Hogwarts, and the offered hand of friendship. And the refusal.</p><p>Looking into those grey eyes, Harry knew Malfoy was thinking of that too. Harry reached for Malfoy's hand. Those grey eyes flared with triumph as Harry’s fingers slid against his palm.</p><p>Malfoy jerked his hand back.</p><p>"Sorry, Potter," he whispered maliciously. "But now we're even. Next time, don't refuse help when it's offered. See you around."</p><p>And with a twirl of his robes, he vanished up the stairs, smiling at Harry's scream of rage.</p><p>"Oh my! Late on your first lesson!" squeaked the tiny Charms teacher, Professor Flitwick, as Harry entered the classroom ten minutes later, red-faced and flushed. "And you are…?"</p><p>"Harry Potter, sir" he muttered, "Sorry I'm so late sir, but I fell in the trick step and I had to wait until a teacher came by to get out again."</p><p>Professor Flitwick gave an excited squeak at his name and toppled off the pile of books he was standing on. When he re-emerged, he was beaming at Harry. "Well then, no harm done, this <em>is</em> your first week here, so tardiness is forgivable. But was there no one there to help you? A fellow classmate, perhaps?"</p><p>At this, Harry threw a venomous glare at Malfoy, who pulled a face at Harry behind Flitwick's back. "No one, sir," he lied, taking his seat beside Tracy Davis. Out of the corner of his eye, he could make out Hermione Granger scowling at him, and wondered what it was he'd possibly done to upset her. They hadn’t spoken since the unpleasantness at the feast last night, and Harry had assumed that Granger was somehow angry with as well as the others, seeing as she was ignoring them all completely.</p><p>But as soon as class ended, Granger dropped into step beside him. Harry thought he should probably ask if Granger was alright after what happened the night before, if the other girls had been nasty at all in the dorms.</p><p>“How are yo-” Harry began, before Granger cut him off.</p><p>It wasn’t about last night, or the stupid attitude the Slytherin’s had, or even about what had happened in class so far. No, Granger wanted to give a very long and snooty lecture on school rules and the horrors of tardiness. How it was important to be diligent even on his first day of classes. How important appearances were. How on earth he could bear walking about on his first day of school without flattening that messy hair of his.</p><p>Harry was ever so slightly reminded of his Aunt Petunia.</p><p>“I didn’t come late on purpose,” Harry muttered petulantly, but Granger merely tutted.</p><p>“First impressions are important, you know,” she said, glancing furtively at the backs of their classmates. “And flouting school rules is a sure-fire way to draw attention to yourself. You don’t want a black-mark against your name already, do you?”</p><p>Harry inwardly marvelled at how bossy a person’s voice could be. Wasn’t the Sorting Hat supposed to put them in houses with similar personalities or something? This talk of educational discipline was nearly as dull as listening to his uncle talk about drills.</p><p>“And another thing-”</p><p>"Honestly, Granger, you act as if school rules are the be-all and end-all. No doubt that’s the case with <em>muggle</em> schools," sallow Daphne Greengrass scoffed back at them. Immediately Granger’s face turned stony. “Hogwarts is an ancient centre of magical forces, it has secrets and tricks all through it to its very foundation. It takes real knowhow to not be tricked up by it. <em>Everyone</em> knows that. So that’s why tardiness is allowed on your first day, plus, we’re sweet little first years who don’t know any better."</p><p>"That’s right, rules don’t apply while we’re still learning the ropes," the hard-faced Pansy Parkinson added, flicking her bangs with a haughty sniff. "Besides, a <em>true</em> Slytherin knows that rules are only important so long as they benefit us."</p><p>"Well, that’s not how I-" Granger began, but this time Malfoy cut her off.</p><p>"No, Granger, don’t you get it? We don’t care. <em>This</em> is how it works: Slytherins only follow rules when they work in our favour. Otherwise, they're there as general guidelines, to be broken or bent to our advantage. That's why the other houses suck: they always follow the rules, Gryffindor more than most, the puffed-up prats. My father always says that rules exist to help us rise to the top, it’s not about obeying them or not, it’s only about success. A pureblood would <em>know </em>that. And besides, nothing's illegal until you're caught, and even then, it's not set in stone, so long as you spin it right. So stop trying to tell us how it should be when you don’t know a thing about how we do things here in the wizarding world."</p><p>Daphne Greengrass was nodding sagely. “That’s the pureblood way. As a muggleborn who doesn’t know <em>anything</em>, it would be a good idea if you listened to those of us who actually know what we’re doing.”</p><p>Harry scowled at her superior tone, but unlike last night, instead of looking hurt Granger straightened, a startling sunny smile on her face. “Oh <em>really</em>? So, it <em>is</em> true that there are pureblood mores?” she said in cheery monotone. “I’d read about it, but none of that was mentioned in any of the recent chapters of <em>Hogwarts: A History</em>, so I thought that sort of old fashioned stuff had died out, you know<em>. </em>Maybe it just wasn’t important enough to mention. I’d better go read that again, maybe it can enlighten me a bit more on your ‘proper pureblood ways’.”</p><p>And with that, she swept off. A quick glance at his classmates’ thunderous expressions had Harry hurry after her, even as he inwardly cheered her words. Still, this would probably not end well.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As if Hogwarts wasn’t proving complicated enough, Harry was taking his first overdue go at the whole friendship business and it was proving more difficult that he would have liked.</p><p>He’d managed the first few days of classes so far, insofar as his teachers didn’t yell at him for being, as one teacher had put it, a dunderhead – in fact, it was surprising to find that he wasn’t miles behind everyone else despite having a class full of kids from magical families. Neither of Malfoy’s hulking bodguards, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, had much when it came to critical thinking beyond "chocolate or vanilla", and Pansy Parkinson seemed more interested in proving to be better than Daphne Greengrass and vice versa than following what was being said in class. In fact, the only one who didn’t seem to be struggling at all with the new content was Granger, who after the standoff after Charms seemed strangely buoyed, intent on besting all her classmates and proving herself worthy of being in Slytherin, a tenacity that was, despite their best attempts to relentlessly ostracise her, garnering the attention of the other Slytherins enough into reassessing her points.</p><p>Maybe it was because they both had miss stepped that first night and there was some weird unspoken camaraderie but somehow Harry was spending an awful lot of time with Granger. She tolerated his presence next to her, and that was preferable to being near the other Slytherins, so Harry didn’t mind, even if she was relentlessly annoying. A silent and distant sort of amity, that had been all of Harry’s relationships with students that didn’t outright avoid him because of Dudley.</p><p>But the points were making the whole friendship situation a little murkier. And the points were another thing.</p><p>Learning how to navigate Hogwarts, and even the subjects, were nothing, <em>nothing</em>, compared to how difficult surviving the Slytherin House was turning out to be.</p><p>Of course, Harry had very quickly realised that his house was not like the others, seeing as it was comprised of stuck up prats, but he was pretty sure the other houses didn’t function <em>quite </em>like Slytherin did. In the other houses, year groups didn’t really intermingle, instead forming small friendship groups within their years, giggling girls in their little cliques and boys clustering around like-minded boys.</p><p>There was none of that in Slytherin.</p><p>Instead, the Slytherin house was based on a complex social hierarchy that no one was exempt from. It was the same kind of weird social structing that was unspoken, the kind Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon excelled at with the rest of the neighbourhood – sticking their noses into each other’s business, gossiping constantly, jockeying for positions and shunting people down the ladder for the smallest of reasons.</p><p>Stupid, petty, pointless nonsense. And Harry was stuck right smack dab in the middle of it all. The Slytherins had set up their own informal house cup, but rather than a cup, the prize was being Top Lord or Lady Wanker, and Harry would have happily had none of it, but they weren’t making it easy for him. Rank was everything in Slytherin. And with a constant fluctuation in ranks, everyone had to be constantly aware of who were placed at what, or risk being flung to the bottom.</p><p>Harry had known bullies all his life, but Dudley and his gang had nothing on the insidious cruelty of the Slytherin House. Although from what Harry had observed over the years, this sort of gang mentality and brutal pecking order was pretty normal for teenagers, but Slytherin’s, being ambitious sods, were of course better at it than the other Houses.</p><p>How someone scored owed to various factors, with blood purity being the obvious one that Harry had learnt on day one. But as much as they boasted about it, it seemed blood status alone only counted for so much in Slytherin’s cutthroat hierarchy. Vincent and Gregory were both purebloods, and both of them were also complete morons. Sure, they had brute strength, but physical intimidation was only so useful and it wasn’t exactly subtle, something that was apparently important despite what massive drama-queens the Slytherins were.</p><p>But the lesson Harry learned over and over was that Slytherins weren’t joking when they called themselves the house of the cunning and ambitious. They prided themselves on their cunning and their ambition, and if someone had neither, they were immediately ranked lower on the social ladder like as not. It was ambition over cunning, cunning over cleverness, cleverness over loyalty, and loyalty over bravery. And, they had not so patiently explained over Harry’s first week, courage and loyalty were tricky characteristics, as one must need courage in order to succeed and loyalty from others to achieve their goals, but it can also equate into foolhardiness, impulsiveness, and perseverance – traits that were, the Slytherins sneered, why Gryffindors were so pathetic and stupid and not nearly as good as <em>their</em> house. Slytherins had to know the difference in an objective worth persisting in and one that must be given up as a dud. They also had to know who deserved loyalty, had to be clever enough to know who was worth befriending or supporting, whether to play the long game or go for short term rewards, whether a mistake was irredeemable or fixable – it was enough different social rules to make Harry’s head hurt.</p><p>Currently, Harry had about 55 points: 10 as a half-blood with two magical parents, 10 as a first year, 10 because he was deemed moderately clever, another 5 for his good behaviour in classes, and 20 because he was famous. Normally first years ranked quite low initially, as they were considered variables, with their true worth and character to be determined more solidly in the years to come. Even though Harry was unusually high because of the added bonus of fame boosting him up, he was nowhere near the top in his year. Clever and talented purebloods always came first in Slytherin. Even as he snorted at how stupid the point system was, in all honesty, Harry was just happy he wasn't coming last.</p><p>That honour went, unsurprisingly, to Granger.</p><p>As a muggleborn she got minus points, something that, the others had gleefully pointed out at every opportunity, had never ever happened before in Slytherin. Granger had responded to that by dominating each class by answering every question the teacher posed and even succeeding in their first spells right off the bat, already earning several house points from the teachers. Despite her apparent disdain, Granger had looked smug when, after some furious debate, the older students had deemed her worthy for a 4-point score. Measly though it was, by some unwritten law, this had been enough for the other first years to get the go ahead and slightly dial back their bullying and absorb her into ‘The House’.</p><p>Which was the problem for Harry. At least with Granger there had been someone else to be outside the system, standing with him in solidarity against the stupidity of the collective Slytherin clique. But they hadn’t even got to Friday before she’d somehow won their reluctant admiration and acceptance, even if she was still a mudblood stain on their noble House. But Harry was never given the chance to stand apart from the group. He was absorbed into their group from the get-go, whether he liked it or not.</p><p>Having gone to school with Dudley all his life had ensured Harry had never had any real friends, and his understanding of friendship groups was admittedly spotty, but he was sure the way the Slytherins approached friendships were not the norm – somehow everyone was kinda sorta friends with everyone. Pansy Parkinson had explained with a patronising smile that this ensured that if any one of them turned out to be successful in the future, everyone else would be at least friendly acquaintances with them. “It’s not who <em>you</em> are, Harry, it’s who you <em>are</em>,” she explained to him, as if, Harry thought with exasperation, what she said had any actual meaning. Especially since this big group of ‘friendly acquaintances’ still somehow managed to also have everything from petty revenge to fierce interpersonal vendettas. “It’s just like one big happy, dysfunctional family,” Tracy Davis had said cheerfully. “You all stick together even when you hate each other. It’s like, pack bond mentality, or whatever.” At least Harry was perfecting the art of nodding along to this drivel.</p><p>But that was just it, even though it was all drivel, he just couldn’t escape it. And even more annoyingly, he didn’t really want to.</p><p>All his life he’d gone friendless, but somehow Harry had been thrust into a large group of people who tolerated his presence, not only speaking to him in a nice fashion with minimal snide comments, but who also seemed to not mind being around him, and he, well, simply put he had absolutely no idea how to deal with it.</p><p>He was perceptive enough to know that they didn’t particularly care about him beyond whatever weirdo house hierarchy dictated they do, but worst of all, despite all his reservations about Slytherin, Harry actually found himself enjoying the feeling of being surrounded by people who actually bothered to talk and listen to him – he even allowed himself in the darkest part of his mind to think that, getting past all the blood purity stuff, they could be potential friends. Though perhaps saying they were potential friends was an exaggeration, because Malfoy was <em>definitely</em> never going to be his friend (more like mortal enemy), the girls were busy working out the hierarchy between <em>them</em>, Blaise Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle were utterly uninterested in the drama of the class, and Granger was such a bossy know-it-all who didn't seem the slightest bit interested in any of them outside of proving herself as the smartest in the class. So no, not really anywhere close to being friends, but their acceptance was enough that Harry didn’t feel completely miserable.</p><p>But here at Hogwarts, away from Dudley, away from his baggy hand-me-down clothes and freaky reputation, Harry had really hoped he could make a real friend.</p><p>Which was the reason Friday was an important day, a moment Harry had been hoping for and dreading all week. They had Double Potions with the Gryffindors, and it would be the first time Harry would get a chance to talk to Ron since the Sorting without the prying eyes of the whole school on them.</p><p>He’d naively been under the assumption that Potions would be a good opportunity where he could talk to Ron once more, and it seemed from the smiles they’d shared across the dining hall at dinner on Thursday, that Ron had much the same idea. This hope was swiftly crushed when Daphne Greengrass’ older sister Thalia the Prefect came back to the common room raging at Percy Weasley.</p><p>“Upstart blood-traitor as the audacity to order <em>me</em> about!” she’d snarled, throwing herself onto a chaise lounge, pouting theatrically as her friends comforted her by recounting every horrible thing they’d ever heard or suspected about Percy Weasley.</p><p>Harry didn’t need to know the ins and outs of pureblood society to know that being a ‘blood traitor’ wasn’t a good thing. “Weasleys, blood traitors, the lot of them,” Malfoy had hissed as they clambered into bed that night. Even as Harry dragged his curtains across to indicate end of discussion, Malfoy, as usual continued unperturbed. “Good thing the blood traitors are all off in Gryffindor. Wouldn’t be caught dead paling around with someone like <em>that</em>. Not unless I wanted everyone to think <em>I </em>was one too.”</p><p>Harry punched his pillow into shape, wishing it was a certain someone’s face. But it didn’t change anything. There were only two options –talk to Ron and rekindle their friendship, or remain on 55 points and keep on speaking terms with his housemates by blanking Ron.</p><p>During breakfast, Harry could practically feel the eyes of his fellow Slytherins drilling into him, waiting for him to take his stance on the proverbial battlefield between Gryffindor and Slytherin. Even Granger seemed tense, although that may have simply been because it was the first lesson of a new subject.</p><p>The arrival of the post brought a welcome distraction to the evil eyes his classmates were giving him.</p><p>Hedwig had been visiting him every day, nibbling on his toast and giving his ear an affectionate nip, but today she landed in front of him and dropped a letter onto his plate. Wondering who on earth it was from, Harry tore it open at once.</p><p>"<strong><em>Dear Harry,</em></strong></p><p>
  <strong> <em>I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.</em> </strong>
</p><p>
  <strong> <em>Hagrid"</em> </strong>
</p><p>Harry was just about to reply when the note was snatched from his grasp. He looked up to see Malfoy smirking at him across the table. Somehow, by some petty unspoken agreement, Harry and Malfoy had made a point to sit directly across from one another at meals, the better to throw a venomous glare or two at each other with a sprinkle of shin kicking.</p><p>"Who's sent you a letter, Potter?" he drawled, unfolding the letter with a flourish.</p><p>"Give it back!" Harry snatched desperately for the note but Malfoy simply leant backwards out of reach. His grey eyes widened as he read.</p><p>Harry felt his ears burn. Malfoy had been receiving sweets and the like from home nearly every day, something he would pointedly rub in Harry's face. Harry could just imagine how Malfoy would hold this over him; he'd already made his opinion of the gamekeeper clear at Diagon Alley.</p><p>Malfoy let out a sharp laugh. "<em>Tea</em>? With that great oaf? Merlin, Potter, are you really that desperate for company, or do you just like befriending half-wits?" He glanced openly over to the Gryffindor table.</p><p>Harry stood angrily, a wave of fury rising in him at Malfoy’s barbs. He didn't need any reminders of his budding friendship with Ron, not today when it could possibly be all over. "Don't you dare say that about Hagrid!" he snarled, ignoring the looks this attracted from the rest of the table. "You don't know anything about him, Malfoy! Hagrid's really cool and interesting, which is more than I can say about <em>you</em>."</p><p>Malfoy flushed pink and Harry took the opportunity to snatch back his letter. "Yes, please, I'll see you later," he spoke aloud for Malfoy’s benefit as he scrawled his answer on the back.</p><p>As Hedwig took off again, Harry and Malfoy were locked in a silent battle of wills, staring one another down, not even looking away when the others resumed talking. Harry narrowed his eyes at Malfoy as Zabini stole the kippers from his plate. Malfoy glared back, not breaking eye contact as he passed the syrup to Crabbe.</p><p>“Boys,” Parkinson said with exasperation, rolling her eyes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because Potions turned out to be a disaster.</p><p>It seemed that Harry needn't have worried about finding an opportunity to talk to Ron, because he never even got the chance to approach him. By some telepathic hivemind the other Slytherins all seemed to have, as soon as they entered the dungeons Harry found himself immediately flanked on all sides, herding him towards the left side of the class. The Gryffindors were already there, Ron sitting beside the round-faced boy from the train who had lost his toad.</p><p>The unified front of the Slytherins didn't go unnoticed, and Harry was sure that it was for the benefit of Ron. He'd stood slightly in his seat when Harry had arrived, but as soon as he noticed Harry's royally annoying guard, Ron’s eager smile faded.</p><p>Harry was steered to an empty bench, sandwiched between Blaise Zabini and Daphne Greengrass, apparently unphased at the amused looks the Gryffindors were sending them. One of them, an Indian girl, turned to her friend and whispered something to her. They both glanced over their shoulder at Harry and giggled loudly.</p><p>Heat crept up his neck; he hated all of this strange attention, and the Slytherins acting even stranger wasn’t helping his frayed nerves. Although he suspected that they weren’t giggling at his bodyguards, when the two girls openly pointed at his forehead, before breaking out into more giggles. Harry flattened his fringe. For the past ten years, he been totally ignored, and suddenly having people know his name at a glance made him immensely uncomfortable. He used to love his scar, but it was becoming a nuisance when everyone stared at it all the damn time.</p><p>Behind the two girls, Ron was still half-off his seat, eyes darting back and forth across the room, before he promptly stood, and determinedly made his way over towards Harry. Immediately, both Greengrass and Zabini tensed and shifted closer.</p><p>In a strange way, Harry felt touched by their protectiveness, which was annoying when he was trying to be irritated that they were interfering. The gesture seemed to throw Ron, who faltered slightly before he stopped in front of their desk.</p><p>"Er, hullo Harry" he stammered, glancing nervously at Crabbe and Goyle, who were both watching the redhead intently with matching frowns.</p><p>This was it: the moment of truth. Was Harry going to be nice to Ron, someone whom he liked immensely but apparently could never be friends with now that they were in opposing houses without being totally ostracised by all of Slytherin? Or would he do the stupid cowardly thing and buckle under peer pressure for people who only really liked him for his fame?</p><p>"Weasley," he greeted neutrally, even as the words felt leaden on his tongue.</p><p>As Ron's face fell, Harry felt a painful shard lodge itself in his chest over losing the first friend he'd ever had.</p><p>Ron stood there looking torn, his mouth slightly open as though he wished to something more, but Zabini butted in. "Is there something you wanted, <em>Weasley</em>?" he asked coldly, disdain dripping from every syllable.</p><p>Ron jerked back in surprise at the tone, before glaring at Zabini. "Nothing from <em>you,</em>" he snapped fiercely, but Greengrass took the opportunity to join in.</p><p>"Well if all you wanted to do was get close to some <em>real</em> wizards, congratulations, you've succeeded," she purred, her voice like ice. "So off you run back with the rest of those mutts like a good dog and stop sniffing around your betters. Go on, shoo, you little mongrel."</p><p>Ron looked flabbergasted at their rudeness, his face turning a blotchy purple, and for a moment he looked like he was seriously contemplating hitting her, when Professor Snape strode in.</p><p>"Sit," Professor Snape snapped at Ron, who flinched and hurried back to his seat, while the Slytherins laughed, barking like dogs at him as he went.</p><p>Harry forced himself to look only to the front of the class as the lesson began, eyes glued to Professor Snape, aware of the pale, pointed face grinning smugly at him from the corner of his vision. He blinked at the slight prickle in his eyes.</p><p>‘You see,’ Harry told himself firmly, 'That's how it is now.’</p>
