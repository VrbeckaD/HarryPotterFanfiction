    <p>
  <span>She could hear her friends yelling and spells flying around, but there were thick walls between them and she didn’t have any idea how many. It was easy to say that she was lost. Not that she knew much about Department of Mysteries anyway, but it was dark and she simply kept running, trying to get away from the man who had been after her from the minute she step inside Ministry.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But every door seemed to be locked and she kept going in circles. He was just few meters behind her now. There wasn’t really anywhere to hide. She was starting to desperate and her breathing came out shallow and faster.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She was supposed to be the smart one, the brightest witch of her age. She should had tried harder to get Harry see sense and not just charge straight into arms of Death Eaters who didn’t care if they were pretty much children. In their eyes they were enemy as much as Order members. She wasn’t about to just give in and let the scruffy Russian kill her but right now all she could do was to try and blend in with the wall and hold her wand tightly in her hand, repeating every offensive spell in her head that she could think of. She knew that defense wasn’t going to be enough.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Come out, devchurka, come out.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione shivered when hearing his voice. It was so low and his accent was thick even though she was sure that he had lived in Britain for three or so decades. But as far as she knew he haven’t gone to Hogwarts. When Daily Prophet announced the news about Death Eaters breaking out of Azkaban, Hermione’s first instinct had been to study them. It was just who she was, she needed to know everything she could. Her friends didn’t really understand it but it had saved them more than once, not that they ever thanked her for it.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> “It’s just us now, devchurka, there’s nowhere to run. If you come out now, I go easy on you.” He laughed but it didn’t sound like he was having fun, more like he was being bored. It seemed like typical Russian trait to her for men at least. She had been to Moscow and Saint Petersburg more than once with her parents. They had been obsessed to make Hermione a ballerina before she had gotten her Hogwarts letter and it was well known that the best dancers came from Russian so they wanted to go see them regularly. Because of that she could speak some Russian also, but was quite rusty since it had been over two years since her last trip.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>Yebat' tebya!” Hermione screamed at the man, knowing it was extremely stupid and she most likely just gave away her hiding spot.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But the man didn’t jump at her and no curse came flying at her, only laugher that sounded much more authentic this time.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That is not something a lady should say.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>He was calling her a lady now?</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span> </span>
  </em>
  <span>“I wasn’t aware that a mudblood could be a lady.” Hermione spat at him, trying to sound more angry than scared.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I don’t like that word.” Dolohov grunted. Hermione could hear him moving closer now but there really was nowhere she could hide so she stayed as still as possible. “It’s disgusting. Blood can’t have mud in it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That made Hermione froze. The man was a Death Eater, saying something like that didn’t really make any sense. Even her school mates weren’t above calling her mudblood. Why would Death Eater think it was disgusting thing to say?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Then why are you a Death Eater?” Hermione asked quietly. She just had to. She needed to know what other reasons were there since Order and everyone really kept firmly saying that the Death Eaters were about hating muggles and muggleborns.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> “I didn’t say I like muggleborns. I just don’t like that name.” Dolohov grunted. It was sort of relief for Hermione. It wasn’t about her liking the idea of people hating her for the fact that she was a muggleborn but it was better than people hating her for no reason at all or for a reason that she just didn’t know. Everything was just so much more easier when you were aware of things, when you were prepared. But in the same time Dolohov didn’t really answer her question.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione didn’t repeat her question no matter how interested she was to know. The saying history is written by victors was very accurate. She really didn’t know anything about the dark side than their hatred to muggles and muggleborns, she didn’t know why they felt that way and she didn’t really know anything about Voldemort either and neither did Harry even thought he acted like he knew everything about his enemy. But no one never told them anything and no one never really seemed to even care. It was all about being right and being the good guy. But for Hermione that wasn’t enough. It wasn’t like she was going to jump to the other side but she needed to know what and why she was fighting.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not going to curse again? That’s more like it. Pretty girls shouldn’t curse.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Being called pretty made Hermione’s skin turn to goosebumps. No one ever called her pretty so it was unreal and having a Death Eater calling you pretty was just creepy. And she never really though her looks as pretty, beautiful or as anything positive really. She was short with no curves and a long curly hair that had a life of its own that she often kept in messy bun to keep it out of the way. She knew that some girls in her dorm were slightly jealous of how skinny she was, but that was because of the dancing. Even thought she couldn’t really dance much anymore she made sure that she stayed in shape. Her legs and arms had proper muscle strength and very little fat, but like many other dancer she was really tiny. Having muscle strength and good aerobic endurance did help in situations like this were you needed to run and hide but for some reason keeping your body in good physical shape wasn’t something witches and wizards really did unless they were quidditch players. To her it seemed ridiculous.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was moving closer again. Hermione could hear his steps and feel the air thicken around her as she became more and more trapped. She really had chosen a really shitty place to hide. No escape routes, nothing. She was stuck, waiting on what the man might or might not do. She really had no idea what he was going to anymore since all she had expected was to be cursed straight away, what obviously hadn’t happened.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I can almost see you now.” Hermione wasn’t sure if he was talking to her or himself. But she could almost see him also. Well a dark shape of him in a dark room. Wasn’t much, but she could see where he was and he was close. Close enough that she could smell him. He smelled like whiskey, coffee and tobacco. Basic. That’s what Hermione thought. Her father smelled like whiskey, coffee and tobacco half of the time also. She wondered if he could smell her and what would she smell to him. She never really gotten a hang of using perfumes except for a special events like going to restaurant or ballet with her parents. That was also the only time when she really dressed up or used any makeup, she just didn’t see a point to do that while in school. Most likely everyone would have just laughed at her, told her she tried too hard. Last years Yule Ball was exception but then she had been in arms of someone who didn’t deserve a sloppy looking little girl.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was right in front of her face now. Hermione could stare straight into his dark green almost black eyes that had a hungry gleam in them. It scared her but also intrigued her the way it shouldn’t have. He was handsome in a scruffy way. Shoulder length hair in ponytail, unkept beard and more tiny scars that she could count. She was also pretty sure that there was a tattoo on his neck, peeking under his heavy robes. She was glad that he wasn’t wearing the Death Eater mask anymore, they weren’t exactly the most appealing looking. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You smell like coffee and lavenders.” He answered her unasked question. She wasn’t sure if she liked that because only she couldn’t figure out why he had suddenly said that unless he had read her mind which was unsettling thought. She felt violated even by the idea of someone poking around her head. Hermione was very private person in that matter. It wasn’t easy, thought, when your life or what other people liked to believe to be her life had been all over trashy newspapers. She hardly ever even shared anything with Harry and Ron who were after all her best friends. They didn’t really know anything about her expect for how she was at school and with them. And for some reason she wouldn’t admit to herself she had no intention to ever change that.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“You are even more beautiful when looking this close, Ptichka”, she could feel his hot breath by her ear and it made her whole body shake. She wasn’t sure if it was necessarily a bad thing and that scared her even more. “Why so quiet?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She looked at him or tried but her eyes didn’t quite make it to his eyes, instead they locked into his tattoo, trying to make sense what it was. When his hand went to touch her cheek and forced her head up she didn’t have a choice but the stare at his eyes. He looked so hungry and she felt really small and fragile then.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Pretty little thing.” He spoke again and she kept her silence, waiting for him to do something, curse her more likely.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Why did he have to be so close, she thought as his hands went to her hair and face leaned to her neck. She felt herself grow more and more anxious. Slowly his lips were there, on her skin gently first. It was just wrong, but when he got more forceful and nipped at her, a small moan escaped from her lips before she could stop it. Hermione froze. She was scared out of her mind and mostly because she didn’t push the Russian Death Eater away, because she didn’t want to push him away. Get to know your enemy just got a very different meaning. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He smirked against her skin, knowing her inner struggle and brought his another hand to hold her hips against the wall that she was already pressed against. How convenient. It was also convenient that the second he had stepped into that room hunting her, the door had closed behind him and sealed the room from any intruders. Now what did the Unspeakables use the room for to need such a thing was something he didn’t really want or needed to know.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You like this don’t you?” He whispered into girls ear. Knowing how much his every move affected her. She was just too much to simply kill or even torture.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione tried to keep quiet but when his hands somehow ended inside her shirt and now traveled towards her chest she couldn’t help but to nod her head. She really, really shouldn’t but there just was something about the man that stopped her from stopping him. She couldn’t find words for it or speak for that matter. Maybe he had cursed her after all, being quiet wasn’t really her, she was always ready to argue and have decent conversation, not that she had many of those since her friends didn’t really talk much about anything but quidditch, what was one of the few subject that she had no interest or proper knowledge of.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Did you curse me?” After few minutes she finally found her voice, but Dolohovs hand had also reached to her bra and the another one was holding her hair tightly as he make sure that her neck would be covered in bruises when she got out of there, if she got out of there that was.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> He laughed and bit harder down her neck, making her moan even louder. Who knew that she liked to be bitten. Before this she only had few sweet kisses from Victor Krum who was too much of a gentleman to even properly kiss her.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> “No, Ptichka, I didn’t curse you.” He whispered and liked his way to her earlobe before taking a bite out of it too. “This is all you. I should kill you, Ptichka, but I can’t.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> She was afraid to ask but she had to. “Why can’t you kill me?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> He grunted and pressed his lower half to her pelvis, showing her how much effect she had on him. “Because I want more.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> She didn’t allow herself to ask what did that mean, she could guess but how much more did he want? Again she moaned as he pressed his hard on to her but this time she didn’t just stand still, she quickly placed her hands on his hips like they had always been there and pulled him more closer to create friction. It was his turn to moan as well as smirk. He forced her head to turn towards her and brutally smashed his lips against hers, biting them and making them open up for him. He didn’t ask for permission but in the end he wasn’t going to take anymore than what the witch willingly, even thought maybe persuaded, gave him. Unlike his fellows he wasn’t a rapist, he didn’t enjoy making someone scream from fear and fighting him, he wanted response and screams of pleasure.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He surprised her by slipping his hand out of her shirt and just ripping it open quickly before pulling her legs around his waist so he could get even closer. He kept pulling her hair to give him better access to her mouth. He didn’t hold anything back and he had no desire to let go. His grip was bruising and for some reason that made Hermione moan even more. She was terrified of how she was feeling but didn’t want it to stop. She wanted more.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> It was all so new to her. She never really even touched herself before, she never had that need that her roommates had talked about. When they had whispered about hot kisses and blowjobs in broom closets, Hermione had shut her ears and went back to her books. It didn’t mean that she didn’t know anything about sex, she was too smart for that. Her mother had given her the talk when she was fairly young and after that she had educated herself via several different types of books. The naughty ones her mother hid behind her closet and the ones you could borrow from the library. But knowing something and experiencing something were so different. And no matter how much she loved books, experiencing was starting to be much better.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Tell me what you want?”</span>
</p>
<p align="center">
  <span>*</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When Hermione woke up she knew exactly where she was, the hospital wing of Hogwarts, but how she had gotten there was another thing completely. The last thing she remembered was the Dolohov’s husky voice asking what she wanted. Her face got red from just thinking the man. What happened? Had she gone further with him or did he do something to her so she wouldn’t remember? Did someone find them?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>How in the world had she gotten into that situation in the first place? Snogging a Death Eater hadn’t exactly been the plan when she followed Harry to the Ministry. She was quite sure that he hadn’t cursed her to do anything but she had still felt compelled, like someone had taken over her body and guided her to him before drugging her till she was addicted.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>If anyone found out she would be send to Janus Thickey ward if not to Azkaban for fraternizing with a fugitive, and no one would ever trust her again. She would be a traitor and a pariah.  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Miss Granger, I see you are awake.” Madam Pomfrey stalked towards her and Hermione felt anxious. Would the other witch know how she had gotten out of the Ministry? “How are you feeling?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It took Hermione some time to answer since she really wasn’t sure how. Nothing was hurting, mostly she was just confused and tired. But she guessed that there was a reason why she was in the hospital wing and not in her dorm. “I feel fine.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Madam Pomfrey gave her a stern look before smiling. “That’s good. Technically there’s nothing wrong with you, but.” She took a deep breath before continuing. “There is a large purple scar that starts from your collarbone and goes all the way to your hip. We have no idea what had caused it since the spell used is very much unknown to even Professor Snape. He did confirm my suspicion of it being done with dark magic but what is odd is that no matter how large the scar is there is no actual damage done to you. All your organs are in good shape as well as your magical core. You are in perfectly good health. I know that to young girl like yourself, a scar like that can be upsetting but you will just have to get used to it, since we don’t know what caused it, we won’t know if it will go away.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Hermione stared at Madam Pomfrey without showing any emotions. She wasn’t exactly worried about what the scar would look like on her like Madam Pomfrey had suggested, she was more unsettled about the fact that it seemed to be harmless? What exactly had Dolohov done to her? It had to be him but why curse her if not to harm her? Or maybe it worked slow and would kill her in next week or maybe month if not even year. She wouldn’t put it past him. Hermione realized that Madam Pomfrey was waiting for her to response.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Um. Could I maybe see it?” That was a normal teenage girl reaction, right?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“There is a mirror in the bathroom. But be quick and then back to bed. I would like you to stay here for another night and see if anything changes now that you are awake.” Madam Pomfrey rushed toward the bathroom, hoping it would make her come out faster also.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She carefully removed her hospital gown and only then realizing that she was actually naked beneath it. And didn’t Madam Pomfrey mention something about Professor Snape? Burying the thought of her professor seeing her naked into the furthest corner of her mind she looked at herself in the mirror. Just like Madam Pomfrey had said; the scar started from her collarbone and went vertically down between her breast before ending to her hip bone. It was dark purple and now that she looked at it, she could feel the dark magic that pulsed from it. She let her hand trace it and felt like tiny electrical shocks burst against her fingers. It didn’t hurt. In some twisted way it felt good if anything. Her breathing got shallow as she tried to figure out what was its purpose. And as she thought of the encounter with the man, the part she could remember. The part where his husky voice whispered naughty things to her ear and his large, strong hands gripped her hips and his mouth devoured hers. Not thinking about it was becoming very difficult.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> “Miss Granger! I want you back in that bed within two minutes.” Madam Pomfrey’s familiarly stern voice commanded behind the closed door.</span>
</p>
