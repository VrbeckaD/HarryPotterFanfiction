    <p>Chapter One- Willow Potter</p><p>Three-year-old Willow stared at the bad man over her grandmother's still body she said ''Grandma''</p><p>Voldemort looked at her and said ''Willow Potter I will get to you once I finish off your big brother.''</p><p>Willow watched as the bad man pointed his wand at her big brother she screamed ''No!'' and pure white energy covered her brother it looked like smoke covering her brother.</p><p>The spell was sent back at the bad man and hit him in the chest. The man looked at her in shock as he turned to ash he said ''Willow Potter.'' Willow passed out the smoke disappearing as she did. Harry looked at his sister as the roof caved in. He said ''Willa'' a stray beam hit him in the head making a scar on his forehead in the shape of a lightning bolt.</p><p>American Hunter Kayla Evan's looked at her daughter with a small smile the brown skinned child was sleeping against her chest she kissed her forehead and hummed softly. She was walking around trying to find her way back to London she looked at the street she was on and looked and saw Privet Drive she frowned she said ''How can someone live on this street it's just dreadful.'' The light brown skinned woman sighed and pulled out her cellphone and frowned softly she was three miles from London how did she even get there in the first place.</p><p>She passed by Number 4 and looked and saw a woman and a man who were a bit younger than her place a baby on the ground outside the front door of number 4. She frowned and watched as they left the toddler and disappeared with a pop. She walked over and looked at the red-haired little baby girl she looked two years older than her little Naomi. The baby girl opened her green eyes and Kayla sighed softly and said ''You just had to open those eyes and look right at me huh.'' The little girl giggled and ''Hi'' Kayla picked her up and said ''Hello little red would you like to come home with me'' she grinned and hummed and Kayla said ''What's one more daughter.''</p><p>Two years later</p><p>Willow's eye twitched when she heard her little sister following behind her she spun around and frowned at Naomi and said ''Go home! Naomi now momma will scold you again.''</p><p>Naomi shook her head and said ''No thank you.''</p><p>Willow groaned and said ''Come on then'' and kept walking and Naomi grinned and followed after her. Willow sighed and said ''Be quiet'' the five-year-old looked back and saw her three-year-old sister concentrating on staying quiet. Willow said ''We are going to the top of the cliff to mediate momma wants me to work on my Aura.'' They reached the cliff thirty minutes later Willow sat down and Naomi followed her by sitting down also. Willow looked at her adopted sister and she had her eyes closed and Willow's eyes widened when she could see her sister's Aura Willow smiled and closed her eyes also. Behind them Kayla watched as her daughter's meditated, she could feel their Aura's from where she stood and she was so proud.</p><p>6 years later</p><p>11-year-old Willow frowned with her arms crossed aboard the ship going to where the Hunter's Exam was being held. She watched from the sidelines she was the only girl here and she had to keep an eye on her sister who was going to be taking the exam also and make sure she didn't die. 9-year-old Naomi stood beside her with her pet leopard who was sleeping in front of her. The brown skinned child had long waist length thick black curly hair and looked like a china doll. Willow had back length curly red hair and tan skin from being outdoors all the time she sneered at the muscle head's staring at her and her sister. She said ''Come on Naomi'' and walked to their cabin since they were girl's they had there own so they wouldn't have to share with the men.</p><p>Naomi looked at her sister and nodded and said ''Come on Rain'' the leopard opened an eye he grunted and followed his mistress. Naomi skipped after her sister and Willow closed the door with extra force than needed after Rain had made it inside.</p><p>Two hours later</p><p>Willow gasped away and saw Naomi sleeping on Rain's fur coat Rain looked at her and Willow whispered ''I'm fine.''</p><p>Willow's dream</p><p>Willow watched as her mother left for a mission Kayla looked at her and kissed her forehead seven-year-old Willow asked ''Momma where are you going?''</p><p>Kayla hummed ''I'm going on a Treasure hunt the jewel is called the blue Ruby it was last seen on a remote island that was in 1880.'' Willow giggled when she saw her mother's eyes light up as she spoke. She placed her hands on her cheeks and walked over and said ''I love you I'll bring something home for you I promise take care of your little sister you have enough treasure to sell in the mean time I'll be back love.'' She looked at Naomi and kissed her cheek and Rain looked at Kayla and Kayla poked the cub on its nose and said ''Be a good boy Rain'' Rain licked her nose and then went back to sleep. Kayla whispered ''I love you Mi'' and looked at her one last time and then rubbed Willow's head and said ''I love you very much Willa.''</p><p>Willow grinned and watched her leave and she ran outside and said ''Come back Mom I love you too!'' waving as the woman walked down the road. Kayla waved and blew a kiss to her oldest daughter and she was gone after that she hadn't come back.</p><p>Present</p><p>Willow ran her fingers threw her hair and whispered ''Momma, where are you?'' Rain jumped down and licked her cheek and Willow smiled stiffly and rubbed his head and hummed softly.</p><p>Whale Island two days ago</p><p>A reddish orange haired woman was working hard going through the fish in front of her trying to forget about the deal she had made with her baby/nephew. She shook in fear hoping that he didn't bring back the huge fish hoping he couldn't do it but she knew in the back of her mind he would catch that fish he was too much like his father. She shook her head and went back to work listening to the conversation behind her about Gon trying to ignore the pit in her stomach. A man behind her said ''Is Gon still angling for the master of the swamp?''</p><p>Mito turned and smiled stiffly ''Yes he's been at it for almost a week'' she blocked out whatever his answer was. She went back to work and sighed softly still thinking about Gon.</p><p>In the swamp</p><p>A black haired boy with green tips with amber colored eyes sat with leaf hat on and a fishing pole not paying attention to the butterflies fluttering around him staying still and calm and focused he was going to get this fish if he's patient it will come and then he can go and take the Hunter's exam. He looked when the bob moved and he said ''Oh'' silently and the bob kept moving and then it went underwater and Gon screamed ''Yeah!'' and a bird flew away it must have been near him. He pulled on the line harder and harder he cried ''Here it comes!'' Pulling on the line harder and faster and pulled the line using the tree as leverage. He wrapped the line again around the tree one more time and tugged again he could see the line cutting into the tree but that didn't stop him he kept pulling on the fish and he screamed with joy when the fish came from the water.</p><p>He brought the fish back and the people in the town gathered around to look at the fish in awe he ran over to his aunt and said ''I did it I caught it that means I can take the Hunter's exam right!'' Mito stared at him with her hands interlocked in front of her she just stared in his eyes they shined so brightly just like his father's. She put her head down and he ran by her and said ''I'm going to be a Hunter just wait and see'' running to the house.</p><p>Mito looked at the picture of Gon's father her grandmother said ''It must be in his blood his father at 12 years old now him'' Mito just stared at the photo her grandmother continued ''I don't have to tell you that his eyes sparkle just like his father's we will soon have to let him go'' Mito just stayed silent she walked to Gon's room and he was packing.</p><p>Mito asked ''Are you sure about this Gon?''</p><p>Gon nodded and said ''I have to dad is a hunter''</p><p>Mito cried ''And he abandoned you he left you when you were just a baby.''</p><p>Gon cried ''I have to know why I have to know why being a hunter was more important than his son I have to know!'' He looked at her with his determined eyes and said ''I have to know why he left what was the reason for him to leave his son.''</p><p>Mito sighed and whispered ''Okay.'' She left the room and Gon went back to packing and then went to bed he had a ship to get on in the morning he hopped his aunt would be okay by then. This was something he had to do.</p><p>Hogwarts</p><p>Lily and James Potter looked at their son Harry James Potter as he walked to the Gryffindor table with a grin on their faces.</p><p>Professor McGonagall cleared her throat and said ''Willow Potter''</p><p>Lily's eyes swept the room for red curly hair and when she didn't see it, she gasped softly and looked at James. James looked at Dumbledore and Dumbledore said ''Willow Potter!'' No one came to the stool he looked at McGonagall and motioned her to continue.</p>
