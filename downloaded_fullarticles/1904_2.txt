    <p> </p>
<p>The first time he had pulled out his wand, quickly and without thinking. The other boy had stared at him, not surprised and not even alarmed and had done nothing to stop him. It was definitely weird, Harry had thought, how Malfoy wasn't even blinking at being pointed with a wand.<br/>
He regretted reacting that way almost immediately, but he couldn't change it, nor could he change their past.</p>
<p><br/>
He had gone up there to face his own demons, he had gone up there because his own bedroom felt small and crowded and even though he had never minded small and crowded places, right now he needed to be alone. Maybe the war had changed him beyond repair.<br/>
</p>
<p>At first, he hadn't even noticed Malfoy. He had only noticed a shape hidden in the shadows of the Tower, staring up into the night sky. But he only took out his wand when he realized who it was. Maybe that hadn't been his most glorious moment. And it's not like Harry was scared of him or anything, but the memories were still too fresh on his mind.<br/>
</p>
<p>That first night he had ran away from that place, from him and from the night sky only to return after a couple days. And Malfoy was there.<br/>
Harry had decided that he was free to do as he pleased, and he was no one to ask him to leave, but he didn't really like having him in a place that meant so much to everyone <em>but </em>him and his Death Eater family.<br/>
But going back meant being in his room and falling quickly into his nightmares, so he had stayed.<br/>
</p>
<p>Harry decided to sit far, far away from Malfoy, almost six meters away. He heard a snort from the shadows but decided not to give in and he said nothing.<br/>
</p>
<p>They remained in that weird silent company for several nights, their only exchange had happened when Harry couldn't still his tongue anymore, and asked:<br/>
</p>
<p>"Why here?"<br/>
</p>
<p>"You know why"<br/>
</p>
<p>And that had been it. For almost a month, they both sat in the same place at night, staring at the same stars, as physically away as they could be.<br/>
</p>
<p>Harry knew it was dumb. They saw each other during class every day, they had bumped into each other on the hallways, barely nodding in acknowledgment and everything was civil. <em>Civil. </em><br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>The correct situation was, maybe, that Malfoy was so subdued he wasn't actively pursuing him or bothering him. And <em>maybe </em>that was bothering him as much as everything else.<br/>
</p>
<p>Neither of them had a real choice of coming back or not. Malfoy's trial had decided he had to finish his school before paying for his crimes during the war and some charity work he really couldn't remember or care.<br/>
</p>
<p>And him... well, let's just say that the first time he went in public and had a panic attack it ended up on every single newspaper. At least back here, even if he didn't feel protected and had nightmares every night, people would leave him be. And he had his friends. He wouldn't be alone.<br/>
</p>
<p>Then why did he feel so alone?<br/>
</p>
<p>He looked over to where Malfoy was sitting, knees to his chest, arms hugging his legs. Harry reminded himself that they hated each other and he should be incredibly offended that Malfoy had the audacity to show his face around there. But, again, he really didn't have a choice.<br/>
</p>
<p>"Two truths and a lie"<br/>
</p>
<p>"What?" Harry had been so self absorbed that he blinked twice trying to figure out if Malfoy had truly spoken or if his mind was messing with him.<br/>
</p>
<p>"It's a game, Potter, surely you are familiar with it? I think your dear muggles invented it"<br/>
</p>
<p>Harry tightened his jaw, because his <em>tone </em>said enough about what he clearly thought of muggles; and Harry didn't know that game because he had never had a normal fucking life. He copied Malfoy, pulling his own knees to his chest and hugging them slightly.<br/>
</p>
<p>He could <em>hear </em>Draco rolling his eyes.<br/>
</p>
<p>"Each turn we say two truths about ourselves and one lie, the other one has to guess which one is the lie"<br/>
</p>
<p>"And if we are wrong?"<br/>
</p>
<p>"Don't know, wish to take off a piece of clothing?"<br/>
</p>
<p>"You are<em> sick" </em>Harry snapped quickly, hugging his knees tighter and a deep silence fell between them. He hadn't meant to be that harsh, but he wasn't suddenly going to be... all nice and friendly and he wasn't about to get humiliated by him.<br/>
</p>
<p>"If you get it wrong, then you won't know which one is a lie. I would drink if you had anything on you but I assume you don't have any alcohol?" Silence "Of course not, why would you?"<br/>
</p>
<p>Harry pursed his lips, feeling like that was meant as an insult but he couldn't quite put his finger on why.<br/>
</p>
<p>"Fine" Harry finally said, because his curiosity was screaming inside his head and he couldn't handle it when it was about Draco.<br/>
</p>
<p>There was another silence, -because everything between them seemed to happen in between silences- until a low familiar voice spoke.<br/>
</p>
<p>"I am terribly afraid of the dark" Malfoy shifted a bit, his eyes on the night sky above them. "I am Marked. I actually like cats"<br/>
</p>
<p>And then he stared at him, as if he had only said he liked cats and ice cream and bunnies. He had just... Harry tried to remember what he knew about him or... what he didn't. Lucius Malfoy was a death eater so it would only be reasonable to assume his son had followed in his steps.<br/>
</p>
<p>"The lie is..." Harry looked away from him, wishing reality were different than it was "you are not afraid of the dark, otherwise you wouldn't be sitting over there"<br/>
</p>
<p>"Bravo, Potter"<br/>
</p>
<p>He groaned, clutching at his legs a little bit more and realized it was his turn to reveal something of himself. Great. A couple of years back he would have been appalled at the idea, but right now? What did he have to lose? A little voice in his head warned him that this was Malfoy, a Slytherin so cunning he would probably use every single piece of information from him or from any of his enemies to gain advantage in life.<br/>
</p>
<p>"I wanted to come back" He shifted uncomfortably because everything that came to mind was sad or terrible "I love Quidditch and wish I could play this year. I actually think you are a good enough seeker" There was a snort</p>
<p>"<em>Thanks, </em>I guess. And that's way too easy, Potter."<br/>
<br/>
"It... is?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. You actually think I'm a <em>great </em>seeker"<br/>
</p>
<p>Harry chuckled and shook his head, trying not to look as amused as he was.<br/>
</p>
<p>"You didn't want to come back" Malfoy said, this time more serious "That's obvious" Potter sighed, what was the point of this, again?</p>
<p><br/>
"Your turn"<br/>
</p>
<p>Draco let go of his legs, stretching them while his hands held his torso in an upright position.<br/>
</p>
<p>"I never killed anyone." He said and cleared his throat. "I can say you-know-who's name. I love my Father"<br/>
</p>
<p>Harry frowned.<br/>
</p>
<p>"You are cheating"<br/>
</p>
<p>"What?" Malfoy stared back, still from a distance because they hadn't moved any closer in all those nights.<br/>
</p>
<p>"Those are all true"<br/>
</p>
<p>Malfoy stared a bit surprised and then chuckled "Oh, are they?"<br/>
</p>
<p>That <em>fucking</em> asshole.  <br/>
</p>
<p>Alright, alright. There was a lie in all of that... He was sure Malfoy hadn't killed anyone: he wasn't cruel enough to do something like that. He was sure Malfoy loved his father, and <em>admired </em>him. It was so disgusting. But what could he know? He never had one.<br/>
Maybe having a father even as bad as Malfoy's would have been good.<br/>
</p>
<p>"You can't say Voldemort"<br/>
</p>
<p>"You are surprising me"<br/>
</p>
<p>"Why can't you? He lived in your house, probably dined in your table, and you can't say his name? He's dead you know, you won't have to worry about him anymore"<br/>
</p>
<p>Draco didn't respond, and okay, explaining their facts wasn't part of the game so he had to swallow whatever the other boy threw at him.<br/>
</p>
<p>"I enjoy chocolate ice cream, I fancy Cho" Harry frowned trying to think of another truth that wasn't too revealing but... maybe this was something he needed and his mouth spoke before his brain could stop him "I have nightmares almost every night"<br/>
</p>
<p>"You don't fancy Cho anymore" Draco chuckled "You are not making this hard"<br/>
</p>
<p>"Oh but you are?"<br/>
</p>
<p>"I believe you had to think hard on my last one"<br/>
</p>
<p>The blonde boy moved for a moment and it almost seemed as if he wanted to get up and go sit next to him. He stopped, though.<br/>
He sighed and looked at one of his hands. Did he also run out of good things to say? Nah, he could probably talk about all his money and friends and family and his hate for muggle borns.<br/>
</p>
<p>"I think every single move I make ahead of time" Malfoy crossed his legs under his body "I fancy Pansy" He smirked at his own rhyme "Being here is not so bad"<br/>
</p>
<p>"Did you just copy my lie?"<br/>
</p>
<p>"You said Cho, I said Pansy. Two different girls, surely you have noticed?"<br/>
</p>
<p>Harry wanted to choke him to death -kind of.<br/>
</p>
<p>"Ha, ha, very funny. So who do you like?"<br/>
</p>
<p>"Who do <em>you </em>like?"<br/>
</p>
<p>Silence. His mind told him <em>Ginny, of course, </em>right?<br/>
</p>
<p>"I need to be going" Harry rose from his place, taking a long look at Draco and deciding it was best not to... come back the next night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He came back.</p>
