    <p>December 20th 2001</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Bloody hell Granger, you trying to give a man a heart attack?” Hermione turned to see Theodore Nott, dressed in his finest dress robes, strolling down the hallway she had just entered. Hermione looked down at her own attire anxiously. It was the Ministry’s christmas ball and she rarely allowed herself to wear extravagant clothes, but as soon as she had mentioned needing a dress to Ginny, she was being dragged through all the shops that wizarding London had to offer, much to Hermione’s chagrin. She’d chosen a shimmery silver floor length gown with thin straps, and a low cut but not too revealing front. The back of the dress dipped down to her lower back, paired with the slit that travelled up to her left thigh, there really was more skin on show than she had ever displayed before. She had managed to tame her hair into silky curls which she swept up from her face and into a delicate bun, decorated with a diamond clip and matching jewellery. She was a lot more confident when she had been in the shop with Ginny telling her how amazing she looked. But arriving here on her own, she was starting to panic.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“You think it’s too much?” The question came out as more of a statement, and she couldn’t help feeling stupid. His lips twisted into a grin as he leant against the wall next to her, admiring the view. “Oh gods it is, i’m going to murder Ginny” She couldn’t help but notice the looks of people that passed them by. “People are <em> staring </em> Theo” she hissed.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Theo snorted and Hermione’s eyes snapped up to his. “You know, most witches would kill for the attention you’re getting.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Well I don’t want everyone's eyes on me.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Just Malfoy’s right?” Hermione narrowed her eyes at him. Sure, she noticed Malfoy, but who hadn’t? She, along with many other women at work, appreciated his fine form and stupid good looks, but that didn’t mean she wanted him.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Please” she scoffed.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“You haven’t been as subtle as you think princess.” His lips curved upwards as he stepped towards her. “But don’t worry, one look at you and he will lose his shit. Shall we?” Hermione didn’t have time to respond before he was linking arms and walking her through the venue doors and into the ballroom. The crowded room was bedecked with cream and gold furnishings, streams of warm golden orbs were suspended from the ceiling providing the majority of the lighting. A few other women were dressed in similarly revealing gowns to hers and she could feel some of her anxiety slip away. Well, until she noticed that Theo was leading her straight to Blaise Zabini, who looked up at the pair and nudged his blonde companion, nodding in their direction. A knowing smile tugging at his lips.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>
  <em> Crap. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Hermione wanted more than anything to turn on the spot and search for her friends, ones that weren’t hell-bent on embarrassing her, but Theo kept a firm grip on her arm. Malfoy turned to follow Blaise’s line of sight and stilled when silver-flecked eyes met hers, before travelling the length of her body. Her breath caught as she did the same to him, his black and white dress robes perfectly tailored. Damn it, he looked stunning. Her mouth suddenly became dry as Malfoy downed the rest of his whiskey and gave her a mischievous smile.</p><p>“Granger”</p><p>“Malfoy”</p><p>“Hermione”</p><p>“Blaise”</p><p>“Fashionably late as always, Nott” Blaise chuckled.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Well someone had to wait for Hermione, the poor girl was standing in the hall too frightened to come in” Theo gave her side a nudge. He was really going to pay for this.  </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Need i remind you that I was already heading in when <em> you </em> stopped <em> me </em>?” She retorted, pinching his arm that still gripped her. “If anything Theo, you were the one who was too afraid to come in by yourself.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Before the smirking prick could begin to reply, a piercing shriek sounded from behind the group, joined by collective groans from Malfoy and Zabini who had a good view of the crowd behind them. “Theo!” He tensed beside Hermione, drawing her closer to his side just as his other arm was now being manhandled by a witch in a floor-length purple gown. Hermione tried to suppress a grin at the witch his friends referred to as his office stalker. She had to admit Meredith was rather attractive, her blond hair draped over her shoulders in silky waves, and a slim figure with curves in all the right places. However, her whiny, petty attitude certainly didn’t entertain Theo enough to give in to her eager advances.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“There you are! You said you’d be here an hour ago Mister- Oh.” Her eyes started to bulge slightly as she noticed Theo’s other arm that had now wrapped around Hermione’s waist. “I didn’t realise you had a <em> date </em> . <em> ” </em>Her voice held a slightly accusing tone. Hermione noticed the smiles from the other Slytherins and tried to keep herself from laughing.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“I.. um.. yes I do-”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“No, he doesn’t” Hermione cut in, avoiding the incredulous look that Theo shot at her. “He was trying to get me to dance actually but..” Hermione gestured to her shoes with a laugh, twisting Theo’s fingers tightly until he was forced to let go. “In these heels, I'm afraid it’s not possible without a few drinks in me first! Perhaps you’d like to join him instead?”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Meredith's eyes lit up and the witch practically clawed at his arm to drag him away.</p><p>“I won’t forget this Granger” He muttered under his breath, dragging his feet like some petulant child as the two remaining men chuckled on their friend's behalf.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>She hummed sweetly. “Neither will I!” Hermione waved them off, unable to contain her laugh any longer. She sighed contentedly, two can play that game, Mr Nott. It wasn’t long before they were joined by two more girls eager for the men’s attentions. When it became clear that Malfoy wasn’t interested, they both latched onto Blaise who looped his arm around one and planted featherlight kisses on the other’s neck. With a wink at Hermione, he bid them farewell and lead them off to Merlin knows where.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Well he certainly doesn’t waste any time, does he?” She asked in disbelief.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Draco snorted, “No, he’s never been one for subtlety.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“And what about you Malfoy? Are you the type to drop hints and wait for the girl to make her move, or are you not afraid to go for what you want?” His brows rose as the corner of his mouth tugged upwards. Hermione tried not to look too mortified at her sudden curiosity. Did she seriously just ask him that?</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Trust me, if I find myself a girl worth pursuing, she’ll know about it.” He studied her face for a minute before his grin returned. “Honestly Granger, if you wanted a date all you had to do was ask.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Now it was her time to snort. “That’s awfully presumptuous of you.”  </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“I don’t hear you denying it.” Malfoy edged close enough that she had to crane her head to look at him. His features resumed their usual mask of indifference, but his eyes were piercing her so intensely, it was as if he could see the dizzying thoughts now appearing in her mind. The room had suddenly become very, very warm. Hermione could feel the flush creeping up her cheeks yet she could not seem to tear her eyes away from him. She opened her mouth to reply but was interrupted by someone clearing their throat from behind her, the sound all too reminiscent of their old toad faced professor.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Hello Draco” Malfoy’s demeanour turned colder at the sultry tone but refused to break eye contact with Hermione, at least not until the witch cleared her throat again.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Parkinson” he replied in a clipped voice, giving the barest of nods in her direction. Pansy’s eyes briefly narrowed at the use of her formal name, before her infuriatingly smug expression returned as she gestured towards a tall, broad-shouldered man now making his way over to them. His cold brown eyes displaying very little excitement to be here until he clocked Malfoy, and grinned.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“This is Alexei-”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Malfoy!”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Levski!” Levski? Hermione studied the man as she tried to recall the name.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“It’s been a long time!” The man exclaimed loudly in a thick accent, Bulgarian if she was not mistaken. He clasped Malfoy’s outstretched hand vigorously. Pansy went quiet as she watched her ex and her date, who Hermione was pretty sure she only brought to try and cause jealousy over, start conversing animatedly, asking after their families as if old friends. Hermione couldn’t contain the twitch of her lips at Pansy’s gaping expression.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“You should come over and visit the team again!” Hermione internally groaned as the memory clicked into place. He was on the Bulgarian Quidditch team.. having to endure being around Pansy was bad enough let alone listening to them talk about Quidditch! She couldn’t think of anything worse.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Malfoy’s lips twisted into a delicious grin, “I agree, how is Miss Vassileva?”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><em> It got worse </em>.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Alexei rolled his eyes giving Malfoy an exasperated sigh, although his tone was seemed amused. “Two years on and she’s still talking about you. I didn’t know whether to shake your hand just now or hex you on the spot for it.” A joyous chuckle escaped Malfoy’s lips taking Hermione by surprise.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Hermione had no intention of listening to stories of Malfoy’s various love interests, especially when it elicited that response from him. Not that she cared, of course, she’d just rather not hear it that’s all.. at least she had some delight in the furious expression that flitted across Pansy’s face. Hermione subtly backed away a step and made to head over to Harry who was in a very animated conversation with a colleague, she tried to at least. She’d barely got one step away before Malfoy had clocked on and put a hand on her lower back, the sudden warmth on her bare skin shot through her like a current.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“This is Granger, she works with me in the Ministry.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Alexei’s eyes roamed over her. “<em>Hermione</em> Granger?” He asked, slightly taken aback. His smile widening, causing Hermione to fidget nervously. “I’ve heard much from Viktor, it’s a pleasure to finally meet you.” Well, that certainly gave Malfoy pause. “You still write to him?” Hermione stilled.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>
  <em> Oh god. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>The letters.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>It had been an eventful end to the summer. Every one of the Trio’s friends had got together for Neville and Harry’s joint birthday celebrations in Wizarding London. What had started off as a nice, quiet meal had turned into a night of heavy drinking and reckless behaviour, on Hermione’s part anyway. Halfway through the evening Dean and Seamus had spotted Viktor entering the bar they were currently drinking dry, and Harry was all too eager to pull up a chair for the Bulgarian. It wasn’t long until he’d found his way next to Hermione and reminiscing on the events on their fourth year. And my god had he blossomed since then! His features were more pronounced, muscles nearly twice the size since she’d last seen him, and his eyes captured hers with a mischievous glint. Hermione had found she was quite enjoying his closeness, leaning into him and shamelessly encouraging his advances. It had been well over a year since Hermione had found herself with male company. Not one to be tempted by a one night stand, she grew rather frustrated with the few failed dates she’d been on and found herself missing the intimacy. So when Viktor had offered her a nightcap in his hotel room after the rest of the party were too far gone, she decided it was time that she had a little fun. And she did. She even came back the following two days before he returned to Bulgaria. He still wasn’t the most loquacious man, so their time was mainly spent between the sheets, and in the shower, against the walls.. by the last day she was slightly relieved he was leaving, if only so her body could recover. A week later she received her first owl from him, and with their hectic work schedules, they realised that any chance of another meeting would be few and far between. So instead he resorted in sending her.. amorous.. letters. At first, she had scoffed at them and simply told him she wouldn’t be sending him naughty messages via owl post, but as time passed and each letter came, she grew more and more frustrated and gave in. Making sure her office door was locked and silenced when she received his replies.  </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Malfoy nudged her from her thoughts and Hermione met Alexei’s extended hand, expecting a strong shake but instead, he dipped his head and pressed a light kiss to her knuckles. She tried to ignore the blush that was surely creeping its way up her cheeks yet again, thankful he hadn’t said much more of the content of said letters. Perhaps he just thought they were penpals? Pansy’s eyes practically dripped with loathing over the intimate touch. The witch looked like she was about to break out in hives at any second.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“I confess I haven’t had the chance to reply to his last owl, I hope he is well? Especially after his most recent um.. injury.” A bludger to the groin to be exact, but she didn’t want to say in front of either Slytherin who were both watching her like hawks. Alexei chuckled at her attempted discretion.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Oh there’s no lasting damage, still works just fine” Wiggling his brows at her. “I’ll make sure to pass on your well wishes. Might encourage him to make a quicker recovery” he added with a wink. Well if that wasn’t the dreaded confirmation she needed.. her next letter to Viktor will not be one of sympathy!</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Hermione couldn’t stop the squeaky laugh that escaped her, clearing her throat she silently berated her nervous energy. <em> Pull yourself together woman! </em> “That’s.. that’s great news.” She flagged down a passing waiter and grabbed two champagne flutes from his tray, passing one to Malfoy who took it with a bemused look as she made quick work of her own.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Clearly not impressed with the conversation, Pansy cleared her throat again and directed her attention to Malfoy. “I ran into your mother yesterday, she was so desperate for a catch-up and is planning on meeting me for tea tomorrow afternoon. Of course, she wishes for you to join us Draco.” Fixing Hermione with a stare as she added: “Just like old times.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Funny, I saw her this morning and she gave no mention of it. I’m actually engaged tomorrow so she’ll have to make do without a chaperone.” Malfoy drawled, his eyes landing on Hermione’s near-empty glass. “If you’ll excuse us, we’re in need of another drink.” Not daring to look at Pansy, Hermione shyly waved goodbye to Alexei who still had his eyes fixed on her and waited whilst the two men shook hands again and promised to catch up later. Malfoy placed his hand on her lower back again and directed her through the crowd towards the bar at the far back of the room, even further away from Harry who was now eyeing her curiously. Malfoy grabbed Hermione another glass of Champagne, she accepted the drink with a chuckle as she looked back to find Pansy no longer hanging on the arm of the Bulgarian, sporting the most enormous pout she’d ever seen the girl wear. The lights in the room began to travel up to the main stage where Kingsley was tapping a glass as he prepared for the Minister’s annual speech. The hall quieted as everyone turned their attention towards the stage.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“I do believe you’ve severely pissed her off, I hope your mother won’t be too upset you won’t be there tomorrow.” She whispered.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Oh that certainly wasn’t my mother’s idea.” He replied in an equally hushed tone. At Hermione’s questioning glance he added “as much as she would like me to find a wife, she was rather relieved when I ended things with Pansy. You think she’s bad, you should meet her mother.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“The bitch doesn’t deserve you anyway.” The words were out of her mouth before she realised. With growing horror, Hermione watched as Draco stilled beside her, a beat of silence almost audible.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>
  <em> One </em>
</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>
  <em> Two   </em>
</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Straightening the cuffs of his dress robes, he took a step back and disappeared from her peripheral. Hermione’s shoulders slumped, startled by the coolness that now crept down her spine. Her reaction alone left her irritated. How could she have been so <em> stupid </em>? It was one thing to think of what things would be like with Malfoy but another to vocalise them. They’d just got to a point of seeing each other on a daily basis without any irritation, their interactions had become quite pleasant actually. Even daring a few flirtatiously teasing remarks. And now she had surely ruined everything.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Had she misjudged the signs? Anyone with eyes could tell just how much the Slytherin witch got under his skin. For years Hermione would watch her relentless pestering at school, the displays of affection and the way she clung to Draco around the castle and in the great hall were enough to put even Ron off his breakfast. And now she had to witness it within her place of work. Hermione to some surprise had had enough. But who was she, a muggle-born witch, allowing herself to fantasize about the possibility of Malfoy breaking centuries of archaic traditions. For <em> no </em> other reason than that she wants to see some change within the pureblood community, in regards to half-bloods and muggle-borns of course. She couldn't care less who Malfoy ended up with, as long as it wasn't <em> her, </em>and that she didn't have to be victim to their unwanted public displays of affection whilst trying to work. At least that’s what Hermione was now trying to tell herself.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>
  <em> No. This is not the time to be distracted by the never-ending conundrum that is Draco Malfoy. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Forcing herself to stand tall Hermione looked ahead, attempting to drown out the unwelcome thoughts clawing at her mind and focus on Kingsley’s speech, only to have a large hand settle on her hip, pulling her gently against a wall of solid muscle at her back. Startled from her thoughts Hermione froze as the familiar scented cologne invaded her senses. She clutched her drink tighter to mask the slight tremble in her hands.  </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“You’ve got to stop doing that.” Malfoy’s breath caressed her neck, his tone was calm as if his close proximity was nothing out of the ordinary. However, his grip on her tightened at his words. Hermione brought her flute to her lips, eyes scanning the room to see if anyone else noticed their interaction.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Doing what?” She whispered, failing to hide the slight tremble in her voice.  She took a large mouthful of champagne to steady her nerves, something Malfoy clearly delighted in as he leant in, lips quirked upwards against her neck. His breath on her skin left her pulse racing.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>
  <em> Holy shit. </em>
</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Saying things that make me want to kiss you”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Just as quickly as the drink entered her mouth it came flying out again, trickling down her chin and neck as she tried not to choke on the rest. Hermione spun around to find Malfoy retreat into the crowd, shoulders bobbing up and down in silent laughter. <em> Prick. </em></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“You alright there?” Hermione turned to see the barman hand her a napkin which she took gratefully, dabbing furiously at her chin and chest as if she could rub off the tingling sensation left in Malfoy’s wake. Hermione tried her best to brush off the incident with a giggle, hoping she didn’t look as mortified as she currently felt. Oh he will pay for this!</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Fine, thank you. Just went down the wrong way!” Casting a quick scourgify on the cloth and handing it back with a shy smile.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Might want to go steady on the Champagne” he chuckled giving her a wink before turning his attention back to Kingsley.  </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>***</p><p>The rest of the evening Hermione spent with Harry and Ginny, the former eyeing her curiously, and the latter grinning from ear to ear when she caught Hermione searching the room for any sign of Malfoy. After finishing their meal and Harry distracted by his co-workers who had come to say hello, Hermione downed her drink and rounded on the redhead who was not so subtly staring at her.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Something on your mind Gin?”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“No” She replied innocently, “but there’s <em> someone </em> on yours!” Hermione laughed at the statement, of course Ginny would notice. “Now I know why you were so bent out of shape about finding a decent dress, looks like it went down well though. You’re welcome by the way.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“I needed a nice dress simply because I didn’t own one suitable enough! And I <em> still </em> think it’s too much”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Oh please, I have just as much on show as you do! And don’t try and evade the subject, I need details!”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Hermione rolled her eyes. “Yes, but you have an amazing figure and can pull it off-” Ginny’s hand connected with the back of her head before Hermione had time to react, even when inebriated the girl had a good swing! “What the hell Ginny!?” She exclaimed, noticing the girl was no longer grinning and pinned her with a glare that could rival her mother.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Don’t <em> ever </em> let me hear you say that again. You are fucking beautiful, half the men in here couldn’t stop staring!” Hermione turned her gaze to the empty glass in her hand, knowing Ginny would not let her speak until she’s finished, she resigned herself to the lecture. “When you weren’t looking, Malfoy was eyeing you up like his favourite dessert which he couldn’t wait to devour.” She could feel her cheeks reddening, usually, she would have scoffed at the blatant lie but Hermione knew how perceptive her friend can be, and couldn’t help the warmth that made its way through her chest. “ <em> And </em>, his hands were all over you during the speech. Poor Harry nearly lost the blood supply in his arm as I tried to keep from screaming!” Hermione couldn’t help but smile at the memory of his hands on her hips, his lips leaving gentle caresses on her neck…</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>This time Ginny did scream. “You totally want to fuck Malfoy!”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“GIN!”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>The contents of Harry’s drink came spewing across the table as he whipped round at his girlfriend’s exclamation. Shit<em> . </em>The girl was practically bouncing with glee, not at all caring that others on the table could hear them. Thankfully the music in the venue was high enough to drown out their conversation to the rest of the hall. Hermione groaned as she leant forward, holding her head in her hands. She needed more alcohol to deal with the nosey witch.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Since when?” Harry croaked, causing Ginny to roll her eyes. “..Mione?”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“My guess? Since eighth year... <em> At least.” </em>Ginny smirked knowing she was right, but Hermione still tried to give Gin her best ‘shut the hell up’ expression but it seemed her friend was enjoying this far too much.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Eighth year?! Bullshit.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Hermione just sat there not knowing what to say. She was about to change the subject when she felt someone sit in the chair beside her and chuckle.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Haven't you ever wondered why Hermione personally delivers her files to our department instead of sending her assistant?” She looked to her side to see a rather steaming Theo grinning like a fool. She gritted her teeth and glared at him.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“I like to see Harry whenever I can, that's hardly suspicious behaviour Nott.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“So what about taking your lunch break in his office every Tuesday? The one day that's guaranteed for him to be there..” He had her there. Damn him.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“You’re really not a subtle as you think you are Hermione.” He slid his whiskey over to her, still grinning. She took a mouthful and surveyed her friends who were staring at her expectantly.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Fine! I will admit, he’s nice to look at..”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“All day every day.” Hermione rammed her elbow into Theo’s ribs and Ginny cackled triumphantly, leaning into Hermione.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“And I do believe the feeling is mutual!”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Hermione scoffed. “Sure he likes to flirt, but in case it's escaped your notice Gin, I’m not the only one!”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“So he doesn’t come to you after you’ve caught a girl eyeing him up? He doesn’t delight in seeing your reaction upon hearing stories of his romances? Doesn’t drag you into situations where you can’t escape a girl fawning over him like some lovesick puppy?”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Hermione took a second to let Theo’s words sink in. There <em> had </em> been numerous occasions where he seemed amused at her gawking or eye-rolling when women would stop by their offices or corner him in the canteen... And whatever that stunt with Pansy was. But surely Theo and Ginny were just exaggerating, this was Malfoy for Merlin’s sake. It’s not like she would fit in with his family!</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>She peeked at Harry who’s shocked expression was now replaced with a warm smile as he shook his head at her.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“I really do come by to see you though Harry..”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>He just brushed away her apologetic words and laughed.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“After everything you’ve gone through, you deserve someone who can keep up with you Mione” She couldn’t help but smile.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Honestly Harry, you really are oblivious!” Ginny mussed up his hair and he caught her hand before she made it even more unruly.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Well it’s a good job I have you to point things out to me, my little sneaky witch.” He nuzzled her neck leaving a trail of kisses which made Ginny giggle fiendishly.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Ugh, get a room” Theo laughed as he stood, pulling Hermione up with him. “Come on, let’s go make Malfoy <em> really </em> jealous.” She tried to pull away as he dragged her to the dance floor, shaking her head violently.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“I.. No- I can’t dance”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Need I remind you witch, that you owe me for earlier?” Hermione squealed as he pulled her close and practically carried her into the crowd of dancers. “Besides, we have to make this look believable... That’s twice you’ve refused me now, I’m doing my best not to be offended.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Hermione swatted his shoulder as he wrapped an arm around her waist, placing his left hand in her right. “Just follow me and for Merlin’s sake is it too much to ask that you look into me?”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>She couldn’t help but laugh as Theo started to move around the floor, Hermione trying her best to follow his lead. “I can’t tell whether you’re trying to play matchmaker or cause mischief, Mr Nott.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>He let in a sharp intake of breath, “Me?!” His eyes gleamed as he leant in too close, his mouth grazing her ear, “Would I do such a thing?” His hand travelled a little lower down her back and she pinched his shoulder hard.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“You are incorrigible and you know it!”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“I try my best.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>He dipped her low giving her a wink, making her blush furiously at the attention they were now receiving. She noticed Ginny and Harry laughing in their general direction. The music picked up in tempo and Theo began guiding her around the floor at a faster pace, randomly picking her up and twirling her when she least expected it, causing her to laugh uncontrollably. As the song drew to a close, she noticed a flash of white-blonde hair over Theo’s shoulder, his expression unreadable but his eyes were pinned on Hermione, his eyebrows raised. Her breath caught as he moved forward as if to cut in, but Theo kept a firm hold on her as the next song started and he swept her off again. She tried her best to keep track of where Malfoy had been, his jaw tightening a fraction before disappearing through the crowd, but she soon lost him completely. After dancing through two more songs, Hermione convinced Theo to get some more drinks and they headed over to the bar. As much as she had enjoyed using Malfoy’s tactics against him, she felt herself growing quite desperate to have his arms around her again.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Theo ordered her a glass of Prosecco and a couple of firewhiskeys for himself and Blaise who had spotted them and made his way over, a cocky grin plastered on his face, trailed by the two women who had approached him earlier. Hermione took a sip of her drink and surveyed the room, it didn’t take long to spot him but what she saw made her drink turn to ice in her throat. Malfoy had his arms around a slim woman with long blond hair. Her face was hidden in the crook of his neck as he held her tightly, Hermione gulped and felt the sparkling drink burn right down to the pit of her stomach. They could just be friends.. She stopped that thought as he dipped his head to whisper in her ear, the woman pulled back and planted a kiss to his cheek. Hermione’s breath caught in her throat as Malfoy looked around the room, his eyes fell on Theo and Blaise, and then looped his arm around the witch and swiftly left the ballroom.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Dread coiled in her stomach, he hadn’t even <em> looked </em> at Hermione and she was standing only a few feet away from his friends! Her vision became blurry, the hope that her friends had instilled was quickly torn from her, leaving nothing but a burning rage. He didn’t care, probably never had done. She suddenly felt very very stupid, standing here in this ridiculous dress and heels that she’d spent far more money on than she would normally, to impress and hopefully capture his eyes, and for what? <em> For nothing. </em></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>She didn’t know how long she stood there staring at the door which they had left, the minutes felt like hours and she couldn’t calm the raging in her chest. The boy’s conversation came to a halt and she turned to see them watching her expectantly, had they asked her something? She didn’t have the strength to talk, merely raising an eyebrow at them. Theo’s eyes lost their usual gleam as he studied her face.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“We were just saying that maybe we should find Malfoy and take the party elsewhere” Blaise winked at her but froze as her eyes blurred again. No no no, not here, not in front of them.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Hermione took in a deep breath to calm herself. “You’ll be wasting your time, he’s already gone.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Why would he leave already” Blaise looked baffled whereas Theo’s face had gone blank as if knowing what she was about to say.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“I’m guessing to entertain the woman he so hastily left with.” Hermione knew she sounded far too bitter, but she also found that she no longer cared to keep her feelings in. Downing the rest of her drink she slammed the glass back onto the bar,</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Who was it?” Theo asked tentatively.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Don’t know.. Don’t care. Just some tall slim blond..” Theo narrowed his eyes at Blaise as they shared a look that confirmed the dread she felt. She needed to leave. Now.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>She drew in a shaky breath and gave Theo a kiss on the cheek and Blaise a weak smile.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“I’ll see you tomorrow-”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>“Hermione wait-”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>Theo tried to grab her arm but she was already walking away. She collected her bag from her table, thankful that Ginny and Harry weren’t there, and made her way out of the hall, avoiding anyone she knew until she reached the big towering doors of the venue and jogged down the steps. The cold air assaulted her lungs and the emotions she had tried to keep at bay suddenly hit her like a battering ram. She clutched her purse to her chest and apparated home.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p>She probably shouldn't have done that, given how much she had drunk. The ground came out from underneath her as she fell to her knees on the cold wooden floor of her living room. She threw her bag on the sofa and screamed at the pain lacing its way up her legs. Hermione summoned her bottle of Ogden’s finest and leant her back against her sofa, finally letting the tears that threatened to spill, fall from her in heaving gulps.</p>
