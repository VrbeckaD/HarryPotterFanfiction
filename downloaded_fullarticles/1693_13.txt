    <p>Harry entered the Gryffindor common room - after the Halloween feast, after the choosing of the champions, after the meeting in the antechamber - to the cheers and congratulations from his housemates. Each repetition of "How'd you do it, mate?" caused his stomach to sink lower as he fought through the crowd in search of his friends. Just as Harry caught sight of Ron, yet another older Gryffindor stopped him to congratulate him on defeating Dumbledore's age line. Yet again, Harry started to deny entering himself in the tournament.</p><p>"Don't bother asking how," Ron spat at them, startling Harry with the venom in his voice. "He didn't even tell his <em>friends</em>."</p><p>Before Harry could properly respond, Ron whirled around and barreled past several people on his way to the boys' dorm, ignoring Harry's calls as he went. The room was suddenly subdued, its occupants uncomfortable with watching such a well-known, close friendship crumble before their eyes. Harry looked around with wild eyes until he spotted Hermione, and pushed his way through to her without giving anyone else an opportunity to interfere. He might have lost Ron - for now, hopefully temporarily - but if he couldn't get through to her and was left totally alone Harry didn't know what he'd do.</p><p>"Hermione," he pleaded, pulling her towards a quieter corner.</p><p>"Can you get out of it?" she asked without preamble.</p><p>Harry's face lit up briefly with hope. "You believe that I didn't do it?"</p><p>"Of course I do," Hermione said with no small amount of scorn, as if it was ridiculous that he'd ask. "I saw the look on your face when your name was called. Ron knows too, or he will when he takes a moment to think about it. He's just jealous."</p><p>"Well," Harry said with a sigh, "hopefully he thinks it through soon. Moody says this is probably a plot to kill me. As far as getting out of it - I need your help."</p><p>"Anything, Harry," Hermione responded, clasping a comforting hand on Harry's arm.</p><p>He took a deep breath, heartened by Hermione's unwavering support. "The judges've said that I have to compete, because the goblet creates a 'magically binding contract'. But no one has said what that even means. Will I <em>die</em> if I don't do it? Does it have loopholes, like a regular contract? Is it like the imperius curse, where the contract will force me to compete, and if it is can I resist it in the same way? I just don't know, Hermione."</p><p>"Harry," Hermione said, biting her lip, "Are you sure that you want to mess with this? It sounds risky."</p><p>"I just want to research it, for now," he assured her. "If Moody is right about someone wanting this tournament to kill me - and it's the only thing that makes sense - then staying in the tournament is risky too. I need to have all the information before I decide anything."</p><p>"Okay." Hermione took a steadying breath. "Okay. I can help you research magical contracts. We'll go to the library after classes tomorrow."</p><p>"<em>Thank you</em>, Hermione," Harry breathed. "I'm going to head up to bed. Maybe, Ron-"</p><p>"Give him a little space tonight," Hermione interrupted. She paused, then. "He'll come around, but- Well, it's worth it to be <em>your</em> friend, of course, but it isn't always easy to be <em>Harry Potter's </em>friend, you know?"</p><p>Harry sighed, silently cursing the Wizarding World's mania over the boy-who-lived. "Yeah, alright. I'll just get some sleep then. G'night, Hermione."</p><p> </p><p>"Here!" Hermione exclaimed softly, her voice colored with the excitement of an answered question. The suddenness of it startled Harry slightly. Hermione was on her fifth book about magical contracts, while Harry was just beginning his second. The girl really was a research machine, and Harry was so glad that she was there to help him. All they'd managed to learn so far was that a magical contract was driven by intent instead of language, which eliminated any loopholes they could take advantage of. Whoever had enchanted the goblet was long dead, so there was no way to know if their intent would allow an unwilling participant to remove themselves from the tournament. It seemed like Hermione had finally found something related to breaking a contract, though, so they could move forward.</p><p>Her face fell as she read further down the page. "It isn't good news," Hermione told Harry simply.</p><p>He just waited for her to continue. Of course there would be some consequence to deter people from breaking a magical contract. It was only a matter of what it was.</p><p>After a moment, Hermione read Harry the passage from the book. "A person judged to be breaking a magical contract is classified as an Oath-Breaker. I read that, already, which is how I started looking into what being an Oath-Breaker meant. The consequences for an Oath-Breaker are social, legal, and magical in nature. Oath-Breakers are typically considered untrustworthy, and are shunned in most circles of society or business. An Oath-Breaker may not hold Ministry offices or enter into future contracts or oaths. Healers have the right to refuse treatment to an Oath-Breaker. The most severe consequence for the Oath-Breaker, however, is the damage done to the magical core by the contract itself. The magical core of the Oath-Breaker is fractured, leaving them with only near-Squib levels of accessible magic. The exact amount of magic an Oath-Breaker is able to access varies by individuals, but accessing a fractured magical core is invariably painful. This damage is not reversible with any known method of Healing, nor will it heal naturally."</p><p>Harry just looked at Hermione, his mouth open slightly in shock. It hadn't sounded unbearable, until the last bit. The worst thing would have been being refused magical Healing, but if he found a Healer who wasn't bothered by the circumstances then even that would have been circumvented. Losing his <em>magic</em>, though-</p><p>"I'm sorry, Harry," Hermione said miserably. </p><p>"'S okay," he responded dully, before taking a few moments to review what she'd said in his mind and absorb the information. Unlike Hermione, Harry couldn't immediately comprehend textbook jargon. After a minute, he nodded. "Okay," he paused. "Okay. It's bad, but-"</p><p>"But?" Hermione shrieked, only to lower her voice to an urgent whisper at a sound <em>shush</em> from Madame Pince. "Harry, you <em>couldn't</em>," she begged him.</p><p> "I don't want to <em>die</em>, Hermione," Harry insisted quietly, eyeing the front desk where Pince was still watching them with a sharp gaze. Hermione didn't immediately respond, so he continued. "It isn't a good option, but it's still a better option than dying. I lived without magic for ten years before Hogwarts, and I'd hate to give it up but I think I'd be in a better place now than I was then."</p><p>Hermione made a small questioning noise, and Harry smiled.</p><p>"I've got friends now. You, and Ron once he comes around. Sirius. Even Professor Lupin. I wouldn't be alone. And I'd still have <em>some </em>magic, if there were an emergency. And surely not every Healer would refuse to treat me. Even as an Oath-Breaker I'd still be Harry Potter.</p><p>"I just don't like it, Harry," Hermione said with a sigh, and then hesitated. "But it is better than dying. Oh, I wish you weren't in this situation at all!"</p><p>Harry smiled ruefully at her. "Me too. But-" he sighed. "I'm not going to drop out of the tournament today. As bad as the consequences would be, it will have to be a last resort. But if it comes down to my life or my magic, it's not even a choice."</p><p>Hermione pulled him into a tight hug, and clung there for quite some time.</p><p> </p><p>Harry tried, over and over, to talk to Ron and explain the situation with the tournament to him. Each time Harry approached him, he walked away. He even abandoned a meal partially eaten when Harry tried to talk to him, something nearly unheard of for Ron. If he couldn't leave the area, he staunchly ignored Harry's existence until Harry gave up. It was frustrating, bordering on infuriating, but Harry wasn't willing to give up on his first friend just yet.</p><p>Ron very clearly regretted his outburst of jealousy on Halloween. Hermione had told Harry that, and Harry could see it if he looked carefully. Now, it was just his stupid, stubborn pride keeping him from apologizing. </p><p>Hermione was awkwardly pulled between the two. At first Harry was relieved that Ron wasn't angry with her for continuing to talk to him. Now, he felt guilty that she was caught in the middle. Hermione insisted that it wasn't his fault - he was trying to repair the rift, and Ron was the one perpetuating this argument. Once, Harry had suggested it would be easier for her if she distanced herself from him. She'd just <em>looked </em>at him, expressionless, until he got so uncomfortable that he apologized for voicing the thought. For better or for worse, she wasn't going to abandon either of her friends and leave them alone. Instead, she developed a schedule of when each one would have the opportunity to see her.</p><p> </p><p>A week before the first task was supposed to take place, Hagrid took Harry under his invisibility cloak to show him the <em>guests </em>in the Forbidden Forest. The next day, Harry carefully placed a book on various dragon species in front of Hermione, four bookmarks identifying the species in the woods. "I can't do it, Hermione."</p><p>It took Hermione a moment to process what he meant, to go back to their conversation in the library. In a small voice she asked, "A-are you sure?"</p><p>"Yeah," Harry breathed. "I don't know any of the spells that this book suggests to subdue a dragon, and I don't have the time to learn them reliably. There's no way I can walk in to meet a dragon unprepared - Hermione, I'm fourteen and this tournament was designed for adults."</p><p>She nodded, apparently debating with herself for a moment, then flung herself at Harry and wrapped him in a hug. "You shouldn't have to make this choice," she whispered after a few moments.</p><p>Harry hugged her back tightly. "I shouldn't have had to save the stone or kill a basilisk, either," he mumbled. "When has that ever stopped anything?"</p><p> </p><p>Harry sat in a tent with the three champions - no longer 'the other three', but no one knew that yet besides himself and Hermione. Harry had told Cedric Diggory about the dragons as quickly as he'd been able to. Maxime and Karkaroff were both there the night Hagrid had shown them to him, and Harry had stopped expecting adults to behave fairly before he'd begun Hogwarts. Cedric didn't deserve to be the only champion left unaware, and Harry really hoped that Hogwarts would win this thing. </p><p>He'd spent every day since making the decision to drop out casting spells, knowing he'd miss it dearly. He hadn't written a single essay all week, and Hermione hadn't even tried to make him. He wouldn't be able to attend Hogwarts after this, so his grades were no longer important. Late last night, he'd cast his patronus charm one final time and said a painful goodbye to Prongs. </p><p>Bagman and Crouch came in to kick off the task, and each of the champions drew a model dragon from a bag to determine the species they would face. Unaware of his plans, they'd saved Harry for last. He was horrified to realize that he would have been facing the Hungarian Horntail, objectively the most fearsome of the lot. Able to shoot fire for fifty feet hot enough to burn a person to a crisp in seconds, not safe from behind either because of the spiked tail, and <em>incredibly</em> aggressive. They held the bag out to him, and Harry just shook his head.</p><p>"You have to compete, Potter," Crouch said testily. "We discussed this already."</p><p>"Now, Barty," Bagman cheerfully reprimanded him. "I'm sure it's just a spot of nerves, give the boy a moment."</p><p>Rather than address either of them directly, Harry drew his wand and placed the tip against his chest, just like the book on magical contracts had described. Crouch stiffened, immediately aware of what Harry was doing.</p><p>"I, Harry James Potter," he began. Bagman realized what was happening and reached out as if to stop him, but Crouch grabbed the man's arm. They couldn't interfere, Harry knew. "In full awareness of the magical and legal consequences, choose to exit this magical contract and live forever as an Oath-Breaker." He took a deep breath. No going back, now. "As I will it, so be it done."</p><p>There was a cracking inside him, as though he'd broken a bone but so much deeper, and Harry knew that it had worked. His core was fractured, and he was free from the magical contract. He was an Oath-Breaker.</p>
