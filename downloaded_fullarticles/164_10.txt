    <p>     Draco wanted to fling himself off the owlry. Stupid Potter and his stupid face and his stupid curls and his stupid glowing skin. He could only imagine the way his hands would look in contrast to the saviors dark chest. </p><p>     It was maddening, honestly. </p><p>     He watched dazed, taking in the git’s stupidly fit body as he walked around the courtyard in his stupidly well fitting muggle clothes. Draco thanked every God he could name for white t-shirts. </p><p>     The fabric was thin enough, that if the right amount of light illuminated his torso, Draco could almost see right through it and good lord, he needed to focus.</p><p>     It wasn’t his fault that the three foot essay on the history of potions wasn’t as appealing.</p><p>     “Sickle for your thoughts?” </p><p>     Draco snapped his head towards a smug looking Pansy. The slight lift of the corners of her mouth were enough to know exactly what she was thinking and Draco would hear none of it.</p><p>     “How about a Galleon for you to mind your damn business.” She laughed obnoxiously loud and clapped Draco on the shoulder. </p><p>     “I didn’t know you drank your coffee without cream, Draco, I’m enlightened.” He narrowed his eyes at her accusingly.</p><p>     “Shut up, you slag. Let me admire from afar without judgement.” </p><p>     She gave him a knowing smile and lifted her hands in defense. They sat in silence for a while, Pansy letting him admire without judgement. It wasn’t like she wasn’t gazing at the frizzy haired book freak anyways. </p><p>     They both watched until Potter himself felt the gaze and stared back. </p><p>      Draco’s cheeks heated and he immediately redirected his eyes to something far more interesting, like the floor. </p><p>      Potter, under no circumstances, was to know how attractive Draco thought he was. If after everything, the war, the guilt, the sadness, of after all of that, Draco had one thing left, he was going to keep it. The pretty hatred the two shared was the only constant in his life and he intended make it remain as such.</p><p>     His name meant nothing anymore, people looked at him like he was dirt, his father was dead. Draco had absolutely nothing. Except for that. Bad as it may be, he had it and it was his own. That feeling of adrenaline when they bickered. That was real and it made him feel something other than the numbness Voldemort had crucioed into him the year before.</p><p>     “You know what I think?” Pansy gathered the lose pieces of parchment that she abandoned during her stare and stuffed them into her bag.</p><p>     “I think you want Potter to suffocate you with his lips, but you’re just too hufflepuff to admit it.”</p><p>     Draco spluttered and put a hand over his mouth. The girl had no shame. None.</p><p>     “Will you fuck off and not shout my deep dark secrets to the entire courtyard!” Now. Draco knew Pansy Parkinson very well, like the back if his dead pale hand, and he knew it as soon as the words left his mouth that they were a mistake. But she wouldn’t dare. </p><p>     They stared at each other for a moment. The eyebrow said it all.</p><p>     “You wouldn’t.” She smiled sweetly.</p><p>     Draco was already up and running away as Pansy lifted herself up onto the ledge of the water fountain while gaining everyones attention.</p><p>     “Pansy Parkinson I will murder y-“</p><p>     “Draco Malfoy drinks his coffee without cream and wants Harry Potter to blow his back out!”</p><p>     The bitch.</p>
